Mobile telephones have likewise become a normal part of Australian life. In all areas of telecommunications, technology has become more advanced and more sophisticated.</para><para>The telecommunications environment has changed, and the <inline ref="R2131">Crimes Legislation Amendment (Telecommunications Offences and Other Measures) Bill (No. 2) 2004</inline> will ensure that Commonwealth criminal offences remain effective in this changed environment.</para><para>This bill replaces a bill of a similar name which was introduced into the Senate on 24 June 2004, except that the suicide related material offences have been included in a separate bill.</para><para>This bill continues the Australian government's proactive approach to updating criminal laws in light of rapid technological change. For example, the government developed the Cybercrime Act 2001 to provide a solid platform of criminal offences to assist Australia meet the challenges posed by computer hackers and `denial of service' attacks. Importantly, the cybercrime offences are cast in technologically neutral terms. The same approach is adopted in many of these new and updated telecommunications offences.</para><para>The existing telecommunications offences in part VIIB of the Crimes Act 1914 were enacted in 1989. This bill will repeal existing outdated telecommunications offences and insert a package of revised and new telecommunications offences into the Criminal Code. Moving these offences from the Crimes Act to the Criminal Code continues the process of relocating all serious Commonwealth offences into the Criminal Code.</para><para>Among the offences included in the bill are a range of important new measures dealing with the use of the Internet to facilitate or exploit the sexual abuse of children.</para><para>The bill contains new offences dealing with use of the Internet to access, transmit and make available child pornography and child abuse material, as well as the possession or production of such material with intent to place it on the Internet. These offences complement existing offences prohibiting the importation of such material into Australia and will carry a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment.</para><para>Law enforcement agencies estimate that around 85 per cent of child pornography seized in Australia is distributed via the Internet. In September last year, German police cracked a global child pornography network involving over 26,000 Internet users. By focusing on the Internet, these new federal offences target the very heart of the abhorrent child pornography industry.</para><para>The new offences will also prohibit the use of a telecommunications service, including by means of the Internet, to procure or `groom' a person who is under 16 years of age for the purpose of engaging in sexual activity with that person or so that a third person can engage in sexual activity with that person. These offences carry penalties of 12 to 15 years imprisonment. </para><para>These new offences target adult offenders who exploit the anonymity of telecommunications services (for example, a `chat room' on the Internet) to win the trust of a child as a first step towards the future sexual abuse of that child. This abhorrent practice is known as `online grooming'.</para><para>The new `procurement' offences will also target situations where an offender, having won a child's trust, then uses a telecommunications service to orchestrate a meeting with the child so as to engage in sexual activity.</para><para>These new offences would provide a firm legal basis for proactive AFP policing of this disturbing practice. The underlying rationale for the new offences is to allow law enforcement to intervene before a child is actually abused. A typical investigation may involve an AFP officer or an investigator at the Australian High Tech Crime Centre assuming the identity of a fictitious child, interacting with potential predatory adults over the Internet and arresting a predatory adult before they have an opportunity to sexually abuse a real child that they are also `grooming'. A Queensland prosecution has been successful on this basis.</para><para>The parliament can take an important leadership role in this area. New federal offences will provide a springboard to a national approach to this issue.</para><para>Tough offences targeting sexual predators in this way align with the government's commitment to a nationally consistent child sex offender registration system and the CrimTrac Agency's work in this area.</para><para>The telecommunications offences package also contains new and updated offences dealing with interference with telecommunications and use of telecommunications to engage in inappropriate behaviour. Among these measures are:</para><para>	new offences dealing with the `rebirthing' of stolen mobile phones and the copying of mobile phone SIM cards;</para><para>	an updated version of the existing offence dealing with use of a telecommunications service to menace, harass or cause offence that is extended to cover Internet content that causes offence;</para><para>	new offences dealing with the use of a telecommunications service to make threats or hoaxes; and</para><para>	new offences dealing with improper use of emergency service numbers, including triple zero.</para><para>In addition to the telecommunications offences, this bill also introduces other significant offences, targeting credit card skimming and contamination of goods.</para><para>The personal financial information offences introduced into the Criminal Code by this bill are a key component of the Australian government's national strategy to crack down on credit card skimming and Internet banking fraud. Credit card skimming is the process by which legitimate credit and debit card data is illicitly captured or copied, frequently by means of an electronic skimming device.</para><para>These amendments will criminalise dishonestly obtaining or dealing with personal financial information without the consent of the person to whom the information relates. These amendments will also criminalise possession or importation of a device with the intention that the device be used to commit a personal financial information offence.</para><para>Internet banking fraud, including `phishing'—where online criminals use apparently legitimate emails to trick people into divulging banking details—will also be covered by the bill. Any person who uses a deception to obtain another person's financial information will be guilty of an offence. </para><para>The proposed laws will ensure that Australians can feel more confident about electronic, telephone and Internet banking, knowing that penalties of up to five years imprisonment apply to those who capture or misuse their confidential financial details.</para><para>Comprehensive new contamination of goods offences are also included in this bill. These offences—to be inserted into the Criminal Code—will apply to a person who contaminates goods intending to cause economic loss, public alarm or anxiety, and, in some cases, harm to public health.</para><para>These offences also extend to persons who threaten to contaminate goods or falsely claim to have contaminated goods. This recognises that the level of economic loss or public anxiety or alarm can be the same regardless of whether the contamination is real, threatened or fictitious. It also reflects that in each case the offender's intention is to cause economic loss, public alarm or anxiety.</para><para>The offences will overlap and complement existing state and territory offences. Importantly, the federal contamination offences will have some extraterritorial reach. For example, a threat to contaminate Australian goods which is made from outside Australia would be covered.</para><para>Finally, this bill will also make a number of amendments to a range of other criminal law and justice acts. These include simplifying some procedures under the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987 and amending the Crimes (Aviation) Act 1991 to outlaw child prostitution on board Australian registered aircraft outside Australia, ensuring that the application of Australia's criminal laws on board aircraft complies with the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children. It also includes amending chapter 2 of the Criminal Code and amending the Customs Act 1901 to make clear the elements of the serious drug offences in that act.</para><para>I believe that this bill represents a significant advance in upgrading the criminal law to ensure it meets the challenges posed by new technology and the opportunities which it provides to criminals. I commend the bill to the House and I present the explanatory memorandum.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Rudd</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT (SUICIDE RELATED MATERIAL OFFENCES) BILL 2004</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>32037</page.no><id.no>R2132</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>32037</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Slipper</inline>, and read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>32037</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>32037</page.no><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SLIPPER</name><name.id>0V5</name.id><electorate>Fisher</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>The <inline ref="R2132">Criminal Code Amendment (Suicide Related Material Offences) Bill 2004</inline> introduces important new measures that will criminalise use of the Internet where the intention of that use is to counsel or incite suicide, or promote or provide instruction on a particular method of committing suicide.</para><para>The offences will cover use of a carriage service, including the Internet, to access, transmit or make available material that counsels or incites suicide, or promotes or provides instruction on a particular method of committing suicide. The possession, production or supply of such material with intent to make it available on the Internet will also be covered.</para><para>Currently there are a range of easily accessible Internet sites and Internet chat rooms that provide explicit instructions on methods of committing suicide and, in the case of Internet chat rooms, sometimes contain actual discussions where one person or even a group of persons urge another to commit suicide. Studies have shown that in some cases such Internet chat room discussions have led to a person attempting suicide, sometimes successfully. </para><para>The proposed offences reflect the harm that can be done by those who use the Internet with destructive intent and they will assist in preventing the use of the Internet in this way to encourage vulnerable individuals to take their own lives.</para><para>Advocacy of, or debate about, law reform on voluntary euthanasia or suicide related issues that takes place on the Internet will in no way be affected by the proposed offences, because these types of communications would not carry the requisite intention. For the same reason, the offences are unlikely to capture material such as research papers dealing with suicide related issues or suicide prevention, or support material.</para><para>These offences are intended to complement existing Customs regulations prohibiting the physical importation and exportation of suicide kits and information related to those kits. They will carry the same maximum penalty as the Customs offences of $110,000 for an individual.</para><para>The offences will also complement the proposed new telecommunications offences in the <inline ref="R2131">Crimes Legislation Amendment (Telecommunications Offences and Other Measures) Bill (No. 2) 2004</inline>, the telecommunications offences bill (No. 2).

Individuals, groups and states have committed, sponsored and supported terrorist acts for millennia. Terrorism, for the most part, stemmed from particular ethnic, sectarian and civil conflicts. Its consequences, although terrible, were largely confined to surrounding populations. As a global strategic phenomenon and shaper of international affairs, terrorism, until recently, did not loom large. The terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 in New York and Washington DC underlined the emergence of a new type of terrorist threat. Al-Qaeda and their associated groups pose unprecedented challenges to Western and other countries. Their broad reach and loose network structure help them resist frontal assaults: it is the very definition of `asymmetric warfare'. Their skilled use of communications and information technology, their ability to tap into financial networks and other ideological networks and their willingness to employ weapons of mass destruction, if they gain access to them, give terrorist organisations global potency. The radical and undifferentiated nature of their demands puts them beyond the reach of negotiation and deterrence. </para></talk.start><para>Here in our own region, regional terrorist networks with strong links to al-Qaeda and other extremist Islamic groups represent a significant and growing threat to the region's security. This underscores the necessity of governments around the region taking strong action in support of effective border control measures and a range of other antiterrorism measures. Here in our own region, al-Qaeda and its associated terrorist organisations—Jemaah Islamiah and others—continue to represent a significant threat to Australian security interests across South-East Asia and within Australia itself. This organisation has not been eliminated; it continues. Based on reports by those who examine these organisations at a professional and academic level, these organisations continue to find grounds for recruitment and the continuation of their terrorist planning and contingency operations in the region.</para><para>The application of biometrics in passports has been around for a good number of years. It is noteworthy that this is not an isolated development but a truly global movement towards the development of advanced systems. In May 2003 the International Civil Aviation Organisation, ICAO, adopted a global harmonised blueprint for the integration of biometric identification to passports and other machine-readable travel documents. As far back as May 2003, ICAO determined that facial recognition rated highest in terms of compatibility with key operational considerations. Further, by February this year ICAO had adopted facial recognition as the global standard for biometric identifiers in passports.</para><para>While the United States has been leading the push for the global development and use of biometric passports, revising to October next year its original deadline of October 2004 for visa waiver program countries to adopt machine-readable passports with biometric identifiers, it is worth also briefly noting that at least 10 countries in addition to the US and Australia are looking at biometric identifiers for passports and travel documents.</para><para>The United Kingdom Passport Service conducted a six-month trial of biometric identifiers from January to June 2004 involving 10,000 people who volunteered to have their facial, iris and fingerprint identifiers `enrolled'—I believe that is the technical term for it. In December 2003 the Home Office stated that the UK Passport Service was planning to begin issuing passports containing a facial biometric in mid 2005 and will give consideration to including a secondary biometric—iris or fingerprint—in later versions. In a statement on 28 July 2004 welcoming the extension by the US of the 26 October 2004 deadline, the United Kingdom government stated that work is underway to implement a facial biometric in British passports from late 2005 or early 2006.</para><para>In May 2004, Belgium announced its intention to begin issuing biometric passports in 2005, with a pilot to start shortly. The passports will contain a facial biometric initially. In February 2004, Denmark announced its intention to issue to its citizens biometric passports including a facial identifier. It intends to issue the new passports in late 2004. In February 2004 the European Commission adopted a proposal for the inclusion of a facial biometric in EU passports. The EC's proposal was to go before the European Union and the European Parliament for consideration. In February 2004, Germany initiated a six-month trial of a biometric border control system based on iris scanning. In February 2004, Ireland announced that it was considering the introduction of biometric passports. In December 2003, Italy presented a prototype of its biometric passport, which contains three identifiers: a facial image and two fingerprints. </para><para>Here in our own region, in November 2002 the government in Tokyo announced it was commencing a trial of biometric technologies to facilitate check-in at Japanese airports. In January 2004, the Netherlands announced it would be conducting a six-month trial of a biometric passport containing facial and fingerprint scans. In our own region again—very close to home—in December 2003 the government of New Zealand was described as `moving at full steam' to implement microchip based biometric passports that can store a digitised version of a person's passport photo. The general manager of the identity services division of New Zealand's Department of Internal Affairs was reported as saying that the division is already developing the necessary systems and processes for implementation. Finally, in April 2003 it was reported that the French government was looking at using biometrics to improve border control by fingerprinting all applicants for tourist visas.</para><para>The purpose of rendering that long and detailed list of what is happening around the world—in particular in Europe but also here in our own region—is to indicate that an increasing number of governments are moving in the direction of the proposals outlined in the legislation before the House. This set of measures, aimed at tightening passport identification around the world, is a direct and credible response to the mounting threat of global and regional terrorism. There will be concerns, of course, about the ultimate impact of some of these measures in certain quarters, as far as civil liberties are concerned, and I will come to that later in my response to the legislation. But on balance, by the sheer depth and breadth of the global response to the terrorist problem and other associated law enforcement measures, it can be seen that what is being proposed in this country is not unique and reflects a challenge facing us all.</para><para>The <inline ref="R2116">Australian Passports Bill 2004</inline> will repeal Australian passports provisions of the 1938 act. I note briefly in passing that the <inline ref="R2113">Australian Passports (Transitionals and Consequentials) Bill 2004</inline> makes the necessary amendments to repeal provisions of the 1938 act that have been superseded and to rename that act the Foreign Passports (Law Enforcement and Security) Act 2004. Labor have been supportive from the outset of strengthening the technology aspects of the Australian passport system. We have been supportive of the government exploring the possibility of biometric measures for Australian passports and Australian passport holders. We have indicated our support on many occasions.</para><para>It has taken the government at the very least two years since first flagging the move to adopt biometric identifiers and subsequent changes to the Passports Act. While we welcome the move to tighten security around one of the most crucial personal identifiers, we remain critical of the government dragging its feet over efforts to protect the Australian people at a more general level. Of course, this should not come as a surprise even to the casual observer of many aspects of what the government has been engaged in. The government constantly talks about the threat of terrorism, but, if we look at a range of practical measures which have been adopted by the government in the intelligence and security fields, often there is a yawning gap between the government's rhetoric and the reality which is delivered on the ground.</para><para>We recall, of course, the affair of Willie Brigitte and his having been issued with a tourism visa 18 months after September 11 and six months after Bali—not under a false identity, not under a false name or a false passport but under his own name and under his own identity. This is the same Willie Brigitte who is alleged to be responsible for seeking to develop a terrorist cell here in Australia. From the public record we know that Brigitte had been followed by French intelligence since 1999 as a potential terrorist. The controller-general of France's coordinating unit for counter-terrorism had confirmed that Brigitte had been entered on France's national terrorism database, yet despite this the government issued Brigitte, travelling on his own passport and in his own name, a tourism visa to visit Australia, thereby allowing Brigitte to operate freely in this country between May and September of last year. Furthermore, we know that, regrettably, Brigitte was reissued with a French passport while he was here in this country. </para><para>Brigitte is not an isolated incident: the government allowed Abdul Rahim Ayub to leave Australia. To refresh this place's memory of who this individual is, he is alleged by Jack Roche to have been the national leader of JI in Australia. He fled Australia to Indonesia in early October 2002, leaving his family behind. On 30 October ASIO raided his house, and in December 2002 Abdul's family returned to Indonesia with the assistance of the Indonesian consulate, which did not inform Australian authorities of their departure. While the failure to detain, question and prosecute Abdul Rahim Ayub was a significant law enforcement failure, it was also a failure of the government's border protection efforts.</para><para>To not limit our critique to these two matters—those of Brigitte and Abdul Rahim Ayub—it is important also to look at how the government has gone about accounting for a good number of passports across the country which have been sent to various individuals subsequent to application. We know through questions on notice that, when it first came to office, this government introduced a revision to the passports delivery process. To quote the Minister for Foreign Affairs on 10 August 1999—almost five years ago to the day:</para><quote><para>Passports Australia ceased sending mailed passports by receipted mail on 31 December 1997 in order to reduce expenditure and to provide a more convenient delivery system to its clients.</para></quote><para>We know from that same question:</para><quote><para>1,343 passports have been reported as missing in the mail in the 18 months since the new system was introduced. 355 of these have been recovered and returned for normal use. The remainder are still missing and have been replaced.</para></quote><para>I repeat: 988 are still missing—have not been recovered—and who knows where they are. That was in response to the minister proudly owning an initiative which was designed `to reduce expenditure and to provide a more convenient delivery system to its clients'.</para><para>When it comes to questions of national security, particularly as it relates to security of passports, which is the subject of this legislation before the House, I would have thought that that was one of the most foolhardy measures ever initiated by the government, the minister and the department. The consequences are there for us to see, and the figures I cite are those which the minister himself has delivered to the parliament through an answer to questions on notice. It does not take a large number of people using travel documents to bring about a terrorist event—it does not take a large number of people to plan a terrorist event; it does not take a large number of people to execute a terrorist event, as the horrific events in Bali have demonstrated. It is an extraordinary indictment of wrong priorities in an age of terrorism that this could have occurred, whereby we still today have 988 missing Australian passports, in large part a consequence of a system which was introduced by the government to save money. </para><para>If we fast forward to today, the government—in a decision that appears to recognise that having 1,000 passports unaccounted for is not in the national interest—has, thankfully, reversed the ludicrous decision to post passports through the unregistered mail. On 22 July 2002, registered mail for passports was reintroduced. That was virtually nine months after September 11, and the consequences in terms of the number of passports that have gone missing are quite acute. While a reduction in the overall number of lost passports has occurred, the number of passports reported missing in the mail during 2002-03 still totalled 700. While 252 of those were subsequently recovered, 171—an astounding 38 per cent of the lost total—remained unaccounted for in 2002-03.</para><para>There are, therefore, continued significant problems when it comes to how we best secure the sending out of passports to those who apply for them. The government has corrected the method by which it mails passports out, although belatedly, but plainly there is still a problem. Ensuring that passports simply do not go missing at the point at which they are dispatched to applicants should be a leading priority for the minister and the department. The total number of passports lost in the year 2002-03—that is, in the year following Bali—was 171, and that is a matter of grave concern to us all. The ongoing security risk associated with those lost or missing passports is something for which the government is directly responsible. It is a core matter of public administration.</para><para>We understand that there will always be limitations on what government can do. You cannot have a 100 per cent fail-safe system, but I do question, in this age of terrorism, whether we cannot do better in terms of the number of passports which simply go missing in the mail. Short-term cost-cutting measures such as that introduced when the government first came into office are unrealistic when we are dealing with a matter of such profound importance as the potential misuse of passports by terrorists and others concerned with creating mischief and committing illegal acts.</para><para>As far as the changes to the law governing Australian travel documents are concerned, we are satisfied that many of the changes involve clarification and restructuring of the language, with minimal substantive change. There are some key substantive changes, however, that should be noted. These involve (1) allowing the minister to adopt particular methods or technologies for identification or other purposes under the bill, (2) changes to the grounds and processes for refusal and cancellation of passports, (3) the addition of new offences and substantially increased penalties and (4) new measures concerning the use of information and the privacy procedures surrounding that.</para><para>Several new elements of Australian passports law and policy will be introduced with the Australian Passports Bill. In summary, these include for the first time a clear statement of the entitlement of Australian citizens to a passport, and that is something which we welcome. Further, penalties for passport fraud will be increased—to 10 years imprisonment or $110,000; a framework for the use of technology will be introduced; and the exceptions to the requirement for either both parents' consent or a court order for a child to travel internationally will make clear that disputes between parents should be dealt with by the courts. Other new elements will be: improvements to the mechanism for the refusal or cancellation of a passport on law enforcement grounds or if a person is likely to engage in harmful contact; measures to minimise the problems caused by lost and stolen passports; and privacy related measures, including a transparent mechanism for obtaining information to verify identity and citizenship and to regulate the disclosure of passport information for other limited purposes. </para><para>We in the opposition, as the alternative government of Australia, support these initiatives. They are in the main sensible and long overdue, updating as they do the important provisions of the Australian passport system. In particular, we support the strengthening of penalties for offences against the Passports Act. Part 4, division 2 outlines the offences and penalties under each of a number of categories: producing false or misleading documents in relation to Australian documents; improper use or possession of an Australian travel document; selling an Australian travel document; and a range of other provisions. Regrettably, these increased penalties reflect the new circumstances in which we live and the central importance of preserving the integrity of the passport system. These offences will also apply with extraterritorial jurisdiction—that is, relevant conduct that occurs abroad may be liable to criminal prosecution in Australia.</para><para>The bill also introduces penalties for officers issuing a passport contrary to the act and for officers issuing travel related documents contrary to the act or the minister's determination, as well as for any abuse of public office. For each of these offences, the Australian Passports Bill 2004 has introduced a penalty of 10 years imprisonment or $110,000 or both. This will bring the penalties for offences under the Passports Act into line with offences in related legislation, such as the Criminal Code, section 73—people smuggling and related offences—and the Migration Act 1958, section 234. Both these acts provide for penalties of 10 years imprisonment or fines of 1,000 penalty units—$110,000—or both.</para><para>We also welcome the clarification of the reasons the minister may refuse to issue an Australian passport. Under the 1938 act, the minister or an authorised officer may issue a passport to Australian citizens. The minister must not refuse to issue a passport unless a ground for refusal applies. This would remain the case under this bill, although the language would be changed so as to emphasise Australian citizens' entitlement to passports unless a good ground for refusal applies. Division 2 of the bill outlines the reasons under which the minister may refuse to issue an Australian passport. It breaks the reasons for refusal into two groupings: subdivision A focuses on the issuing of passports to children and subdivision B focuses on law enforcement and security.</para><para>Briefly, but importantly, we support the government's proposal to update the welfare and family crisis provisions of the 1938 act. The exception in clause 11(2)(d) will complement the requirement contained in the Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction that a child who has been wrongfully removed for a period of less than 12 months should be returned without delay. The exception in the new act will not, however, require the commencement of proceedings or the existence of court orders relating to the custody of a child.</para><para>We also support the principal change in new subsection 11(3), which will ensure that, if parents or a child disagree about the child travelling internationally, the dispute will be dealt with by the courts and not under the passports law. Current arrangements for the resolution of disputes are revised because they are inadequate. Approximately 25 cases annually involve applicants seeking to resolve—through the administrative review process, under the 1938 act, rather than through the courts—disputes with the child's other parent about whether their child should travel internationally. This places an onus—and probably an unacceptable onus—on departmental officers to make decisions outside of the purview of the family law system. If the matter proceeds to the AAT, DFAT becomes the respondent rather than the parent who has refused or who is not represented. A new paragraph, 48(b), will ensure that decisions to refuse to issue an Australian travel document are not reviewable under the act's review regime. </para><para>I simply say to the government, however, that, given the sensitivity which these new provisions will involve, as far as families who will be affected by them are concerned, it is important that the department keep under close and serious review the operational implications which these provisions have after a 12-month period of being in effect. The intention which underpins these changes strikes the opposition as being correct and well balanced. However, from experience, we will be able to assess, hopefully, how effective the provisions have been in dealing with the real life consular circumstances which present themselves in terms of Australian families who find themselves involved in cases of disputed arrangements for the travel of a child.</para><para>In relation to biometrics, importantly, the passports bill includes for the first time an explicit reference to the application of different technologies in support of the integrity of the Australian passport. Such technology applications would include facial biometrics. Some concern has been expressed as to the personal invasiveness of that technology during the application process. In discussions with the department, we have been advised that the application process involves, in its current form, the current procedure of providing a photograph from which the relevant data is then obtained. Nonetheless, clause 47 of the bill would allow the minister to authorise through a determination that a particular method or technology may be used for the purpose of confirming the identity of an applicant or travel document holder, or for any other functions under the bill. The clause would allow any methods or technologies to be used which confirm the `validity of evidence of the identity' of applicants or travel document holders. Such technology includes facial biometrics—measurements of a person's face that can allow identification of that person by a computer.</para><para>Given the breadth of the language, we on this side of the House have some concerns that in its current form it could also include broader applications, including future fingerprinting or use of genetic information. It is not surprising that the issue of the use of private information arising from the application of new technologies therefore remains a contentious one. We are not prima facie opposed to new technologies being applied; we simply at this stage, however, register the legitimate concerns that some in the community have about the ultimate impact of some of these potential technologies on civil liberties in this country.</para><para>This is particularly so given the interaction of clause 47, `The Minister may authorise use of particular methods and technologies', and clause 42, `Disclosure of personal information for the purposes of this Act.' The bill may be broad enough to allow the creation of a large database of biometric or other personal information for uses beyond the immediate scope of the Passports Act. In its current form, the bill provides no rules governing how such information is to be collected, stored, protected or used. The minister's determination would decide the bulk of these under paragraph 2 of clause 47 and clause 46. The Privacy Act 1988 would also impose some limitations. In its current form, therefore, this clause would give the minister a very broad power indeed to make rules for the collection of information, including the adoption of controversial biometric technology, both in its current and prospective forms. </para><para>While the ministerial determination is a disallowable instrument, allowing for some level of parliamentary scrutiny, the broad ranging powers that could be invoked by the minister under this clause have led to the view that we should seek an amendment to it. These matters have been discussed with the minister's office and the department. While we appreciate that, in the absence of a particular provision for the management of information collected, the information would be governed by the information privacy principles of the Privacy Act, we believe that more can, and should, be done.</para><para>Given that the goal is to use biometric information, for example, to maintain the integrity of the passport/travel document system, we are seeking an amendment to impose specific limitations on the scope of ministerial discretion in relation to the use of such technology and/or methods of collection, storage and dissemination that could be provided under clause 47. The opposition would therefore support inserting defining language to reflect the purpose of the ministerial determination and the level and nature of the personal information being recorded and to time-limit the storage of such information. I understand that the government has indicated that it supports amending clause 47. We are grateful that the government agrees with our concerns. We will move in another place an amendment to limit subclause 47(2) along the following lines: `If the determination relates to the use of personal information, the nature of the personal information and the purpose for which it will be used must be specified.' A note to clause 47, in the same style as the one to the previous clause, shall be added along the following lines: `Information collected under this section must be dealt with in accordance with section 14 of the Privacy Act 1988, including information privacy principles 1 and 4.' These amendments will provide for greater security of personal information and will narrowly limit the minister's discretion over the dissemination and use of information collected for the purposes of passport scrutiny.</para><para>We on this side of the parliament fully recognise that difficult balances have to be achieved here. We do not adopt an irresponsible oppositionist approach to this for the sake of opposition itself. These are difficult questions which confront the decision maker, who is the minister, the department, which is responsible for administering this act, and, in addition, those in the wider community who are concerned about any long-term impact of a deleterious nature on this nation's long-cherished tradition of civil liberties. We believe, with the amendments that we have put forward responsibly—and I thank the government for its positive response to them—that we can achieve a somewhat better balance than is contained in the original draft.</para><para>Therefore, from the opposition's perspective, if these amendments are adopted by the government in the Senate, we find no cause to oppose the bill and would support it in its current terms. If we reflect again on our broader circumstances, practical measures such as this govern the physical administration of our passport and visa procedures—and how we run things at the coalface with those who enter this country and those who leave this country. These matters represent a fundamental contribution to the substance of maintaining and enhancing this nation's national security in an exceptionally difficult age. In this age of terrorism in which we live, passport security and the overall integrity of the border protection system are fundamental. When we are concerned more broadly about the war against terrorism, globally and in the region, it is practical matters of this nature which cause the country to realise that we who are involved in the decision-making processes here in Canberra have to take practical and often difficult decisions which may have an effect on some traditional freedoms that are being exercised. </para><para>I think all of us in this place need to reflect on what will happen when the new biometric passports come into effect in this country. Some Australians, when they have first contact with this system, may find some of the things which they encounter through the application and dispensing process unfamiliar and confronting. I think we need to begin to warn the Australian public that these things will occur. But, with appropriate and intelligent support from both sides of the parliament and a rational and dispassionate debate about it, we can achieve good things for the country and good things for the nation's security. However, to conclude on this, when it comes to what is still a fundamental and continuing element of national security—that is, how we best protect passports once issued and sent out to the Australian public—losing a few hundred a year and having lost several hundred in previous years is a practical problem which needs the department's urgent attention. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>32046</page.no><name role="metadata">Baird, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BAIRD</name><name.id>MP6</name.id><electorate>Cook</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I listened with interest to the member for Griffith's contribution on the <inline ref="R2116">Australian Passports Bill 2004</inline> and follow him once again in debate in this House. It is interesting that, despite the long rhetorical contribution by the member for Griffith that we have experienced, the bottom line is that he supports these measures and, with the amendments that the minister has indicated the government will support, we do have support from the opposition with regard to the key measures of the bill.</para></talk.start><para>In terms of the member for Griffith's key area of criticism, which was the number of passports lost each year—something he made quite a focus of in his criticism—I noticed that the total number lost last year in the mail was 355. Of course, we would rather there be no passports lost, but it should be borne in mind that one million passports are issued each year and these 355 that were lost in the post were subsequently cancelled. The member for Griffith is quite renowned for his rhetorical flourishes, but it is stretching the issue a little too much to say that these losses endanger Australia's security. They represent .03 per cent of the total number of passports issued, and the lost passports were immediately cancelled. Nevertheless, the government does appreciate the support by the opposition of these key measures which have been introduced into the House, because the integrity of the passport system is integral to the fight against terrorism on a global basis. The passport system is important to the protection of Australia's security and the protection of our borders. It is also crucial that we have an effective passport system in order to maintain the vitality of the Australian tourism industry.</para><para>The tourism industry is now Australia's largest supplier of foreign earnings, representing some $16.5 billion each year. It does employ 650,000 people on a direct basis and some 350,000 people on an indirect basis, so it is also the largest employer in the country. As passports remain an integral and significant part of travel activities, the consultation which has occurred with the tourism industry is important and significant, and there is considerable support from the tourism industry for these changes. The legislation we have now is 66 years old and should undoubtedly have been changed long ago to meet requirements, but the current focus on global terror means that these changes have become absolutely essential.</para><para>It is also important to recognise how many passports are issued each year—some one million—and how many Australians hold passports. Some 40 per cent of Australians hold passports. If you compare that to the United States, you will see that about 20 per cent of Americans hold passports. We are a community that travels extensively, and we certainly want to ensure that all Australians have the right to continue to travel. That enriches our country and our culture and also reflects the very multicultural nature of our community. So the changes to the act are important and significant on several grounds. </para><para>The main purposes of the bill are threefold. Firstly, it maintains Australian citizens' access to passports of the highest integrity that establish the bearer's identity and citizenship. Of course, this legislation enables biometric identification to be used in the future, and I noted with interest the outline given by the member for Griffith of the changes that have been made in various parts of the world—or research which has been undertaken. We are hoping that we will move in the long-term future to these biometric identification measures. The use of facial biometrics in passports would eliminate much of the fraud which currently exists, and the use of irises is one of the key ways that has been identified as a means of establishing identity.</para><para>I am aware that the government is undertaking research in this area to see where we can move to and to see what the experiences of two American airports that have introduced these biometric measures have been. We look forward to research and development in this area, because these measures do ensure greater integrity of our border protection measures and of Australian passports, and we look forward to research into and development of the usage of these measures in assessing those who come to our borders and establishing the veracity of their claims. We know that there are a number of people—and I have met refugee applicants in this category—who have used false passports and come into the country as a result. These measures are being tightened up, and the penalties which are included in this bill are important in that regard. This bill does not only improve checks, enabling biometric measures to be introduced; it also introduces penalties for those who use false Australian passports and someone else's identity to travel internationally. It is important that those penalties be established.</para><para>The penalties have increased from two years imprisonment or $5,000 to 10 years imprisonment or $110,000. Some might think that that is excessive. When you consider the vulnerability that we have for allowing people into the country who do have security risks associated with their backgrounds then you can see why these penalties are being imposed. That relates to the second aim of this bill, which is to ensure that the passports law complements national security, border protection, Australian law enforcement measures and international law enforcement cooperation. Certainly this bill will ensure greater accountability of agencies, such as police and ASIO, which are responsible for law enforcement and national security. It will ensure that all appropriate types of conduct will be covered.</para><para>The bill provides for the ability to cancel or refuse passports, with a requirement that reasons be given for that cancellation or refusal. That is significant: the new act will set out clear reasons for the refusal and cancellation of a passport and there will be a comprehensive regime for review of any decisions. Reasons for refusal or cancellation will include that a person is likely to engage in, be charged with or be sentenced for specified serious crimes including terrorism, child sex tourism, child abduction or sexual slavery, people smuggling and drug trafficking. We regard all of those as being serious crimes and the cancellation of a passport for those reasons would seem highly appropriate. </para><para>The third aspect of this bill is to introduce a legal structure which will ensure consistency with family law, privacy and administrative law principles. There are some questions about the greater difficulty in getting children's passports and whether or not that is necessary. In the past, what has been required in getting a passport for a child is the signature of both parents. But we have had experiences of children being abducted and we need to protect the rights of both parents. I am sure we have all read heart-rending stories of abduction of a child by one parent, making it impossible for the parent based in Australia to have access to that child. Often the child will disappear. The standard requirement is for a court order. The new act will make it clear that disputes between parents should be dealt with by the courts. So it is not simply a matter of going along to the passport office to sort the matter out. There is a requirement that it go back to the court to decide whether the passport will be issued and whether one parent can take the child overseas. Special circumstances, such as where one parent cannot be located, in which exceptions to the requirements can be made will be set out clearly under the new act. We all want to ensure that parents have rights in the issuing of passports and that they do not experience the enormous difficulties and heart-rending problems that occur when a child disappears offshore.</para><para>So those are the three key aspects of this bill. The first is maintaining Australian passports of the highest integrity which establish the bearer's identity and citizenship. The bill does include a clear statement of the entitlement of an Australian to a passport. I am sure we all would agree with that. Secondly, this bill ensures that the passports law complements the national security objectives that all of us in this House would support. I was very interested to hear that continuing support from the member for Griffith, who supported the key provisions and objectives of this bill. The penalties that are imposed are in line with the threats that the false use of passports would incur.</para><para>There is also the important development of the new technology. As this is a fast-moving field it is being experimented with overseas. I believe that we should really concentrate our resources to be the leader in technology internationally. With 20 million Australians, some 40 per cent of whom hold passports, and with five million international visitors each year, we do have the ability to provide leadership internationally. We are seen as one of the leading tourism countries in the world. You need only look at some of the international publications. <inline font-style="italic">Travel and Leisure</inline> has just awarded Sydney the top travel destination in the world for the ninth year in a row. Australia is usually in the top five of any international listing of preferred tourism destinations. That is why we should get it right and why we can be at the vanguard of new technology.</para><para>There is a problem with lost and stolen passports. There are those who seem to have a habit of continually losing their passport. The member for Griffith mentioned passports that are lost in the mail. More significant are those which people simply lose. Some people have lost their passport two, three, four and five times. Last year a total of 32,479 passports were recorded as lost or stolen. This, to my mind, is the more significant occurrence. The ones that are lost by Australia Post are immediately cancelled, whereas it often takes some time before an individual is aware that their passport has been lost or stolen.</para><para>This legislation enables the minister to determine the penalties involved. The length of time of the validity of the passport can be limited. A significantly increased fee can also be imposed as a penalty for the loss of a passport. There are those who hold passports and continually lose them. The question could be raised as to whether some of those passports are finding their way into the hands of people smugglers or the hands of those who want to use them for global terrorism. Of course that is one of the very reasons why these penalties are being introduced and why there is such concern—32,479 is a lot of lost passports. Concentration on those factors is important. There are questions in relation to privacy and identity issues, as well as the involvement of biometrics in the privacy issues. I believe the more important national security questions override those issues in this case. Nevertheless, the need to maintain privacy is an ongoing issue. </para><para>One of the problems with the fee structure in the past has been whether the fee related to passports is regarded as a cost recovery measure or a tax. The way it has been handled in the past, under the old 1938 bill, has caused questions concerning the raising of the costs involved. The actual costs each year amount to some $100 million, so it is significant in terms of cost recovery. This bill allows the passport office to establish the increased fees. Nevertheless, I am sure that the tourism industry would want to ensure that, with departure taxes and airport levies et cetera, we do not have excessive passport costs providing a further penalty on the tourism industry. But I am sure that, from what we have seen in the past, there will be modest increases in this area.</para><para>There are a range of measures in this new legislation that we welcome and, of course, after 66 years it is appropriate that we have these significant changes. There are important changes there. The legislation maintains the right of every Australian to hold a passport, but the new measures ensure greater integrity for our passports, greater protection of our borders and greater protection against terrorism. These measures complement our national security measures, border protection measures and law enforcement measures. The measures included in the bill in relation to biometric measuring devices for passports are welcome. The penalties established in this bill—the two years imprisonment—are important antiterrorism measures. The penalties against those who needlessly or recklessly do not safeguard the security of their passports are also important, not so much as a penalty for their tardiness but rather to prevent the potential for the passports to get into the wrong hands and be used for illegal travel and passport fraud. Of course, the darker side of it all is the possibility of the passports being used for terrorism purposes.</para><para>Australians are extensive travellers. We do have a viable tourism industry, and the passport is central to it. On this side of the House we welcome the opposition's support for the legislation, and we have listened to their proposed amendment in relation to the biometrics. It is legislation which should be supported because of its support for the tourism industry, its support of border protection in this country, its support of the fight against global terrorism, its support of the use of new technology in border protection, its support of the protection of parents and its penalties for those who abuse our passports. It is a well thought out measure. I congratulate those in the passport office who have been involved in the development of the legislation, as well as those involved from the minister's office and the department. I certainly commend the legislation to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>32049</page.no><name role="metadata">Smith, Stephen, MP</name><name role="display">Mr STEPHEN SMITH</name><name.id>5V5</name.id><electorate>Perth</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I support the <inline ref="R2116">Australian Passports Bill 2004</inline> and I associate myself with the general remarks of my colleague the shadow minister for foreign affairs. I propose to make some brief remarks in my capacity as the shadow minister for immigration. Passports are of course essential to the movement of people. In our passport system and in our immigration system, we need to ensure the integrity of the movement of people. In the modern day, that is absolutely important. In the modern day, taking sensible precautions based on modern technology against passport fraud and identity fraud are absolutely essential. In recent times, we have had some very bad examples of identity fraud, passport fraud or lax procedures so far as passports, movement of people and visa arrangements are concerned. The Willie Brigitte example is but one—perhaps the best or the worst as the case may be. So it is absolutely essential that our passport system and our movement-of-people system and their administration have integrity. If we have confidence in the integrity of those systems, then we can not only proceed confidently for our own part but also require and ask the same high standards of others when it comes to their systems and the integrity of their people movement procedures. </para></talk.start><para>These measures are sensible in my view. The most important aspects of them, in very many respects, and the areas where I wish to focus my remarks are biometrics and the use of modern-day technology to ensure integrity of movement of people and integrity of passport and travel arrangements. With biometrics we see the use of, for example, fingerprint, facial or iris—eye—screening. Not only do we need to be at the forefront of international developments and use of this technology, we also need to make sure we are keeping up.</para><para>Look at some of the recent international developments. In the first half of 2003 the International Civil Aviation Organisation, ICAO, adopted what they described as a `global harmonized blueprint for the integration of biometric identification into passports' and other machine-readable travel documents or MRTDs, as they are known in the trade. ICAO referred to the use of various available biometric techniques: face, fingers and eyes.</para><para>The United States, an important trading partner and an important country with whom we have many people-movement exchanges, had until recently a deadline of October this year for machine-readable passports with biometric identifiers. The deadline was extended to October 2005 to enable other jurisdictions to make the necessary technological developments. For some time the United States has had a number of pilot posts for biometric visa programs.</para><para>In the UK, another important country so far as people movement to and from Australia is concerned, the UK Passport Service conducted a six-month trial of biometric identifiers in the first half of this year. In December 2003 the UK Home Office stated that the UK Passport Service was planning to begin issuing in the middle of next year passports which included facial biometrics and was also giving consideration to secondary biometrics—iris and fingerprint—in subsequent versions.</para><para>Other European countries, such as Belgium and Denmark, and the European Union itself are proceeding along comparable or similar lines. In February of this year the European Commission adopted a proposal for the inclusion of facial biometrics in European Union passports. In February of this year, Germany initiated a trial of iris scanning at some of their border posts. The list goes on. So, not only is it important for the integrity of our own system that we proceed to adopt, adapt and apply these modern-day scientific and technological techniques, it is also important that we keep up with developments in relevant jurisdictions.</para><para>Recently the minister for immigration officially opened a Biometrics Testing Facility in Canberra, which she described as being `designed to enhance Australia's efforts in border security' and to operate against identity fraud. The Biometric Testing Facility in Canberra is described as using `practical applications of new technologies such as facial recognition, fingerprint and iris scanning to assess how these technologies could be integrated into DIMIA's existing processes'. DIMIA staff are actively involved in applying the technology to identity and border management. </para><para>At the time I welcomed that. I think that is an important facility. The minister in her remarks at the opening of the facility made the point that she regarded the use of biometrics as being an important tool for entry. I made the point at the time that that is a limited view because you can use biometrics not just for entry requirements but also for compliance.</para><para>On the same day as the minister opened the biometric testing laboratory in Canberra she released the department's immigration compliance report, <inline font-style="italic">Managing the border: immigration compliance</inline>, 2002-03 edition. Those familiar with the compliance report will be aware that it covers a four-year period. In terms of compliance, my point is that we need to be thinking of using biometrics not just for entry requirements but also for compliance.</para><para>If you have a look at the report you will find that it again confirms that, at any point in time, we will have in Australia up to 60,000 illegal foreign, non-Australian citizens present. Of those 60,000, up to half will be working. Those people will be in Australia illegally—non-Australian citizens illegally in Australia—either because they have overstayed the time period of their visa or because they are in breach of a particular visa condition. These people are here illegally, in contradistinction to those people who might come here as unauthorised arrivals and claim our protection under the refugee convention.</para><para>The report also makes it crystal clear that, in this area, neither the government nor the department has done anything over a four-year period. I remember in November or December of 2000 the former minister for immigration indicating that the government would introduce legislation to impose sanctions on employers who knowingly employed illegal foreign workers. A month or two ago the current minister issued the same statement. There is only one problem: over four years, nothing has occurred. So there is a serious deficiency here in the government's administration. There is a neglect of policy. There is a seriously limited long-term view that biometrics cannot be applied or utilised for compliance as well as entry.</para><para>Labor has a proposal for an illegal foreign worker's card which would mean a simple `no card, no work'. We propose to link that card in the future to biometric information, so that the biometric information contained in the illegal foreign worker's card would be linked to the information contained in the department of immigration, the visa office and the Australian Taxation Office. So it would be an effective method of compliance.</para><para>So there are 60,000 non-Australian citizens illegally present in Australia at any point in time. The government have done nothing about that for at least four years. Up to 30,000 of them are working illegally at any point in time. Four years ago the government promised legislation to impose sanctions on employers who knowingly employ illegal foreign workers. They have done nothing. Now, regrettably, at that point in the cycle when we should be embracing the use of biometrics across the board, the government say, through the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, that they are not interested in utilising biometric information for compliance purposes. This, to my mind, is very short-sighted. </para><para>In the course of making his remarks on the bill on behalf of the opposition, the member for Griffith, the shadow minister for foreign affairs, made the point that he had raised with the office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs a privacy concern, to which the government had responded sensibly and, in general terms, favourably. I think that point is right. On my reading of the legislation, in terms of the use of biometrics, it would be possible under the legislation to embed the biometric material in the passport itself—a machine-readable travel document which I referred to earlier—or to keep it in a central database, which is one of the models that the United States is looking at or intending to use in its own visit scheme. In either model there is a privacy concern.</para><para>Earlier this year the House and the parliament considered the <inline ref="R1750">Migration Legislation Amendment (Identification and Authentication) Bill 2004</inline>. That piece of migration legislation was looking at the future use of biometrics for identity and document fraud so far as non-Australian citizens were concerned. Both in this House and in the other place questions of privacy were raised. That bill was referred to the relevant Senate committee and the government sensibly responded favourably to some of the privacy suggestions made in respect of that bill, including about the use of biometrics for identification and authentication of non-Australian citizens in terms of people movement and border protection.</para><para>If we can accord that approach to non-Australian citizens then it is obviously sensible that we accord the same general approach to Australian citizens so far as passport data is concerned. Whilst I am not suggesting that the particular measures in that legislation necessarily need to be applied here, I am pleased that the issue has been raised, that the government seems to have responded favourably in general terms and that it seems happy to incorporate some details on how personal information can be utilised—requiring specification of detail when that personal information is proposed to be obtained or utilised and generally bringing the matter under the umbrella of the Privacy Act 1988. I think that is a sensible concern that has been raised and a sensible response from the government in general terms.</para><para>These are important measures in very many respects. I suspect that at the moment they will be underappreciated by the Australian community. As the procedures and requirements come to be adopted and Australian citizens, when they obtain their passports, are faced with what they will no doubt regard as higher standards and higher requirements on them, we may, in our electorate offices and ministerial offices, get the odd criticism, query or complaint. Whilst there may well be some administrative teething problems, I think it will be incumbent on all of us at the time to make the point that it is absolutely essential in the modern day that our passport system is one of integrity, that our immigration and border controls have integrity and that we ensure that we utilise modern-day technology that includes, in particular and especially, biometric information.</para><para>The modern day will demand, warrant and require that biometric information be contained in travel documents, in my view, not just for entry purposes but also for compliance purposes. In that context, these are sensible measures which the parliament should embrace and which I am sure our colleagues in the Senate will also embrace. While they might look at the privacy point in detail, I am sure that will be resolved amicably and sensibly, as the adoption generally of these measures will enhance our capacity for integrity in our passport arrangements and integrity in our people-movement arrangements. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>32053</page.no><name role="metadata">Billson, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BILLSON</name><name.id>1K6</name.id><electorate>Dunkley</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank the member for Griffith, the member for Cook and also the member for Perth for their contributions to this debate. It is an important package of legislation. As the member for Perth was alluding to, it might not be immediately obvious to some citizens, but this is an important package of legislation, comprising the <inline ref="R2116">Australian Passports Bill 2004</inline>, the <inline ref="R2115">Australian Passports (Application Fees) Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2113">Australian Passports (Transitionals and Consequentials) Bill 2004</inline>. I particularly thank the member for Griffith and the member for Perth for indicating the opposition's support for the legislation.</para></talk.start><para>I would like to draw attention to the member for Cook's contribution. As an ardent advocate of the tourism industry, he would no doubt be aware that the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline> in Melbourne has reported, in an article headed `Resurgence in new passports', that Australians are flocking overseas. The article talked about Australian travellers thumbing their noses at terrorists and applying for passports in record numbers. The number of passports issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade was up 17 per cent last financial year. The department's division of consular and passport services does an outstanding job. It is a key friend and ally and part of team Australia, looking after international travellers from this country. The only thing the member for Cook did not do was to encourage travellers to look at smartraveller.gov.au for the latest information on travel destinations and some really practical, helpful hints on how to make their travel a success and as enjoyable as it can be.</para><para>As the Minister for Foreign Affairs said when introducing these bills, the government wants to ensure that Australians can continue to rely on a travel document of the highest integrity which clearly establishes their identity and their citizenship. To do this, the government has brought to the parliament a legal structure for Australia's world-class passport system, based on three core themes: modernisation, clarification and enhancement. These themes are addressed in a number of ways throughout the package of bills before the House, and I would like to highlight some of the key elements: identity fraud, national security, law enforcement and children's passports.</para><para>Penalties for passport fraud would be increased up to $110,000 or a 10-year jail term from the current $5,000 or two-year jail term that the present act provides. These penalties are the same as those for comparable offences for people smuggling. A set of measures aimed at reducing the number of lost and stolen passports are also included in the legislation. The government's policy approach is twofold: to emphasise the importance of protecting passports and to stop the misuse of lost or stolen passports.</para><para>It is worth reflecting on some of the comments from the member for Griffith. The integrity and security of our passports and the passport system is not simply about the point of delivery. It is about the application process, with the supporting evidence, which is verified; processing procedures; the detection of fraud through that process; production—we have a secure production facility that produces tamper-proof passports; the issuing of passports, which was a point the member for Griffith chose to focus on; and also their use. That whole system goes to the question of the security of our passports.</para><para>The member for Griffith alluded to the 343 passports reported as missing in the mail in the 18 months since the new initiative was introduced. The member for Griffith failed to convey that all passports lost are cancelled and cannot be used to leave or return to Australia. Efforts are also continuing through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to enhance the partnership with Australia Post to get the number of lost passports down to zero. But, as I think the member for Cook pointed out, the number of passports that are not reaching their destination equates to 0.3 per cent, so we need to get this in context. Efforts are also being made to exchange information on lost and stolen passports with other countries. Again to enforce the fact that a lost or stolen passport becomes inoperable, we are working with other countries to ensure that our systems are as complementary as they can be. </para><para>One million passports are issued each year. Fraud related activity is also being given greater attention within the department of foreign affairs with the recent creation of a new section within DFAT, with this goal as its express purpose. I mentioned that the passport itself has in-built integrity measures. The Australian passport—a world-class document, a secure document—is virtually tamper proof. Laser cuts in the paper and other security features mean that the data page will tear away if there is an attempt to remove the laminate. So people who watch <inline font-style="italic">CSI </inline>and see things happening there—a photo slipping into an identification document—and then try to relate them to the Australian passport ignore some of the tamper-proof features that are embedded as a feature of the world-class Australian passport. The document has been tested widely and has been internationally commended for its tamper-evident features. That is, if someone messes with it, one can tell. That is an important issue, putting in context some of the points of the member for Griffith.</para><para>The new act will enable us to combat identity fraud through the use of emerging technologies such as biometrics. The use of biometric technology has attracted some attention over the past few years. The Australian Passports Bill 2004 sets out a framework for the use of that technology at clause 47. As indicated by the opposition, the government is receptive to some refining and finetuning of that provision in the other place. The government will continue in consultation processes as far as possible with its research and development program for the introduction of facial biometric technology. Some of the speakers spoke about iris biometric technologies. The algorithms that can go into a biometric feature may take into account a range of other facial features—facial structure and things of that kind. Again, there is work in progress there, and Australia is at the forefront of that work.</para><para>If this technology is adopted, the details of its use in passports will be set out in a ministerial determination which will be subject to parliamentary approval. The minister has consistently emphasised the need to introduce these technologies in a manner which maintains community confidence in the protection of people's privacy but which is also complementary to the integrity and security of our passport system. Accordingly, the determination would detail the nature of the information to be collected—in the case we are working to, a photograph—and the purpose for which it is to be used to assist in identifying fraudulent passport applications and detecting fraudulent use of a passport.</para><para>It is worth reflecting on some of the comments by the opposition. Whilst the government is happy to work cooperatively with the opposition on finetuning the specific provisions of clause 47, we should not miss the apparent contradiction in some of the points that have been made by the opposition. The provisions in this bill which the opposition seeks to elaborate further go to limiting the application of this technology and being clear about the privacy concerns that are a part of it and therefore, through that declaration, being quite specific about the material to be collected and its application. That is quite consistent with the government's aims for this package of legislation. But, in the next breath, the opposition is arguing that we are not using biometric technologies and systems for other applications. You have heard some of the examples put forward by the opposition. It is an interesting debating point, but the inconsistency in those two thoughts—arguing that there is a need to constrain the application and then seeking to score a political point against the government for not broadening the application of that very same data—is something that I will leave others to reflect upon. But, in specific relation to this bill, the government is prepared to accommodate clause 47 refinements that the opposition has suggested. </para><para>Clause 47 relates to the future application of technology, but the current issue for us is biometrics. In the case of the passport system, this means facial biometrics such as photographs and the metrics applying to facial structure and facial features. The Australian passport system has a reputation for being a world leader in the use of cutting edge technology. As I mentioned, we should not overlook the great credit that successive governments and DFAT have gained over the years.</para><para>There was also some criticism by the member for Griffith that the government was, in his words, dragging its feet. Again, it might be a cheap debating point but it is one that needs to be looked at in the context of what has actually been going on. Australia has been leading the world in the development of this technology. Australia is in the vanguard—it is leading the world in the development and application of this technology. Other countries have not been able to provide environments which would guarantee international interoperability. There is no point in us functioning solely as an island. To achieve the potential of this technology and to fulfil the purpose for which we are investigating it, this technology needs to work in conjunction with other jurisdictions. We cannot blindly trot off into the sunset and do our own thing and then find that the world-class technology in our passports can only be used here. A passport is a travel document so there is another destination involved.</para><para>Australia will be in a position to introduce biometrics when others are providing it and can support the infrastructure. The investment of around $6 million to date is focused on research and development to justify what the full implementation outlay would involve. That is in the order of $150 million to $160 million. It makes some sense to hasten with care but be very much at the leading edge of the development of this technology. The government is doing that. It is patently unreasonable to suggest that the government has been dragging its feet. We are not aware of any other country which is using biometric technology in passports as yet. There is a need to distinguish what others are doing in the visa area from the application of this emerging technology in passports. We are not aware of any country more advanced in the development of the use of biometrics for passports than our own.</para><para>The new act will explicitly allow for refusal or cancellation of a passport if an Australian is likely to engage in, is charged with or has been sentenced for specific serious crimes. These crimes will include child sex tourism, child abduction, sexual slavery, drug trafficking, people smuggling and terrorism. The existing powers to cancel a passport are also incorporated. They relate to the prospect of prejudicing national security. That feature of the current act has been retained in this bill. The administration of these provisions will be clarified, with the act making clear that it is the responsibility of the law enforcement or security agencies to assess that a person should be prevented from travelling. A person's passport would then be refused or cancelled to complement the national security or law enforcement objective. </para><para>In the tricky area of children's passports, the basic requirement for the issuing of a passport for children—that both parents' consent or a court order be obtained—has been retained. Some flexibility is necessary, with the complexity of modern travel and relationships, and the regime for applying exceptions is set out in the bill and explanatory memorandum. However, an important new element has been included, and that is when the department is asked to apply these exceptions in circumstances where there is a dispute between the parents about whether their child can travel internationally. A declaration may be made that the matter should be dealt with by a court. DFAT has many gifted people, but resolving family disputes is not a core competency of the department. Currently, in these cases, difficult, heart-wrenching and often conflict-ridden administrative decisions are made in that environment by passport officers outside the formal policy and legislative framework established under the family law system. Obtaining a passport should not trump a family law outcome.</para><para>These amendments seek to ensure that the family law related issues are resolved first, prior to a decision being made about the issuing of a passport. I should stress that the government is committed to the smooth operation of these family law related issues. The bill does not limit which court should resolve these disputes: the Family Court of Australia, the Federal Magistrates Court and, in some cases, state and territory courts have jurisdiction to do so. The choice of a court is a matter for the parents and not mandated by the department. In addition, the department will maintain its close consultation with the courts to ensure that this process operates as smoothly as possible. I should emphasise that the overall policy objective of these provisions is to protect children from abduction and to protect the rights of parents.</para><para>In conclusion, I should note the broad impact of this legislative package. Eight million Australians hold passports, and it is important that the passport system reflects their needs. We have a world-class passport system. I mentioned earlier that one million passports are issued per year, each being issued in an average of less than 10 days. We use leading edge work-flow systems and other technologies. We have a record of using the latest technologies and being in the vanguard of the development of new and emerging technologies. We were one of the first to introduce machine readable zones and digitised images on our passports. Australia was the first country to use a unique floating image—a jumping kangaroo—in the laminate. Clients are well serviced by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, with nine passport offices in Australia. Applicants can apply at over 100 locations overseas and there are 1,700 Australia Post outlets around Australia ready to assist people with the passport application process. These three bills will strengthen the capacity and integrity of an already world-class Australian passport system and I am delighted to commend them to the chamber.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para><para>Message from the Governor-General recommending appropriation announced.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>32057</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Mr BILLSON (Dunkley)—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (10.35 a.m.)—by leave—I move: </para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a third time.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a third time.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>AUSTRALIAN PASSPORTS (APPLICATION FEES) BILL 2004</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>32057</page.no><id.no>R2115</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>32057</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 24 June, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Downer</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>32057</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Mr BILLSON (Dunkley)—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (10.37 a.m.)—by leave—I move:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a third time.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a third time.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>AUSTRALIAN PASSPORTS (TRANSITIONALS AND CONSEQUENTIALS) BILL 2004</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>32057</page.no><id.no>R2113</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>32057</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 24 June, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Downer</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>32057</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Mr BILLSON (Dunkley)—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (10.37 a.m.)—by leave—I move:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a third time.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a third time.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES AND VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2004 BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2004</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>32057</page.no><id.no>R2114</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>32057</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 24 June, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pyne</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para><inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline></para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>32057</page.no><name role="metadata">Swan, Wayne, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SWAN</name><name.id>2V5</name.id><electorate>Lilley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R2114">Family and Community Services and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (2004 Budget Measures) Bill 2004</inline> implements two of the 2004 budget measures in the FaCS portfolio. On the face of it the measures are positive but, as always with this government, whenever you scratch the surface they always have an agenda to claw benefits back. The bill gives effect to two 2004 FaCS budget measures. Schedule 1 amends the Social Security Act 1991 and the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 to exempt the fee waiver and fee pay scholarships from the income test for income support payments. Schedule 2 amends the Social Security Act 1991 to expand the eligibility criteria for the carer allowance by allowing a new group of carers to be qualify for carer allowance if they provide certain care for an adult with a disability, even if they do not live with that adult. Under this measure the required care must be provided on a daily basis for at least 20 hours per week. Both measures are beneficial and will be supported. However, they need to be seen in the light of the government's previous treatment of carers.</para></talk.start><para>Last year the government axed 30,000 families with disabled children from the carer allowance, something that the opposition drew attention to at the time. At the time we also drew attention to the fact that there were leaked budget proposals from the FaCS portfolio in a 62-page cabinet-in-confidence letter to the Prime Minister. The letter from the Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Patterson, outlined her budget strategy and bid for 23 key budget measures. Among those measures were some for carers, including this small beneficial measure before us today, but the government at that stage intended to pay for it by cutting payments to those who apply for benefits in the future. This cold-hearted measure proposed cutting $30 million from the carer allowance by restricting backdating provisions. Families waiting for the diagnosis of serious conditions would no longer be allowed to backdate claims when loved ones fall ill. It really does give you an insight into the priorities of the Howard government: they are interested only in their own re-election—so they will deliver a small expansion of carer allowance before the election, while in their bottom drawer are plans to cut that benefit afterwards. </para><para>This is central to the government's whole political strategy. It pretends to be Father Christmas on the eve of the election, but after the election it behaves like Scrooge. We have seen this across the board in this budget: additional benefits for families that could not be provided in the previous three or nine years, and suddenly a river of gold flows to the people and they are expected to believe that this government has a generous heart. But when you go to the core documents from which this government operates, such as the cabinet-in-confidence submission from Senator Patterson from around November last year, you see how cold-hearted the Howard government is and what it would do if it were re-elected for a further three years.</para><para>On page 7 of this cabinet-in-confidence document are the nasty proposals that the government is not talking about prior to the election but would implement if it were re-elected in one or two months time. I will quote from the document. It says that the `proposals in the package are linked, and most require changes to legislation'. It continues, `The fourth proposal is a savings proposal that would reduce the period for backdating payment of carer allowance to 12 weeks for both adults and children from the current 26 weeks for adults and the 52 weeks for children, and would substantially offset over four years the costs of the additional assistance proposal.' What was the additional assistance proposal? We are seeing that today—that is here, all right. The additional assistance proposal—which is overdue and welcome—was going to be paid for by the nasty hidden proposal revealed in this document  which, strangely enough, did not see the light of day in the budget but is there for after the election.</para><para>You can see the extent that it is there for after the election when you get to attachment A10 in the cabinet-in-confidence document. A10 sets out this measure that I have described before which commences early next year. This measure, where the government say, `We've finally recognised the needs of people receiving carer allowance. There was an anomaly whereby if someone wasn't living in the same residence they couldn't get their carer allowance. Well, now they can. Aren't we jolly good fellows?' is to be funded after the election with cutbacks which will hit a large number of people. That is what the government's documentation indicates.</para><para>If there was ever a bill that demonstrated the failure of the Howard government to grasp and face up to the big challenges—the big ideas and solutions that are required to meet our social challenges in this country—it is this one. This bill, as I said, extends the carer allowance to a small group who have previously been excluded, and that is welcome. But it is an initiative which has been built on the back not just of the cutbacks that are coming after the election if the government are re-elected but of the cutbacks from knocking 30,000 carers off carer allowance in the last 18 months—they ripped it away! It was the political backlash that flowed from their attack on those 30,000 families that made this government come forward with their one-off $600 payment in the budget—they were so on the nose amongst the hard-pressed carers of our community. </para><para>What do we get in this bill? Another short-term fix, no long-term plan for carers and one-off $600 payments. Fix the small anomaly here which will help a small group of people, hide the nasty proposals in the cabinet submission until after the election and then claw the $600 back by other means afterwards—that is the approach of this government. And all of that is built on the other fundamental attack that remains in the system and that is held up by Labor in the Senate, which is the attempt by the government to cut the disability support pension by $70 a fortnight for a large number of disability support pensioners. This is something that is going to receive a fair bit of attention in the coming debate about the future of our country: the government's proposals to cut the disability support pension by $70 a fortnight, and their ultimate goal to attack the indexation method of pensions and take them down for not only working age pension recipients but the whole lot. That is the ultimate objective of the Howard government.</para><para>This measure that we are looking at today is another short-term fix. It is a short-term fix which comes in the middle of a sea of attacks. I see the member for Herbert is present in the chamber. I wonder what he has had to say to those local families in his electorate who were knocked off the carer allowance. What did he say to them? And what is he going to say to them if he is re-elected when the government comes back with its plans in those cabinet submissions which will further attack those people who are seeking to access a future carer allowance? What is he going to say to all those people who may have their disability support pension cut—the thousands of them in the federal electorate of Herbert who may have their disability support pension cut by $70 a fortnight—if the government is re-elected and is successful in getting that measure through the parliament? All of this illustrates the determination of the Howard government simply to play politics—short-term politics—whilst it has a long-term plan hidden in the bottom drawer to punch some very big holes in our social safety net.</para><para>After nine years of playing Scrooge, it is suddenly Christmas, and the government are lavishing new benefits on people—no amount of money is too big. Last year they could not fund the pneumococcal vaccine; this year rivers of gold are flowing. But do you know what will happen? After the election they will come and steal it all back. Do you know why we know that? Because that is exactly what they did after the last election. It is Groundhog Day now, because just before the last election there were $300 payments to seniors on the eve of the election and $1,000 family payment debt waivers—all was flowing. There was no need to do anything else about the family payment system, because it would all go away into the future; it was all just a minor administrative problem. And now what do we have in the family payment system? Debts of $1.6 billion for 1.5 million people over the past three years—debts that the government said would never happen and would simply go away. The government have had nine years in office playing Scrooge, and suddenly it is Christmas and benefits are flowing.</para><para>We all know what will happen if this government are re-elected. They will be there to steal it all back, because at the end of the day this is a government which is full of small-time political connivers. That is essentially what they are up to. They are small-time political connivers. They are not creative thinkers. They are not facing up to the big social challenges in this country. They are just small-time political connivers. There is not a statesman among them, particularly when it comes to our social security system. </para><para>The other measure in this bill deals with scholarships. Currently, scholarships are required to be taken into account as income unless specifically exempted from the income test for income support payments. As announced in the 2004 budget, all fee waived and fee paying scholarships will no longer be included as income under the social security test for income support payments under the Social Security Act 1991 and the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. The exemptions will apply to scholarships offered in the secondary vocational, education training and higher education sectors. The government has estimated that the exemption will benefit approximately 1,550 students at the present time, increasing to 2,220 students.</para><para>I now come to the small carer allowance initiative in the bill—an initiative well overdue. The Social Security Act currently requires a carer to live with the person for whom they are providing care to qualify for the carer allowance. This co-residency requirement departed from the practice under the former domiciliary nursing care benefit which the carer allowance replaced from July 1999. That old benefit allowed some discretion for payment in situations where there was no co-residence. So this measure rectifies that problem. But it takes place in an environment where the government is simply attacking the living standards of an enormous number of families. It is hiding significant information that the Australian public need to have placed before them so they can evaluate the record of this government.</para><para>It is now 2½ months since the budget. It is two months since the Senate estimates hearings, where we asked this government a lot of questions about a lot of these budget measures. For the first time in history in this budget area and for this department, the government are simply refusing to supply the answers that we have requested about the carer allowance, about all of those that were removed and the circumstances of their removal. They are refusing to supply that. They are refusing to come back and answer with regard to the Labor analysis that shows that the $600 one-off family payment, which the government claim is built into the family payment system forever, disappears in five to seven years. They are refusing to come back on that. And, by their refusal to come back with information on that, they have confirmed that it does disappear. This is unprecedented—we have not had a situation ever in this portfolio where the department have simply refused to supply the answers. They have a lot to hide; they have an enormous amount to hide. What they are hiding is the fact that the $600 payment, through the swindle that they have perpetrated on indexation arrangements and family payments, is eroded in five to seven years. This is always the way the Howard government do it. They put forward an increase which exists on a temporary basis and then they come and claw it all back. That is what is going to happen to the $600 increase which they are pretending exists. That is one of the reasons that they will not answer the questions which have been put to them.</para><para>On top of that, we have the extraordinary situation where the government, in their rush to shovel the cash out of the window—they are driving down the main streets of suburban electorates just shovelling $100 bills out of the window to anyone who wants them—paid the $600 family payment to families who were not entitled to it. Some people received two payments. They were ringing up members of parliament saying, `We're not entitled to this money—we're only entitled to one, but we got two.' Suddenly, the government once again was a river to its people. Minister Patterson said: `Keep the money even if you are not entitled to it. Keep the money.' Isn't this extraordinary! After the vilification and the campaign that the government has conducted with the 30,000 families that were knocked off the carer allowance and the way in which it has denigrated people on disability support pensions, suddenly, if there is an overpayment, they are no longer cheats; they are worthy citizens. </para><para>Australians can understand that double standard and, of course, they were appalled. To begin with, all of those 34,000 families out there with pensioner concession cards who just had them ripped up were particularly appalled. During this period the government was doing a review of people who were entitled to concession cards. Suddenly, 34,000 people received a letter saying, `You are no longer entitled to your concession card—it is gone,' and not a reason was given to those people. So they understand the double standard. What they want is one standard for all, not a special standard for election bribes, where people who are overpaid $600 can suddenly keep it and other people are hunted down, have their tax returns stripped and have the debt collectors set upon them. These are double standards—one for the election and one for after the election. There is a lot more of that to come.</para><para>A week and half ago we stumbled across what is perhaps one of the biggest bungles that we have seen from this government. It usually tries to blame Centrelink for them, but it is not the fault of the people who work in Centrelink or any of the officials who administer the policy; it is the fault of the government. We suddenly find out that the government has not been telling families about the 27 family payment paydays and, in fact, people are now being overpaid. The government is refusing to tell families who are getting the additional $600 payment what their debts may be under the existing system until September and possibly later, thereby encouraging them to spend their additional moneys unaware of how much the government may be requesting back. On top of that fraud that the government has perpetrated on families, we suddenly find that the government has not taken into account the fact that there are 27 paydays so that, in this financial year in addition to the average $900 debt, these families are going to incur another $400 to $800 debt. The member for Herbert votes for this system in the House—a system that has an inbuilt debt trap which gives families on average a $900 a year debt.</para><para>And now we suddenly find that, in the next financial year, added to that debt—because of the failure of the government to tell families about the additional payday—there will be an additional debt of $400 to $800. So the minimum debt in the current financial year, which people will not find out about until after the election, is going to be $1,300.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>HK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Lindsay, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Lindsay</name></talker><para>—Absolute rubbish!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>2V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Swan, Wayne, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SWAN</name></talker><para>—Your minister admitted it on radio. And you are so ignorant of this fact—so absolutely unaware of the problem in the family payment system—that you can say it is rubbish. He has actually said it is true. So the average debt this year, which people will not find out about until after next June, is going to be $1,300 per family.</para></talk.start></continue><para>When we exposed this debacle and bungle, the minister said, `We told them about it, because we put it up on the web site.' About a week before we exposed the bungle, it did go up on the web site, but it went up on the web site that nobody uses. It did not go up on the Centrelink web site; it went up on the FaCS web site: in a small note down the bottom, as always—it is always in the fine print with the Howard government, never in the headline.</para><para>People should have been told about this in May, when Centrelink wrote to them telling them to put in their income estimates. The government would then have been perfectly entitled to say, `It is something we have done something about.' If people had been notified of this in May, the government would have had a defence, but they did not do that. Why didn't they do that? I will tell you why they did not do it: because they did not want to draw attention to the debt trap in their family payment system. That is why. What happened was this: they took a deliberate decision not to tell people about the 27 paydays, because that would have raised the spectre of average debts going from $900 to $1,300. That is why they did not do it. </para><para>That is why, when we look at the record of this government, I say we are simply dealing with small-time connivers, rather than creative thinkers, statesmen or people who have a vision for a family payment system and a social security system that deal with the big issues in our society and look after the long-term interests of families. They only have a vision for a short-term political fix. That is why in the budget they did not take the opportunity to fix the debt trap in the family payment system—and they should have. They took the decision to create a short-term political fix which would paper over the cracks in it. In effect, they took the decision to slosh money all over it so that people might temporarily forget about all the problems in the system.</para><para>What did that produce? It produced Australia's biggest ever pork barrel. I suppose that will be the Treasurer's legacy. I will never forget budget night, when he was giving his speech and I was sitting over there, and 50 words into the speech the Treasurer said, `This is a huge spending budget.' I nearly fell off the front bench. That is what the government accuse the Labor Party of. And huge spending it was: an extra $2 billion pumped out there in the $600 payments, hoping people would forget about the average debt of $900, which they are not going to tell them about until at least after September, and hoping they would all forget about the 27 paydays—not telling the families, so that would add to the debt. They just threw a bit of cash around and hoped people would forget about the long term—the financial headache that is coming after the election, if the government are re-elected, and the need to reform the system so that families can get their payments accurately on a fortnightly basis.</para><para>All of this demonstrates one very important point: this government have not had a third-term agenda at all, except an agenda of giving payments when they want to get re-elected and of clawing those back afterwards. Of course, work and family was supposed to be the third-term agenda. If this is work and family—making the debt trap in the family payment system bigger and only giving income tax cuts to everyone who earns over $52,000—this is a very twisted set of people. This government do not have a third-term agenda, and they certainly do not have a fourth-term agenda, except for all of the things that we have seen in their cabinet documents—such as their proposals to go after carers after the election—which they will implement after the election, if they are re-elected.</para><para>I will just go through that proposal again, because I think the carers of Australia need to be very familiar with the government's plans for them after the election. The fourth proposal is a savings proposal that would reduce the period of backdating payment of carer allowance to 12 weeks for both adults and children—currently it is 26 weeks for adults and 52 weeks for children—and would substantially offset over four years the costs of additional proposals. Just sitting there in the bottom drawer, this is another one of those clawbacks—just in the carer area. It is just like the financial headache that is going to come from the fact that the government did not notify families about the phenomenon of 27 payment periods and the additional debts coming from that after 30 June. It is just like the government's failure to fix the family payment system in this budget by trying to paper over the cracks.

Senator Patterson, in November last year wrote to the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, and put forward the measure in this bill that allows people to still receive carer allowance where there is not co-residence. I welcome that initiative. But what is not in the bill but is going to fund the proposal—as Senator Patterson's correspondence to the Prime Minister makes absolutely clear—are further cutbacks for people wanting to receive carer allowance in the future. The member for Herbert is all in favour of that, but I am sure that the carers in Townsville will be absolutely horrified to realise that he and his government are sitting on this measure, which they are not telling them about prior to the election. We will just go through that measure again. The fourth proposal, which appears on page 7 of the cabinet-in-confidence document, says:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>The fourth proposal is a savings proposal that would reduce the period of backdating payment of carer allowance to 12 weeks for both adults and children.</para></quote><para>That would be down from the current 26 weeks for adults and 52 weeks for children and would:</para><quote><para>... substantially offset over four years the costs of the additional assistance proposals.</para></quote><para>That is, the additional assistance proposal which is in this bill is funded in their advance plans—which the minister submitted to the Prime Minister—by expenditure cuts that the government have not put forward to the Australian people and will only do so if they are re-elected. That is how they intend to really fund this additional measure in the budget.</para><para>The carers of Australia are awake to this government. They are aware that every time John Howard gives them something the claw comes out after the election to pull it all back. That is what this document demonstrates: that the government have the claw waiting. It is in the bottom drawer, and if they are re-elected that is how they intend to fund this measure. That is why the Australian people are sick of these small time political connivers—like the member for Herbert—who are engaged in these sorts of political games. They want a Latham Labor government, which has some positive plans for the future, which will have a fair approach to the administration of social security benefits and which will ensure that those people who are vulnerable are not the subject of these political fixes and political tricks. That is why they want a family payment system which is accurate and timely, and that is what they will get from a Latham Labor government. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>32064</page.no><name role="metadata">Lindsay, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LINDSAY</name><name.id>HK6</name.id><electorate>Herbert</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to start on a positive note and recognise the people who, on behalf of the government and the people of Australia, deliver benefits to those who very much need the support that the government provides—that is, I would like to recognise the good people of Centrelink. I am pleased to tell the House that, in the last measured month when an independent organisation measured the customer satisfaction rating of Centrelink, in the CNQ area of Australia—which includes the electorates of Capricornia, Dawson, Leichhardt, Herbert and Kennedy—Centrelink achieved the highest level of customer satisfaction ever recorded by any Centrelink area in the history of Centrelink. That is a fantastic achievement and just shows that, under the leadership of Peter Doutre, who is based in Townsville, Centrelink is getting better and better. I think that is recognised by its customers. It is certainly recognised by the government, but it is not recognised by the member for Lilley. Every time he makes a statement he has something sinister and nasty to say about the good people who work in Centrelink—the people who these days are doing so well at looking after those who need the assistance that the government provides.</para></talk.start><para>In relation to the <inline ref="R2114">Family and Community Services and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (2004 Budget Measures) Bill 2004</inline>, I would like to address a couple of matters that the member for Lilley raised in his contribution. The first matter concerns what he said that the government are doing to the disability support pension—that we are going to cut $70 a fortnight from the pension. That is just not true. We have not cut the DSP by $70 this year. We have not and will not cut the DSP in the future. End of story. Yet the member for Lilley said in the Australian parliament today, in this scare campaign, that we are going to cut the disability support pension. It is just not true; it is a nonsense.</para><para>What we are doing is proposing to take people who can work off the disability support pension and to transfer them to Newstart. That is sensible. It is sensible for a couple of reasons. I have people in my electorate who are on the disability support pension while running concreting businesses. How can they get the disability support pension and run a concreting business? I am talking about people who go out there and lay concrete. It is true; it happens. The government are not in the business of providing income support for people who run concreting businesses on disability support pensions. Secondly, for those more genuine cases who are currently on a DSP but who in fact can work, it gives them greater dignity not to be on a disability support pension. It encourages them to get out and have a go—and so they should. The member for Lilley does not seem to understand that.</para><para>In relation to the member for Lilley's claim that we are knocking 30,000 people off the carer allowance, you really need to understand what is actually happening. First of all, the Howard government very much recognise the vital role that carers play in our society, and we will continue to support them. They deserve our support. Indeed, currently we are providing carers with direct payments of almost $1.8 billion each year—that is, $1.8 billion goes to carers in direct payments. That is the kind of support that the Howard government are prepared to give to these people who provide such a good service in the community. That amount of money is a 135 per cent increase since 1999. That does not sound like a cut to me. The carer payment is provided to about 84,000 customers, and they very much appreciate the government assistance that they are given. Carer allowance is provided to over 300,000 customers. That was at a cost of $770 million in 2003-04. </para><para>With regard to the claim that 30,000 customers are being stripped of benefits or kicked off benefits, let me tell you what has actually happened. There has been a regular review process of Centrelink. It is part of the proper, businesslike approach that you would expect of a government that manages taxpayers' money properly. In this instance, 67,000 customers have been reviewed. In that review, only 2,742 carers of children with a disability failed to achieve a qualifying score. About 6,500 people contacted Centrelink and they themselves advised Centrelink that they were no longer eligible. Another 8,300 people did not respond to the review. Even though Centrelink wrote three times to those customers—and telephoned them—they did not respond. The take out of that is that more than half of the people that made up the figure claimed by the member for Lilley either acknowledged they were no longer eligible or failed to reply. Of the remainder, almost 7,000 customers continued to receive their health-care cards.</para><para>Is the member for Lilley saying to this parliament and to the Australian people that Centrelink should not review entitlements? Is he saying that the people who were getting the benefits and admitted that they were not entitled to them should continue to receive them? If that is what he is saying, what sort of management is that? It is classic Australian Labor Party rhetoric. I reject it, the government rejects it and I think the people of Australia will reject that view as well.</para><para>With regard to the measure on carer allowance in the bill before the House today, I have seen cases—as all members of parliament have—where people come to you and say, `We'd like to get a carer allowance because we are caring for an elderly relative,' and you find that in the fence between the property of, perhaps, their elderly parents—or of a next-door neighbour with whom they may have no family relationship—and their own property there is a gate and they provide care for those people next door. Yet they cannot get a carer allowance, even though they are providing the care. I have even seen cases where the carers were living in the same building but, because there was some independence for the person being cared for—that is, because there was no connecting door between the two residences and, to get from the carer's residence to where the person being cared for was living, you had to walk out the front door, go around the corner and walk up the stairs in the same building, they were not entitled to a carer's allowance. That is clearly silly and the government has recognised that. I am pleased to see that the Australian Labor Party recognises that this is a sensible measure that it will support. It is a measure that the government is pleased to put before the parliament.</para><para>I also note the rhetoric used by the member for Lilley with regard to the government's `long-term plan hidden in the bottom drawer' and the government's `cold-hearted approach' and all that sort of thing. Perhaps the member for Lilley ought to explain to the Australian people why the Australian Labor Party wants to get rid of the Medicare safety net. How can that be? Already more than half a million Australians are taking advantage of the Medicare safety net. The Medicare safety net is the mechanism whereby, if you are in receipt of some sort of concession card, if you are a child under 16 or if your medical expenses exceed $300 in one year, the government will rebate 80 per cent of your medical costs. Why would the Australian Labor Party want to take away that safety net? Remember that in relation to out-of-pocket expenses all of those people who are on the one Medicare card count, if they are all in the one family. If you are a family that does not qualify for a concession card, after an expenditure of $700 you get 80 per cent of your medical costs rebated. You can do that in one operation at a hospital these days. But the Australian Labor Party wants to dump that. Bring on the election! Let us put that to the Australian people and see what they think of the Australian Labor Party when that happens—and also the weird claims from the member for Lilley about Centrelink operations and this bill. </para><para>The government have also indicated that we are going to exempt all scholarships that pay tuition fees on a student's behalf or waive from the social security and veterans' affairs income tests all or part of such a student's tuition fee. A couple of thousand students are going to benefit from that, and so they should. I am pleased to see that the Australian Labor Party have said that they are going to support that measure as well. Make no mistake about it: the opposition will support this government legislation. They will say a number of things about the government's mean-spiritedness and then support the legislation. There is a message in that for the Australian people. I am very pleased to see these measures going through parliament this morning, and I will be pleased to see the Australian Labor Party's support for them.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>32066</page.no><name role="metadata">Hall, Jill, MP</name><name role="display">Ms HALL</name><name.id>83N</name.id><electorate>Shortland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The member for Herbert is right. We on this side of the House will be supporting the <inline ref="R2114">Family and Community Services and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (2004 Budget Measures) Bill 2004</inline>. We believe it is long overdue and I will talk about that in my speech. The government's record is appalling when it comes to supporting Australian families and Australian people in need, who rely on the government to give them support. It has a philosophy that if you need assistance from the government you are a second-class citizen. This has been reflected in various pieces of legislation that have gone through this parliament, through various statements made by ministers and through various actions that this government has taken during the time that it has been in power.</para></talk.start><para>Under the Howard government, the divide between those who have and those who have not has grown. In Australia today there are those who are extremely wealthy, who can afford to have the best of everything, and then there are those who struggle just to put bread on the table. In a country like Australia that is appalling. When a situation like that develops, it means that the government has failed. The Howard government has failed many hundreds of thousands of people in Australia and I think that is sad. Real people's lives are being affected; real people do not have the opportunities that they deserve and should expect.</para><para>This government has actively campaigned to make the lives of struggling Australian families, pensioners and the unemployed harder, with some of the most draconian measures that you can imagine. When we are faced with an election, this government seeks to buy the votes of Australian people. It has been a hallmark of the Howard government administration that throughout its term in government it has taken. After an election, it takes everything it can. It makes the lives of Australian people so hard. When an election is looming, it starts throwing little bribes at the Australian people and hoping that they will forget that it has made their lives so intolerable. </para><para>This bill is once again a last-minute attempt to turn the tide. It should have happened a lot earlier; it is something that you would have to welcome. The bill gives effect to the 2004 budget measures for the Department of Family and Community Services, which were detailed by the Treasurer when he presented the budget to this House. The bill amends schedule 1 of the Social Security Act 1991 and the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 to exempt fee waivers and fee-paying scholarships from the income tests for income support payments. Schedule 2 amends the Social Security Act 1991 to expand the eligibility criteria for carer allowance by allowing a new group of carers to qualify for carer allowance. This is something that will be welcomed by carers and something that has, once again, been long overdue. I will talk a little more about that in just a moment.</para><para>Currently, scholarships are required to be taken into account as income unless there is specific exemption from the income test for income support payments. The new measures introduced in the bill make the system a lot more workable and remove any penalty to those people who are receiving scholarships. It is my understanding that the exemption will benefit about 1,550 students at present, increasing to 2,200 students per year by 2008.</para><para>At present, to qualify for the carer allowance a carer is required to live with the person for whom they are providing care. I know that members on both sides of this House would have been approached by constituents who are providing full-time care for a relative or even a neighbour but who are not living in the same house. This has been a matter on which I have lobbied the government on many occasions. I know that my colleagues on this side of the House have also thought that this was something that needed to be changed.</para><para>As recently as last Friday I was visited by a constituent whose wife provides 12 hours of care a day to her elderly mother, who has not left her bedroom for two years. She has been confined to her bedroom for two years. She baths her; she feeds her; she also cares for her father. Yet she has been ineligible to receive the carer allowance. This measure will benefit her and it will benefit both her mother and father. In recent times her father has also become very frail and has developed dementia. He relies on his daughter for the support and care that will enable both him and his wife to live in their own home within the community.</para><para>Let us face it: that is what this is about. This is about ensuring that elderly people can remain in their homes rather than have to move into a residential facility. Without those carers who are prepared to visit, to cook, to care for people on a daily basis, elderly people would be forced to live in a residential facility. That would be a lot more expensive and it would be of greater cost to the Australian people than extending the carer allowance, as this legislation does. That is the reason that I believe this should have happened a long time ago.</para><para>Carers need a lot more than just the carer allowance. They need ongoing support. They need more community aged care packages. Currently there is a chronic shortage of community aged care packages. The government made an announcement recently of additional packages. These will not even touch the edges of what is needed in the area that I represent in this parliament. They are inadequate. If the government were serious about supporting carers it would ensure that there were enough of these packages and it would ensure that there were enough respite places. </para><para>Once again in the budget the government extended the period in which people could access respite. However, in my area you could extend respite to six months and people would still be unable to access it because the respite beds are not available. Whilst this is good legislation that demands support because it is going to benefit the Australian people, I feel that it does not go far enough. It does not really recognise the needs of those carers who rely on this government for support.</para><para>The member for Lilley mentioned the Centrelink review of the entitlement to carer allowance for parents of disabled children. Like most members of this House, I have been visited by constituents whose carer allowance has been stopped. A number of parents have been to see me who have children who suffer from intellectual disabilities and who are totally dependent on their parents. Their carer allowance was stopped. In some cases, after vigorous representation by my office we were able to turn that decision around, but the anxiety this caused families was enormous—anxiety and a process that they did not need to go through.</para><para>Recently I met a lady whose daughter is extremely disabled. Since the time she was born, this girl has gone through operation after operation. She requires daily assistance from her mother. She attends a normal high school, but without the medical and caring assistance she gets from her mother she would not be able to lead a normal life. The review form arrived and the boxes to tick did not correspond with this girl's disability. Therefore, the disability allowance was stopped. This lady is a single mother whose marriage broke up simply because of the stress placed on it by the disability this young girl has. This is a mother who is coping just to survive on a daily basis. She would probably fall into that group of 8,300 people mentioned by the member for Herbert who did not respond to the review. After receiving the letter, this lady was in such a total state of depression that she felt that she could not continue to fight to get this allowance. This lady spends more on aids for her daughter than she receives from the carer allowance.</para><para>There are some real issues affecting real people that this government is not facing up to. It is an absolute disgrace that, heading to an election, the government, finally, after eight years of inflicting pain on the Australian people, has decided to throw some pittances to carers, pittances such as $600, $1,000—one-off payments—which carers will willingly take because they know how hard their lives are. But the government really needs to provide ongoing, everyday—daily, weekly, monthly, yearly—support, not election-time bribes and election-time supports.</para><para>We have had the fiasco where families who incurred family tax benefit debts had $600 thrown at them in June by the government, with another $600 to be thrown at them after June. That will not fix the problem. The family tax benefit debts will continue to accumulate and families will continue to hurt. But we are heading to an election and they will not hurt until after the election. The government is throwing goodies at them now and will hurt them after the election. I do not think that that is the way a government should treat the people of Australia. I think the people of Australia deserve respect; they deserve a government that will provide them with ongoing support all of the time, not just at election time. </para><para>The member for Herbert mentioned the Medicare safety net. The Labor Party do not believe that there is a need for a Medicare safety net. We believe that Medicare should be strengthened, and we believe that all doctors should bulk-bill their patients. If doctors bulk-bill, you do not need a safety net. We are committed to Medicare and we are committed to all Australian people. The member for Herbert talked at some length about the disability pension. He went on to talk about people receiving the disability support pension and working as concreters. This only goes to denigrate all the people who receive disability support pensions. Before coming to this parliament, I used to work with people with disabilities—people who received the disability support pension—and there was nothing that they wanted more than to get back into the work force. You do not help people with disabilities return to the work force by denigrating them. You help people with disabilities return to the work force by putting in place the proper programs and supports they need to be able to find employment and maintain employment. I think the comments by the member for Herbert demonstrate the philosophy of this government. If somebody is down and out, if somebody is doing it hard, what do you do? You denigrate them. That is not good enough.</para><para>I go back to the question I asked at the beginning of my comments: why is the government introducing this legislation now? Why did it not introduce the legislation after the last election? The answer is simple. The government is introducing this legislation now to buy votes, just as it was trying to buy votes when it gave the $600 to people in receipt of family tax benefits and just as it was trying to buy votes with the $1,000 payments for people in receipt of the carer allowance and carer payments.</para><para>The Australian people want certainty and ongoing assistance, not election bribes that are given to them today and taken from them tomorrow. This is one of the most mean-spirited governments in Australia's history—a government that takes Australians for granted at all times other than when there is an election. The only time that this government really looks to the needs of average Australian people, people who are doing it hard, is when it wants them to vote for it. I have news for the government: Australians are beginning to understand how the Howard government works. They are beginning to understand that it is a government that gives to them before the election and takes from them after the election. I call on the government to make real changes for carers, to ensure that carers get the ongoing support that they need and not just stopgap, money-throwing bribes when there is going to be an election. Carers deserve better. All Australians deserve better. We want an Australian government that delivers to the Australian people all of the time, not just when an election is about to be called.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>32069</page.no><name role="metadata">Dutton, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DUTTON</name><name.id>00AKI</name.id><electorate>Dickson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise today to offer my very strong support for the <inline ref="R2114">Family and Community Services and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (2004 Budget Measures) Bill 2004</inline>. The measures contained in this bill are for two very important sectors of our community—sectors that were overlooked by Labor as they simply could not afford to provide them with these options due to their poor economic management and the huge Labor Party debt. The Howard government is pleased to be able to offer these changes to carers and students eligible for scholarships. I encourage Labor to pass these changes and to at least allow these groups options that were never afforded to them under the Labor Party government. Whilst they could not offer these options when in government, Labor now have the opportunity to make amends by simply passing this bill and recognising that these groups deserve this assistance. </para></talk.start><para>There are two schedules in this bill. The first, relating to scholarships, will exempt all scholarships that pay tuition fees on a student's behalf or waive all or part of a student's tuition fees from the social security and veterans' affairs income tests. Schedule 2 relates to the carer allowance and will expand the eligibility criteria for carer allowance by allowing a carer to be qualified if they provide certain care and attention for an adult with a disability even if they do not live with that adult.</para><para>One of the issues under the scholarships schedule is that currently some scholarships that pay part or all of student tuition fees are not exempt from social security or veterans' affairs income tests. This unfairly excludes a significant number of people from applying for this assistance and means that many are otherwise unable to pursue this study due to lack of financial assistance. This measure would exempt all scholarships that pay part or all of student tuition fees from social security and veterans' affairs income tests. It would allow more people the option of attending secondary education, vocational education and training, as well as higher education. This bill extends exemptions announced in December 2003 in which the Commonwealth learning scholarships and full fee-waiver scholarships provided by higher education institutions were made exempt from social security and veterans' affairs income tests. Measures will apply to secondary education, vocational education and training, and higher education sector scholarships. They will only apply to scholarships where fees or charges associated with courses are waived or institutions pay the fees on behalf of students. In both of these circumstances, the student has no discretion over the use of these funds. They will not apply to cash scholarships, which will still be assessed as income. If the government exempted all scholarships, then it would be possible for students with discretionary cash scholarships to be considerably better off than students earning the same amount of income from working.</para><para>Up to 1,550 students are expected to benefit from this measure, building up to 2,200 per year by 2008. This measure will encourage students who could not afford study without this assistance to continue or re-enter education programs. Students who receive this assistance may still work to pay for other costs associated with study. This will not hinder them from doing that. It will, however, substantially assist the majority of the financial burden associated with studies in the form of tuition fees.</para><para>The issues I want to discuss today under the carer allowance schedule are as follows. Firstly, currently carers must live with the person for whom they are providing care in order to receive the carer allowance. This measure is intended to recognise that people have different living arrangements, so it is not always possible or appropriate for the carer to live with the disabled adult. Secondly, it seeks to recognise that these carers still make a valuable and significant contribution to our community. Under this schedule, required care and attention is to be provided by the carer on a daily basis for a total of at least 20 hours per week. `Care and attention' relates to the provision of personal care and can include activities such as assisting the disabled adult with showering, dressing, feeding and mobility. These new measures for non co-resident carers mirror as closely as possible the arrangements currently in place for co-resident carers of adults with a disability. They do not apply to carers of children with a disability because requirements that a child with a disability be a dependent child of the carer would in almost all cases require the carer and the child to live together in a private home. </para><para>Co-resident carers currently caring for either an adult or a child with a disability will not be affected by these amendments. It is expected that approximately 13,270 non co-resident carers will benefit from this measure. The measure recognises that these carers take an unnecessary burden off other health care services and that if people are willing to undertake this responsibility the government quite rightly should provide them with assistance, as they are essentially helping the government by reducing numbers in other health care facilities.</para><para>The Howard government recognises the vital role that carers play in our society and will continue to support them. The Australian government provided carers with direct payments, including bonuses, that totalled over $1.8 billion in 2003-04. It is incredible when you recognise that that is an increase of 135 per cent since 1999-2000. Carer payments were provided to approximately 84,000 customers, at a cost of nearly $830 million, over the financial year 2003-04. Carer allowance was provided to nearly 300,000 customers, at a cost of almost three-quarters of a billion dollars, in 2003-04.</para><para>As part of this debate it is important to concentrate more specifically on some of the carer initiatives in the budget. This budget is no different from some of the previous budgets under this government where we have supported carers very directly. In this budget the government will spend an additional $461 million on carers. The budget's carer package recognises the wide diversity of carers, their various care situations, the range of care needs and the long-term commitment of many carers. The government have been working hard to bring forward the changes to the carer allowance announced in the budget. These changes were originally to take effect from 1 April next year but will now commence, subject to the passage of this legislation, from 1 September 2004. This will ensure that carers can benefit from these changes at the earliest possible date. The changes will mean that from 1 September 2004 the carer allowance will be available to eligible carers who do not live with the person for whom they provide substantial levels of personal care on a daily basis. Over 13,000 carers will benefit from this measure, at an estimated cost of almost $107 million over four years.</para><para>What of the previous carer initiatives under the Howard government? The National Respite for Carers Program is a Howard government initiative. Funding for this program has increased more than fivefold since 1996-97 to an estimated $105 million in 2004-05. It is a very important point to make. It is an important distinction to make as part of this debate because, despite the ramblings of some of those members opposite about their care for people who are in many cases in very desperate circumstances, this government is the one that has proven—in stark contrast to the benefits that were provided under the previous Labor government—that it cares very sincerely for carers and for people suffering from disabilities and will continue to make its commitment to those people. The National Respite for Carers Program now funds over 90 Commonwealth carer respite centres and other outlets around the nation. There are over 100 respite services specifically targeted at carers of people with dementia, over 300 other respite services to help carers and a Commonwealth carer resource centre in every state and territory capital city to help carers obtain the information and support that they need.</para><para>The 2002-03 budget provided carers with an additional $80 million over four years. That was for respite care and other assistance, including assistance with dementia care. Since 1996 the Howard government have made significant beneficial legislative changes to carer payments and the carer allowance which include: extending carer payment eligibility to carers of profoundly disabled children under 16 years of age; extending carer payment eligibility to carers of two or more disabled children who together require a level of care that is at least equivalent to the level of care required by a single child with a profound disability; and increasing the permitted hours of work and educational training et cetera from 10 to 20 hours per week, without the loss of carer payment eligibility. We have extended carer allowance eligibility to carers who do not live with the person for whom they provide substantial levels of personal care on a daily basis. Importantly, we have introduced two new, simpler and more objective assessment tools—firstly, the adult disability assessment tool, to assess eligibility for carer payment and carer allowance in respect of adults and, secondly, the child disability assessment tool, to assess eligibility for carer allowance in relation to children. </para><para>The lists of recognised disabilities for children under 16 years of age were introduced in July 1998. They are important because they have helped to assess eligibility for carer allowance in relation to children. If a child has a disability cited on these lists, their parent or carer will receive carer allowance, without the need for further assessment, until the child is aged 16 years. The National Family Carers Voice was established in August 2003, for two years, to provide the government with advice on family carer issues. The National Family Carers Voice will provide more detailed information about the needs of carers and the types of assistance they require to make their caring role more effective and more sustainable.</para><para>Since coming to office this government have provided a significant boost to funding support for carers. In the 2004-05 budget we have further demonstrated our commitment to carers. We are, as is a matter of public record, only a matter of weeks or months away from the general election for 2004. It is important, as part of all debates on Commonwealth expenditure, to examine the record of this government and how it stands in complete contrast to the financial mishaps of the Labor Party—not just when they were in government but when the current Leader of the Opposition was the mayor of Liverpool. Both of the measures that we have discussed today are possible only because of the excellent financial management shown by this government over the last 8½ years. This government have continually delivered surpluses and at the same time have continued to reduce the substantial debt which Labor left the Australian taxpayer.</para><para>When we came to government in 1996, there was $96 billion in government debt—Labor Party debt of $96 billion. With the excellent financial management of this government, we have successfully reduced it to around $25 billion. The important take-out of all that is the fact that this government now save, on a per annum basis, approximately $6 billion a year in interest payments that Labor would otherwise be making and that we can now make to services such as education and health and to carers. It is important to note today—and the Australian people should realise the significance of these figures—that, as a debt per person, each Australian was left with a debt of about $5,200 under Labor when we came to government in 1996. Remarkably, over the last nine years, because of the sound financial management of the Howard government, we have been able to reduce that to around $1,200 per person. It is a significant effort, and it is one that the government should be commended on and that every Australian should recognise. </para><para>It is also important to note that the reduction in this debt has not been at the expense of services to the Australian public, because the Howard government have also delivered record unemployment levels, maintained at under six per cent. In my own electorate of Dickson unemployment is now at 3.2 per cent—an incredible low. National unemployment levels are at 23-year lows. We have delivered to the Australian people home loan interest rates which have been reduced to 30-year lows. Inflation is now at 2.6 per cent. It was double that under Labor at 5.2 per cent, which provided upward pressure on interest rates. We have helped increase all sorts of benefit and support to small business. Most significantly, we have cut overdraft rates from 20½ per cent and higher under Labor to under nine per cent under this government. Overall economic management has meant that economic growth in this country has averaged 3.6 per cent.</para><para>Measures provided under this bill are possible because of this government's successful financial management. These measures are assisting groups in our community that, because of their huge debt, Labor could never afford to help and never did help. I ask the opposition to show support for this very important legislation today, to provide support to those most in need of it and to support this government in its ongoing reform of the Australian economy, which has delivered so much to the Australian people. For those reasons, I commend this bill to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>32073</page.no><name role="metadata">Pyne, Chris, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PYNE</name><name.id>9V5</name.id><electorate>Sturt</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Family and Community Services</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—At the outset, I thank those members of the House who have taken part in the debate on the <inline ref="R2114">Family and Community Services and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (2004 Budget Measures) Bill 2004</inline>, with varying degrees of success: the member for Lilley, with his usual style; the member for Shortland; and the members for Herbert and Dickson on the government side, who were both erudite and lucid in their support for the government legislation, which does two things. This bill gives effect to two beneficial family and community services and veterans' affairs 2004 budget measures that require legislation. One is the scholarship measure; the second is the carer allowance.</para></talk.start><para>The scholarships measure exempts all fee-pay and fee-waiver scholarships from the social security and veterans' affairs income tests. This measure will assist students receiving those scholarships in the secondary, vocational education and training and higher education sectors. Approximately 1,550 students are already benefiting from this measure through ex gratia payments, and it is expected that this number will increase to 2,200 students per year by 2008.</para><para>The carer allowance measure allows a carer to be qualified for the carer allowance if they provide certain care for an adult with a disability, even if they do not live with that adult. This beneficial measure allows carers and the people they care for to choose the living arrangements that best suit their particular circumstances, without requiring them to live in the same home. This measure recognises the valuable and significant contribution that these carers make to the community and is expected to assist over 13,000 additional carers from September 2004.</para><para>On a personal note, I particularly recommend the second aspect of this bill, which is of course to allow carers to no longer reside with the person for whom they are caring. Many members, particularly those from Tasmania, may well remember the case of Shirley Jordan and Harry Belbin. Harry Belbin is a disabled person. Shirley Jordan is his sister, who continues to care for him and has since 1984. In 1984, the then Minister for Health, Dr Neal Blewett, gave her an ex gratia pension. Under the review of carer allowances, that pension was taken away from her about three years ago. She applied for an ex gratia payment. That matter came to me as the parliamentary secretary responsible for family and community services, who deals with ex gratia payments. Looking at the case, I determined that she should have an ex gratia payment made to her because of what was almost a case of estoppel that had been created through the 18 or 20 years that she had been paid a pension, only to have it taken away from her. I think that case highlighted the anomaly that had existed in the law for a long time about carers who were doing all the things that carers do to look after a particular individual but who, because they did not reside with that particular individual, were not able to access the carer allowance. </para><para>I travelled to Burnie in Tasmania to see Shirley Jordan and Harry Belbin. I went with Senator Richard Colbeck, the very fine Liberal senator from Tasmania who represents the north-west of that great state. I met with Shirley Jordan and Harry Belbin in their homes some months before the government announced this measure in the budget. I was delighted to have been able to help Shirley Jordan and Harry Belbin. I believe that the case that Shirley Jordan pressed for some time was one of the main word pictures that demonstrated to people that a system in which a carer lived with the person they were caring for might in many cases be appropriate but was not the only system that was capable of being good for the person who was being cared for and the person who was doing the caring. I am particularly delighted with that measure. I commend the Family and Community Services and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (2004 Budget Measures) Bill 2004 to the House.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para><para>Message from the Governor-General recommending appropriation announced.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>32074</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Mr PYNE (Sturt—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Family and Community Services) (12.00 p.m.)—by leave—I move:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a third time.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a third time.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ANTI-TERRORISM BILL (NO. 3) 2004</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>32074</page.no><id.no>R2124</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>32074</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 24 June, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ruddock</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>32074</page.no><name role="metadata">McClelland, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McCLELLAND</name><name.id>JK6</name.id><electorate>Barton</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank the Attorney-General for coming into the House. I will be brief in terms of my comments on this bill, which reproduces what were formerly schedules 1, 2 and 5 of the <inline ref="R2107">Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2004</inline>, which was brought into the House shortly before the last recess. The House will recall that schedule 1 dealt with foreign travel documents, schedule 2 dealt with the surrender of passports and the restriction of movement of persons in the context of ASIO issuing a questioning warrant under ASIO's powers to investigate potential terrorist situations, and schedule 5 dealt with forensic identification of victims of mass casualty incidents. I have already spoken in some detail on the provisions of these measures as contained in the <inline ref="R2124">Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 3) 2004</inline> when I made my contribution to the second reading debate on the <inline ref="R2124">Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2004</inline>. As I said, my remarks will be relatively brief with respect to these measures, which not essentially although in actuality replicate what was in the <inline ref="R2124">Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2004.</inline></para></talk.start><para>Since the <inline ref="">Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2004</inline><inline ref=""></inline><inline ref="">was </inline>introduced into the House, the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee has had an opportunity to receive submissions and hear evidence on these provisions which are now included in the <inline ref="">Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 3) 2004</inline> as well. I understand that the committee is due to report tomorrow. It is worth noting that the committee received around 93 submissions, which is indicative of the high level of community interest in applying scrutiny to legislation of this kind. I commented on this previously.</para><para>It is worth noting that, while schedules 1 and 2 attracted significant comment and scrutiny in a large number of submissions, only three submissions were received in respect of schedule 5, which deals with the forensic information in the event of a catastrophe occurring in Australia. Those three submissions were brief emails and their comments were essentially bland statements such as, `Concerns about schedule 5 intruding into the privacy of citizens.'</para><para>With respect to those who made such submissions, it is appropriate that they read the background to schedule 5 and in particular its recommendation that these measures were necessary to deal with an event which none of us wants to occur on Australian shores but which was identified in the Sherman report as a matter of urgency. Indeed, concerns about intrusion into the privacy of citizens have been firmly rebutted by the former Federal Privacy Commissioner, who is active in his protection of the interests of the privacy of Australian citizens. He, in fact, joined in the urgent recommendation of the Sherman committee for the amendments in schedule 5 to be made as soon as possible.</para><para>Again, without overly gloating, the way these submissions and concerns have been relayed to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee does suggest that Labor was correct in suggesting that schedule 5 be hived off into a separate bill so that it could have been passed expeditiously in the last parliament—certainly prior to the intrusion of any election. As it has turned out, that should be achieved should this legislation proceed speedily, as we are prepared to cooperate during the course of these two weeks.</para><para>I should comment, in fairness to him, on the commentator in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> who wrote an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Telegraph</inline>—that famous or infamous political commentator, Piers Akerman. He got stuck into me as well as others about supporting the reference of these sorts of matters to the committee process. But when you are talking about concerns and the whole matrix of the need for tighter security measures and the impact that they have on civil liberties, it is just better all round if people have the opportunity to voice their concerns and those concerns are addressed by a parliamentary committee—or at least noted by a parliamentary committee—recommending, if appropriate, measures to address those concerns. If they find those concerns are without substance they note that fact but, when it comes to the balance between the need for tighter security in the community and concerns of civil liberties, you cannot go past the whole concept of participatory democracy that our committee system facilitates. Insofar as I respond to Piers Akerman and probably regret giving his name notoriety in regard to some matters raised by him, I thought I should put a countervailing argument to the one which he advanced last Sunday.</para><para>In fact, the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee has been a first-rate committee of the parliament. I congratulate all members of that committee from both sides of the House. They genuinely approach complex and at times emotive issues in a very balanced and constructive way. I believe they genuinely seek to achieve an outcome that is in the national interest rather than to pursue any party political agenda. I believe it has provided tremendous service to the Australian people in how it has incorporated the appropriate balance that is often needed when we are addressing bills of this nature. </para><para>Finally, I should note that when the Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2004, which I have referred to, was introduced into the House the Minister for Foreign Affairs introduced the <inline ref="R2116">Australian Passports Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2113">Australian Passports (Transitionals and Consequentials) Bill 2004</inline> at about the same time. Those bills clearly interact with the passport provisions in the current bill, particularly in schedule 1, but they raise somewhat different issues. In fact, the passports bill introduced by the foreign minister has been supported by both sides of parliament during the course of debate this morning. As a result of a mechanism in the consequential provisions, and with its passage and the passage of the Australian Passports Bill, I understand that schedule 1 will be automatically hived off into a separate piece of legislation. That mechanism seems to be effective and innovative and it is a measure that the opposition can support.</para><para>In summary, we are supporting the passage of the measures contained in the Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 3). We expect, at least with respect to some aspects of schedules 1 or 2, that the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee may make recommendations when it hands down its report tomorrow. Given the praise that I have bestowed on that committee, we will certainly look closely at any recommendations that it may make on areas in which the bill could potentially be improved or enhanced. We will have the opportunity to address those matters in the Senate, but I can again indicate to the Attorney-General and the parliament that the opposition will cooperate with the expeditious passage of these measures.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>32076</page.no><name role="metadata">Dutton, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DUTTON</name><name.id>00AKI</name.id><electorate>Dickson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is with a great deal of pleasure that I rise to strongly support the <inline ref="R2124">Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 3) 2004</inline> before the House. At the outset I acknowledge the very gracious comments of the member for Barton about the wise counsel offered to him by Piers Akerman and heeded by him. It is always good to see a little bit of recognition of the right way of thinking in this country and it certainly could not go astray in deliberations by the Australian Labor Party on some of the important measures before the House at the moment. Piers Akerman has plenty to say about the Labor Party in relation to these matters. It is no wonder that the member for Barton is sensitive about some of the writings of Mr Akerman, because I think Piers Akerman in many ways provides an objective outlook and review of the Australian Labor Party's ideological opposition to some of these very wise provisions put forward by the government. It is only right that the member for Barton has acknowledged the areas from which he has drawn inspiration in arriving at his decision to support this bill today.</para></talk.start><para>I am very proud to be a member of this strong Howard government. The Howard government remain willing and ready to stand up to terrorists. We are a government that will not be blackmailed or coerced into backing down in our ongoing fight against terrorism. As a government we must remain committed in our fight towards making Australia a safer place for all Australians for generations to come. Following the horrific events of September 11 and, closer to home, the Bali tragedy, our security has been under threat like never before from terrorist organisations for no reason other than the fact that we enjoy a Western way of life—a way of life that enables us to express our religious beliefs without persecution, a way of life that encourages all citizens to work in their chosen profession, regardless of race, sex or age, and a way of life that this government must protect for future generations. It is a way of life that this government strongly believe all Australians are entitled to and a way of life that we must seek to guard from terrorists at any cost. The recent heightened terror alert for key financial institutions in the United States is a stark reminder that the threat of terrorism is constant and very real in our society, and makes it even more important to Australia's national security that this bill is passed. This government will do whatever is necessary to prevent terrorism from reaching our shores, and I ask that the opposition join us today in this endeavour by voting for this bill. </para><para>The purpose of this bill is to revise Australia's counterterrorism framework through amending three Commonwealth statutes: firstly, the Passports Act 1938, which will give authorities certain powers to demand, confiscate and seize foreign passports; secondly, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979, which will give ASIO powers to demand the surrender of Australian and foreign passports in certain circumstances; and, thirdly, the Crimes Act 1914, which will be amended to facilitate effective disaster victim identification and criminal investigation in the event of a mass casualty incident within this country.</para><para>Since 2001 this government has pledged more than $3.1 billion for national security. In this year's budget alone the government provided an additional $775 million over five years to further counter the threat of terrorism in Australia. Inclusive in this is $270 million to increase our ability to gather intelligence and identify possible threats to our country; $207 million to upgrade protective security, including air security officers at airports; $150 million to help secure Australia's borders; and $87 million to develop our Australian Federal Police presence outside Australia, in surrounding regions. As a government we are committed to making Australia safer for all and we will spend the necessary amount of money to do this effectively.</para><para>I want first to turn to the issues under the Passports Act 1938 and the reason for the government moving to make amendments. The misuse of foreign travel documents is often associated with terrorist and criminal activity. At present, many people hold both Australian and foreign passports. As the law currently stands, authorities are only entitled to confiscate Australian passports. It is therefore essential that law enforcement and security authorities have the power to seize all documents that would facilitate a person's departure from Australia's jurisdiction. It would be ridiculous for someone to get out of the country where authorities have confiscated the Australian passport but not the foreign passport. That is a loophole that this bill seeks to amend.</para><para>These new provisions will also assist with international law enforcement and security cooperation. These amendments relating to foreign travel documents do not have extraterritorial jurisdiction—that is, competent authorities and the minister will have power to act only in circumstances where the person is in Australia. In addition, in circumstances where a person's foreign travel documents are seized, there is nothing to prevent the country that issued those documents from requesting their return.</para><para>The second issue I want to discuss relates to the amendments sought to the ASIO Act 1979. It is important that persons who have vital information in relation to terrorist activity are not able to leave this country before being questioned by the appropriate security authorities. Amendments under this bill will give ASIO the power to demand that a person surrender their Australian and foreign passports if the person is subject to a request for consent to apply for a questioning warrant. This will prevent a person who may have vital information about a planned terrorist attack from fleeing this country before being questioned. However, this power to demand the surrender of a person's passports and for them to be questioned will only be available where it is reasonably believed that the person might have vital information in relation to terrorist activity. It would only be exercised if the person attempts to leave Australia or there is a concern that the person may attempt to leave the country. </para><para>This bill will also create new offences under the ASIO Act for failure to comply with a demand for the surrender of a person's passport and for leaving Australia when a person is subject to a request for consent to apply for a questioning warrant. Such measures would enable ASIO to better protect Australian citizens from terrorism but would still protect the rights of the individual.</para><para>The third area that we seek amendment to is the Crimes Act 1914. The amendments to the Crimes Act are being made to address concerns that existing forensic legislation may be inadequate to facilitate effective disaster victim identification if, tragically, a mass casualty incident were to occur within Australia. Our experience from the Bali disaster shows that in mass casualty incidents the forensic services of the Commonwealth, states and territories will need to work together to ensure that disaster victim identification occurs as quickly as possible. This bill would extend the operation of laws that were passed to deal with the Bali disaster so that they can be applied to a wide variety of potential incidents that may occur within Australia. Should such a tragedy ever occur on Australian soil it is imperative that measures are in place for Commonwealth, state and territory authorities to be able to work together effectively. This will make the process more efficient and less traumatic for victims' families.</para><para>I want to turn now to some comments that were made by the Labor Party's member for Barton yesterday about the Attorney-General's announcement of some very important funding. It was humorous to see some of the comments made by the member for Barton in his press release regarding the government's alleged `phoney announcement', as he calls it, of over $6 million as our commitment to the national security hotline. The member for Barton knows—he is not a stupid person; he must know and surely he would know, if he had taken the time to read the budget appropriation statements for the past two years—that this is new money.</para><para>The Labor Party should be the one to speak with conviction about dressing up old policies as new initiatives, because we on this side of the House know the famous policy of the Labor Party in relation to the coastguard! It is not something that the Labor Party like to talk about, despite the fact that they have reannounced the policy on no fewer than four separate occasions now. They do not like to go into the detail of it, because they know that as a policy it is an insult to the Australian people, it is an insult to the Australian Navy, it is an insult to the Australian Customs Service and it is an insult to anybody who has any legitimate concern as part of this debate.</para><para>When their coastguard policy was first announced in 2001, Labor estimated that it would cost $895 million. After the election, the ever incredibly successful Simon Crean announced the revised, cheaper version at $612 million over four years—a snappy reduction of $280-odd million. Mark Latham—the champion of flip-flop policy, one of the most incapable leaders the Labor Party have ever put forward and a person incapable of making a decisive decision in this country's national interest, as we see now on a daily basis—has again changed this policy. Since then, the homeland security spokesman has announced that it has had a further revised estimate, to now cost just $450 million. It must be put on the public record today that the Labor Party have no idea about the issues of homeland security, national security and border protection when they put forward this joke of a policy. </para><para>We see at the moment that the Leader of the Opposition is incapable of making a decision in the national economic interest of this country in the procrastination he shows on a daily basis concerning the free trade agreement. It is a demonstration of how dangerous Mark Latham would be as Prime Minister of this country, and it does not stop there. If you look at the track record of the member for Werriwa, now the Leader of the Opposition and the possible alternative to the Prime Minister for the leadership of this country, it does not stop there. It does not stop at Latham's threat to economic security; it certainly extends to Labor's threat to national security.</para><para>Labor have shown in recent years how weak they have been in relation to border protection. They have shown, through both their public comment and certainly their private deliberations with the left who have a stranglehold on the Labor Party, the fact that they have not been able to commit to good strong policies that this government has committed to, legislated for and fought hard to protect, not just in this place but also in the other place, to ensure that the long-term interests of the Australian people are protected. This debate today demonstrates that all of the threat that exists at the moment—all of the serious threat that faces our country and Western civilisation—can never be contemplated by the Labor Party because they are incapable of dealing with the issues and putting forward the measures that would protect the interests of this country.</para><para>Over the last seven years this government has sought to provide Australia, as I said, with national security, economic strength and social stability. When the Howard government came to power, Australia's national security had been left in a neglected state by the Labor Party, with a run-down Defence Force. Since 1996 a plan has been in place to rebuild our Defence Force, initially protecting defence from budget cuts in 1996 and since then providing the biggest sustained increase in defence funding in 20 years. Inclusive in this was the government's swift actions to decisively strengthen Australia's counterterrorism capabilities after terror attacks in the US and Bali. Since September 11 new resources and capabilities have been provided across government. An additional $3.2 billion has been committed to national security and border protection. As I said before, importantly, it includes $870 million for our intelligence agencies. The Howard government's record of achievement in security measures is second to none. It has doubled ASIO's budget since September 11, with more than $131 million over four years. More than $50 million over four years has been provided for the protection of critical infrastructure, and more than $29 million of that is for security. More than $50 million over five years was announced prior to the last budget to establish the national threat assessment, bringing together agencies in assessing terror threat intelligence.</para><para>The Howard government have secured our borders against terrorist suspects as best we can. We must recognise that that is a vital weapon in our fight against terrorism and has both domestic and international implications. The government are not interested in letting terrorists enter Australia and we are also not interested in exporting terrorists who are then free to pursue their deadly ambitions in other countries. This bill provides practical measures that will further enhance the capacity of our intelligence and security agencies to investigate and hopefully prevent any tragic terrorist activity in this country. These measures are also non-controversial amendments that should be passed as a matter of priority. This bill is the first security bill not to be referred to a Senate committee and I would encourage the opposition not to delay it. It is time for the opposition to recognise that Australia's security is a priority over party politics. It is a priority over the loony left of the Labor Party dictating on these matters. I urge the Leader of the Opposition to use this as an opportunity to show that he may have some indication of strength of leadership. I urge him on that basis to pass this bill. On that basis I commend this bill to the House. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>32080</page.no><name role="metadata">Danby, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DANBY</name><name.id>WF6</name.id><electorate>Melbourne Ports</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The honourable member for Barton has outlined with great clarity the opposition's position on the <inline ref="R2124">Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 3) 2004</inline>. Since the events of 11 September 2001 and the Bali bombings of October 2002, Labor have consistently supported security related legislation on a bipartisan basis because we believe that these issues should not be a matter of party politics. I hope the previous speaker, the member for Dickson, notes what is actually done rather than his own rhetoric.</para></talk.start><para>That is why I found it a bit disappointing to see the Attorney-General adopting what I considered a bit of a high-handed tone when referring to the opposition's position on this bill. In his second reading speech the Attorney-General said of the honourable member for Barton:</para><quote><para>... I caution him that the importance or urgency of national security matters is not dependent on the Labor Party's assessment of what is important or urgent.</para><para>I take my advice on what is in the national interest from our intelligence and law enforcement agencies.</para></quote><para>Labor have not disputed that these bills are based on the advice which the minister gets from the security services. We support them for that reason, despite what is widely perceived across the Western world as the informed misperception of the security agencies—as Ken Pollack has called it—about the war in Iraq as evidenced by the Flood inquiry, the Butler inquiry and the US Senate inquiry. We support, as I have said, the contents of this bill for the reason that it is suggested by the experts in the security services, not because the minister tells us to.</para><para>We are the opposition. We are in a different position and have different political views from him and the government. We will work in the national interests of Australia, but we simply cannot be asked to take on trust what the Attorney-General says. We prefer the advice of security professionals. Advice from the government that brought us the children overboard scandal et cetera might be considered political advice and no-one in their right mind would expect any opposition to accept it. It is the right and responsibility of the opposition to make its own judgments on all legislation before this parliament, and that is what we continue to do. Since the minister spent 13 years in opposition, I am sure he understands that quite well. We have taken some criticism from some people on the left over our stance on this terrorism bill and from the loony right. In my electorate there have been quite laughable attacks on me from the loony LaRouchites because of Labor's support for this bill. We have not budged.</para><para>A Labor government will continue to take a stand against terrorism and those who cooperate with terrorists, as I am sure the Australian public noticed when the Leader of the Opposition gave his response about how Australia under a Latham government would react if it found itself in a similar situation to that of the Philippines, with hostages taken in Iraq. I think that was the appropriate way to respond, without denigrating what other countries—which are allies and regional neighbours of Australia—do. I am sure that in the future the government, if it remains in government, will have the support of opposition parties, and I hope that we would have their support in dealing with these matters. </para><para>Labor will also of course maintain its longstanding concern for the civil liberties of all Australians. With these bills and with antiterrorist legislation so far—and there is a great deal of work that has been put into this, particularly by Senator Faulkner and people in the Senate—we do not believe that civil liberties and security are incompatible. However, in the wake of the Bali bombing, Australians understand the nature of the threat that we face from terrorism and accept that bills such as the one we have before us—provided they are based on professional advice and are given careful parliamentary scrutiny—are in their interests.</para><para>Today I want to discuss some of the events and individuals that lie behind this legislation and that, unfortunately, make these bills necessary. In October 2002, the Indonesia-based terrorist organisation Jemaah Islamiah, the local franchise of al-Qaeda, carried out the Bali bombings, killing 88 Australians amongst the 202 victims. Two of those killed lived in my electorate. We now know that the mastermind and instigator of this atrocity was Abu Bakar Bashir, the Indonesian Islamic cleric. Bashir received a short prison sentence for plotting to overthrow the Indonesian government but has never been charged in relation to the Bali bombing.</para><para>I have previously praised General Pastika, the Indonesian police and courts—as I think all sensible Australians have—for the speed with which they captured those actually responsible for that murderous attack on our countrymen and women. It is unfortunate that the Indonesian authorities under President Megawati have shown little enthusiasm for prosecuting the man who actually ordered the bombing. The evidence we have of that is very interesting testimony in the trial of Jack Roche, which I urge all people who are seriously interested in this issue to have a look at.</para><para>It is pleasing to see that Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, who resigned from the cabinets of both Wahid and Megawati because he believed that their response to the terrorist threat to Indonesian democracy was not strong enough, is now the frontrunner for the Indonesian presidential election. It is up to the Indonesian people, obviously, who they elect, but—to quote in another context the famous words of Margaret Thatcher about Mikhail Gorbachev—Mr Yudhoyono is a man who Australia can do business with. His prospects give us some hope that some time in the near future we may see Abu Bakar Bashir brought to justice. That would greatly benefit the long-suffering people of Indonesia, who do not want to see these horrors take place in their country, which is economically reviving at the moment. The Bashir gang are the worst thing possible for the future of Indonesia.</para><para>It is not just a matter for Indonesia, however. In the Perth criminal court in May, Australians were given absolutely undeniable evidence that terrorist attacks in Australia had been planned and that Abu Bakar Bashir is the man who had been planning them. This evidence has come from an unimpeachable source, namely one of Bashir's Australian operatives, Mr Jack Roche, known to his friends as Jihad Jack. Halfway through his trial on charges that he conspired with others to blow up the Israeli embassy here in Canberra, Roche changed his plea to guilty. He also acknowledged that he planned to assassinate a leading Australian businessman who lives in my electorate, Joseph Gutnick. I was at the wedding of the daughter of Mr and Mrs Gutnick on Monday night, and there was still a great deal of alarm about the kinds of attacks that these kinds of people were proposing to make in Australia and at the fact that they could attract a light sentence. Roche was sentenced to nine years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 4½ years. I thought this was an inadequate sentence for a man who voluntarily entered into a conspiracy to destroy an embassy in the heart of Canberra with a truck bomb. Therefore, I wrote in measured terms to the Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr Damian Bugg QC, asking him to consider an appeal against this sentence. I am pleased that he has now done so and is appealing Roche's light sentence. </para><para>Unfortunately, Roche is not the only Australian who has been foolish enough to travel to Pakistan or Afghanistan to be trained in how to carry out terrorist attacks. We also have the cases of David Hicks and Mamdouh Habib, two Australians who are currently paying for their folly at Guantanamo Bay. I do not believe that most Australians sympathise with the current attempts to glamorise Hicks or to portray him as a martyr or a political prisoner, as some of his lawyers and media boosters have sought to do. The documentary <inline font-style="italic">The President versus David Hicks</inline> that screened on SBS television recently sought to glamorise Hicks. I am sure that the relatives or friends of the 88 Australians killed in Bali do not share the sentiments of that film.</para><para>It is important for this House to understand that Hicks, in my view, was no naive innocent who was duped into travelling to Afghanistan. He said in letters to his father, quoted in the film, that his reason for training with al-Qaeda was so that `the Western-Jewish domination is finished, so we can live under Muslim law again'. It would appear from his own words that he has a very hardline position and is opposed to the kind of pluralist democracy we have in Australia.</para><para>Let me make it clear that I believe that, as Australian citizens, Hicks and Habib are entitled to justice—not the kind of fundamentalist justice that al-Qaeda would inflict on Australia if it had the chance—but they are not entitled also to be lionised as heroes and martyrs. They are entitled to be treated in a humane way at Guantanamo Bay. We want their trials to be brought forward as quickly as possible. We must ensure that the Australian government sees that they are treated in a humane way. However, in my view, no Australian who values the pluralist, tolerant democracy that we have built in this country, which al-Qaeda would like to destroy, should have any sympathy for them.</para><para>We have a number of other recent cases of people who have been accused of being foolishly involved with terrorist activities. One is Bilal Khazal of Sydney, who is wanted in Lebanon for allegedly financing a terrorist attack in a north Lebanese town and blowing up a McDonald's outlet in that town. It has also been suggested by credible sources that he is a high-level al-Qaeda sympathiser and in contact with their operatives overseas. Recently, Faheem Khalid Lodhi has been charged in Sydney with planning a terrorist attack on what has been named only as `a major infrastructure facility'. He is apparently linked to the man who left Australia, Willie Brigitte, who is from Lashkar-e-Taiba, another organisation that the opposition has joined with the government in proscribing as a terrorist organisation. In passing, I am sure I do not need to remind the Attorney-General—who should understand that the opposition has been supportive of his government over security matters—that it was his government that allowed Brigitte to leave Australia, when in my view he should be on trial in this country for planning terrorist attacks here. In Perth we also had the brothers Abdul Rahman Ayub and Abdur Ahaman Ayub, who operated a terrorist support organisation called Darul Islam and who apparently invited Abu Bakar Bashir to Australia. The Ayub brothers, originally from Lakemba in Sydney, have fled Australia. </para><para>It is obvious that all these people are `Islamists'. I use that word very carefully. These are people who misuse a great monotheistic religion for political purposes. This is no criticism of the great religion of Islam. With the exceptions of Roche and Hicks, they are immigrants to Australia from Islamic countries. We are frequently told that we must not scapegoat the Arab and Islamic communities in Australia by associating them with terrorism in an indiscriminate way. This is of course true, and in my view neither I nor anyone else on this side of the House has been guilty of doing so and, to the best of my knowledge, I have not observed people on the government side doing so to date. We should all be very careful to distinguish between Islamists—people who misuse Islam for political purposes and for their fanatical ends—and the vast majority of Muslims, including Australian Muslims. The great majority of Australians who have migrated here from Islamic countries are peaceful and law-abiding people who have no desire but to live in peace, practise their religion and enjoy the same rights and freedoms as other Australians.</para><para>I have to say, however, that certain statements have tended to foster suspicions in the minds of non-Muslim Australians, giving ammunition to ignorant people who wish to scapegoat Australian Muslims. Those statements are the ones made by one particular self-appointed leader of the Australian Islamic community, and he is Sheikh Taj el-Din Al Hilaly, the Imam of the Lakemba Mosque in Sydney. He has a long record of statements which appear to be bigoted and condone terrorism. In February this year, Sheikh Hilaly gave a sermon at a mosque in Sidon, Lebanon, in which, according to a translation supplied by the Australian Embassy in Beirut—the Australian Embassy, not some other organisation—he said:</para><quote><para>Sons of Islam, there is a war of infidels taking place everywhere. The true man is the boy who opposes Israeli tanks with strength and faith. The boy who, despite his mother's objections, goes out to war to become a martyr like his elder brother. The boy who tells his mother: `Oh mother, don't cry for me if I die. Oh mother, Jihad has been imposed on me and I want to become a martyr.'</para></quote><para>In that statement Sheikh Hilaly is praising organisations like al-Qaeda, Hamas and Hezbollah, which promote and carry out suicide bombings in Iraq, Israel and recently Turkey. They send out teenagers and children of other people, not their own children, to blow themselves up with explosives, and in doing so they kill large numbers of innocent civilians.</para><para>If young Australian Muslims like the deluded young man Zak Mallah hear their religious leaders speaking in these terms, is it surprising that a few of them may be sufficiently influenced to want to go down the same path as suicide bombers in other parts of the world? We do not want this kind of incitement here in Australia. Sheikh Hilaly said:</para><quote><para>Don't be surprised if one day you hear the Muezzin calling for prayer ... from the top of the White House. September 11 is God's work against oppressors. Some of the things that happen in the world cannot be explained; a civilian airplane whose secrets cannot be explained if we ask its pilot who reached his objective without error, who led your steps? Or if we ask the giant that fell, who humiliated you? Or if we ask the President, who made you cry? God is the answer. </para></quote><para>So here we have a man who should be much more responsible. He puts himself forward as a spiritual leader in Australia's largest city, at the head of a fast growing community of Australians—a community which runs schools in which young Australians are educated—and he thinks that the terrorist massacre of September 11 was God's work against oppressors. I think it was a political act by a deluded group of fanatics, and I do not think that any spiritual leader of any denomination should apologise for or incite on behalf of these people. I would like Sheikh Hilaly to explain these inflammatory remarks to the families of the Bangladeshi Muslim kitchen workers who were killed in the World Trade Centre on September 11.</para><para>I contrast Sheikh Hilaly's words with the conciliatory words of many Muslim leaders in Australia, including Yasser Soliman of the Islamic Council of Victoria, Sheikh Fehmi of the Preston mosque and other people in the Muslim community in Australia who take a much more responsible stand. They do not want to be stereotyped or scapegoated as sympathisers with terrorism, but they have a dilemma and, with great respect, I point out to them that, if the words and actions of Sheikh Hilaly continue, they tend to embarrass their entire community. I have noticed that when Sheikh Hilaly has been interviewed by <inline font-style="italic">Four Corners </inline>or other programs he speaks much more moderately, but you cannot say one thing overseas and another thing in Australia about these matters. They are too serious, and we hold you to account in this country for words that you say overseas.</para><para>This has been a rather long digression from the contents of this bill, but since the opposition are not opposing this legislation I thought it important that the House be given some background which puts the measures of this bill into their proper context. The honourable member for Barton has set out our attitude to the details of this bill. As I said earlier, we on this side of the House will continue to support sensible and well-judged measures which enhance Australia's security. As an opposition we will continue to give those measures proper scrutiny. I suggest to the Attorney-General that he will have no let-up in that area. In government, we will continue to uphold Australia's national interests and ensure that this country is secure against terrorism, as I am sure that the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition during the recent hostage taking in Iraq have clearly illuminated. I suggest that the Australian public pay very clear attention to those remarks.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>32084</page.no><name role="metadata">Cadman, Alan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CADMAN</name><name.id>SD4</name.id><electorate>Mitchell</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R2124">Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 3) 2004</inline> has three main objectives. They are quite simple, and they add to a whole raft of initiatives taken by this government to amend our security laws and to make a legal framework which is adequate for Australia's needs in this day and age. This series of amendments seems to be one of the salami slices the Attorney-General needs to take in order to get some of the anti-terrorism and protective measures through the parliament. We are dependent on the support of the Australian Labor Party in the Senate to make changes which are critical to Australia's security. It amazes me that the Australian Labor Party appear to be putting themselves in a position to be held culpable if our systems fail and if we cannot achieve the outcomes that are necessary to protect Australian lives. They seem to think that that sort of activity within the Senate is responsible and will produce good results for them politically and on the ground in Australia. I cannot agree with this approach, because I think that that sort of playing with national security is something that should not be done. National security should be approached with a sense of deep responsibility and concern for the wellbeing of Australian citizens. There does not seem to be any evidence of that at the moment. </para></talk.start><para>The first objective of this bill is to amend the Passports Act so that, where people carry two passports and their Australian passport is confiscated or withdrawn, they cannot use a second passport to exit Australia. It brings into effect a provision that the international force of their overseas passport can, through Commonwealth law, be held to not be a sufficient reason for someone to travel if it is a condition of their parole that they remain in Australia or if, because they are suspected of being likely to engage in harmful conduct, such as terrorist activity, they should be prevented from leaving Australia on a foreign passport. The second objective of this legislation is to ensure that those subject to a request by the Director-General of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation to the minister for consent to apply for a questioning warrant be prevented from leaving Australia. I am pleased that the Australian Labor Party are supporting this provision. It is one that they had doubts about over a long period of time. If the Director-General of ASIO says to the minister that a certain individual should be questioned and should be prevented from leaving Australia, this bill enables that process to be undertaken.</para><para>The third objective is to amend the forensic procedure provisions of the Crimes Act to facilitate effective disaster victim identification in the event of a disaster causing mass casualties—if a terrorist attack or an aircraft disaster were to occur within Australia, for instance. The DNA profiles of individuals who are casualties of a disaster of that type can be used for the purposes of identification. That is perfectly reasonable and it is all within the framework of the need to ensure Australia's security and safety.</para><para>I notice that the Australian Labor Party as supporters of the bill have adopted a broad approach to the legislation, and I intend to do the same. I need to say a few things about the Australian Labor Party's position as it compares with where the government is going on these measures. I want to set out pretty clearly for the House some of the initiatives adopted by the government and some of the responses from the Australian Labor Party to what are sensible measures. These started with the Australian Olympics and were then pursued more intensively following September 11 and the Bali bombings. In that situation, we have reacted as a government to the needs of the day, but the Australian Labor Party's reactions to the government's initiatives have on many occasions appeared to be confused.</para><para>Some of the government's initiatives are wide-reaching and move into an area of legislation that we have not dealt with before in Australia. To list some of the changes to legislation, one has to go through a raft of provisions. Among the legislative initiatives adopted by the government there have been changes to: the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation legislation; the border security legislation of 2002; the Crimes Amendment Act, allowing forensics to be used to identify victims—the issue that we are dealing with today; the anti-hoax and other measures under the Crimes Act; espionage and related matters under the Criminal Code; offences against Australians under the Criminal Code; the suppression of terrorist bombings, making it an offence under the Criminal Code to place bombs or other lethal devices in proscribed places with the intention of causing death or serious harm; the terrorism and criminal act; the constitutional reference of powers; and the creation of a package of counter-terrorism legislation, which was passed by the Commonwealth on 27 June 2000, which received royal assent on 5 July 2000 and which states and territories have also mirrored in legislation they have enacted. </para><para>That removes the constitutional limitations so that Australian authorities can work together on counter-terrorism activities to protect Australian lives. Further, there is the Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Act 2002, which removes the requirement for ASIO or for the Attorney-General to be satisfied by a decision in the United Nations Security Council relating to terrorism before making an organisation proscribable. Other government initiatives include: the 2003 Hezbollah amendment to the Criminal Code, the Hamas bill of 2003, the 2002 suppression of financing of terrorism and the Telecommunications Interception Legislation Amendment Act 2002. There we have a whole range of legislative initiatives—I have mentioned only some of them—that have been enacted by successive Attorney-Generals, particularly the current one, to draw together the legal framework for us to take security protection against those that would seek to harm Australians.</para><para>Terrorism as it is being expressed around the world is not a matter of making a military statement; it is a statement against the Australian way of life, against Western values. It is as simple as that. Terrorists want to disrupt and cause fear in order to drag down the current Western way of life. In the past three federal budgets the Howard government has allocated more than $3 billion over five years to enhance Australia's security. That applies to our capabilities and our arrangements with other governments and it is a unique and coordinated national approach.</para><para>I would like to list some of our achievements over this period. We have seen increased intelligence sharing and cooperation between government agencies—something that the Americans have struggled with; it is coming to light that there is now a coordinated approach being adopted in that country. We have seen a comprehensive new series of laws and technologies aimed at keeping ahead of organised crime syndicates in the new digital age to make sure that we have appropriate tracking and identification devices available to our law enforcement agencies. There has been a strengthening of our defence forces. It is essential that they are involved. We have seen the establishment of a new special operations command, a tactical assault group and a 300-strong instant response regiment with specialist skills.</para><para>Based overseas, we have new joint federal, state and territory police counter-terrorism investigation teams, which are at the cutting edge of taking charge of an incident should it occur or having in place preventative measures if such an incident were identified. We have extensive new resources to help the AFP fight terrorism, including additional investigators based overseas. That ensures essential intelligence and information-gathering processes in our near neighbourhood, where drug lords have moved without too much trouble. We need information on terrorist activities. It is essential that we work with our neighbours—our friends who are living in the region—and their governments to make sure that we all take charge of this situation.</para><para>There is tighter security in airports, along with armed plain-clothes air security officers on selected flights. We have state-of-the-art surveillance systems on Coastwatch planes, and more air and sea patrols to protect our borders. We have seen an upgrade in emergency services, with new equipment and specialist training. We have a more effective capacity to deal with chemical, biological and radiological threats. The implementation of the national counter-terrorism plan ensures that detailed strategic arrangements are in place for governments and security agents to prevent and respond to terrorism. </para><para>We have, step after step, logical, coordinated services in Australia, both state and federal. They are drawn together and matched with our security and intelligence-gathering processes and our defence systems and are related internationally to our friends and allies. We have seen the opening of the National Threat Assessment Centre—marking its transition to a 24-hours-a-day, seven-days-a-week operation—a full month ahead of when it was scheduled to commence operation.</para><para>We are working with the Pacific islands. I saw dismissive remarks from the Leader of the Opposition about Australia's role with the Pacific forum and our relationship with its members. I think that is a critical part of our approach and it is foundational. We do not want to be imposing our systems on them, but we need to be able to understand where the risks lie and which systems are likely to expose us to threat should they be used. We have seen the establishment of unprecedented cooperative working arrangements between the AFP and its counterparts in our region, particularly in Indonesia. Despite what the previous speaker said, I think it is critical that we have that relationship and cooperation with Indonesia.</para><para>We have entered into nine memorandums of understanding in counter-terrorism cooperation with key partners in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, Fiji, Cambodia, East Timor, India and Papua New Guinea. All are in place, all are bilateral and give us an understanding of how we work together. The framework of working together is underscored with hard words of cooperation, of binding trust and of working together. A trusted information sharing network of critical infrastructure protection was established in April 2003 to link Australian state and territory governments and business in the sharing of information on security threats and vulnerabilities. The business-to-government ministerial forum on national security was held in Canberra in June this year. All of these measures are drawn together in a cohesive way.</para><para>In light of that activity it is really strange to find that the package of counter-terrorism legislation that was passed by the Commonwealth on 27 June 2002 was played with by the Australian Labor Party. The Australian Labor Party wanted the United Nations, in the first place, to be the key instrumentality in deciding whether we listed terrorist bodies in Australia. How ridiculous was that and how ridiculous has it been proven to be? The Labor Party originally voted against giving the Attorney-General the power to list terrorist organisations. It just would not cop that. In early 2004 the opposition changed its position on that issue. It took two years to think the thing through, during which period we could not list the organisations that were a threat to the nation. The Australian Labor Party was prepared to stand between our security and a sensible listing process. In a press release, the opposition has claimed that, if elected, it would repeal the provisions it agreed to. Has that been retracted, or does the Australian Labor Party still have a policy that it would prefer to have the United Nations list the terrorist organisations which are a threat to Australia rather than place that in Australian hands?</para><para>While we have been putting together all the steps I have listed to make Australia safe and building up the resources to do so, the Australian Labor Party failed the Australian community when it rejected the ASIO bill at the end of the 2002 parliamentary sittings, showing complete disregard for protecting the community. It passed the ASIO bill early in 2003 while at the same time indicating it was going to wind back some of ASIO's powers. Thanks to Labor, ASIO's powers to detain and question people with information about possible terrorists attacks and to gather details we need to prevent these attacks have been seriously diminished. That shows a half-hearted appreciation of what lies before us. </para><para>A more subtle and equally concerning example of this approach was the Leader of the Opposition's suggestion that the Australian Labor Party would support retrospective criminal laws to facilitate the return of Hicks and Habib from Guantanamo Bay, with no apparent consideration of how such an amendment could possibly work. How would you do that? Nobody has ever thought of doing it before. Australian nationals took possible action of a terrorist type, and they need to be brought to trial under the processes under which they were first apprehended. To change the criminal law retrospectively is just crazy.</para><para>I thank a journalist with the <inline font-style="italic">Australian </inline>for bringing our attention once more to the material prepared by Katharine Betts, professor of sociology at Swinburne, in the journal <inline font-style="italic">People and Place</inline>. She draws attention to the fact that the standards and values of the Australian Labor Party are quite different to those of the community. I give a couple of examples that Janet Albrechtsen uses. She points to the fact that on a range of social and economic factors the Australian Labor Party elected person holds quite a different view to that held by Labor Party voters. For instance, she found that more than half of all voters, including Labor voters, think that the American alliance is very important to Australia, yet less than one-quarter of Labor candidates agreed. Only one-quarter of the Labor Party candidates agreed that the American alliance is important but half the voters think it is important.</para><para>Another issue which is important is that one-third of Labor Party voters have a great deal of trust that the US would come to Australia's defence but just 12½ per cent of Labor representatives or candidates do. So, on every issue of major relationship with the United States and on these security issues, it appears that the Australian Labor Party candidates and members are more suspicious of America, more anti-American and less prone to want Australia to be secure than those people who vote Labor. It is no wonder that there is a deep concern out there amongst the Australian people that the Australian Labor Party really does not understand the urgency of the situation and the need for actions such as the amendments we are dealing with today. I welcome the Attorney-General and thank him for his careful application to some of these needs of Australia, for his consistency and for his preparedness to keep fighting on small issue after small issue, building block after building block, to put together over two years a very comprehensive package. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>32088</page.no><name role="metadata">Hunt, Gregory, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HUNT</name><name.id>00AMV</name.id><electorate>Flinders</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R2124">Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 3) 2004</inline> does a series of things. It amends the Passports Act 1938, it amends the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 and it amends the Crimes Act 1914. It does all of these in a manner so as to assist the Australian government in providing the foundations for protecting and preserving the maintenance of security within Australia and for Australian citizens. It does so against a background of a series of legislative acts over the last three years. Legislation to amend the Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Act 2002, the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism Act 2002, the Criminal Code Amendment (Suppression of Terrorist Bombings) Act 2002 and many other actions taken by this government are part of the package.</para></talk.start><para>In speaking to the Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 3) 2004, I want to look most importantly at the global context, the challenge we face, the reasons for our actions and the purpose which guides the steps that we now take. The proposition I present to the House is a simple one: we face a different type of challenge to any that we have faced before as an Australian society or as a global community—that is, the challenge of international terrorism capable, armed and equipped to act in such a way to bring violence as a means of carrying out political objectives across the world. It is not limited to Western, Christian, Jewish or Islamic societies; it is aimed at all societies which get in the way of the primary objective of al-Qaeda, its associates and its affiliates. </para><para>In that context, I want to address the three great challenges which Australia faces in dealing with antiterrorism: firstly, al-Qaeda; secondly, establishing a sound democratic society in the Middle East in Iraq; and, thirdly, terrorism within our own region. In looking at the question of al-Qaeda, it is important to understand three key things: its ideology, its strategy and its methods. The ideology of al-Qaeda is a simple one in many ways. It is to create an Islamic caliphate across the globe. Over a 100-year vision, it seeks to develop a world which replicates the society we saw in Afghanistan under the Taliban. It seeks a Taliban style globe. That is its express, clear and unequivocal objective.</para><para>What is that society? It is a perversion of Islam. It has as much connection to Islam as the Oklahoma City bombers had to Christianity. That was a perversion of Christianity. Al-Qaeda is a perversion of Islam. It breaches all of the fundamental tenets of that great religion and it seeks to do so for the benefit of those who carry a particular ideology. That is what we face: a clear world view.</para><para>Its strategy, which is also well known, is to break down Western engagement with the Islamic world, as a first stage. Its strategy is to drive out Western engagement so as to seek to capture over the next 30 years one of the four great Islamic countries—Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan or Indonesia—within our own area. Whether it is the Muslim brotherhood in Egypt, al-Qaeda or its affiliates in Saudi Arabia or in Pakistan, or Jemaah Islamiah in Indonesia, what we see in each of those countries is an attempt to destabilise the governments, to cause either the countries to fragment or their governments to be replaced by a Taliban style, ultraextremist Islamic government. It is not about Islam—that is a false debate; it is about a sliver of extremists who are willing to use any actions, anywhere, to achieve their outcomes. Their outcomes are, very simply, a worldwide Islamic caliphate; that is what they seek to achieve. Their strategy is very clear: to break off and drive out Western links so as to establish a toehold or a base. In the same way that, from the poorest country in the world, Afghanistan, when they effectively had control of the government through the Taliban, they were able to launch attacks upon different parts of the world, now they seek to do that with the resources of a major state.</para><para>Let me quote from the Australian government's recent white paper on terrorism, because it is very important to understand the scope, desire and brutality which underpins al-Qaeda's objectives. In their 1998 fatwa—or message of Islamic jihad—bin Laden, al-Zawahiri and other key members of al-Qaeda said that their objective and exhortation to others is:</para><quote><para>... to kill Americans and their allies—civilians and military—is an individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it, in order to liberate the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the holy mosque [in Mecca] from their grip, and in order for their armies to move out of all the lands of Islam, defeated and unable to threaten any Muslim. </para></quote><para>In June 2002, through an al-Qaeda spokesman, they go on to say:</para><quote><para>... we have the right to kill four million Americans, including one million children, displace double that figure and injure and cripple hundreds of thousands. We have the right to fight them by chemical and biological weapons ...</para></quote><para>The first quote was in 1998. The second quote was before any activity was undertaken in Iraq. It is a mind-set which predated any current administration. It is a mind-set which was developed during the 1980s in Afghanistan. It is a mind-set which is deep and enduring and which, I say again to this House, is an utter perversion of the great and noble religion of Islam and does not represent Islam. It is, first and foremost, a civil war and an attack upon mainstream Islam.</para><para>Against that background, we also see that al-Qaeda are willing to and seek to carry out acts of large-scale violence which cause mass human suffering and which have mostly been associated with firepower and explosive capability. Whether it was September 11, Madrid, Tanzania, Tunisia, Kenya or, closer to home, the tragedy in Bali, we see the combination of heat and fire and the destruction of human lives on a mass scale. That is what they are willing to do and that is why it is a different kind of threat. There is no doubt that the Australian mainland is a target—of course it is a target—as are all Western cities and all cities of any faith or denomination around the world where it might conceivably help al-Qaeda's objectives. That is the nature of the threat. We will see more assassinations, more beheadings and more large-scale terror activities. The nature of the threat is great.</para><para>That leads me to the second great challenge that we have: the question of securing peace in Iraq. Very simply, what is occurring there is an attempt to take the world's most dictatorial and brutal society—a Stalinist society, which would carry out systematic rape and brutality against its own people, which had a history and practice of using and developing chemical and biological weapons and capability; from the Butler report, David Kay's report and the Flood report, there is no doubt that that capability existed and was being worked on; there is also no doubt, to the best of my knowledge, that Iraq is the only state in the last 50 years to have used such weapons in conflict, both internationally and against its own civilian population—and replace it with a fledgling democratic society. Democracy, as we know, is the enemy of al-Qaeda. In one of the statements, al-Zawahiri characterises democracy as a false religion. Of al-Zawahiri, the white paper says:</para><quote><para>For him, people who live in democracies, particularly in Muslim countries, are therefore legitimate targets because, by voting and paying taxes, they participate in the `idolatrous' democratic process. Similarly, those who seek to promote democracy in Muslim countries are also deemed to be targets.</para></quote><para>Very simply, what we see is an attack upon the very possibility that an Islamic society might become democratic. To me, that is an outrageous thing, and it is something which we have to resist.</para><para>It was always going to be a difficult process—a difficult challenge—in Iraq. But, if it is not a worthwhile purpose to take on the challenge of transforming a society that lived in terror, that was in the thrall of a dictator and where women could be taken at the whim of senior officials and used for their own purposes, then I am sadly mistaken. To me, that is a courageous and noble activity. Yes, it has been controversial, but it has been fundamental to what we are, what we believe and what we seek to become as a society. It represents the goals of promoting democracy, providing to people a basic life that is free of terror and providing to people choice over their own personal futures. That is what is occurring in Iraq. </para><para>Against that, there are two forces. There are the remnants of Saddam Hussein's Baathist regime who seek to recapture what they have lost, and there are those who take up the words of al-Zawahiri, Qutb and bin Laden. They seek to destroy any hope for a free society—if that were to come about—because they see in their failed society the seeds of their own growth and of their own extremist version of an Islamic caliphate. That is why Australia is involved in Iraq. That is why we take the difficult steps. As I said before, there will be more assassinations, beheadings and mass explosions targeted at civilian populations so as to create terror.</para><para>We face these things closer to home as well. We see them within our own region. Jemaah Islamiah brought about the horror of the Bali bombings, in which 202 lives were lost, 88 of them Australian. In that situation, their goal is very clear: it is to bring down the Indonesian government, to cause Indonesia to fragment, to cause Australia and other Western nations to break ranks with Indonesia—which now works as a new, secular and democratic country—and to set about creating a pan South-East Asian caliphate across the southern parts of the Philippines and through Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei. That is the stated goal of Jemaah Islamiah. Our job is simple. Our job is to recognise that we have to take steps to resist and prevent the triumph of these types of activities. It is a battle on the ground, and it is a battle of ideas. There are four great steps we must take. Firstly, we must be involved in development and providing economic opportunities. Secondly, we have to be involved in education. Thirdly, we have to be involved in joint policing. Fourthly, we have to be involved in security within the region, internationally—which is what we are involved in with Afghanistan and particularly Iraq—and at home. This bill helps complement the armoury in terms of our homeland protection.</para><para>For those reasons, I support completely the measures contained within the <inline ref="R2124">Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 3) 2004</inline>. I commend the bill to the House and urge all members of this House to be ever vigilant to the fact that we face a challenge to our security at home, to our Australian people abroad and to our way of life. It is a challenge from people who care nothing for it but simply seek to impose a world that is anathema to everything we believe. For that reason, our task as legislators and Australian citizens is to say with unbending will that we will defend, protect and do everything we can to ensure that Australia plays a constructive role in the world as we see it in the first part of the 21st century.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>32091</page.no><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name><name.id>0J4</name.id><electorate>Berowra</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Attorney-General</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—in reply—I would like to thank the honourable members for Barton and Melbourne Ports, from the opposition, and my colleagues the members for Dickson, Mitchell and Flinders for their contributions to this debate on the <inline ref="R2124">Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 3) 2004.</inline> I appreciate my colleagues' very perceptive speeches. They covered the broad range of issues that we have to deal with in this scourge of terrorism that we face. They have certainly outlined the breadth of measures that we have taken, but they have also made some very incisive speeches on the nature of the threat. I thank them very much for their contributions to this debate.</para></talk.start><para>I think it is important to understand that the opposition's contribution and support, while appreciated, should be understood for what it is. This is the lowest common denominator result. We have a bill that has been introduced to enable us to legislate, hopefully during this fortnight, to deal with two aspects of the government's agenda in relation to counter-terrorism but excluding two others that were part of the <inline ref="R2107">Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2004</inline>, which remains before a Senate committee. While I welcome the support for these measures, I suspect that any opposition would be very hard put to oppose the reasonableness of what is intended here. They are two very important practical issues that are of significance to the security of this country as well as going some way to dealing with the consequences of a terrorist attack or a national disaster, were they to occur. The procedures in schedules 1 and 2 for the surrender of passports will play a vital role in enabling Australian authorities to effectively seal the border to escaping terrorists. There is not much point in having a sophisticated system for the surrender of Australian passports if the suspect can avoid that system just by using a foreign passport. What opposition would say they are happy enough to have people stopped from using their Australian passport but `ta-ta' if they want to use a foreign passport? They could not do it. It would be totally irresponsible and they would be held up to ridicule. For that reason, they have to support it. </para><para>The amendments concerning foreign travel documents will also enable authorities to take them from those suspected of other serious crimes such as child sex offences. All countries need to work together to impede the movement of criminals across the globe as well as those who are terrorists or suspected of terrorism. I am pleased to see that members understand the need for these amendments. They will make a difference in our effort to prevent a terrorist attack. The provisions in schedule 3, which would enable authorities to use forensic procedures laws to identify the victims of a mass casualty incident, are, sadly, a lesson that we have learnt from Bali. No longer can this country rely on myriad state laws to deal with such incidents.</para><para>Following Bali, the parliament met the challenge by enacting a federal law. What we want to avoid is the necessity, if there is such a tragic event again, of having to introduce a single enactment in the shadow of such a tragedy. We need to act now in preparation for a possible domestic incident. It is pleasing to see that there will be support for this measure, but I say again it is not a measure that I would suspect that any opposition could oppose. I think these are the lowest common denominator results, and I make that clear—I want to say that to the shadow Attorney-General to his face rather than behind his back, and I welcome him back to the chamber. May I also record my thanks to Tom Sherman, whose review of the provisions enacted immediately following the Bali attack identified the need for forensic amendments. The review was made up of officers of the Privacy Commissioner, the Ombudsman, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Australian Federal Police.</para><para>Let me say, back in June it was certainly my hope to have these reasonable amendments in place, and it is fortunate that there has not been an incident of some sort that might have led us to believe that we have been found wanting in relation to our own duties by not having had it passed in the earlier session. But I do want to make the point, and it is a very important point, that the <inline ref="R2107">Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2004</inline>, from which these provisions have been abstracted, is nevertheless a very important piece of legislation and is deserving of support in the same way as this bill is deserving of support.</para><para>Let me deal with the issues that remain. The first is in relation to association with terrorist organisations. This proposed offence would enable authorities to prosecute those who, through their relationships with the directors, promoters and members of terrorist organisations, assist them to expand or continue to exist. I might just say—and I will continue to say this in the days and weeks ahead—that this measure is important. The measures that we have dealing with terrorists at the moment require us to first establish as an essential element that they are engaged in planning a terrorist act. It is a quite significant limitation. It is the starting point, and it is a difficult starting point from which to be able to proceed to prosecute. The provisions that we have sought here are provisions that have been requested, and I am sure the shadow Attorney-General noticed recently the remarks of the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police in support of a measure of this sort to give us a more complete set of legislative provisions. </para><para>The other matter that was excluded is something that I thought state premiers had sought. I noticed recently that they have wanted to raise questions about consultation. I have no problems about consultation or sitting down and working out better arrangements, but the provisions that were included in the Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 2) included the transfer of prisoners who, for national security reasons, ought to be able to be moved from a jail in one state to a more appropriate facility either within that state or elsewhere. It has been criticised, I gather, as a proposal which is moving a little too quickly, but let me just say that the idea of such transfers was raised over six months ago by state officials with Commonwealth officials and we were trying to respond quickly to that. As I said, I have no problem about our officials working through with the states to be conscious of their requirements as well, but I think you do need to be in a position where for national security purposes people can be shifted between one centre and another—sometimes for their own safety and protection; sometimes to protect the broader community.</para><para>I think those measures remain important. I very much regret that, with the way in which the Senate deals with these matters, it takes time. I suspect that the measures that ought to be dealt with in relation to association with terrorists and the transfer of prisoners will be delayed by many months simply because these matters have been referred to a committee. That is a regrettable outcome. I think the matters remain urgent and I will continue to press the importance of those. So, while welcoming the support of the opposition for the lowest common denominator result, and I do, let me encourage them to be more proactive in these matters and to join the government in implementing those measures which have been recommended to us—advanced by the officers who have the expertise, knowledge and experience in these matters—and which are important for enabling us to deal with the antiterrorism issues in a comprehensive way. I again thank my colleagues for their contributions during the debate. I hope the Senate can deal with the matter during the course of this week.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a second time</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>32093</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Mr RUDDOCK (Berowra—Attorney-General) (1.30 p.m.)—by leave—I move:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a third time.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a third time.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BUSINESS</title><type>Business</type><page.no>32093</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Rearrangement</title><page.no>32093</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay—Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (1.30 p.m.)—by leave—I move:</para><motion><para>That notice No. 3, government business, be postponed until a later hour this day.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to. </para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>32094</page.no><id.no>R2092</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>32094</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 24 June, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Costello</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>32094</page.no><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name><name.id>DT4</name.id><electorate>Hotham</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R2092">Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill 2004</inline> is the government's response to the Dawson review, an inquiry which in fact reported 15 months ago—and someone has to be answerable as to why it has taken so long to respond to it. The reality is that the Dawson response at the time was widely criticised as inadequate. As a consequence, a process was set up in the Senate to consider and report on further alterations to strengthen competition in the economy and to consider further amendments to the Trade Practices Act. That Senate process reported in June and made some 17 recommendations, only one of which is picked up in this bill. It is the one aspect of the bill which we believe is important, an aspect, also recommended by Dawson, that goes to collective bargaining opportunities for small business. But the rest of this legislation is inadequate and a disappointing response both to Dawson and to the Senate deliberations.</para></talk.start><para>With the other aspect of this legislation, the new tribunal, there are some serious concerns which we believe require further consideration and analysis. Also there is the failure by this legislation to respond to any of the other 16 recommendations made by the Senate process that I have alluded to, despite the fact that two of those recommendations were adopted and recommended unanimously by the Senate.</para><para>It is against that background that I move:</para><para>That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</para><para>“whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading in order not to block the passage of the collective bargaining provisions for small business, the House condemns the Government for:</para><para>(1)	combining important small business reforms and highly contentious changes to the merger approval regime in the same Bill; and</para><para>(2)	not adopting all the recommendations of the Report of the Senate Inquiry into “The effectiveness of the <inline font-style="italic">Trade Practices Act 1974</inline> in protecting small business” ”.</para><para>We believe that is the desired way this should go and obviously that opportunity will present itself in the Senate.</para><para>So I indicate that we move that amendment and seek to have the House determine that approach. But in the Senate it is our intention to seek to have the bill split so that the aspect of it that we believe does deserve carriage can be carried and the concerns about the new tribunal sent to a Senate committee of inquiry. We will also move amendments to seek to have adopted those recommendations made by the Senate to strengthen the trade practices legislation to strengthen competition in this economy.</para><para>This bill, as I said, is a very disappointing attempt at improving the trade practices law. I made the point before that the Dawson review actually reported 15 months ago. Little wonder this government is getting the reputation of being seriously out of puff. What sort of a government is it that commissions a review into an important area like this, gets that review and then 15 months down the track brings forward this inadequate response? We have heard this government criticising Labor for wanting a Senate review into the free trade agreement—a review which took something like two or three months—and our being criticised for dithering. What sort of dithering is it when you have a Treasurer who has been sitting on a report for 15 months who only then brings legislation before the parliament just before an election? The gall of the government: to be critical of the opposition for taking time to insist on important reviews of the free trade agreement, one dimension of which the government immediately picked up yesterday—that is, the protection of local content. Within two hours of Labor proposing its approach, the government picked it up—we hope they do the same with the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. This shows the importance of inquiry and scrutiny. But in the circumstances where that scrutiny has occurred in relation to the Trade Practices Act, the government has ignored all but one of the recommendations coming from that process. </para><para>Just on the specifics of the collective bargaining provisions, which Labor supports and wants to see go through, Labor supported that measure 12 months ago. Yet it is only today, on the eve of an election, that the government pick it up. Why does it take them so long to adopt what Labor has flagged its support for, which could have been adopted through bipartisan agreement? Why does it take the government so long to act on these things? It was not until June 2004 that we saw this legislative response. In my view, it is the lateness and inadequacy of the government's response which demonstrates that there is no serious commitment by this government to a procompetitive reform agenda in this economy. They talk the words, but they do not implement the acts. They pretend to be in favour of competition, but they do not put in place the regime or legislative structure that guarantees it.</para><para>In the end, it was Labor's proposals that it put out for strengthening the Trade Practices Act that forced the government's hand. So here we are, 15 months late and with an inadequate response, despite the fact that the Senate has given great deliberation to this and made some important recommendations. Labor in office will put those recommendations into place. I thought the parliamentary secretary at the table had fallen asleep a moment ago. She was snoring away there. I think that is the government's approach in terms of dealing with the competition reform in this economy—they are asleep at the wheel.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>GK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Kelly, Jackie, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name></talker><para>—There she is, snoring again! This government are asleep at the wheel, and it demonstrates itself on every occasion. They are given the way forward by Labor, but they do not know what to do with it. They sit around, they dither and they do nothing, yet small businesses in this country that really need these important reforms are the ones that suffer. But when we talk about this reform that took 15 months, it was not much of a response at all. Although in our view the Dawson review of the Trade Practices Act gave the government an ideal opportunity to take the big leap forward, they squibbed it. After all this time, they have come up with this mediocre reform.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The bill is notable for what it does not include. I will mention some important areas. It does not include any strengthening of the act to stop the misuse of market power; nor does it do anything to stop the creeping acquisitions that erode market power by stealth while the ACCC is effectively unable to do anything to stop them. The pro small business reforms that are contained in this bill do not go far enough. Whilst Labor does support the introduction of a notification procedure that allows small business speedy and cheaper access to collective bargaining with big business, the government has oversold the importance of this measure. That is because, as the ACCC has repeatedly stated, the notification is just a procedural change. It is important, but it is only a partial response to the more complex problem of the abuse of market power, about which the government proposes to do nothing. </para><para>I will come in a minute to the details of what Labor proposes in this area to really strengthen competition and support small business in the community. Before that, I want to underpin the importance of competition for a dynamic economy. Competition is vital to driving a higher capacity for economic growth, lifting the growth rate of the nation and sharing the benefits. We all know the reforms that Labor undertook during the eighties—the reforms which opened up and internationalised the economy. Labor did this by taking tough decisions to reduce tariff levels, float the dollar and liberalise the banking system. Labor also embarked on a very strong procompetition set of policies. A lot has been done in that area, and I give credit to the government. They have done some important things too. But the truth is that a lot more needs to be done, and the major piece of unfinished business on the agenda is the cutting back of the abuse of market power. This is one of the fundamental pillars upon which the ACCC and its precursors were formed. On the face of it, it was to ensure that there was no abuse of market power, but we are continuing to see examples of how that is being whittled away. We have to continue to push the reform agenda to set the nation on that higher growth path. It occurs by creating the efficiency gains that will drive productivity. That is the only reliable way to increase living standards in the long term.</para><para>The story goes something like this: productivity growth is not just about liberalising tariffs and cutting costs. Productivity growth flows from improved economic efficiency, but this depends on getting the price mechanism right. There is no surer way to restrict efficiency than to undermine the capacity of prices to signal the efficient allocation of economic resources in an economy. The thing that most undermines efficient price setting is monopoly behaviour—the abuse of market power. If we constrain this abuse, we will get greater efficiency as an economy. As a consequence of that, we will get greater productivity, higher growth and better living standards. It is good for the economy. It makes sense. But for Labor it is about more than just expanding the wealth cake. It is also about fairness. What Labor has always argued is: you have to invest in the drivers of economic growth and you have to lift economic growth, but you have to seek prosperity for a purpose.</para><para>Through tough competition laws you not only guarantee higher overall returns but you create greater balance between small business, or the consumer, and the powerful vested interests of the wealthy elite who control corporate Australia. Competition policy is about creating a fairer playing field, not just an even one. It is about defending the rights of average Australians—the little people—which strong financial power and pressure could be used to undermine.</para><para>But this is not the government's vision. On the contrary: their competition policy seems to work from the opposite pole. It gives concessions, it supports this continuing abuse of market power by big business. Labor is concerned that the proposed merger arrangements may be providing a very significant concession to big business. The new authorisation process means that proponents of a merger who believe they will fail the competition test can apply to this new tribunal to have their merger considered on public interest grounds. Labor's fear is that the merger changes appear to be designed to make it easier to get larger merger proposals approved. That is why we believe the intent of this legislation needs greater scrutiny.</para><para>The former head of the ACCC, Professor Alan Fels, is strongly opposed to the merger authorisation process, embodied in this legislation, which bypasses the ACCC and goes straight to the Competition Tribunal. He suggested that there will be significant mechanical difficulties associated with the tribunal. This is because it is not an investigative body but primarily a judicial one. He also notes that there will be no rights of appeal for consumers, the people for whom the competition laws are structured to give a better go and fairer prices. </para><para>Labor is open to all measures to maximise the efficiency and effectiveness of the merger authorisation process. If there have been delays in the authorisation process these can be dealt with by reforming the current arrangements. But the current arrangements are still functional, even if they could be improved. Last year, the ACCC considered 191 merger proposals. Of these, it objected to nine because they were likely to substantially lessen competition, and two of these proceeded following enforceable undertakings being provided.</para><para>In light of these concerns, a Labor government will seek to have these new merger provisions carved out of the bill in the Senate and sent to a Senate committee for review. Failing this, Labor commits to review the whole mechanism in government. We will ensure that the interests of consumers and small business are considered in any merger authorisation process. Labor's policy promises more substantial reform and will deliver a more efficient pricing regime. It will, as a consequence, produce improved productivity gains and growth.</para><para>Labor has already announced a seven-point plan to ensure that this happens in the area of competition reform. We have proposed that section 46 of the Trade Practices Act be strengthened and that predatory pricing be explicitly banned. The ACCC will be given the power to issue `cease and desist orders' to provide immediate relief against market abuse and anticompetitive conduct. Courts will be granted a new power to order the divestiture of assets to tackle the worst cases of market abuse or cartel behaviour. The Trade Practices Act will be amended to put a brake on large companies accumulating smaller enterprises in a way that lessens competition. Labor will also restore some balance to the relationship between franchisees and parent companies by allowing the ACCC to bundle up complaints against a parent company.</para><para>The sixth point of that seven-point plan ensures that the ACCC's independence will be preserved by building into the Trade Practices Act a formal statutory review of the act, and ensuring all appointments to the ACCC are made on the basis of independence and expertise. The final point of Labor's plan is that greater transparency will be applied to the ACCC's merger undertaking process by forcing the ACCC to report on firms' compliance with their undertakings.</para><para>Labor has also participated in a comprehensive Senate inquiry—the inquiry that I referred to at the beginning of this speech. `The effectiveness of the Trade Practises Act 1974 in protecting small business,' was the title and the consideration of that Senate process. Seventeen recommendations came from that process. Labor supports all 17 of the recommendations of the committee. The government has only acted on one of these recommendations, the collective bargaining notification for small business. Although three others are uncontroversial, the government has not even bothered to include them in the bill. You have to ask yourself, `Where is the serious commitment to reform by this government when it will not even include the uncontroversial issues, let alone those other recommendations I talked about?' It also shows how the government is not seriously seeking to reform the Trade Practices Act.</para><para>We call on the government to work with the opposition to bring into law all the committee's recommendations where possible. It is a genuine offer in terms of bipartisan support from us. This has been the subject of review and deliberation. Recommendations have been made. They have been made on the basis of the evidence presented. This is a genuine offer on Labor's part to work with the government to implement them. What we will do in the Senate is move amendments to give effect to the committee's recommendations, including strengthening provisions relating to unconscionable conduct, enhancing the ACCC's ability to seek injunctions to quickly tackle anticompetitive conduct and improving access to justice for small business by expanding the jurisdiction of the Federal Magistrates Court. </para><para>For some time Labor has been highlighting the problems with section 46 of the Trade Practices Act. It is true that the High Court's decisions in the Boral case and the Rural Press case have narrowed the scope of section 46. The ACCC has pleaded with the government to strengthen the law. Only last month, its chairman stated that the commission regards section 46, as presently drafted, as being reasonably ineffective. Why then isn't the government seeking to do something in this legislation to strengthen the hand of the ACCC, to address the concerns and the deficiencies established and identified through the court processes and in response to the chairman saying that the current provisions are reasonably ineffective? One would have thought that that would be the signal for the government to act. But where is the action? All that has happened is that the government has gone missing in action because it does not believe in real support for small business, in strengthening their hand and in ensuring true competition and true effective market power.</para><para>Under the competition principles agreement, the Commonwealth agreed to amend part 4 of the act only after consultation with the states. Therefore, in this bill we will not move amendments to section 46, but we really believe that the government needs to take action in this regard. Labor will, however, be seeking to further amend section 46 in the Senate as a priority on coming to government. Those amendments to section 46 will clarify the scope of some of the competition tests under section 46, further define the meaning of predatory pricing, make the financial power of `entity' a relevant consideration in considering market power, ensure that the scope of the competition tests extend beyond individual markets and clarify that companies can be seen to have substantial market power by acting in concert with other companies.</para><para>In conclusion, we have a government that is missing in action in terms of competition law reform; a government that has been sent the signals not only by the chairman of the ACCC—as a consequence of the whittling down of the effectiveness of the intent of the act by various cases in the courts—but also by recommendations of a Senate committee after taking submissions. What we have before the House today is weak policy. It is weak policy because it is limited in its approach. It is limited to enabling the collective bargaining operations of small business—which we welcome and want to support. But this legislation should have gone much further. Just like so many other things that this government talks about and says it believes in, it fails the test when it comes to the real activity and the real amendments.</para><para>This legislation highlights a government without a vision for this country, a government that is out of puff, a government that talks the words of competition and fairness in the marketplace but does not enact legislation and take steps to ensure that that happens. We believe it is time for a change. The Australian people will have the opportunity to make that change in the not too distant future. In relation to this legislation, we want the government to work with us now, in the time available, to implement the Senate recommendations. We could get bipartisan support and bring the strengthened trade practices legislation before this parliament. The government stands condemned for its failure to do so. Labor's commitment is to do it on attaining office. I commend the second reading amendment to the House. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Jenkins)</inline>—Is the amendment seconded?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Smith, Stephen, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Stephen Smith</name></talker><para>—I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—The original question was that this bill be now read a second time.

Whilst I intend to dive into some of the more substantial matters that are contained within this bill, I will take the very short period of time available to me prior to question time today to address and respond to some of the arguments that were raised by the shadow Treasurer. I was bemused to hear the shadow Treasurer claim in this chamber that the ALP is a friend to small business. It is hilarious that the Australian Labor Party would come into this chamber at a time when, as part of its policy platform, it is proposing the introduction of a new federal payroll tax of 0.1 per cent and claim that it is the Labor Party that is the friend of the Australian small business sector. Nothing could be further from the truth.</para></talk.start><para>I heard the shadow Treasurer make all sorts of claims along these lines. Among his claims was that, as part of the ALP's policy, there are seven key points that the ALP would like to see introduced to help business and consumers in the Australian economy. I guess that some of those key policy platforms that the ALP is adopting to help small business must have been forgotten by the shadow Treasurer. The payroll tax was not mentioned. Perhaps the shadow Treasurer forgot that. Nor did the shadow Treasurer talk about the portability of long service leave—another key component, we understand, of the Australian Labor Party's pro small business platform.</para><para>This has got directly to do with the Trade Practices Act because it relates to the way in which government policy has a direct impact on not only competition but also the costs that small businesses have to face. The reality is that it is very difficult for a business to be competitive in a competitive marketplace if they are shackled with the kinds of industrial relations policies that the Australian Labor Party is putting forward. The portability of long service leave is a key case in point. The reality is that, if the Labor Party was to win government, its policy would see small business employees being able to go into another small business and work there for perhaps three months or six months and then impose upon that small business the right to take long service. Likewise, the ALP's policy would see unions having a right of entry. This would ensure that small business would again be shackled with the unions having the right to go into a small business premises and demand that they have entry.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

Can I say at the outset that we have not as yet seen the precise terms of the amendment that is being put forward. The basis of the amendment which has been set out by the Leader of the Opposition and various other shadow ministers is wrong. The amendment proceeds on a total misunderstanding of how the patent law of this country operates. It assumes that the patent law of this country operates in the way the United States patent law operates, and it does not. In Australia there are no automatic injunctions available as there are in the United States. And in Australia, contrary to what has been alleged by the Labor Party, the lodgment of a patent application does not stop the generic process. That completely undercuts the whole basis of the proposition that has been put by the Leader of the Opposition.</para></talk.start><para>The Leader of the Opposition has been saying ever since yesterday morning that you need to have special penalties to stop the lodgment of bodgie or spurious patent applications which will prevent the marketing of generic drugs. That has been the argument advanced by the Leader of the Opposition, and it shows a complete misunderstanding of how the law operates in Australia. A patent holder in this country cannot stop the marketing of a generic drug without taking action for infringement of patent.</para><para>What the Leader of the Opposition has falsely alleged to the Australian public is that, as soon as you put in a patent application, that can stop the marketing of a generic drug. Wrong, I say to the Leader of the Opposition. That is a complete misunderstanding of how the law operates. That is why the amendment proposed by the Leader of the Opposition is unnecessary. But we also believe that the amendment proposed, as explained by the Leader of the Opposition thus far, is also potentially harmful, because it would undermine an important element of the operation of our intellectual property laws. The whole basis of the patent law is to encourage innovation, to encourage the entrepreneurial spirit, to encourage people to lodge applications for good ideas and to protect their good ideas. If you introduce the sort of change that the Leader of the Opposition is recommending, you would have a result of inhibiting many people from protecting their ideas. I do not think we should inhibit people from protecting ideas in this country. Can I simply say that, if you decide to introduce a regime of this kind for a limited number of manufacturers, why would you limit it to pharmaceutical manufacturers? Why wouldn't you extend it to other manufacturers? In the process, you would undermine a significant part of our intellectual property law, so that is the reason why the amendment would be harmful. </para><para>Could I point out to the House that, when it comes to the credibility of the Labor Party on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, for 2½ years the Labor Party said the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme would be undermined if the parliament agreed to a modest increase in the patient co-contribution.

The stance that they are taking on this issue also goes to the question of political expediency.</para><para>Seeing that we are quoting people, let me quote, from yesterday on ABC radio in Sydney, the most senior serving Labor man in Australia—that is, the Premier of New South Wales.

The government has been appalled by the humanitarian and human rights disaster of Sudan. We do need to distinguish between the civil war in southern Sudan, which is nearing—we hope—settlement after 20 years, and the current emergency which is taking place in the western part of Sudan in Darfur. The Darfur crisis has left an estimated 30,000 to 50,000 people dead, and that figure comes from the United Nations. There are about 1.2 million people who have been displaced, 200,000 of those people in Chad, and the security and humanitarian situation there is still deteriorating.</para></talk.start><para>The government responded to the crisis in May with a $5 million contribution to humanitarian assistance, followed by a further $3 million contribution in June. Last Tuesday I announced a further $12 million in emergency humanitarian assistance. Today I can confirm that $9 million of that will go to the World Food Program and UNICEF, and the remaining funds will be channelled through other relief agencies, including the International Committee of the Red Cross, Oxfam and World Vision. These funds from Australia will provide emergency food, water supplies, sanitation and health care for the victims. I have written to Sudan's foreign minister to express Australia's deep concern about the situation. The Australian government has said on a number of occasions that we will consider requests for defence and other support that has been mandated by the United Nations Security Council.</para><para>The government welcomes the Security Council resolution on Darfur which was recently passed. We lobbied hard for the resolution because strong international pressure is needed to ensure that the government of Sudan lives up to its promises. A resolution does set obligations which, if not met by Sudan's government, will be backed by not just tougher diplomatic measures but tougher economic measures as well. It is vital for the United Nations this time, late as it may be, to take a strong stand against this egregious situation. We do not want to see a failure of the United Nations in dealing with a humanitarian crisis as we saw 10 years ago in the case of Rwanda. We look to the Sudanese government to meet its obligations under the resolution. I must say that we are concerned that the head of the Sudanese army has said that he regards the resolution from the Security Council as a declaration of war. The Sudanese government should be under no illusions about the seriousness with which the international community sees this situation. It must respond quickly and it must respond meaningfully. </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Trade: Free Trade Agreement</title><page.no>32102</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>32102</page.no><name role="metadata">Latham, Mark, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LATHAM</name><name.id>K26</name.id><electorate>Werriwa</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Prime Minister.

The answer to the interpretation placed on their stance by the Leader of the Opposition is that what he says is wrong, because the free trade agreement will not increase the price of generic drugs. The whole basis of what is being put forward by the Leader of the Opposition is wrong. It was not even the conclusion of his own trade spokesman.

The false claim is that the free trade agreement undermines the PBS. It does not. That was even the conclusion of Senator Conroy. What the Leader of the Opposition is proposing is an amendment based on a total misunderstanding of how the patent law of Australia operates. He is proposing an amendment that might be relevant if we were in the American Congress, where you have a completely different patent law. It might be relevant if you had automatic injunctions available, where you did have a true operation of this evergreening process. But that simply does not operate in Australia, and if the Leader of the Opposition had bothered to read the legislation, if he had bothered to read the Senate report, he might have come to that conclusion.</para><para>We are opposed to the Leader of the Opposition's amendment because we think it is unnecessary. It proceeds upon a misunderstanding of the patent law in this country. We are also against it because it would harm the operation of the existing intellectual property law. It would introduce an element of uncertainty. It would discourage investment. It would discourage innovation and the creation of new ideas, which are precisely the things that this country ought to be encouraging rather than discouraging.

Members of his own party recognise that this is unnecessary. The member for Brand,  in his contribution during the debate in the parliament, argued for the agreement with no such condition. We know from media reports that the member for Griffith and Senator Sherry argued in caucus that it was not necessary. In the paper today the head of the Generic Medicines Industry Association, and head of the generic company Alphapharm, also said it is not necessary. I quote from the head of the organisation that the Labor Party purport to represent the interests of in this debate. He said:</para><quote><para>The Government has repeatedly assured us there will be no delay to the market entry of generic medicines and we believe that the legislation is consistent with this.</para></quote><para>That is from the head of the generic drug industry of Australia.

Regional Australia is an export powerhouse—there is no doubt about that—and that power, it has to be said, no longer rests exclusively on primary production. Rural industries have diversified enormously in recent years. It might be the case that the ALP thinks that manufacturing businesses should exist only in the city, but in fact such businesses, large and small, are spread liberally right throughout regional Australia. For example, our largest manufacturing sector, food processing, is largely based in regional Australia.</para></talk.start><para>In relation to the benefits of the free trade agreement, there can be no question that the benefits are very real. The removal of tariffs in the processed food and horticultural sectors will benefit these important regional employers greatly. The wine industry—a major regional industry, a major regional value-adder—will benefit very greatly by the wind-down in US tariffs. The metals and minerals export sectors, which are regionally based of course, will be more competitive with the immediate withdrawal of US duties.</para><para>I will give a couple of specific examples of manufacturers in country areas, in Guyra and New England. Ruddweigh make high-technology livestock and grain weighing equipment. They use world-leading technology. They have been trying to develop a market in the US for years. When my office spoke to them recently, they were emphatic that this deal ought to be passed and passed as soon as possible because it will have a major and very positive impact on their ability to export to the United States and to develop further jobs in the country town of Guyra in New South Wales. Then there is Permadrive on the North Coast of New South Wales, around Ballina. There will be members who are familiar with this company's development of extraordinary hydraulic technology to conserve energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. They have recently been faced with having to develop a subsidiary company in the US in order to satisfy American requirements with regard to enormous potential defence contracts. Under the free trade agreement they would not have to do so. They could deal directly, as though they were an American company dealing with their American market. This is potentially very important. Their market is the largest truck fleet in the world: the US military. They want the free trade agreement. They do not want an impediment to it. These examples highlight how important the free trade agreement is to rural and regional Australia. </para><para>Whilst the bottom line is that the ALP in this place want to be half pregnant on this—they do not want to come one way or the other way cleanly; they cannot make up their minds—it is a reality that not only have you got strong industry support out there but there are enlightened members of the labour movement that can see it as well. I note that Bill Ludwig, the National President of the Australian Workers Union, said that it ought to be supported. He said: `Overall, you have to say yes. With a population of 300 million over there'—meaning the US—`that's not a bad market to get into.'</para><para>It occurred to me that history always provides some interesting illustrations of the value of previous government actions and some insights into the sort of leadership or otherwise provided by those who were not in government. I thought it would be interesting to have a look at the Australia-Japan pact of 1957. That was pretty controversial at the time. We know now, of course, that it has been of enormous benefit to Australia, beyond the wildest dreams of those who promoted it at the time. It has been responsible for a lot of those jobs that the Minister for Trade talks about: one in five across Australia and one in four in regional Australia. I had a look at the Gallup polls of the day. They show that, despite it being only 12 years after the end of the Second World War, Australians overwhelmingly supported the Australia-Japan pact. But the interesting thing about it is that the ALP of the day at least knew where they stood: they opposed it. Dr Evatt opposed it. He was wrong—the Australian people were right—but what is to be said for it is that he displayed leadership. He did not believe in it, and he came out cleanly and said, `We don't support it.' He took a position.</para><para>We are by any definition not terribly far out from the point when the Leader of the Opposition will want to portray himself as a serious contender for the leadership of this nation. I have to say to you that if you cannot make up your mind on something as basic and as obviously beneficial to the Australian community, the economy and jobs—particularly jobs in regional Australia—as the free trade agreement, you are certainly in no position to assume the leadership of the nation.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Trade: Free Trade Agreement</title><page.no>32109</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>32109</page.no><name role="metadata">Latham, Mark, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LATHAM</name><name.id>K26</name.id><electorate>Werriwa</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Prime Minister and it follows the earlier answer by the Minister for Health and Ageing.

The government does believe that the relationship with the United States is vitally important to this country. It is vitally important to our security, and not just because we have a formal treaty, the ANZUS treaty, which was entered into by a coalition government many years ago, but because when dealing with the security threats of our region the United States is a key—a fundamentally important—player. The United States is fundamental to the war against terrorism in South-East Asia; the United States is fundamental to the resolution of the problem on the Korean peninsula. The United States has been a great partner of Australia's in cooperation in dealing with those issues but also on issues such as East Timor.</para></talk.start><para>The government make no apology for believing very passionately that this alliance relationship is in Australia's national interest. We are proud of the way we have built the relationship up over the years from the Sydney declaration in 1996 through to, most recently, a free trade agreement between Australia and the world's largest economy, giving us such outstanding access to that economy.</para><para>Are there any alternative views? There are the views about America and the American alliance so often expressed by the Leader of the Opposition. There was a debate some months ago about bringing Australian troops out of Iraq by Christmas. An American-led exercise to overthrow Saddam Hussein—an American-led exercise to help provide stability and democracy in Iraq—is one that the Leader of the Opposition off the top of his head on a radio program decided he wanted to abandon through his cut and run policy of 23 March. I concede the point that he thought that up just off the top of his head. He has had eight different policies on `troops out by Christmas' since—a total of nine `troops out by Christmas' policies since 23 March.</para><para>We are seeing exactly the same phenomenon with the free trade agreement. The free trade agreement with Singapore was not questioned by the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition asked no questions and showed no interest in the implications for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme of the free trade agreement with Thailand. It was of no interest—it was not even examined. I doubt whether the Leader of the Opposition has had that document in his hands. I doubt it very much. Why? Because Thailand and Singapore are not the United States of America. The reason the Leader of the Opposition has been attacking the free trade agreement with the United States of America is that it is with America. He has had four different positions on this issue. He was against it in February. He said it was not a free trade agreement in July. We thought he was going to support it two or three days ago. Then he came up with his sham amendments in order to provide the opportunity of rejecting it. </para><para>The fact is that the common themes here are twofold. The first is the visceral anti-Americanism of the Leader of the Opposition and many, but not all, in his own party. That comes through over and over again. The second is policy on the run. On the pharmaceutical issue, the Leader of the Opposition has made up the policy overnight without having any understanding of Australian patents law, and he is now trying to work out how he is going to defend his policy. He has absolutely no understanding of how the existing law would work in the first place and no understanding of what the consequences of his amendments would be. They would destroy innovation in this country. People simply would not lodge applications for patents if those applications, on failing, were to incur a financial penalty. It just has not been thought through. The Leader of the Opposition has no idea. It is yet another example of his wild and erratic policy ride and making things up on the run, all of which is built on the foundation of a visceral anti-Americanism—a very dangerous formula for somebody who one day wishes to become the Prime Minister of this country.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Education: University Fees</title><page.no>32111</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>32111</page.no><name role="metadata">Macklin, Jenny, MP</name><name role="display">Ms MACKLIN</name><name.id>PG6</name.id><electorate>Jagajaga</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Minister for Education, Science and Training.

As to the answer the Labor Party puts up to that question, in its policy the Labor Party is saying that the 136,000 foreign students in Australian universities have greater rights to access Australian universities than Australian citizens. The fact is that this government is expanding the number of HECS places, where the taxpayer pays for three-quarters of the cost of the university education, by 36,000 over the next four years.

If we look at medicine, we see that right across Australia there are 530,000 undergraduates in Australian universities. Today there are 11,000 Australians paying their own way. They have academic scores of 99 or 98 and they missed out on a HECS place. The price they pay for that is not getting a public subsidy, a taxpayer subsidy. But they are paying their own way. What this government has said is that, from next year, every student who is offered a fee paying place for the first time will be offered a loan from the Australian taxpayer—a HECS style loan, for which the government funds the university—and the student, rich or poor, does not have to pay a cent back until they are working and earning in excess of $36,000 a year. There are 784 courses in this country where full fee paying places are offered. There are only 16 courses enrolling 300 students that cost anywhere near $100,000.

As a member who represents a lot of beef and dairy producers, the member for Page would be eagerly looking forward to some of those benefits starting to flow to Australian farmers from 1 January next year. It is not some time far off in the distance; these benefits can flow immediately. For instance, for beef producers the tariff on in-quota deliveries of beef—and that is nearly all of our exports—is lifted entirely, immediately. So there will be significant benefits there from day one. Indeed, as the quota grows over the years, the benefits to the industry also expand. It has been estimated that there are about $3 billion worth of additional benefits for Australian beef producers over the first 20 years of this agreement.</para></talk.start><para>Benefits to the dairy industry are estimated at about $1½ billion over that period—very substantial amounts indeed. The tariff on wool is eliminated over four years. The tariffs on lamb and mutton all go, most of them immediately and others over four years. The tariff on wine exports is eliminated over 11 years. That is worth about $38 million a year to this wonderful Australian industry. And of course there will be immediate tariff reductions on a whole range of horticultural products, immediate elimination of the tariff on cotton seeds, elimination also of tariffs on seafood, wheat and grain products and a whole range of other agricultural produce—enormous benefits, immediately.</para><para>It is amazing, therefore, that there has not been a demand, particularly from the shadow minister for agriculture—who I notice is missing—that the Labor Party support this free trade agreement immediately. This is something that can deliver billions of dollars of benefits to Australian agriculture, and no-one opposite is demanding that the Leader of the Opposition get out of the way and allow this package of legislation to pass. It is high time the spurious amendments proposed by the Leader of the Opposition be put aside so that these benefits can flow immediately to farmers. This offers potentially the biggest boost in farm incomes from any trade measure that we have been able to undertake in generations. As the Deputy Prime Minister mentioned a few moments ago, it can be compared with the breakthroughs that occurred as a result of the arrangements with Japan. Here is a wonderful new opportunity, and it is time the Leader of the Opposition got out of the way and allowed farmers to start reaping the benefits.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Education: University Fees</title><page.no>32113</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>32113</page.no><name role="metadata">Macklin, Jenny, MP</name><name role="display">Ms MACKLIN</name><name.id>PG6</name.id><electorate>Jagajaga</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is again to the Minister for Education, Science and Training.

The Labor Party's attitude here is that in some way Australians have fewer rights in their universities. Despite the fact that they work hard and their parents pay taxes, the Labor Party says they have fewer rights. The Labor Party is also seeking, in this and a number of areas, to falsely mislead Australians into thinking that what the government are doing is reducing HECS places and replacing them with fee-paying places. In fact the reality is that, at a cost of $2½ billion to Australian taxpayers—many of whom have never seen the inside of a university—we are expanding HECS places by 36,000 over four years and then saying to the students of Australia, `If you work hard and the opportunity is offered to be a fee-paying student, not only do you have the right of choice if you want to take it up but for the first time a loan will be available.'</para></talk.start></continue><para>The Labor Party have a problem with two things.

Under its provisions, it would be an offence to intentionally associate with a person who is a member of a listed terrorist organisation or who promotes or directs the activities of a listed terrorist organisation, where that association provides support that would help the terrorist organisation continue to exist or expand. The fact is that terrorist organisations depend upon contact and integration with the community as a whole in order to survive and expand. This bill seeks to cut off this source of support to such organisations, particularly those organisations that engage in terror from behind the veil of the broader community.

This is what I have described as the new politics—more public participation and more involvement in the decisions of government. Of course, it took a long time for the Howard government to deliver all the information about the FTA. The final appeal mechanism for the PBS, for example, was only delivered to the public arena 10 days ago.</para></talk.start><para>We know, of course, that at the beginning of this year the government rushed in and left sugar out. At one time, the Deputy Prime Minister said that it would be un-Australian to leave sugar out of this agreement, but that is exactly what they did. By the definition of the Leader of the National Party, the government did an un-Australian thing. By contrast, the Labor Party were determined to get it right and, despite the Prime Minister's bagging of the Senate committee and his bagging of the process by which these matters were considered, we thought it was the right thing to look at it in a thorough and considered way. </para><para>Already I can report a dividend on our approach, with the Prime Minister giving ground on the question of cultural content. Would it have happened if not for the Senate committee and the Labor Party amendments? No way in the world. There is no way in the world that this Prime Minister would have given ground on the issue of cultural content, if the Labor Party had not raised the issue, if it had not been considered by the Senate report and if strong Senate recommendations had not been made on this subject. The current rules would have been inadequate. The current rules would have left the matter of this nation's great cultural content to the Australian Broadcasting Authority—that is, a David Flint type flunkey in the future would have been the custodian of the local content rules and it would have taken a resolution of both houses of parliament to disallow a weakening of those cultural content rules.</para><para>If it had been left to the Prime Minister and the government, we would have had a hopelessly inadequate situation, with no practical safeguards against someone like David Flint down at the ABA weakening away the local content rules and then, under the trade agreement with the United States, the ratchet provisions ensuring that they could never be lifted again in the future. The Labor Party have a different approach. We have suggested amendments that would write the current local content rules into the schedule of the trade agreement and into the enabling legislation of the trade agreement. Then any attempt to water things down would require the approval of both houses: that is, it would not happen—it would not happen in the future. Only Labor are bringing forward recommendations to ensure that those content rules cannot be watered down in the future. We want to enshrine them in the schedule of the enabling legislation to the FTA. That way it would require both houses to water them down, and that would not happen in practical terms.</para><para>But the Prime Minister says he is now considering Labor's amendment. Well, it is long overdue. If he had not rushed into the agreement, if he had a thorough respect for the Senate process, it would have happened before now. Of course we saw his remarkable comments.

It is only through Labor that we have now got the Prime Minister headed in the right direction—a direction which will ensure, under our amendments, that we have still got Australian faces on Australian TV, that we have still got Australian voices on Australian radio.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We say that we in this country should be proud of our culture. We respect the culture of other nations right around the world, but there is something special about Australian culture. There is something distinctive about the Australian way of expressing ourselves, of relating to other people. Whether we call it the larrikin spirit, Australian mateship or any other description, we all know as proud Australians on this side of the House that there is something special about Australian culture. There is something special about the Australian way of expressing ourselves in the media. That is why we support the local content rules. That is why we would never tolerate a situation where in the future, someone like David Flint down at the ABA—a Flint type flunky—could erode the local content rules and where, in practical terms, there would be nothing the Australian parliament could do about it. </para><para>We have seen already, through the deliberations and the decisions of the Labor Party, a dividend on the Senate committee process. The Prime Minister is moving in the right direction. We do not know if that means enshrining these rules in regulation or putting them into the schedule of the enabling legislation, which is Labor's preferred approach. But we have got the first sign of a dividend coming through on the deliberative, considered process that we embarked on at the beginning of this year.</para><para>Now the Labor Party is looking for a second dividend, given the major public concern about evergreening and the impact on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The new notification system, whereby generics are required to tell patent companies, will of course have an incentive, an encouragement, for patent companies to evergreen—that is, to lodge bodgie applications not based on the chemical content of the particular product but rather on commercial considerations; it is what is described as the `different coloured pill scenario'. These bodgie applications would be designed to delay the entry of new generic drugs into the Australian market—generic drugs that would be cheaper for the PBS, cheaper for the Australian people.</para><para>There are, of course, sensible Senate recommendations. The Labor senators have put forward recommendation No. 25 to create fines and offences for spurious patent claims. Of course, the government is doing exactly the same thing under the Therapeutic Goods Act for false patent certificates lodged by generic companies. The government, for these certificates that are not valid relating to patents, is planning to impose $110,000 fines plus criminal offences. The government is writing these things into the FTA enabling legislation. It is there in black and white—an amendment to the Therapeutic Goods Act so that the generic companies would face fines of $110,000 and, indeed, criminal offences. We make the simple proposition: why not the same set of fines for the patent companies? The concerns are well known. They have been well aired in the public arena. Why take a risk with the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme? Why take the risk of delaying the entry of generic drugs onto the Australian market when there is a recommendation that provides a safeguard—a guarantee, a peace of mind—for the Australian people?</para><para>In this area the stakes are high. The generics can produce a price decrease of 30 per cent—so valuable to the Australian people, so valuable to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, so valuable to Australian pharmaceutical consumers. Just have a look at the impact of generics in the area of Prozac, used for the treatment of depression. The generics drive down the cost of a packet by $20—a really significant impact for the benefit of consumers. So too the impact on Zantac, for the treatment of ulcers and reflux, with generics driving down the price per packet by $20. For Australian consumers over time, and given that the FTA is forever, these are genuine concerns. If we can get the generics onto the market faster—certainly with no delay—there are enormous cost-of-living benefits to the Australian people, particularly the low-income earners who most need that assistance. </para><para>I say to the Howard government: why not provide the safeguard amendments to ensure these benefits are available? Why not provide the safeguard amendments to ensure these benefits are available now and into the future? The government has a few firewall excuses, a few things it has put up. Firstly, Minister Vaile has said that the government regard it as unnecessary. That is what he said in his press release yesterday: `The government rejects as unnecessary a second condition on Labor's FTA support.' If they regard it as unnecessary, if the Prime Minister is saying that these bodgie applications will not be lodged in the future, what has he to fear from Labor's amendments? If he is saying that these are penalties that will never be imposed, what has he got to fear from Labor's amendment, passing it through and getting his FTA?</para><para>I fear that this is a case of the Prime Minister yet again not being honest with the Australian people. We know the Prime Minister is under pressure from the pharmaceutical companies. And so far he is supporting their side of the argument. If the Prime Minister has nothing to fear, if the minister thinks it is unnecessary, pass Labor's amendment. Pass Labor's amendment as a safeguard for the future of pharmaceutical prices in this country. This is an example of the Prime Minister not being honest and frank with the Australian people. We say he should not take the risk. He should reject the arguments from the pharmaceutical companies and side with the Australian consumers.</para><para>The second argument the government have put forward—and this is their new argument today—is that the Labor amendments would be unworkable. Why then is the government amending the Therapeutic Goods Act to fine generic companies that lodge false applications and certificates with regard to patents?</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>K26</name.id><name role="metadata">Latham, Mark, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LATHAM</name></talker><para>—Why don't they do the same with regard to spurious patent applications from the major companies?</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—The member for Hotham has been warned!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>K26</name.id><name role="metadata">Latham, Mark, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LATHAM</name></talker><para>—Labor's Senate amendments are sound. The government are actually going down this path of new fines, new criminal offences and new penalties in the FTA enabling legislation, but they are only doing it on one side of the street. They are only doing it to the generic companies instead of targeting the problem of potentially spurious patent applications. Why have one set of rules—one set of fines for the generic companies? Why not apply those fines and penalties across the board and ensure that the safeguards are in place for the benefit of the Australian people?</para></talk.start></continue><para>I hear the Minister for Foreign Affairs scoffing away about all this. What does he say? What does he say to the Australian Medical Association about their support for Labor's amendment? If he will not take the word of the Labor Party, he should take the word of the AMA, because the AMA have welcomed the decision of the federal Labor Party to support the FTA, subject to the legislative amendments that safeguard the PBS. Let me read from the AMA press release:</para><quote><para>... the right of generic pharmaceuticals to be marketed as soon as the originator patent expires must be guaranteed.</para></quote><para>That is what the Australian Medical Association are saying. It is a sad day for health policy in this country when the Minister for Trade, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Health and Ageing and the Prime Minister himself are not willing to listen to the Australian Medical Association on a matter as important as this. The AMA say: </para><quote><para>This legislation should ensure that the FTA does not undermine the PBS ...</para></quote><para>They say that these safeguards must be in place before Australia signs off on the FTA. It is not just the AMA who have flagged these concerns. The JSCOT report, from the inquiry which was chaired by the member for Boothby, raises concerns about the impact of the FTA on the generics. JSCOT made some observations and recommendations that flagged a very similar concern to the one now being raised by the Labor Party. It is the AMA, the Senate report and the JSCOT report making all these recommendations, but the government is not listening to commonsense. The government is not listening to what it would otherwise regard as its own interests. It says that it wants the trade agreement passed through the Senate. It has given ground on the cultural content rules. If it is good enough to do it on Labor's first amendment, it should be done on both amendments. It should be done on both amendments because it is our determination to fight for these amendments. We insisted on the review process in the first place, and that has raised valid concerns on behalf of the Australian people.</para><para>There are two matters outstanding that need to be addressed in the legislative process. The text of the FTA is not in dispute. What needs to happen is the strengthening of the enabling legislation. Strengthen the enabling legislation to ensure that the cultural content rules are part of the schedule. They should be scheduled into the legislation itself so there is a guarantee for the Australian people that we are going to have Australian faces on TV and Australian voices on radio and we are not going to have those rules weakened into the future. Labor also has sensible amendments to protect the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme to ensure there is absolutely no delay in getting generic pharmaceutical products onto the Australian market.</para><para>If this government were fair dinkum about the national interest, if it were fair dinkum about good policy making, if it were fair dinkum about the trade agreement and the process and the legislation in the Senate, it would pass the Labor amendments this week in the interests of the Australian people.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>R36</name.id><name role="metadata">Albanese, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Three days next time, I might warn the member for Grayndler!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>K26</name.id><name role="metadata">Latham, Mark, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LATHAM</name></talker><para>—We are going to fight and insist for those interests all the way down the line.

From the day that we concluded these negotiations in Washington, we have contended that we have done that and that we have delivered in full the commitments that we made to the Australian people in terms of our objectives on those defensive issues that we went to prosecute in the negotiations in Washington.</para></talk.start><para>The Leader of the Opposition is alleging that, because there is an undertaking in the free trade agreement to notify, by certification, a patent holder of the advent of a generic drug on the market through the TGA process or to provide a certificate that one does not exist, that automatically is going to lead to a process of evergreening, as it is known in the United States. We argue quite clearly that that will not and cannot happen in Australia. The systems are totally different. We have given an undertaking in this agreement that, when a producer of a generic drug—that is, a drug that has been developed for use after the expiry of a patent drug—goes to the TGA for registration of their drug, one of the conditions is that they should either supply a certificate that indicates whether a patent exists on that drug and whether the patent holder has been notified or supply a certificate to the TGA that there is no patent in existence. That is the end of the story when that certificate is delivered. </para><para>It is alleged then that, through that notification process, patent holders are going to embark upon the sorts of litigious interventions that stop generic drugs getting onto the market—the way it sometimes happens under the American system. That cannot happen in Australia because we have a totally different system. We heard the Leader of the Opposition during question time and earlier on the MPI argue that this is about protecting the PBS. We have protected the PBS as a result of these negotiations and the undertakings in the agreement.</para><para>I will now go to the core issue of the challenge that could be raised to the registration of generic drugs. In the United States, if the originator—that is, the patent holder—files patent infringement litigation against the generic applicant, an automatic 30-month injunction is available, thereby preventing the generic application from being approved and the generic drug coming onto the market during that 30-month period.</para><para>In Australia, no automatic injunction is available outside of the court process. As was indicated during question time, it can only be instigated by a patent holder, not someone that has a patent pending. It should be noted that a patent applicant cannot take action against an alleged infringement of their invention until the patent has been granted, thus limiting the scope for patent applications to be used to frustrate legitimate exploitation of non-patented material.</para><para>It is also important to note the very clear difference between the Australian and American systems. In America, if a drug company has a patented drug for a particular use—for example, if the drug is for use by adults—they can automatically get an extension after the expiration of that patent for use by children. That does not exist in Australia. The ability to seek that 30-month injunction does not exist in Australia, so it is a totally different circumstance. The government's argument against this proposition is that the basis of the proposition—that, as a result of the FTA, we are opening the system up to more litigation and to patent holders slowing down or stopping the flow of generic drugs onto the marketplace—is false. The unworkability of this is, if you apply this sort of punitive measure to what are being loosely called spurious applications, will that then affect the entire patent law? Are you expecting to amend the entire patent law, which encourages the development of innovation and technology in this country? Are we going to destroy the ambition of innovators in this country? If they are going to have an adjudication on whether their argument for a patent is spurious and therefore they are going to be hit with a punitive action, are we going to destroy that innovation in this country? We argue we should not be doing that on a false premise. We argue that the premise by which this is being raised is false and unnecessary.</para><para>I will go back to the objectives that we set out to achieve in this negotiation. I was involved on behalf of government in negotiating this agreement, both on the offensive issues—the issues that we wanted to achieve in terms of improved market access and removing barriers to trade between our two countries—and of course on these all-important defensive issues, and they exist in every negotiation. That is what, in the end, creates a finely balanced negotiated outcome where you do not always get everything you want. We know that we did not get everything that we wanted, and we put our hands up and said, `We didn't achieve that.' We wanted to achieve more. But nor did the Americans achieve everything that they went out to achieve, and this is one area where they were really energetic, pushing hard to open up. We argued long and hard during the negotiations that our system in Australia was extremely unique. There are many countries in the world that want to replicate what we do in Australia. We saw that on the <inline font-style="italic">Four Corners</inline> program on Monday night. We know that, and that is why we want to always defend the structure, the sustainability and the pricing and listing mechanisms that we have in the PBS today, and we did. The PBS is not under threat as a result of the free trade agreement. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>8K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

One of the American ambitions in the negotiations was to extend the data protection period on patented drugs from five years to eight years. That is what exists in the United States—an eight-year protection on the molecular structure of the patented drugs. In Australia today, it is five years. On 1 January 2005, when this agreement enters into force, it will still be five years. We resisted that move because we knew exactly the impact that would have on the generic drug industry in Australia: pushing back by three years their ability to get on the market. We resisted that, and that is not in this agreement.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It is a very important point in terms of highlighting the government's position and the energy and focus that we put into protecting the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme as we know it in Australia. We are unlike many other countries in the world because the taxpayers of Australia invest hundreds of millions of dollars in research into and development of pharmaceuticals in this country. We argued for weeks in this negotiation that that made us different to anybody else in the world, and that we are not freeloading on American or European innovation. We pay our way in this country. But we were going to defend the right of this government and our nation to maintain one of the best structured health systems in the world—the core of that being the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme—and we have done that.</para><para>So we are quite prepared to stand and debate this issue of whether or not the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is being opened up to weakening as a result of this agreement. We say it is not being opened up to weakening. The points I have outlined here and the points that have been made during question time today show that we have defended that. We have defended vigorously the ability of the generic drug industry in Australia to get their product onto the market in a timely fashion—and not just to get it onto the Australian market but to springboard it into third-country markets overseas. This is a very important element, because we want to maintain a sustainable, viable and competitive generic drug industry in this country. It is a very valuable industry in this country. </para><para>The other issue, that was raised by the opposition yesterday and has been raised again today with this MPI, is with regard to the audiovisual sector and local content rules in the services sector of the FTA. It is another area of great importance to a nation of only 20 million people with a unique culture and a unique way of life that is not necessarily impacted upon as much as many other countries in the world by an influx through the media of culture from other parts of the world.</para><para>From the outset we had a clear indication from the industry involved, if I can term it that way—from the audiovisual sector, the actors, the creative people, the writers, the directors, the producers, the opposition and our own backbench—that we must at all costs retain the ability, to put it in its simplest terms, to deliver Australian stories, with Australian voices, on Australian free-to-air television and radio and at the same time maintain a structure in this country so that the people who work in those industries have the ability, between major projects, to get work in the advertising industry. That was a critical element that is often overlooked in what we achieved in this—that we achieved the same reservation on the 80 per cent local content rules on commercial advertisements on free-to-air television. As for maintaining the 55 per cent local content rules on free-to-air television, whether on an analog platform or moving to a digital platform, that has been done, achieved, reserved in this agreement. What about the reservation by value of Australian local content on pay TV—which was 10 per cent and we got a variation in there that we can move it up to 20 per cent, plus subquota sectors? It is done, agreed, in the agreement.</para><para>There was the sensitive issue of future media—some aspects and platforms that we do not even know exist yet but that we know will be developed as the technology develops. How can you codify or prescribe a reservation in that area? In the agreement there is a reservation that says that if an Australian government believes that Australian culture is unnecessarily being excluded from future media it reserves the right to intervene. We have the ability to intervene and put local content rules in the area of new electronic media beyond that which we know today. So there is no question that we have protected our ability to maintain acceptable levels of local content on free-to-air television and radio in the Australian system as part of the reservations that we have negotiated in this agreement.</para><para>I go back to my earlier point. When we embarked upon this negotiation we knew it was going to be tough, because prior to this there had only ever been two negotiated agreements between highly developed and competitive economies such as the United States and Australia. One was between Australia and New Zealand—the CER agreement that was negotiated over 20 years ago. The other was NAFTA, between the United States and Canada. We knew how tough they were to negotiate. This was going to be much more difficult, not just because we were going to be negotiating traditional areas of trade in commodities and manufactured goods—and even new areas like services and government procurement—but because we were going to get into the technology sector. We knew that it was going to be very difficult in the technology sector and that we had to defend the position in particular areas. We maintain that we absolutely have, in the interests of our nation. We knew that we were going to have to prosecute a position in areas that we wanted to gain extra access in—that is, the manufactured goods, services, government procurement and agricultural commodities sectors. At the end of that, our responsibility as a government, given this opportunity, was to make a decision whether overall, on balance, the deal was in the national interest. </para><para>One revelation that we have seen this week—notwithstanding the qualifications from the Leader of the Opposition—is that the Labor Party and the Leader of the Opposition have now acknowledged, and in their press release have listed, a whole page full of reasons why the Australia-United States free trade agreement is in the national interest. We welcome that. We welcome that support and commitment to the national interest, not just for Australians living today who want to do business with America but for future generations for decades to come, because of the economic benefit that will flow from this agreement in the future.</para><para>So we come down to a couple of very narrow, very important issues. We are not disputing that they are very important issues, but they are issues that we have dealt with in this negotiation. We have protected the national interest on these issues. We have protected Australia's ability to maintain local content rules on free-to-air television, as we said we would. We have protected the structure, the sustainability and the viability of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, as we said we would before I left Australia to negotiate this agreement.

Let me explain it to you, Minister, because you clearly do not understand. It is a simple issue. Over the last few days we have watched the Prime Minister squirm and flip and flop because he does not know what to do in the face of Labor's proposal that we had better protect the PBS. Yesterday he said, the first time around, `We'll have a look at it,' then by the middle of question time he had ruled it out. By the end of the day he had had a cabinet meeting to rule it out.

So the simple proposition—the one that apparently the whole Howard government, from the Prime Minister down, is incapable of understanding—is that, if you are the holder of a valuable patent and you get notice that someone is going into the market in competition against you, you will probably try some novel and innovative legal strategies to protect yourself. It is a simple proposition. Anybody you stopped in the street outside would manage to understand it after a minute's explanation. No-one in the Howard government is capable of understanding that simple proposition—not one of them.</para></talk.start></continue><para>What Labor is saying is: let us send a different price signal to the holder of the patent. Let us say to the holder of the patent: `If you actually embark on filing spurious, dodgy patent claims as part of a strategy cooked up with your lawyers to keep the generic out of the market and to keep you selling your patented drug and earning money, we are going to fine you a lot of money. We are going to fine you so much money that, when you do the maths on day one and you ask yourself whether it is worth ringing the lawyers, getting the crack accountants on it, filing the new patent, taking legal action and copping the penalty, the maths is going to come out that it is not worth you doing that.' That is what Labor's proposed amendment is.</para><para>I do not need the Minister for Trade, the Minister for Health and Ageing or the Prime Minister to believe that this is going to happen every second day; it is bad enough if it happens once. If this stops it once then it could have stopped a situation that would have cost Australian taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars. When drugs come off patent, that is what is involved: hundreds of millions of dollars. Two classes of drugs—two big classes—are coming off patent in the next four years: statins, which are about cholesterol, and serotonins, which are an antidepressive medication. The estimated savings from those two alone are $900 million. You do not really need to have it happen many times before a government—and taxpayers—can be hundreds of millions of dollars down, and that threatens the PBS.</para><para>It is the simplest series of propositions. If you actually cared about the PBS—if you cared about the merits of the issue instead of the cheapjack politics—then you would say to Labor, `Let's sit down and work out the text of the amendment and we will pass it.' That is what we are asking the Prime Minister to do. The Prime Minister is always full of advice for others. He has spent many weeks giving the Labor Party advice on the FTA. I would like to give him some back: Prime Minister, call this one for Australia. You advised Mark Latham to do that time after time. It is time the Prime Minister did it himself. If he calls this one for Australia then he will work with Labor to amend and better protect our PBS. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>32128</page.no><name role="metadata">Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP</name><name role="display">Dr SOUTHCOTT</name><name.id>TK6</name.id><electorate>Boothby</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The previous speaker, the member for Lalor, has a fairly unique record on the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement legislation: in the House she voted for it; in the shadow ministry she opposed it; in the Labor Party caucus meeting she was locked into the proposition that is before us now, which is passage of the free trade agreement with two amendments. The outcome of the negotiations was known to us in the early hours of 9 February and we now are in August: it has taken six months to find out where the Labor Party stands on this free trade agreement.</para></talk.start><para>I have to confess that I held the view they would look at either further delay or renegotiation. But I just knew that, when it came to the proposition of a yes or no vote, the Labor Party would never be able to hang together on the free trade agreement. When the three Independents and the Green member forced a division on the free trade agreement in the House of Representatives, we saw 14 Labor members cross the floor and vote for the free trade agreement with the government and 42 members of the Labor Party walk out the door. So there were three members for every one member who voted for it. We know that some Labor senators will never be able to vote for this agreement, and the amendments need to be dealt with separately. But the amendments do nothing to what was negotiated back in February.</para><para>The central proposition run by the Labor Party for six months was that Australia—through Mark Vaile and Stephen Deady—had not negotiated a good deal for Australia. Their central proposition presumably was that the Labor Party's standing in the United States is so high and their negotiator, Senator Conroy, is such a good negotiator that he would have got much better access and been much more successful in defending the offensive claims of the United States. That is laughable; that is absolutely laughable.</para><para>The parliament has had a Joint Standing Committee on Treaties since 1996, and this committee has looked at all treaties that have been signed by Australia in that period; we did not have a treaties committee prior to that date. So, as a matter of course, the free trade agreement with the United States was referred to the treaties committee. We had a threemonth inquiry. We received 215 submissions and we held 11 days of public hearings in seven cities around Australia.</para><para>There are sixteen members of the treaties committee; there are six members of the Labor Party on the treaties committee; there are three Labor senators on the treaties committee: Senators Marshall, Kirk and Stevens. There are as many Labor senators on the treaties committee as there are on the Senate select committee on the free trade agreement. But the problem that the Labor Party had with this committee was that it was government dominated—nine government members, one Democrat member and six Labor Party members—so we had to have a Senate select committee. The Senate select committee was set up by a vote of the Senate on 11 February. It was proposed initially that it would take three months to report; in the end it took six months. It missed its deadline twice. It did not really commence work until May. But as Sir Humphrey Appleby advised his minister, never establish a committee until you know the outcome. This was advice that the Labor Party took to heart: they only trusted a committee which was originally constituted by five non-government members and two government members to give them the answer they wanted. It descended into high farce over the weekend when we had Labor senators on the committee saying they were awaiting direction from the caucus and the caucus waiting for six months saying they were awaiting direction from the senators on the committee. </para><para>This week, we know, was judgment day; it was Labor coming to judgment day on the free trade agreement. According to the commentary, depending on whether you talk to a member of the left or a member of the right, there are two views as to what has been agreed. So the Labor Party, in continuing to paper over the divisions that exist within it on this issue, have come up with two amendments. One is an amendment that the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties—the committee which the Labor Party never trusted to give it a fair hearing—came up with. It is a very simple amendment: instead of the ABA being responsible for and able to change the local content rules—as has been the case since 1992—local content rules can only be changed by a deliberative decision of the parliament. That is a sensible recommendation. It does nothing to change the intent of the free trade agreement and it is certainly within the spirit of the text.</para><para>We made that recommendation because of the ratchet provision, but I have to inform members that it is only measures in annex 1 of the cultural material which are subject to a ratchet provision. That means it is only for free-to-air commercial television for both analog and digital broadcasting but on a single channel and it includes the 55 per cent quota and the 80 per cent quota for advertising. But the other annex 2 issues—multichanneling, subscription television, commercial radio broadcasting and interactive audio and video services—are not subject to a ratchet provision at all. The Labor amendment, I think, is a worthy amendment, but we had actually come up with it five weeks ago and so there was no need to wait another five weeks while we had a Senate select committee. This amendment does nothing but preserve the negotiating position of Mark Vaile and the Australian negotiators, which is to keep the 55 per cent for local content and the 80 per cent for advertising.</para><para>We also had evidence on the patent stuff. There were concerns raised by different groups, including the Australasian Society for HIV Medicine and the National Association of People Living with HIV-AIDS. Their main concern was that we would adopt the American practices. Australian patent law is remaining basically the same, and the view of the committee—and the Labor members of the committee—was:</para><quote><para>The Committee accepts however that the situation in Australia will be different due to our different legal and regulatory environment ...</para></quote><para>We understood the concerns, but we did not believe that, due to the different ways that the Patents Act operates, we would see the process of evergreening. We all know that evergreening occurs in the United States, but it does not mean that because we have signed the free trade agreement we are going to adopt evergreening. That just does not follow. There are all sorts of things in the American legal system, such as the right to bear arms, presidential term limits and so on, that we do not have in Australia. Signing the free trade agreement does not mean we are going to adopt them. Very simply, to apply for a patent in Australia you apply to IP Australia. The length of a patent is 20 plus five years. There are provisional patents in both the United States and Australia, but the difference is that in Australia provisional patents do not acquire legal rights; they do in the United States. We have not seen evergreening in Australia. </para><para>The big question for the Labor Party is: will they block the free trade agreement based on an amendment which is unnecessary and which was not the central issue that was raised over the last six months? In the speech from the shadow minister for health and in the questions from the Leader of the Opposition did we hear one thing about the review process for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme? Did we hear one thing about the review process for the PBAC? This is an admission by the Labor Party that pharmaceutical prices on the PBS will not rise. It is because the review process that we outlined in our discussion paper which was released by the minister for health on 25 July is fair—<inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>32130</page.no><name role="metadata">Organ, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ORGAN</name><name.id>BNL</name.id><electorate>Cunningham</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I welcome the opportunity to speak to the Leader of the Opposition's MPI regarding the government's failure to adequately protect the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and Australia's cultural content rules in its free trade agreement enabling legislation. There is no doubt that the enabling legislation is a dud. Why? It is because the FTA itself is a dud. But what we are seeing here today with this MPI is nothing more than a piece of Labor politicking. The Leader of the Opposition is trying to dig himself out of a hole—the hole that he dug himself into when he turned his back on Australian workers and our national interest by supporting the Prime Minister's free trade agreement with the United States.</para></talk.start><para>Rather than taking a principled stand against the free trade agreement, which, as I told the House on 24 June, delivers very little to Australia in real terms, the ALP is now tinkering around with amendments which expert advice tells us serve no purpose. For example, we are talking about patents and evergreening. What about the bigger issues—the central issues regarding this FTA? Did the opposition members miss the <inline font-style="italic">PM</inline> program last night? Professor Peter Drahos from the Australian National University was interviewed on it, and he had some things to say about Labor's amendments to the <inline ref="R2118">US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Bill 2004</inline> and about other changes. He said:</para><quote><para>While I think the proposals are well intentioned, ultimately they don't really achieve the objective of protecting the PBS. What really matters is the text in the actual agreement. That is what a free trade panel deciding our obligations under the act will look at.</para><para>That's what will ultimately govern a dispute resolution process, not the implementing legislation the Labor Party dream up.</para></quote><para>...	...	...</para><quote><para>They will look at the implementing legislation and they say, “does this implementing legislation fulfil the obligations that Australia agreed to when they signed the agreement?” and if there is a gap between what we've implemented and what we've agreed to in the text, then it is the text that has priority.</para><para>It's like entering into a contract. We've entered into a contract with the United States and that's the contract that will determine whether or not we've fulfilled our obligations.</para><para>The multinationals, that are really the architects of this free trade agreement, will look at our implementing legislation and they will ask themselves, “are the Australians complying? Are they doing what they have undertaken to do in the free trade agreement?”</para><para>And if they come to the conclusion that we haven't complied, then they will take us to court or the equivalent of a court, namely the dispute resolution process that is in the free trade agreement.</para></quote><para>...	...	...</para><quote><para>The whole point of this agreement is to obtain higher prices to deal with the domestic crises in the United States, to deal with the fact that PBS represents world's best practice for Australia producing cheaper medicines. That is the entire point of this. </para></quote><para>Labor's amendments and the government changes count for very little if that expert analysis is correct—and I believe it is. The reality is that any amendment to this agreement—whether it be on manufacturing jobs, pharmaceuticals, the environment or the proper transparencies and processes overlooking this legislation—coming into this place cannot be inserted into the free trade agreement, because it is signed outside the parliament. It is an agreement between Mr Howard and President Bush. It is extramural. It is outside the reach of this parliament.</para><para>Labor has two amendments here which are at the margins and are acceptable, it says, within the free trade agreement. It dare not move outside the free trade agreement, for it cannot. You accept it or reject it. Labor accepts this. The Greens reject it because we do not believe it is in the national interest. The FTA is a dud. Everyone accepts that there are negatives—for example, the loss of up to 50,000 jobs in the manufacturing industry—but there should be no negatives. There are so many problems with this so-called free trade agreement that the opposition should have rejected it outright, just as the government should have pulled the plug when it realised that Australians would be worse off as a result of this agreement.</para><para>There is nothing free about this agreement. It is a restricted, pointed, biased agreement which favours our giant but friendly neighbour across the ocean—the United States—against the interests of this nation. The Greens oppose the legislation because it is not in Australia's national interest—although it is in the interests of the United States and, in particular, the corporate sector in the United States, which stands to gain the most from it. The agreement binds not only many of the processes in our society but also this parliament. It does so in a way that is out of the reach of this parliament  because, once the parliament gives assent to this agreement, changing it becomes conditional on the American interest being fostered. If you do not have that, it will not be changed in the future. Being able to alter the agreement will be out of the question unless the American interest is served. The only option would be to repudiate it further down the line. That of course is unconscionable when the option now is to repudiate it before it comes into force, with many fewer consequences for this nation—a nation which has an economy and population less than one-tenth the size of those of the United States.</para><para>It is very important to understand that the agreement is outside the reach of our democracy in both its formulation and its future impact on this country. This agreement is not subject to parliamentary scrutiny, it is not subject to parliamentary accountability and it is not subject to parliamentary alteration. It is another manifestation of the increasing wish by executive governments in this country—which has been refined and strengthened by the Howard government—to act as extra-parliamentary governing authorities that make decisions outside the ability of parliament to review and make alterations to in the future.</para><para>This agreement will help line the pockets of pharmaceutical corporations in the United States. It inevitably moves us a step towards the far inferior system of the United States, where the sick, the aged, the retired and the poor not only cannot afford many of the pharmaceuticals available but also, as we know, cannot access hospital care. That country is far worse served by the unrestrained market and the division between rich and poor than this country is.</para><para>As I said in this place on 24 June, the fact that our government is seeking to paint meagre concessions and horrendous potential damages as overall wins for Australia is at best naive and at worst anti-Australian. It is clear that the costs of this deal will dramatically outweigh the benefits and cause irreversible damage to our economy, to our major national institutions and to our enviable status as a disease-free producer. That is why this so-called free trade agreement should be rejected—not amended in the Senate as Labor proposes, but rejected outright for the outrageous sham that it is. This FTA threatens jobs, it threatens our industries, it threatens our health care system, it threatens our environment and it threatens our culture and our cultural heritage. </para><para>It is easy to understand why the Prime Minister pursued this agreement with his good mate George Bush, but it is not so easy to explain the dodgy decision by the opposition to cave in yet again. The public will undoubtedly judge both harshly whenever the next election is held. However, you can rest assured that the Greens will continue to stand up for ordinary Australians and defend Australia's national interests.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

It is in fact quite laughable, as I stated at the outset of my contribution, that the party that comes into this chamber and claims to be a friend of small business is the Australian Labor Party. What is laughable about it is that the Australian Labor Party is the party that is proposing to introduce a 0.1 per cent federal payroll tax on businesses—a direct way in which the federal Labor Party will remove the incentive for businesses to hire new employees. There is a reason why under the Howard government we have seen record low levels of unemployment. If the Labor Party were elected you would see a situation arise whereby unemployment rates would start to go back up—as they always do under the Australian Labor Party.</para></talk.start><para>But the main thrust of today's debate is amendments to the Trade Practices Act. There is a whole array of them contained in this bill today. This bill largely comes about as a consequence of a review of the competition provisions of the Trade Practices Act that was chaired by Sir Daryl Dawson, commonly known as the Dawson review. The Dawson review was the most comprehensive review of the competition provisions in the act for more than a decade.</para><para>The reality is that both sides of the chamber recognise the inherent benefits that flow from a competitive marketplace. Both sides of the chamber recognise the inherent benefits that flow to the Australian people as a consequence of the dynamic and temporal efficiencies that arise out of a more competitive marketplace. I acknowledge that in the past the Australian Labor Party certainly has been one to engage in microeconomic reform, recognising that there are dividends that all Australians can enjoy as a consequence of, for example, deregulating the dollar, introducing the Trade Practices Act and so on and so forth.</para><para>But the difference today is that this bill before the House is a recognition by the Howard government—and in particular by the Treasurer, Peter Costello—that in fact significant benefits would flow from the implementation of a number of the recommendations that were put forward by Sir Daryl Dawson in the Dawson review. The overall theme of the Dawson review was that the competition provisions should protect the competitive process rather than particular competitors. The government strongly supports this view of the act and has accepted in fact—despite contrary claims by the member for Hotham—the vast majority of the Dawson review recommendations.</para><para>The bill before the House today will improve existing ACCC processes by providing for greater accountability, greater transparency and more timeliness in decision making, as well as reducing the regulatory burden on businesses that have in the past flowed not only from this act but also from other acts. Businesses both big and small, as well as consumers, will benefit from the new streamlined processes incorporated in the bill, which will be to the advantage of the whole economy. </para><para>I will touch upon some of the key processes and key reforms that are contained within the bill before the chamber today. A new voluntary formal merger clearance process will be put in place to operate in parallel with the informal clearance system. This will provide definite time limits for consideration which business can rely upon and will provide the certainty that a clearance is legally binding. The bill provides that merger authorisation applications will be considered directly by the tribunal instead of by the ACCC. This will ensure commercially realistic time frames for such applications and prevent strategic appeals by third parties. Likewise, with regard to non-merger authorisations, there will be strict time limits for consideration by the ACCC. Of particular advantage to small business, the ACCC will be able to waive the filing fee.</para><para>I will highlight some of the comments that were made by the shadow Treasurer with regard to these particular points. The shadow Treasurer raised concerns about the tribunal and the actual process contained in the bill before the House today. The reality is that there are benefits that flow. Principal among them, and contrary to the concerns that were raised by the shadow Treasurer, is the fact that there will now be an opportunity for tribunals to hear arguments with regard to public interest when it comes to merger considerations. That is not a negative. There are examples that exist where concentration ratios in a marketplace may in fact be breached but it could very conceivably be in the public interest for such a merger to go ahead. Why not allow the legal arguments surrounding those discussions to be put forward, considered and taken into account?</para><para>Similarly, with regard to the public interest, why not allow public interest to be a principal consideration when it comes to determining whether a merger should be allowed to go forward? The shadow Treasurer claimed that the tribunal scares the ALP, that the establishment of the tribunal raises concerns among ALP members and that this is all about providing an opportunity for the Howard government to give kudos and benefits only to the big business sector. It is simply not there in the legislation. Contrary to the scaremongering campaign of the Australian Labor Party, the legislation shows that the new process will allow for public interest to be a factor when it comes to consideration of merger activity.</para><para>For the opposition to claim, perhaps implicitly, that there are no circumstances in which a concentration ratio may be breached—for example, in a market through a merger—and that that could in some way not be in the public interest would be to deny the existence of the argument of national champions. Certainly many leading advocates in the debate about competition and the best use of market forces contend that there is a role for national champions and that consumers can actually win by having national champions. It would seem to me that that notion of national champions runs entirely inconsistently with arguments that we heard from the Australian Labor Party this morning.</para><para>This bill introduces the notion of collective bargaining and reduces the regulatory burden on small business through the introduction of a notification process that allows for collective bargaining by small businesses when dealing with large businesses. This provides an alternative to the authorisation process. Fundamentally, the Howard government does believe that there are benefits that flow from collective bargaining and realises that there can at times be situations where small businesses are at a distinct market disadvantage compared to a larger counterpart that small businesses are needing to negotiate and deal with in a marketplace. The introduction of the notification process for collective bargaining by small businesses is, I know, certainly most welcome. I know the Newsagents Federation, to give one example, would warmly welcome this kind of change. </para><para>Third line forcing is another reform that is being introduced in this bill. There is recognition—and the Dawson review highlighted this—that there are in fact procompetitive benefits that flow as a consequence of third line forcing arrangements. The test that will be used for third line forcing will be a substantial lessening of  the competition test, instead of a per se prohibition with regard to third line forcing. This will make third line forcing consistent with other forms of exclusive dealings as contained in part 4 of the Trade Practices Act.</para><para>With regard to exclusionary provisions, price fixing and joint ventures, serious cartel type conduct involving exclusionary and price fixing measures will continue to be prohibited outright. Genuine joint ventures will provide a defence on competition grounds. There are also minor changes with regard to dual listed companies which will see them treated on the same basis as other companies under the Trade Practices Act. There will also be extra powers available to the ACCC when it comes to enforcement. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission will have a new ability to seize evidence, but this will be balanced against the requirement to obtain a warrant from a magistrate.</para><para>Importantly, there are changes made with regard to penalties, and I would like to touch on this in more detail. The bill provides for a higher penalty for a contravention of the act. It allows for persons to be disqualified from directing or managing a corporation and prohibits the indemnification of officers, employees and agents against the imposition of a pecuniary penalty. There are also reforms contained within the bill which go to the constitutional validity and application of the act to local government.</para><para>Earlier today I heard the shadow Treasurer raising a number of issues about the timing of the Dawson review and the Senate report. The allegation was made by the member for Hotham that the Australian government had in some way acted in breach of, or not consulted widely with the states and territories in accordance with, the requirements of the intergovernmental conduct code agreement of 11 June. The Australian government did in fact seek and receive support from the states and territories for the draft bill as required. As I said, that occurred on 11 June this year. The Dawson bill was introduced into this House on 24 June and is now being debated today and is proposed to be debated by the Senate tomorrow.</para><para>It should be noted that no state or territory voted no to the bill. Victoria, Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania all voted yes, and the remainder of the states and territories, through not responding, have their default votes counted as being affirmative. This is in accordance with the intergovernmental conduct code agreement, which says that during the voting stage the Australian government must receive three votes from the states and territories before the expiry of 35 days in order to introduce the bill. If no vote is received, it is considered a default vote. This occurred with regard to a number of states.</para><para>But that is entirely separate from the situation that exists in relation to the Senate report and the recommendations put forward by the Senate inquiry. The government tabled its response to the Senate report on 23 June and on that date gave notice to the states and territories. Once the government response has been tabled there is a three-month consultation period which commences with the states and territories as per the conduct code agreement, during which time the bill can be drafted. After this, there is a 35-day voting period on a draft bill before it commences. This concludes on 23 September. I highlight that because I do not believe that the shadow Treasurer actually understood the two separate processes that exist, the two separate reports, and the government response to the two separate reports, one with the Dawson review and one with the changes that were contained in the Senate report. </para><para>There are a number of benefits that flow from the changes before the House today. Small business is one of the biggest beneficiaries. All business—and not least of all small businesses, of course—benefit from a strong competition regulator. The report of the Dawson inquiry has reinforced the importance of a vigorous and independent regulatory agency, in the form of the ACCC, to oversee promotion of competition in the Australian economy. I know that on the Gold Coast, the small business capital of Australia, there is in fact a great deal of regard for the operation of the Trade Practices Act and that there are so many who stand to benefit from the temporal and dynamic efficiencies that exist in marketplaces as a consequence of the operation of the Trade Practices Act. I am pleased to know that there are so many others in this chamber who share the view that there are many benefits that flow to small business as a consequence of this act.</para><para>I touched upon the issue of collective bargaining, and I want to highlight some of its key features. As a consequence of this bill, the proposed system will include a period of only 14 days, or a longer period if it is prescribed by regulation, which should be allowed to elapse before a notification takes effect. It is proposed that the period be set by regulation at 28 days, as this will give the commission sufficient time to consider notification applications in the initial stages of the amendment. However, the time period will be monitored and reviewed after 12 months, with a preference for 14 days being introduced.</para><para>There are also benefits for business through the non-merger authorisation process. In addition to the time limits that will be imposed upon the ACCC in relation to non-merger authorisation to improve the speed of the authorisation process, the ACCC will be provided with the discretion to waive fees for non-merger authorisation which would otherwise be payable. The consequence of these changes is that they will improve the accessibility and effectiveness of the authorisation process by reducing the time and cost involved in obtaining an authorisation.</para><para>Likewise, consumers will benefit. Consumers can share in the benefits that are expected to flow from the government's amendments that are aimed at strengthening the civil penalty regime in relation to anticompetitive conduct. The maximum pecuniary penalties for corporations will be increased to the greater of $10 million or three times the unlawful gain or, where the gain cannot be readily ascertained, 10 per cent of the turnover of the corporation. This represents a very significant disincentive to engaging in non-competitive conduct in a marketplace. Likewise, the court, on application from the ACCC, will be able to ban directors and managers from participating in the management of a corporation, and corporations will also be prohibited from indemnifying officers, employees or agents against the imposition of a pecuniary penalty. These are probably the three principal ways in which consumers will benefit, knowing that when it comes to management and directors of companies as well there will be enhanced consumer protection contained in the Trade Practices Act as a consequence of this bill. </para><para>The Trade Practices Act has served the Australian people well. That was the overall finding of the Dawson review and it is the finding of a number of parliamentary committees. It has served the Australian people well but, like any piece of legislation, it does require updating from time to time to ensure it remains both relevant and the best utility available to serve a dynamic and competitive marketplace that exists across so many industries in Australia today.</para><para>I am very pleased to speak to this bill and to support it. I am disappointed that the Australian Labor Party does not support this bill as a whole. It would have been of assistance if the shadow Treasurer had perhaps at the outset understood the difference between the government's response to the Senate report and the government's response to the Dawson report. But, nonetheless, I am still disappointed that the Australian Labor Party does not recognise all the benefits that flow and support this in total rather than seeking to divide the bill into two parts. It is a good bill. It benefits small businesses. It certainly benefits consumers and it ensures that businesses going forward in Australia continue to operate in a competitive environment and, more importantly, in an environment that will continue to promote competitiveness.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>32139</page.no><name role="metadata">Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP</name><name role="display">Mr FITZGIBBON</name><name.id>8K6</name.id><electorate>Hunter</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak to the <inline ref="R2092">Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill 2004</inline> and support the amendment put forward by the member for Hotham. It is a pleasure to follow the member for Moncrieff. I was in his electorate only last Friday, in beautiful Surfers Paradise, speaking at a petroleum retailers conference and putting forward Labor's plan to protect small and independent players in that market, which is unfortunately something that the member for Moncrieff and those on his side of the House are not prepared to do. That subject has great relevance to the debate before us today.</para></talk.start><para>I am not surprised that the member for Moncrieff spent about 90 per cent of his time talking about the merger provisions in this bill and only about 10 per cent of his time talking about issues that go to small business protection. That should not be surprising. This bill really only has two initiatives within it. One is something for small business, in terms of the collective bargaining provisions, and the other is something for big business in terms of the merger provisions. He waxed lyrical about the so-called `new public interest test'. But he must be reading a different bill from the one I am looking at, because the public interest test has been in the bill since the Labor government introduced it back in 1974. But what has changed is that the bill removes the right for third party participation, including the right of the ACCC to intervene in these matters. It is not an enhancement of the merger provisions; I would describe it as a retrograde step in terms of those merger provisions.</para><para>This should be very much a bill about competition and small business protection. It is interesting to note that the Howard government was elected in 1996 largely on the back of a number of commitments it made to the small business community. In 1992 and 1993 John Hewson scared the hell out of the small business community. As was the case with Medicare, John Howard, the then reincarnated opposition leader, found it necessary to put the collective minds of the small business community at rest on both Medicare and small business red tape and paperwork. He, now infamously, promised the small business community at that time that he would not introduce a GST and that he would cut red tape and paperwork for the small business community by some 50 per cent. It is on the record, and it is history now, that the Prime Minister later broke his promise on the introduction of the GST, and it is now farcical to suggest that compliance with red tape and paperwork for the small business community has been reduced since the Howard government came to office. That is why the government cut the small business longitudinal study. That five-year study—an important study for small business academics in determining good public policy for a range of small business issues—introduced by the former Keating government was in its final year, but unfortunately it ended with the cutting of that funding. </para><para>Small business lost the fight against the introduction of the GST because a GST was what the big end of town wanted. Under this government, what corporate Australia wants it gets, regardless of any adverse impact that its wish list has on the small business community. It was the same story when in this place we were discussing retail tenancy issues; it was the same story when in this place we were discussing the Ralph review of business taxation. When the New South Wales government wanted to draw down the provisions of 51AC into its own Retail Leases Act, the Howard government did all it could to frustrate and hold up the New South Wales minister's plan. When the Howard government is faced with a conflict between the big end of town and small business interests, it will back the big business interests every time, and that is what this bill is largely about. That is why the Reid committee's recommendations were never fully adopted, that is why the Baird committee's recommendations were never fully adopted, and that is why the Treasurer is not prepared to embrace all the recommendations of the Dawson review or the recommendations of the Senate committee.</para><para>The Dawson review and the Senate committee started a war of words between the small and the big business communities. It is a war which the government inevitably had to take sides on and the government came down on the side of big business, which comes as no surprise to those of us on this side of the House. When the Howard government is seeking advice on small business policy, it goes straight to the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Retailers Association, the CPAs or the Tourism and Transport Forum. The membership of these organisations comprises the nation's biggest and wealthiest companies. Further, when it is looking for endorsement for its policy approaches, it is organisations such as these that the government turns to. When it wants endorsement for its antiworker legislation, it turns to the BCA; when it wants endorsement for its position on trade practices reform, it turns to the BCA and the Australian Retailers Association; and when it wants endorsement for its tourism related small business policies, it turns to the Tourism and Transport Forum, representing the Macquarie Bank, Leightons, Multiplex, ABN AMRO, Southcorp, IBM, Emirates and Singapore Airlines, to name just a few. Any dissent from an organisation generally representing the voice of small business is stamped out by threats of retribution.</para><para>One of the first lessons learned by students of economics is that competition is a key ingredient for the fair and efficient operation of any market. Without competition, sellers can abuse their market power, which in turn has the dual effects of misallocating resources and disadvantaging consumers. To preserve competition you must have a strong competition law and you must have a regulator with teeth. Strong competition and a strong regulator are critical to competition and the survival of a vibrant small business sector. In recent years the competition reform that was commenced by the former Labor government has stalled and the ACCC has grown concerningly timid. </para><para>This bill is symbolic of the government's lack of will when it comes to trade practices reform. The Senate committee made 17 recommendations. The Dawson committee made 43 recommendations. I was in the House when the Treasurer introduced this bill, and you can imagine how shocked I was as I sat and listened to him read his second reading speech. I had high expectations, as had many in the small business community. I was waiting for the phrase `predatory pricing', but the words are yet to pass the Treasurer's lips—nor, of course, did I hear the phrase `section 46', the most important phrase the small business community in this country is waiting to hear. It reminded me about the fact that I regularly hear the Minister for Small Business and Tourism in this place answering dorothy dixers from his backbench during question time. Earlier today I counted them in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>, and this year there have been about 17 dorothy dixers from the backbench to the Minister for Small Business and Tourism about small business matters. I particularly searched for any reference to him making reference to the words `predatory pricing'. I was able to find only one, and that was only a passing reference when answering a question. The reference was his indication that the Treasurer would soon be making some announcements on predatory pricing, but, of course, we are yet to hear any such announcement.</para><para>Any trade practices practitioner in this country or indeed any person with an interest in trade practices law and in particular how it affects small business is aware that, post Boral, section 46 of the Trade Practices Act is desperately in need of reform. Indeed, pre Boral, section 46 of the Trade Practices Act was desperately in need of reform. That is why throughout the course of the Reid committee and the Baird committee we were taking lots of evidence and having lots of debate about the merits or otherwise of changing to an effects test or changing the onus of proof under section 46 as a means of making that provision stronger and giving greater protection to the small business sector.</para><para>Section 46 prohibits corporations with a substantial degree of market power from using that power in an attempt to damage a competitor, drive a competitor out of the market or stop a competitor entering the market or engaging in competitive conduct. The Boral case brought the efficacy of section 46 so much into doubt that the ACCC at that time gave up on four section 46 cases, believing that pursuing them post the Boral decision was not likely to result in any real outcome in its favour.</para><para>The High Court's judgment in Boral was handed down some 18 months ago. For 18 months small business has been without adequate protection from market power abuse and the ACCC has not had at its disposal an effective tool for dealing with abuse of market power. I thought, understandably, that when this bill was introduced on 24 June this year we were about to see that situation remedied and rectified, but we were all disappointed, and we remain disappointed.</para><para>This bill contains just one thing, as I said, for small business, and that is collective bargaining, although that is flawed—if I get time, I will return to that subject—and something for big business, in their eyes at least, in terms of improving the mergers provisions. It gives small business collective bargaining but it gives big business something on mergers. It contains nothing on section 46, as I have discussed extensively; nothing on predatory pricing in particular; nothing on creeping acquisitions; nothing to enhance the provisions of section 51AC; nothing on cease and desist orders; and no jail penalties for corporate players engaged in cartel type behaviour. These are all matters that Labor is committed to, but they all are matters that get no mention within the context of this bill. </para><para>The government, I suspect, will seek to reassure us that this is only tranche 1—that all these other matters that I have mentioned, all of those other matters that Dawson raised as concerns and all those other issues that the Senate committee raised as concerns will be found in tranche 2. To that we can only say, `We hope so.' But we are also entitled to ask the question: `When?' We are leading into an election—probably, I suspect, in mid-October. Some will have a different view, but it is certainly not going to happen before then. By the time we go through the course of an election campaign, even if the government is re-elected we are not likely to see tranche 2 this side of Christmas.</para><para>Of course, if Labor is elected we would hope more urgency would be shown and Labor could put its policy into place. There is a big chance at least that we will not see tranche 2—if there is to be a tranche 2—this side of Christmas. For 18 months already small business has been without adequate protection, and it looks like it is going to be at least another six months—and, taking into account Christmas, probably even longer—before we can hope to get anything out of the government. So one question is that of timing. The next question is: what are we going to get when we finally see tranche 2? Are we going to get that list of important issues I just mentioned? Specifically, what are we going to get on predatory pricing? Are we going to get the Senate committee majority recommendation or the minority recommendation put forward by government senators Brandis and Chapman?</para><para>Senator Brandis puts himself out as a bit of an expert on the Trade Practices Act, but the reality is that Senator Brandis's proposition on predatory pricing will take us back to square one. What Senator Brandis wants to do is require the ACCC to prove that recoupment is possible in the case of predatory pricing. Boral was about the ACCC, in the first instance, being able to show that a player had a substantial degree of market power, and the High Court proved that that is a difficult test to meet. Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, I put to you that proving that a player is capable of recoupment will be just as difficult as was proving that a player in a market had a substantial degree of market power.</para><para>In the few minutes left to me I want to make a few points about the specific sections of the bill put forward to us today. One, on collective bargaining the initial contract concept is flawed. The government should simply permit notification for conduct covered by section 45. That would be in line with the current law and process on notifications. Two, it should be clear that the parties to any collective bargaining arrangement can have an agent and that the agent can act for more than one notifying group in the same industry or any other industry. Three, the act needs to say that when the ACCC is considering a notification it should take into account that collective bargaining is a public benefit because of the list of benefits outlined in the ACCC draft guideline on collective bargaining. This list should be spelt out in the legislation. Four, the legislation should be clear that the onus of whether or not a notice is rejected is on the ACCC. The ACCC should not be able to put information demands on parties making application which effectively reverse the onus of proof. Five, the $3 million transaction threshold should largely mirror what is in section 51AC and hence be raised to $10 million. There is a strong case for having no threshold at all. None exists, for example, for the authorisation process. Six, the ACCC should not be able to insist on small bargaining groups. Bargaining groups should be and can be national, state or territory based or even regional, depending on the market in which the target operates. The legislation should state that bargaining groups can be national et cetera. </para><para>I ask the minister, the Treasurer or whoever is doing the summing up to answer those concerns that I have expressed on the collective bargaining provisions within this bill. I think the omission of those suggestions that I have put forward are deliberate omissions and are designed to undermine the effectiveness of collective bargaining for small business. Lastly, on detail, whilst I think I know why the third line forcing provisions are in there, they are unnecessary. It is another undermining of the Trade Practices Act. It is another example of the undermining of the effectiveness of the Trade Practices Act in protecting both small business and, of course, the Australian consumer. So I ask the minister when he sums up to answer those questions I have raised on collective bargaining.</para><para>In summary, I just say that this is very disappointing. Eighteen months post Boral, after two extensive inquiries and with plenty of examples of the issues facing the small business community and, indeed, consumers, here we are with a bill which has something for big business and a little something for small business but still nothing on all of the key concerns raised in both of those inquiries all that time ago. Here we are, leading into an election and into Christmas and it looks like, no matter who is in government, because of the timing of these things and the time taken by the election et cetera, small business is facing the possibility that, if there are to be further reforms to the Trade Practices Act in their favour, it is possibly going to be 2005 before they see them. That is unacceptable. None of us who have watched this government in action over the course of the last 8½ years should be surprised. When it comes down to the rights and interests of the big end of town as opposed to small business interests, this government will fall to the side of the big end of town every time. I think this bill demonstrates that again here today.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>32143</page.no><name role="metadata">McMullan, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McMULLAN</name><name.id>5I4</name.id><electorate>Fraser</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to support the amendment moved by the shadow Treasurer, the member for Hotham, and the remarks made by my colleague the member for Hunter on the <inline ref="R2092">Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill 2004</inline>. They both spoke so comprehensively that I should be able to make a contribution that supports their position without taking the full quota of time, thus facilitating the business of the parliament. Yesterday we were in the parliament debating a very disappointing set of propositions from the government about assisting small business to cope with the red-tape crisis of the GST and the business activity statement. It was too little too late. It was disappointing and the very least they could do to give themselves a fig leaf to cover the embarrassment of failing to act. Yesterday what we saw was a very small fig leaf and a very large embarrassment.</para></talk.start><para>We have the same situation today. These changes are trumpeted as ostensibly being part of the government's reform agenda to assist small business. But the government have been slow to act. They have acted without commitment. They have left the small business community understandably disappointed. It is a minimalist approach. The minimalist movement in art had a lot to recommend it, but, as a way of reforming the Trade Practices Act and acting in defence of small business, it is a terribly disappointing approach. You wonder why, because, in the normal course, the government have seen the small business community as their core constituency. They have trumpeted their concern for it. They have campaigned to it and sold their message to it. Yet, when the small business community comes to them for support, the government are missing in action. </para><para>Why is that? It is because, for the first time, it has become clear that the 21st century challenge for government in assisting small business is in assisting small business to cope with unfair competition from big business. Suddenly the government have gone to water. The only voice they have listened to with regard to this matter is the Business Council of Australia, as advocates of the big business interest, and it has driven the government back. First, they had an intention of doing absolutely nothing, then they set up the Dawson review with the intention of doing as little as possible and then, when the Senate committee was imposed upon them, they sought to constrain significantly its recommendations. Now they have sought to recommend none of it in this legislation when some of it was possible. They know they have bipartisan support for some of those reforms.</para><para>Some of the reforms need consultation with the states. We understand that. They cannot legislate to do those things without that consultation. But they have the support of the states, and they know that, if they wished to, they could expedite that. The act sets a time that has to be set aside for consultation but, if they wanted to change it more quickly and went to consult with the states proactively, they would get support because the states have been calling for those reforms. The only people who will not act are the Howard government. They will not act because it does not reflect the interests of the people they actually see as their primary constituency—that is, big business in Australia. They will not act and small business is understandably disappointed at the government being so slow and so weak and having no serious reform agenda.</para><para>Seriously, for the economy as a whole, they are weak on competition policy. Australia needs a new round of productivity boost that comes from enhanced competition. We have had rounds of competition in the past engendered by previous Labor governments in the reduction of tariffs, the opening up of the economy, the floating of the dollar and the liberalisation of the banking system. In the National Competition Policy we blew the winds of competition through the fusty corridors of the Australian economy, which had been ossifying for generations. Now we need another round, and the government are found wanting again. When the current Prime Minister was Treasurer, he failed to implement the necessary competition reforms. As Prime Minister he has done nothing.</para><para>Mark Latham, the Leader of the Opposition, has outlined a seven-point plan to deal with the abuse of market power and to amend the Trade Practices Act to allow small businesses to be effectively competitive with their bigger competitors, to have a fair go, to drive reform, innovation and competition and therefore economic success. But this is a government that is absolutely bereft of new ideas. When was the last time this government came forward with an original major idea or reform? I ask this question at forums all around the country: what was the last new idea that the government came forward with? Most people say the GST. Whether that was a major reform or not, and I suspect that history will say it was not, it was six years ago that we went to an election about that idea. It was actually first articulated more than 10 years ago, but it was articulated by the government seven years ago. There has not been a major economic reform in seven years, and there will not be any until there is a change of government.</para><para>As the member for Hotham and the member for Hunter have outlined, we do support the <inline ref="R2092">Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill 2004,</inline> because it includes measures to make collective bargaining easier and cheaper for small business, and that should happen. It is overdue. The Dawson report came in so long ago that it is amazing that that has not happened so far. Although all too little and too late, there are measures in the bill which, despite some inadequacies, queried and properly raised by the member for Hunter, will nevertheless provide the only collective bargaining the government is going to allow for small business. So we will support that part of the legislation. </para><para>But we do want to see more done. We want to drive the government to meet the cries for help from the small business community. It can do that by supporting the ACCC and by making changes to the Trade Practices Act so it can become an effective, functioning force for competition reform and for enhancing the role of small business. Professor Fels was an outspoken advocate of the need to reform the Trade Practices Act, and the government did nothing. Even the more cautious Mr Samuel, who was Mr Costello's chosen Chairman of the ACCC—and for whose appointment Mr Costello battled so hard—says that the Trade Practices Act is not strong enough to give small business a fair go. But the Treasurer is not listening.</para><para>This bill is running way behind the views of the small business constituency, and I find that even more the case—and I see the member for Kennedy in the chamber—in regional Australia. In the small business communities in country towns and regional cities—Nowra, for instance, which I went to not long ago—around Australia and in the smaller capital cities such as Darwin, where I was discussing this recently, we find even more awareness that small business is finding it harder and harder to compete with the growing dominance of a small number of large companies. We have a trend to duopoly in so many areas, and it is making it harder and harder, particularly in smaller towns and the smaller regional cities. It is hard enough in Sydney and Melbourne, but the smaller the city the harder the task is for the small business community. The government is made up of the Liberal Party, which purports to represent small business, and The Nationals, which purports to represent regional interests. Yet regional small business is suffering and the government will not act. It will not act, because those who pull the strings will not let it.</para><para>Those aspects of a very strong Senate report that would place small business on a fairer footing have been left out of this bill. My colleagues have outlined this, and I have outlined this in speeches before. I simply reiterate now that we can give a commitment to Australian small business that, if the government changes after the election, the law as it relates to the interests of small business in competition with their larger competitors, suppliers and customers will change so that small business will get the reforms recommended by the majority Senate Economics References Committee report into the role of the Trade Practices Act in protecting small business. We will make those changes. We need another package of reform. This government is incapable of delivering it; we will do so after the next election. It is an inevitable change. It must happen. It needs to happen. The economy needs it, small business needs it, regional Australia needs it, and only a Labor government will deliver it.</para><para>My colleagues have spoken about some concerns about the merger provisions. I speak in this debate as the shadow minister for small business. The merger provisions are the area of my colleague the shadow Treasurer, but I have heard his advocacy and share his view that we have serious concerns about that. We do not want to be defenders of the status quo just for the sake of it, so let us have a careful look at this part of the Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill. Send it off to the Senate committee but do not hold up the collective bargaining provisions for it. I say to the government: I know we are getting close to the election and there are political stunts about all sorts of legislation, but do not hold up the collective bargaining provisions, do not hold them hostage to concerns about the merger provisions. They should not be in the same legislation—it would be far better if they were not—but, given that they are, let us send off for investigation those parts of the bill that relate to mergers, without delaying the collective bargaining provisions. We will know whose interests the government are serving if they fail to do that. </para><para>We in the opposition—the alternative government as we approach this election—have made commitments to more substantial reform. We will deliver that reform, which will drive competition, give small business a chance, make the economy more efficient and therefore generate the wealth we need. Those of us in the Australian Labor Party and in parties of its ilk—its counterparts around the world—know that our commitment to redistribution of wealth will only work if we generate the wealth in the first place. So we want an effective, competitive economy, and we need small business to have a fair chance of succeeding, in order to deliver it.</para><para>We participated in the Senate Economics References Committee inquiry into the effectiveness of the Trade Practices Act 1974 in protecting small business. We support all 17 recommendations of that committee. That is the reform that Australia needs. We have been highlighting the problem for ages. We have been campaigning on it for ages, in support of Professor Fels first and in support of Mr Samuel now—and in support of the claims by small business groups all around Australia, who are not traditional supporters of the Labor Party but are looking to the Labor Party for support in delivering reform, because they know that the Howard government will not do so.</para><para>We will support these measures as they relate to collective bargaining. If the government will cooperate in sending off the merger provisions—and others referred to by the shadow Treasurer—for committee investigation, we will focus on and support the quick passage of these collective bargaining propositions. I suspect, in the terms outlined by the member for Hunter, that we would like to see stronger ones, but these are all that small business is going to get, so we will support them. We urge the government to allow the procedural matters outlined by the member for Hotham to occur in the Senate so that those parts of the bill that relate to collective bargaining can pass. We give a commitment that, as the Howard government is unable to deliver the reforms that small business need in the Trade Practices Act, an incoming Latham Labor government will deliver those reforms.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>32146</page.no><name role="metadata">Katter, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KATTER</name><name.id>HX4</name.id><electorate>Kennedy</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am bitterly disappointed in what has come forward from the government in the <inline ref="R2092">Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill 2004</inline>. I would have thought that, on the eve of an election and with the threat from the ALP, they would have gone further. I pay tribute to and thank the opposition for the proposals that they have put forward. They do not go anywhere near far enough, but they go a hell of a lot further than the government's proposals. I would have thought that, with the rhetoric from the government and the championing of small business and with The Nationals senator from Queensland running around making a lot of noise, they must feel ashamed, but they do not. They have no sense of shame whatsoever.</para></talk.start><para><inline font-style="italic">Fair market or market failure</inline><inline font-style="italic">?</inline> is an extraordinary document. In this document, ACNeilsen, the gospel, says that Woolworths and Coles moved from a 51 per cent to a 75.4 per cent share of the food market in Australia. The nearest comparable country on earth permits I think about 12 per cent for the big two. But these blokes are saying that there is no problem with a movement from 51 per cent in 1991 to 75.4 per cent by the time this document came out. I have raised many times in this place the issue of deregulation and its effect. The first industry to hit the wall after deregulation was the egg industry, but before I talk about that it should be remembered in this place—and I do not want to let the ALP off here—that the architect of all this rubbish was Mr Keating. But the opposition have magnificently continued on with his work. There is no doubt about that. </para><para>We are supposed to be deregulating to help consumers. You understand that, Mr Deputy Speaker: in the area of eggs, we deregulated the egg industry, which guaranteed a price to the egg farmers and in almost all states guaranteed a price to the consumers as well. So we had a fixed system. You have to judge proposals by their outcomes. You cannot just say that competition is wonderful; you have to judge it by its outcomes. There was a most magnificent cartoon from that period that had Mr Keating reading a book on the Japanese economic miracle and saying, `It won't work. It works in practice, but it will never work in theory.' Of course, this is what we have here.</para><para>Let me get back to the eggs. In Australia we started with a Brisbane price of $1.93 and an Australian price of $1.85 a kilogram. When we brought this wonderful free market system in, did egg prices go down? They went down for the farmers. They went down 65c a dozen for the farmers. The farmers, who in 1992 were on $2.10 a dozen, lost 65c a dozen. But did the price go down for the consumers? No, it did not. Consumers should have got 65c off a dozen. The price to the consumers went up $1.08 a dozen. So the price paid to the farmers went down by 65c a dozen and the price paid by the consumers went up by over $1.</para><para>Was this a good outcome? I tell you what: it was a damn good outcome for the big retail chains. If you multiply the rise in price of eggs and the drop in their cost by the number of eggs sold, the amount you are left with translates into an extra profit of $415 million per year for the people in these retail chains. Was it a good outcome for the farmers? It was disastrous for the farmers. I think we had over 20 or 30 egg farmers in the Kennedy electorate; I think we are now down to about two. There used to be about 3,000 egg farmers in Australia. The last time they tried to get a figure, there were under 300. Deregulation was disastrous for the farmers and it was disastrous for the consumers, but the big retail chains made an extra $415 million a year in profit. The people who participated in this document knew that. They knew that two companies in the main had taken an extra $415 million a year out of the poor struggling purse of Mrs Housewife and over the broken backs of Australian farmers.</para><para>The industry that I represent—the sugar industry—was No. 2. We are deregulated now, but we were not deregulated then. But they took the tariff away from us. You must understand the importance of this tariff. We were getting a tariff of $120 a tonne. All we are getting now is $240 a tonne for our entire production. The tariff was worth $120 a tonne to us. During the period when this tariff was taken off, the world price for sugar fell. Brazil went to ethanol, which enabled her to sell the sugar she was putting on the world market at a much lower figure, so the world price fell during this period as well.</para><para>Once again, we had a pre-deregulation price for the farmers of $429 a tonne. We have since had an average price for the period 2000-02 of $287 a tonne. So we have gone from $430 a tonne down to $290 a tonne. The price has fallen for the big retail chains. Did the price go down for the consumers? The price that the retail chains are paying to the farmers has nearly halved, but did the price go down for the consumers? It should have just about halved. Surprise, surprise: it rose from $2.01 for a two-kilo pack to $2.32 a kilo for a two-kilo pack. Once again, the benefit accrued to the retail chains. How much was that benefit? That benefit was $378 million a year of extra profit, taken out of the purse of poor, struggling Mrs Housewife—poor, struggling little mothers with kids—and taken over the broken backs of the farmers. We pay Channel Nine a great tribute, because they did a wonderful story on the number of suicides that are occurring. We are averaging one a month in sugar areas. I hope the people in this place feel happy with their achievements. We saw $378 million in extra profit and, once again, the bulk of it would have gone to the two retail chains. </para><para>Now we come to milk. A past Dean of the Faculty of Economics at Queensland University—a very distinguished academic figure in Australia, not just Queensland—said there are three great shames in the history of this country: the way that we treated the men that came home from Vietnam; the way that we treated the original Australians, the Aboriginal people, if you like; and, the way that we treat the dairy farmers of this country. I did not think that it was an exaggeration to put dairy farmers in the same category as those others. They are the hardest working people. After deregulation, I went and visited 12 dairy farms. I suppose it was to punish myself. I went and said g'day to them and told them that I was sorry for what had happened and that it was my fault that I had failed to win for them. Those 12 farms are run only by husband and wife teams. There are no employees whatsoever. They get up around 5 o'clock in the morning and they go to bed at 7 o'clock at night. I know, because I have visited a lot of them. They finish their last milking at 7 o'clock and then they have to clean up. They have a bit of a spell during the day. They have no employees. The husband and wife on each farm both do this every day of their lives, every year of their lives. These people are the hardest working people. I did not believe anyone still worked that hard.</para><para>After the disaster of the deregulation of the wool industry, which I am not going to talk about today, after the disaster of the deregulation of the egg industry and after the disaster of the removal of the tariffs on the sugar industry, one would have thought that the government would have said, `This is a hopeless failure. Every time we've tried it, it has been a disaster.' But, no, they are driven by ideology. The communists are not dead in this country. The government believe in the ideology and no power on earth and no amount of persuasion or reality is going to change them.</para><para>I am extrapolating these figures from Queensland and New South Wales, because it is very hard to pick a time period in Victoria, as there was a rolling sort of deregulation in Victoria. I do not think anyone familiar with the industry would question that it is fair to apply these figures to the Australian situation. Did it help the consumers? No. The price in Sydney was $1.15 a litre. It went up to $1.54 a litre. The price in Brisbane was $1.16 a litre. It went up to $1.59 a litre. The average price of milk—and I am pleased to see a representative of the dairy industry in here now—for the consumer went up 41c. What happened to the farmers? Did they enjoy the benefit from this 41c rise in the price paid by the consumers? Surprise, surprise: their prices went down, from an average of 53c to an average of 34c. That is a 19c fall. If you add 19c less to the farmers to the 41c more to the consumers and extrapolate from that figure, which is a fair thing to do across Australia, multiplying it by the number of litres—1,884 mega-litres—you come up with an astounding figure of $1,130,000,000 dollars of extra profit every year. </para><para>Then this pathetic fair trading legislation is brought into the House today. It is absolutely pathetic and a continuation of what we have copped. Mr Deputy Speaker, if you allow for the 11c a litre from the government—and we thank the government for that 11c a litre—that takes it down to only $923 million of profit, which in the main is divided up between two companies.</para><para>Let us not beat around the bush. You will recall me mentioning that 75.4 per cent of the marketplace was shared by three companies. Now, of course, there are only two companies and so the 75.4 per cent is effectively divided up by the two of them. Strangely and very interestingly, ACNeilsen is not doing these figures anymore, so we have to refer to Woolworths' and Coles' annual reports for growth figures. But, if you add what they claim the growth of their sales to be to what ACNeilsen reported, they are now on 81.6 per cent of the retail market.</para><para>We have the government saying that there is no problem here and that they are going to stop them from getting any bigger. That should not make those two retailers lose any sleep at night. They have 82 per cent of the Australian market, and anyway the government are only stopping mergers. Coles and Woolworths can still go and buy as many individual supermarkets as they want. I know that one of the independent groups in Australia is taking its own action, because it does not believe that in its lifetime this or any other government is going to do anything to help. It believes that the major parties of Australia are owned by the big corporations.</para><para>I have to be fair to the ALP and say that the offer that they are putting on the table is much, much better than the offer that has been put on the table by those on the other side of the House. One has to remain somewhat sceptical, because they were in government for 12 or 13 years and they were very much involved in creating the problem. A lot of the damage in the egg industry and in the sugar industry was done by them. So in three items there were extra profits: milk, $923 million a year; eggs, $415 million a year; and sugar, $378 million a year. We are talking about extra profits per year of nearly $2,000 million coming out of the pockets of poor Mrs Housewife and from the broken backs of the farmers.</para><para>I went down to attend one of these hearings. I was confident that our representative, The Nationals' senator on this, was going to do the job for us. One of the reasons for my very great anger and rage with this document and this committee was that he sold us out lock, stock and barrel. There is no doubt about that. The day I went down, one of the members of the committee stood up and said, `We have got three ways to travel here.' I had said on many occasions—not to him, to somebody else—that there are three ways to travel here. I said that you could go to the antitrust legislation, the famous legislation of the truly outstanding man of American history, a remarkable and wonderful man, Theodore Roosevelt. Under his trust-busting legislation, he made a stand against the eastern Standard Oil Company in New Jersey—Rockefeller's company—busting it up into 13 or 20 different companies, through great courage and tenacity.</para><para>You can go to that antimonopoly legislation, similar to what America has, but that would still leave it in the hands of the courts, to some degree, and I would have my scepticism about the determination or the ability of a government to go out against organisations so big. Or you could go down the pathway of strengthening the existing laws, which is hardly happening here at all. Alternatively, you could have gone to what NARGA asked for, which is capping and divestment, which obviously is the only way that you are going to deal with this problem. I must say it will take a lot of courage now, because these people have such a stranglehold on the Australian economy. </para><para>In my home town of Charters Towers we could walk down the street—three or four of us—and raise enough money for a paid player for the local rugby league team. If I walked down the street and tried to raise money for the local rugby league team, I would be flat out paying for a player for one weekend. That is because these big stores come in and they do not just want to close the other supermarkets in town; they want to close the after-hours supermarkets, which leaves us nowhere to go. We had the aged persons president in Townsville come to us and say, `We need the corner store. We can't afford a taxi to go uptown.' Outside of Brisbane there is no commuter transportation system. Throughout Australia there is no transportation system outside of the metropolitan areas. Even inside the metropolitan areas people say they need the corner store. But if you allow unrestricted trading hours, then of course there will be no corner stores.</para><para>When the trading hours were extended in Queensland, 100 or 200 corner stores closed down. The main after-hours store in Charters Towers told me that they lost 30 per cent of their business when extended trading hours came in in Queensland. The big stores want to wipe out not only all the competition but also all the bakeries, all the butcher shops and all the florists. There is a bakery, a butcher shop and a florist in these big stores. Now they want to close down all the service stations. They want it all. There is no limit to their hunger for profit.</para><para>I heard Tim Fischer in a speech last night say that this is a land of opportunity. I would like to know where the hell the opportunity is! I know families in this country that have never ever worked for anyone else. They have been owner-operator families for six and seven generations. All their kids can hope for is a job working for some big corporation which, as time goes on, will increasingly be an overseas-owned corporation.</para><para>If there is one thing that competition policy has not delivered in this country, it is competition. This country has gone from having a situation where two corporations have held 51 per cent of the food market to a situation where two corporations, according to their own figures, hold 81.6 per cent of the market. There is not another country in the world that would stand for this sort of situation. For the farmers, what is the use of farming? The biggest farmer in Australia said to me, `We are getting out of it; we are going into cattle and we will sell on the export market, because you cannot survive in this country. We have only two people to sell to.' If you have 5,000 or 10,000 or 15,000 sellers of a product and you have two buyers, when I went to university they told me that was called an oligopoly. I might even say a monopoly of two, as the previous speaker said. We appreciate that in the government there are probably some people that have fought hard for the minor changes that are in the bill. But stopping mergers will not stop the takeovers in Charters Towers and Cloncurry and the thousands of other takeovers. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>32150</page.no><name role="metadata">Cameron, Ross, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ROSS CAMERON</name><name.id>3K6</name.id><electorate>Parramatta</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of the government it is my pleasure to sum up the debate on the <inline ref="R2092">Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill 2004</inline>. I have listened with interest to the characteristically passionate contribution by the member for Kennedy, for whom I have a high regard. But on this issue I confess we have a divergent opinion. I note that under the ongoing competition reforms which this economy has been subject to under the previous government and under the current one in particular, we see Australia being described as the miracle economy by the OECD. We see unemployment at record low levels. In my own electorate it has fallen from 12 per cent to four per cent. We see rapid rates of economic growth. We see real wages for low-income earners rising significantly and consistently. We see tremendous benefits to Australian consumers. This bill provides a healthy balance between the desirability of new market entrants and the capacity of efficient Australian corporations to grow. </para></talk.start><para>The government would like to thank those honourable members who participated in the debate on the <inline ref="">Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill 2004</inline>. This bill implements the government's response to the independent review of the competition provisions of the Trade Practices Act in 2003, chaired by Sir Daryl Dawson. The Dawson review was the most comprehensive review of the competition provisions of the act for a decade. After extensive consultation and careful consideration, the Dawson review concluded that the competition provisions of the act have served Australians well. It made a total 43 recommendations aimed at improving the operation of the competition and authorisation provisions as well as the administration of the act. The overall theme of the Dawson review was that the competition provisions should protect the competitive process rather than particular competitors. The government strongly supports this view of the act and has accepted the vast majority of the Dawson review recommendations.</para><para>The bill will improve existing ACCC processes by providing for greater accountability, transparency and timeliness in decision making and by reducing the regulatory burden on business. Following the government's response, the government undertook a three-month consultation period with the states and territories and a 35-day voting period on the text of the bill required by the Conduct Code Agreement. All eight jurisdictions have approved the bill and the government is eager to see early access to the benefits that are contained in the bill for business, both big and small, and for consumers.</para><para>The new processes and requirements are: a new voluntary formal merger clearance process to operate in parallel with the informal clearance system, definitive time limits for consideration by the ACCC that business can rely on and the certainty that a clearance is legally binding. Merger authorisation applications will be considered directly by the tribunal instead of the ACCC to ensure commercially realistic time frames for applications and to prevent strategic appeals by third parties. Non-merger authorisations will have strict time limits for consideration by the ACCC and, of particular advantage to small business, the ACCC will be able to waive the filing fee.</para><para>The bill will reduce the regulatory burden on small business by introducing a notification process for collective bargaining by small business dealing with large business as an alternative to the authorisation process. The third-line forcing can be beneficial and procompetitive and will be subjected to a substantial lessening of the competition test, instead of being prohibited per se, consistent with other forms of exclusive dealing. Serious cartel type conduct such as exclusionary and price-fixing provisions will continue to be prohibited outright. Genuine joint ventures will provide a defence on competition grounds. </para><para>Dual-listed companies will be treated on the same basis as other companies under the Trade Practices Act. The ACCC will have a new ability to seize evidence, but this will be balanced by the requirement to obtain a warrant from a magistrate. The bill provides higher penalties for a contravention of the act, allows persons to be disqualified from directing or managing a corporation and prohibits the indemnification of officers, employees and agents against the imposition of a pecuniary penalty. This will ultimately be of great benefit to consumers, providing a strong incentive for companies and those responsible for managing company business to comply with the act. Other measures help ensure the constitutional validity of the act's national application and apply the competition provisions to local government, insofar as it carries on a business, consistently with the act's application to other levels of government.</para><para>The opposition is critical of including merger and collective bargaining proposals together in a single bill. The Dawson review recommended the proposals as part of the one package. Both sets of proposals streamline administrative processes, providing transparency, timeliness and accountability. The government is about finding the best and fairest environment for all business to operate in, not favouring one type of business over the other to the detriment of all. If the opposition is serious about bringing the benefits of Dawson to business, both big and small, it will not try to break up the bill and delay it further by sending various parts off to a committee.</para><para>The government has responded to the report of the Senate Economics References Committee on the effectiveness of the Trade Practices Act in protecting small business by accepting some changes to clarify the misuse of the market power provision, section 46, and the prohibition of unconscionable conduct in business transactions. I note the Minister for Small Business and Tourism has arrived at the table and I commend him for his valuable contribution to those reforms which are to the benefit of small business.</para><para>The opposition is querying why the government has not included the changes that it proposes to section 46 in the Dawson bill and why, in fact, the government has only included one recommendation from the Senate inquiry—that is, collective bargaining—in the bill. The government is consulting with the states and territories on its proposed amendments to section 46 as required by the Conduct Code Agreement. The states and territories have a maximum time limit of three months to respond. As at the time of this speech, no state or territory has responded. Following the consultations, the government will seek the vote of the states and territories on a draft bill. Amendments to section 46 cannot be progressed until the states and territories respond as per the Conduct Code Agreement.</para><para>I also note that there have been calls by the opposition and by some in the press for a whole range of new provisions in the Dawson bill to include mechanisms such as a cease and desist power for the ACCC and a prohibition on creeping acquisitions. Dawson, reviews prior to Dawson and the minority government senators in the Senate report specifically rejected such new powers as not only unjustified but quite possibly damaging to the competitive process. Business, particularly small business, is eagerly awaiting the benefits that this bill will confer. I am hopeful the government will receive the support that is needed to streamline and improve the administration and enforcement of the act. I commend the bill to the House.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Wilkie, Kim (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Wilkie) </inline>—The original question was that this bill be now read a second time.

But many of the accountability measures that are included in the <inline ref="R2108">Schools Assistance (Learning Together—Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Bill 2004</inline> are already under way. A number of them were started by Labor state ministers and they, of course, have Labor's support. Not surprisingly, we also support schools flying the flag, but it seems to be the case that this government is actually more interested in the condition of the flagpole than the resources that are available to children in classrooms. Of course this Minister for Education, Science and Training is not the slightest bit interested in talking about resources. He wants to talk about anything but the resources that are available to our schools. He will do anything to avoid talking about it, including, as regularly as possible, blaming the states for any problem with Australian schools. He does this at any opportunity.</para></talk.start><para>The Leader of the Opposition, in his budget reply speech, announced that a federal Labor government would pay the TAFE fees for secondary school students. I think this is a terrific policy initiative because it will encourage more young people to get vocational qualifications, whether it is in information technology, construction or whatever it might be. These students can get that vocational education at a TAFE while they are still at school. If Labor are elected, this iniative will be at no cost to either the parents of those students or their school. But, in response to this terrific initiative announced by the Leader of the Opposition, the education minister immediately issued a statement saying that federal Labor could not make this commitment and that collecting TAFE fees was a state responsibility. Clearly the minister had not considered the possibility that federal, state and territory governments can actually work collaboratively to make sure that we get things done. That is precisely what a federal Labor government will do if elected. </para><para>The recent agreement between Mark Latham, the Leader of the Opposition, and all premiers and chief ministers will put an end to the kind of futile buck-passing that is typified by the attitude of the current Minister for Education, Science and Training. Abolishing TAFE fees for secondary students is just one area where the states, territories and a federal Labor government can work together for great results. Schools are another.</para><para>There is an urgent need for federal and state governments to work together to bring all schools up to a decent national standard. Our schools cannot wait for another three years for a fair funding system. From Labor's point of view, it is well past the time to end the Howard government's unfair schools funding system. We want to see the introduction of a new, needs based funding arrangement. That requires the Commonwealth and state governments to work together. That is exactly what all federal, state and territory Labor leaders have agreed to do. This landmark agreement is Australia's only chance to fix up the school funding mess that is giving the largest increases to the wealthiest schools in this country. Together, federal and state Labor will restore fairness to school funding.</para><para>The Howard government takes every opportunity to claim that the 70 per cent of Australian children in public schools are a state, not a federal, responsibility. Labor strongly disagrees with this view held by the current government. The education of all children must be the responsibility of all Australian governments. The Labor leaders' agreement commits federal, state and territory leaders to making public education a national priority and finally ending the buck-passing. If there is problem in a local school, parents want that problem fixed. What they do not want is meaningless blame-shifting between different levels of government. The agreement that was recently signed by all the Labor leaders will provide increased public funding for our public schools. It will also provide public funding for the non-government school system on the basis of need. That need will be assessed against a very clear national standard. Labor support families who choose non-government schools, and all non-government schools will continue to receive funding support from a future Labor government.</para><para>If Labor are elected, Australia will have a national schools resource standard for the first time, and both federal and state funding will be linked to it. This standard will fulfil two purposes. First, it will be a measure of the recurrent funding required for a 21st-century standard of education for all schools in the future. It will establish the level of resources that schools will need to provide quality teaching, literacy and numeracy support and up-to-date technology and to make sure that we have increased retention in our schools. Second, the standard will become the benchmark for assessing which schools need an increase in funding so that they can deliver a 21st-century standard of education. There will be increased funding for government schools to bring them up to the national standard. The combined funding available to non-government schools from federal, state and private sources, including fees, will also be assessed against the national standard. Non-government schools that do not have the resources to meet the national standard will have their funding increased. </para><para>The current lack of coherent funding principles for non-government schools in Australia has allowed eight different state and territory funding systems to develop alongside, and at times in conflict with, federal funding. There has been no attempt by this government to get a comprehensive approach to the funding of schools at the federal, state and territory levels. By contrast, state and territory governments have agreed to work with a Latham Labor government to make sure that much-needed increases in funding go to those schools that are operating below the standard of resources that they need to operate on. This is by far the fairest way to decide which schools will receive extra funding and which schools will have their funding cut. Funding will be tied to a set of accountability and reporting standards for all schools, which will also deliver a common starting age, a nationally consistent curriculum and national literacy, numeracy and technology standards.</para><para>There are so many opportunities for our neighbourhood government and non-government schools to work together, to share resources such as library facilities or sporting facilities, as some of them already do. Our funding systems should be geared towards creating complementary relationships between government and non-government schools. We do not want to promote the duplication of resources or the resentment that exists at the moment between the different sectors. That resentment has built up over the years of the Howard government—when they have given huge increases to the wealthiest schools in the country. Labor's national schools resource standard represents, for once, a coherent, rational and fair way for all schools to be funded. If we want to give all children—every single child in Australia—a great education then the Howard government's unfair policy has to come to an end. The policy that Labor in government will implement, a fairer funding system, will come about from the beginning of 2006.</para><para>Tonight we are also debating the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Legislation Amendment Bill 2004, which deals with literacy initiatives that were announced by the Minister for Education, Science and Training in the week following the budget. That announcement was another case of the Howard government playing catch-up politics. The Leader of the Opposition has put children's literacy firmly on the national agenda. He did that earlier this year when he announced Labor's program called Read Aloud Australia—an $80 million program to encourage parents to read to their children from birth. The literacy initiative that we are debating tonight in this bill is a very late attempt by the Howard government to catch up with the Leader of the Opposition's incredible efforts to put this issue on the national map.</para><para>Labor welcome the fact that the Howard government is trying to catch up on the critical issue of children's reading. There is no doubt that reading and writing, especially for young children, will be a Labor priority. We particularly support very early childhood development programs, as well as remedial support for children experiencing difficulties in meeting the minimum standard of literacy once they are at school. Of course, we welcome any additional funding support for children's reading. </para><para>But it is interesting that the minister describes this literacy announcement as a Howard government idea. As it turns out, in fact, it is not. Here is how one US journal described a policy announced by the US President Mr Bush back in 1999. It was an education plan that required states to `test their disadvantaged students on academic basics every year'. The journal said:</para><quote><para>... federal money would then go to parents, who could use it as a voucher to pay for ... tutoring ... worth about $1,500.</para></quote><para>I would like the minister, in his response at the end of this debate, to confirm whether or not he ripped off Mr Bush's education policy and is now passing it off as his own. Not only is he trying to impose a US higher education system on Australians, it now seems we are getting a US style literacy plan. But this is of course nowhere near enough to tackle literacy. There is no question on the part of those who educate our children that trying to intervene after year 3 is far too late. If the Howard government were serious about tackling literacy problems, it should adopt Labor's read aloud policy to make sure that more children are read to from infancy. We also want to see increased support provided to those schools where high numbers of children experience reading difficulties. Of course, that is unfortunately not contained in the legislation before us today.</para><para>In conclusion, we will be supporting these bills—we will be passing them—because we want to give schools funding certainty for 2005. But I make it very clear here tonight that, should we win government, schools will be funded from 2006 on a needs basis, because Labor believe that a quality education must be provided to all students, regardless of the schools their parents choose and regardless of their parents' income. We want to make sure that schools are funded fairly. We will not support these massive increases in grants from the federal government going to the wealthier schools in the country. We want our public schools as well as our needy non-government schools to get increased resources. That will be reflected in the policy that Labor takes to the upcoming election.

The proposed building will provide approximately 21,750 square metres of lettable office space, consisting of a small basement containing about 600 square metres of storage space, computer equipment, showers, change rooms, building services and storage for 60 bicycles; a ground floor incorporating the main entrance lobby off Binara Street, a conference centre, reception/security facilities, a child-care centre, a cafe, one other small retail outlet, a loading dock and a mail centre; three levels of above-ground parking with space for 261 cars and 25 motorcycles; six levels of office accommodation of about 2,500 square metres each; and three smaller top-level office floors of about 2,000 square metres each. An additional optional floor may be constructed to cater for an expanded organisation, if required.</para><para>The department currently has about 1,240 staff. The proposal has provision for approximately 1,400 workstations and offices, which allows for expansion and flexibility in the workplace. Staff facilities will include an amenities room, parenting rooms, a carers' room and a prayer room. Fit-out works to be undertaken include integration of services into the base building works, including electrical, airconditioning, ventilation, lighting control, data, communications, security, fire and hydraulic services; office accommodation, including partitioning to form individual offices, meeting rooms, reception areas, training rooms and staff facilities; workstations, including desks and provision for personal storage; and loose furniture.</para><para>The developer is expected to construct the building from late this year or early next year.

Firstly, they allocate Australian government funding for schools for the next four years. Secondly, they introduce a number of accountability requirements aimed at improving the performance of schools and better ensuring that they meet the needs of students and their parents. I want to turn my attention to each of these in turn.</para></talk.start><para>Firstly, in regard to funding, the <inline ref="R2108">Schools Assistance (Learning Together-Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Bill 2004</inline> allocates $31.3 billion over the 2005-08 quadrennium. That is an $8 billion increase from the current quadrennium. Next year alone, schools in Australia will receive a record $7.6 billion in direct funding from the Commonwealth. This figure is up 111 per cent since 1996—that is, since the Howard government has been in office direct Commonwealth funding for Australian schools has risen by 111 per cent. This is clear, unequivocal evidence of the Australian government's commitment to Australian schools. Let me elaborate briefly on a number of the features of this funding. Firstly, the largest increase is in general recurrent funding to cover ongoing costs, principally the costs of salaries of teachers and school staff. There is a figure of $27.4 billion in general recurrent grants for public and non-government schools. That includes full indexation to AGSRC—the average government school recurrent cost—at the current level of about six per cent per annum.</para><para>The bill includes $1.5 billion in capital grants to improve school facilities and help build new facilities. It includes $2 billion for literacy, numeracy and special learning needs—that is an increase of $393 million, or 25 per cent, over the current quadrennium. This funding will target the most disadvantaged students and reduce the chances of them getting behind in literacy and numeracy in those early years. If that happens, it compounds in later years and puts young people at an increasing level of disadvantage.</para><para>Contrary to what the former speaker, the member for Jagajaga and shadow minister for education, said, this level of funding is a record level of funding ever by any Australian government for literacy and numeracy in Australian schools. It is clear evidence of our commitment to addressing need—particularly the needs of disadvantaged students with respect to literacy and numeracy in those essential early years of schooling. In addition to that there is $113 million for geographically isolated children to meet their special education needs and $231 million for newly arrived students from non-English speaking backgrounds to help address the unique needs they have with respect to education.</para><para>The simple point is this: this funding package contains a record level of funding and is a massive increase. It shows very clearly—unequivocally—this government's commitment to the education needs of all children in this country, whether they be in public schools, Catholic schools or independent schools. Importantly, it supports parents in the choices they make for the education of their children. If parents want to choose to send their children to public schools, they should be supported, and they are. If they choose to send their children to Catholic schools, they should be supported, and they are. If they choose to send their children to independent schools, they should be supported, and they are. </para><para>This is in spite of every dishonest and divisive campaign being run by the Australian Education Union and the New South Wales Teachers Federation, which totally misrepresents the situation and plays the public system off against the private system. It creates negativity, division, harm and disunity within our schooling system. Sadly, this division and disunity are echoed and intensified by the comments of so many opposite. Sadly, the Australian Labor Party is happy to be part of this campaign of misrepresentation and dishonesty.</para><para>I want to make four points about this campaign and its dishonesty. The first point is that non-government schools do not get an unfairly high share of public funding. The nonsense that we heard from the member for Jagajaga before tries to pretend that somehow this government is favouring non-government schools, particularly elite non-government schools. The facts are simple: public schools in Australia received last year $19.9 billion of combined state and federal public funding; non-government schools, on the other hand, received $6.2 billion of public sector funding. So the 68 per cent of students who go to public schools received 76 per cent of public sector funding. The 32 per cent of students who attend non-government schools received 24 per cent of public sector funding.</para><para>The focus of the Education Union and New South Wales Teachers Federation and Labor Party campaign has been on just one component of funding. That has been the specifically targeted federal grants. They have totally deceptively and deliberately ignored the larger component of indirect funding that comes via general revenue grants, GST revenue et cetera to the states. Last year, the state governments received some $45 billion in total in revenue from the Commonwealth. Indirectly, that helps to fund state funding on public schools. The point is this: any meaningful, honest, accurate representation of funding needs to look at combined state and federal funding. In combined total figures, public schools receive $19.9 billion and non-government schools receive $6.2 billion. This is fundamentally fair.</para><para>For those non-government schools, the funding depends on the level of need. We are hearing much rhetoric from the other side about introducing a needs based formula. The funding formula is already based on need. The wealthier, less needy non-government schools receive 13.7 per cent—less than 14 per cent—of the average government school recurrent cost. It is a very small amount. The needier schools—those poorer Catholic schools and schools in greater need—can receive up to 70 per cent of the average government school recurrent cost. So the level of public funding, first of all, is always less than 100 per cent of the level of public school funding. Secondly, the proportion that is received depends on the level of need. This is fundamentally fair.</para><para>The second point that I want to make is that it is not a case of wealthy versus poor or of the government supporting wealthy private schools and not supporting supposedly poor, struggling public schools, and yet this is what we would be made to believe if we listened to the comments from the member for Jagajaga. The fact is that 80 per cent of the funding for non-government schools is for Catholic and low-fee Christian schools. It does not all go to so-called wealthy or elite schools; not even the majority of it goes to so-called wealthy or elite schools. Eighty per cent of it goes to the poorer Catholic or independent, low-fee Christian schools. The other point on this is that 20 per cent of families who send their children to non-government schools are earning family incomes of less than $21,000 a year. They are not all wealthy and they are not all elite. Many of them are struggling and yet, for whatever reasons, they still choose to send their children to non-government schools. This government respects and supports that choice. </para><para>The Blue Mountains Grammar School, a non-government school, is in my electorate. We hear people in the Australian Education Union and the Teachers Federation arguing that this is an elite private school and that the families are all wealthy and can afford to pay high fees. I know that there are two-income families at that school that have deliberately taken on a second job—it is usually the mother—in order to pay the fees, because they want to send their children to that school. In a conversation I had with the school principal recently, he said that many of the families are low and moderate income families, struggling to make the sacrifices to send their children to that school. He said that in some cases even the children are working in part-time jobs as well and contributing to the fees of that school. They are not elite, they are not wealthy; they are ordinary families making a choice in the best interests of their children, as they see it, and meeting the needs of their children. This government support that choice, and so we should.</para><para>The third point I want to make is that, contrary to the claims of the teachers unions, non-government schools actually save taxpayers and the education system substantial amounts of money. We have roughly 1.1 million students in non-government schools around this country. The level of funding those schools receive from the government is around $3,500 to $4,000 per student per year less than if they were public schools. That is, the non-government schools are subsidising the education of the children to the tune of around $4 billion a year. It is not simply that taxpayers are subsidising the education of the children, although that is happening; more to the point, they are subsidising the state governments of the day in educating their children. If all those children were to go back to the public systems, the public education systems around this country would have to find roughly $4 billion a year extra just to maintain the current level of per capita funding, just to maintain the same student to teacher ratios and just to maintain the same level of equipment in the schools. So it is not that money is being taken from public schools to give to non-government schools. The fact is simply that non-government schools are saving taxpayers and state and territory education systems money and making it possible for their education dollars to go further. If this were to be reversed, they would all be screaming because the funding per student in public schools, which is provided by state and territory governments, would be falling.</para><para>The fourth point I want to make about this debate from the teachers unions, and supported by the Labor Party, is that this debate has been letting the state and territory governments off the hook. Allowing the debate to focus on issues of federal funding between public and private schools has allowed the state governments to get away with the fact that they are underfunding state public schools. The fact is that public schools are constitutionally the responsibility of state governments. The member for Jagajaga was saying that it is everyone's responsibility to fund schools. It is. We help fund public schools with the massive general revenue grants—those massive buckets of money—that pass every year from the Commonwealth to the states, out of which they fund their public education system. So we are assisting; we are not ignoring our responsibilities. But with the Labor Party and the education unions trying to pretend that we are, and trying to create a dishonest view of what is going on, they are allowing the state governments to escape their responsibility. </para><para>In recent years we have seen direct federal grants—put aside the indirect grants for a moment—from the Australian government to state public schools growing faster than the grants of the state governments to their own schools, and they have been able to get away with that. Why? Because the teachers unions, supported by the Labor Party, have put the focus on the wrong issues. In the last year, for instance, Commonwealth direct grants to public schools rose by six per cent. State government grants to their schools rose, on average, by 2.1 per cent—that is around one-third of federal government grants, and not even keeping up with inflation. Over the past 8½ years under the Howard government direct federal grants to public schools have risen by 68 per cent. So this whole debate, this whole nonsense, that we are getting from the other side and the teachers unions is not only distorting the issue but allowing the state governments to escape their prime responsibility for funding public schools.</para><para>This bill illustrates and, indeed, confirms the Howard government's commitment to funding Australian schools and supporting parents in the choices they make regarding their children's education, be it in public, Catholic or non-government schools. Sadly, the Labor Party's view is different. They have indicated very clearly that they intend to cut the funding from some schools that they deem to be overresourced. This government says, `We're not going to cut funding from any school. We're committed to at least maintaining and, where we can, which is in most cases, we are increasing funding for our schools.' Yet the Labor Party's view is: `We think some schools get too much money. We think some schools are overresourced. We intend to cut funding from some of those supposedly overresourced schools.'</para><para>In a press release in March this year, when asked about how many schools, the member for Jagajaga and opposition spokesman for education said, `Well, if you look at Melbourne and Sydney, for instance, there is more than just a handful; there are many.' So there is not just a handful; there are many schools in the non-government sector from which Labor is planning to cut funding. In other words, Labor will penalise those parents who work hard, those families where two parents choose to work in order to pay school fees and those parents who take on an extra job or do overtime in order to pay the fees for their children to attend the schools of their choice; Labor will penalise them by reducing government funding. It is appalling that the Labor Party could even propose this. And what do we hear from the shadow spokesman? `Not just a handful; there are many schools.' It prompts the question: just how may schools are in fact on Labor's hit list? Just how many schools in the non-government sector will Labor cut funding from in order to appease the teachers unions? How many hardworking parents will they unfairly penalise? The union campaign supported by the Labor Party on this issue is divisive, it is dishonest and it is disgraceful. By contrast, this government is committed to supporting all parents in the choice of education for their children.</para><para>The second bill includes seven conditions of funding—seven accountability measures. Time prevents me going into these in detail, but the aim of these conditions is to make sure that the government funding that is given to help schools, be they public or non-government schools, will help to raise standards in these schools, help to instil the values that are important in these schools and help to ensure that children's needs and parental expectations are being met in these schools. I will quickly outline the seven conditions.</para><para>The first condition is that there has to be a move towards greater national consistency. We have the ridiculous situation in this country where we have six separate state education departments and two different territory education departments with different standards, different starting ages for school, different reporting arrangements et cetera. The government's intention is that we need to move towards a more coherent and consistent national standard. When there are 80,000 students each year moving interstate there is obviously a clear need for greater consistency. </para><para>The second condition is that there is clearer and better reporting to parents—not confused and vague reporting but clear reporting to parents—so they know how their child is performing at school in the basic subjects, against national standards and compared to other students. This way parents will know whether extra support or help is needed and they can talk with their children about those needs. The third condition is transparency of school performance so that parents know which schools are doing well and which are not doing well in a whole range of national benchmarks, including literacy and numeracy, year 12 results, school leaver destinations, teacher qualifications, teacher professional development, staff and student retention and absentee rates—all of these things. This way parents will know the quality of their school versus other schools.</para><para>The fourth condition is greater autonomy to school principals. This government believes that school principals have a much clearer idea of what is going on in a school, of the needs of the children and of the performance of their staff than do centralised state bureaucracies. The fifth condition is the implementation of a National Safe Schools Framework in which there are clear principles to which all schools will commit, ensuring the protection of children. The sixth condition is a commitment to physical activity. We have heard a lot lately about obesity and related problems. This is a requirement for at least two hours of physical education for students each week.</para><para>The final condition is making core values a part of schooling so that every school in this country, public or private, commits to focusing on those values we all consider essential to a cohesive, strong and united country. The government believe that these seven conditions will help focus the attention of schools on raising standards, on meeting the expectations of parents and on meeting the needs of the children they educate. The Howard government are committed to quality education and to supporting the choice of parents. We have shown that with record levels of funding. We have shown that with large increases in funding over previous years and we continue to commit to this. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>32162</page.no><name role="metadata">Organ, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ORGAN</name><name.id>BNL</name.id><electorate>Cunningham</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In rising to speak to the <inline ref="R2108">Schools Assistance (Learning Together-Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2110">States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Legislation Amendment Bill 2004</inline>,<inline ref="R2110"></inline>I must say at the outset that once again the Howard government has come out with another nasty piece of legislation which seeks to further undermine the nation's public education system, a fact not addressed by the previous government speaker who spoke often about choice and did not hold back in bagging the teachers unions. Unfortunately there was no mention by the previous speaker of what we are seeing out there in our communities, which is the running down of the public system. So many on the other side of this House are in denial about the crisis currently facing the public education system in this country. Many members in this House are quite aware of that crisis—they are made aware of it any time they visit their local public school. </para></talk.start><para>Who can forget the Prime Minister's ill-founded swipe at the values—or apparent lack thereof—of the public education system earlier this year? Teachers and parents committed to the public system were stunned and outraged by the Prime Minister's audacity on that occasion. This bill must be clearly seen for what it is: another blatant attack on the public education system in this country. We heard the previous speaker talk about the increasing amounts of money being put into the education system by this government, but the whole problem is that a lot of it is going into the private system while the public education system is missing out increasingly as time goes on.</para><para>We have seen that the Prime Minister's agenda is also being imposed on the public education system. For example, in order to qualify for the government's 2004 budget funding package, schools have been told that they must embrace apparent values based conditions, including each school flying the Australian flag. The Prime Minister told Australian schools that they would not receive federal funding unless they had `a functioning flagpole and flew the Australian flag'. Surely most parents and teachers are much more concerned with resources and infrastructure, especially at the present time, than whether their school flies a flag. I would suggest that most schools already have the flag flying anyway.</para><para>I know that in my own electorate of Cunningham there are numerous schools facing leaking buildings, doors falling off school classrooms and students forced to go to class in cold, damp and wet conditions. We could just go on and on. The infrastructure in the public education system is being run down as we speak. The federal government have a role to play in addressing this real concern out there at the moment. The Prime Minister is usually misguided on the subject of values at school. He seems to want to try once again to force his outmoded social perspective upon the next generation. He said with the budget that he will not give schools any money unless they agree to this. This is typical coalition social engineering in full flight.</para><para>The federal government have been attempting to undermine the perceived quality of our public education system for some time now and this bill is further evidence of that. It is about their attempts to make the public education system a residue system in this country. Rather than representing honestly what public education stands for and what it delivers to students—that is, quality, diversity, tolerance and access—this government are trying to make out that public education is the poor sibling of private education and that they are simply doing their bit to give the public system a hand up. The schools assistance bill is about this government's inability to recognise our public education system as one of the nation's greatest assets, just like their failure to recognise our public health care system as a national asset and a world leader. They want to downgrade public providers to speed up the transition over to private education because this government are obsessed with privatisation and the principles of user pays. The government fundamentally believe that those who can afford to pay deserve higher standards and that those who cannot must work harder until they can break through to the supposedly superior private system.</para><para>What this government must realise is that Australians recognise that our nation's greatest social asset—our commitment to egalitarianism—will be fatally undermined by the government's twisted and misguided ideological agenda. There is no doubt that the government are determined to create a nation of haves and have-nots. Undermining the public education system is just one element of their unwavering support for and faith in the free market. They seem to believe that it is not the government's role to provide essential education and health services but, rather, it is the role of the market to do so. We heard the previous speaker talk about the $4 billion that is coming out of the pockets of ordinary Australians in supporting the education system at the moment. Under this government that cost is increasing every day. </para><para>This government are encouraging in any way they can the flight of Australians from the public system to the private system. This is something that we all need to be really concerned about. This bill represents a further effort by the government to achieve this goal. As the Prime Minister explained when he announced the changes contained within this bill, parents want to see better standards in primary and secondary schools. So, according to the Prime Minister, it seems that obviously the public system needs help to get it up to private system standards. I think that is rubbish. This is despite the fact that most states have indicated that they already have in place most of the programs that the Prime Minister has highlighted, including, for example, compulsory two-hour-per-week exercise programs. By the end of last month, for example, only 123 schools had applied for the $1,500 to buy a flagpole, so it seems that most already have a flagpole standing with the flag fluttering. Teachers unions across the country have highlighted how the Howard government's proposals have more to do with politics than educational outcomes.</para><para>The Greens oppose this bill because most of the conditions which have been tied to funding are either inappropriate or unnecessary. On top of this, the Greens are fundamentally opposed to the inequitable socioeconomic status or SES funding model which, under this bill, the government plan to further extend. A major change implemented by this bill is that all nongovernment schools will now be covered by the SES system which was introduced in 2001. The SES funding model allocates money to a school based on the socioeconomic status of its students, regardless of tuition fees. This means that this government rely on a funding formula which allows them to financially bolster those schools which they perceive to be the best schools—the nation's wealthiest private schools. This government appear to be under the false impression that the most gifted and talented students attend the nation's wealthiest schools. Rather than bolstering our wonderful public system and ensuring that students across the nation continue to have equality of opportunity, this government now blatantly favour the nation's wealthiest schools. That cannot be denied. As a report tabled by Associate Professor Louise Watson at the Senate inquiry into this issue says:</para><quote><para>[Private] schools receive $368 million per year in government grants, which assist in raising their total average resources per student to more than 62% above average state school resources.</para></quote><para>The Greens consider this funding model completely unacceptable.</para><para>The consideration of this bill takes place against the backdrop of continuing debate about Commonwealth funding for schools. It is also occurring at the same time as the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee is conducting an inquiry into Commonwealth funding for schools. This committee is set to report on 11 August. Once again, we have a government showing disrespect to the parliamentary process by handing down relevant legislation into the House before a relevant committee hands down its own report. The committee is examining the principles of Commonwealth funding for schools with particular reference to efficiency, effectiveness and accountability. The Minister for Education, Science and Training, in his budget media release, announced that the government will provide $31.3 billion in funding for Australian schools from 2005 to 2008, representing an $8 billion increase over the current quadrennium of Commonwealth funding for schools in 2001 to 2004. That is $31.3 billion over that 2005-08 period. The bill gives effect to the budget provisions. </para><para>Over two-thirds of the $31.3 billion will be allocated to non-government schools, continuing a trend which has seen the non-government schools' share of Commonwealth specific purpose funding for schools grow from 55.6 per cent in 1995-96 to an estimated 68.9 per cent by 2007-08. That is an additional 13.3 per cent diverted away from the public sector. This allocation takes place in the context that the Australian government considers its school funding role as a supplementary one and that, under the Australian Constitution, government schools are the responsibility of state and territory governments. We have heard the previous speaker refer to that belief. Most of the $8 billion funding increase will be due to indexation and supplementation. From the various ministerial announcements regarding the funding arrangements for the next quadrennium, approximately $404.6 million, or five per cent of this increase, can be readily identified as new money. A major proportion of this money, amounting to $362 million, will finance the Catholic systemic schools' move into the socioeconomic status—SES—system of Commonwealth general recurrent funding for non-government schools.</para><para>There has been some confusion over the detail of the ALP school funding policy and its potential impacts. There can be no confusion over where the Greens stand on schools funding. As Senator Nettle, the Greens spokesperson on education, pointed out earlier this year, when a government choose whether to give money to the public school system or to further subsidise the private school system, the government are making a clear decision about the kind of society they want to be supporting. They are choosing between an inclusive, cohesive and high-performing society and a divided, elitist, and inefficient society. This is a choice the Greens are unafraid to make. We say loud and clear that public education must be the priority of all governments. We say that a free, universal, high-quality public education system is the best policy option for Australia. Such a system must enable lifelong learning and include preschool, primary, secondary, TAFE and university study.</para><para>The Greens recognise that there is a long history of private schooling in this country and that it fulfils a discrete role in the education spectrum. But the dominance of the public school system is a public good, and we believe that it should be recognised and defended as such. Only through a strong public school system that educates the overwhelming majority of our children can we guarantee an inclusive and cohesive education that knits our society together. An education system that allows wealth, religion, and snobbery to segregate kids at school is sowing the seeds for a divided and therefore poorer society. Sadly, this is the direction Australia is moving in as enrolments in public schools drop across the nation. Whilst this continues, governments and political parties cannot afford to stay silent about the shift in enrolments from public schools to private schools.</para><para>Support for public education is central to the political philosophy of the Greens. The benefits of education can only be distributed fairly if all children and all Australians have the right to access education free of charge. The Greens recognise that the process of learning is a continuum from birth to the end of our lives, so our commitment to social justice means that we support a free education system from early childhood through to university. No child should be denied the opportunity to learn and socialise with their peers because of financial barriers, in the same way that no student should be barred from going to university or TAFE because they cannot afford the fees. </para><para>The continuing trend of less federal money for public schools must therefore be reversed. Key to this reversal is the abolition of the outrageously inequitable SES funding system and the funding maintained status of wealthy independent schools and now of Catholic schools. The Greens have always been opposed to the SES system. We voted against it when it was first introduced and we will vote against it again in this debate. We have recognised from the outset that it would never deliver the advertised needs based funding but would entrench the advantage of the wealthiest private schools, and we are seeing that happen. By measuring needs via census districts rather than actual income or assets of parents, SES can never be an accurate model for measuring need, especially since it does not consider the millions of dollars that parents of private school children put into their children's schools. The government's continuing defence of such a model as equitable would be laughable if it did not have such a serious impact on the quality of education that future generations are receiving. The Greens are fundamentally opposed to the ideological thrust of the coalition's education policies and their implementation. They offend against our belief in social justice and they offend against our demand for responsible public policy.</para><para>You might ask: what is the Greens' vision of how to fund schools? This may be a controversial issue elsewhere, but there is unanimous support within the Greens and within the general community that I deal with for the need to prioritise the funding of public schools ahead of private schools. There is a limited bucket of money available from the public sector, and we feel that the public school sector should receive priority in that allocation. We reject the central argument put forward by advocates of private schooling that each taxpayer is entitled to a share of their education dollar. This is at the heart of the so-called choice argument constantly put by the government. This argument is peddled by the government despite the fact that this is not the way taxation works. Our taxes are not hypothecated—no-one can claim a personal share from their defence dollar or their welfare dollar, much as they may wish to. We all pay taxes, and services are provided for the whole of the community. The responsibility of government is to provide the best public education system they possibly can for the whole of the community.</para><para>The Greens' vision for how this should occur is to abolish the Commonwealth government's inequitable schemes for funding private schools, including the socioeconomic status—SES—and funding maintained formulas; to immediately end public funding for the wealthiest private schools, the former category 1 schools; to phase out public funding of category 2 private schools; and to significantly reduce the funding of category 3 private schools as well. Our vision is to redirect this money into a national priority public schools funding program, previously the Disadvantaged Schools Program, to assist in improving educational outcomes in public schools that need additional support. There is no doubt that there are a lot of public schools out there at the moment that need that additional support. The Greens are calling for the funding to private schools to be frozen at 2003-04 levels pending the outcome of a full inquiry into the funding of non-government schools. The Greens are committed to these measures because they represent a significant first step in turning around the enrolment trend away from public schools and towards ensuring that our public education system is up with the world's best. </para><para>The Greens' policies would ensure that approximately $6 billion would be redirected from the private to the public system over the next quadrennium, and that is approximately $610 per student. This would go a long way to addressing chronic teacher shortages, problem class sizes and increases in teacher salaries. But it is not the end of our commitment. The Greens support a further increase in direct federal funding to public schools which would bring our spending on public education closer to the OECD's highest, as a proportion of GDP and per capita levels.</para><para>The Greens believe that accountability for public money is a basic prerequisite of good government. To that end, private schools receiving public funding must fulfil the same accountability requirements as public schools. The Greens support the introduction of standards for full financial disclosure, transparency and accountability; the achieve-ment of core educational standards that must be met by all non-government schools receiving public funding; and the introduction of accountability frameworks to apply to government funding to non-government schools to create the same minimum level of public accountability and transparency that applies to public schools.</para><para>We believe that funding, accountability and equity are the three corners of a responsible and equitable schools policy. What is needed is an overhaul of schools funding which delivers more to public schools and scraps the unfair SES funding model for the private sector. What is also needed is a commitment to accountability for all public funds going to schools and an end to discrimination in any schools for any reason.</para><para>These initiatives can be funded by redirecting the government's existing schools expenditure on a more equitable basis. Australians have consistently told the government in recent times that, when it comes to budget time, people want public money invested in services like health and education, not frittered away on vote buying tax cuts. The Greens believe that in times of prosperity it is the responsibility of government to invest in public works and services that will stand us in good stead in leaner times. This means investment in education and health, not tax cuts.</para><para>Our policy is designed to ensure that its implementation would reap dividends for all Australians for generations to come and to turn around enrolments, as parents see government backing for our public schools and watch public schools thriving on that support. Given the great work currently done by teachers in the public school system, an injection of funds would allow such work to be magnified so as to turn out more quality students ready to make a great contribution to the community. In this way we will all see the benefits of investing in and supporting our public schools. A great public education system, educating the overwhelming majority of the population to the highest quality, can only be of massive lasting benefit culturally, socially, academically and economically to the nation, and that is what the Greens are working for.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>32168</page.no><name role="metadata">Pearce, Christopher, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PEARCE</name><name.id>A8W</name.id><electorate>Aston</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is a great pleasure for me to rise tonight in the House and to speak on this very important legislation—the <inline ref="R2108">Schools Assistance (Learning Together-Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Bill 2004 </inline>and the <inline ref="R2110">States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Legislation Amendment Bill 2004</inline>—which deals with the education of young people across this nation. The 18th century philosopher Rousseau once wrote:</para></talk.start><quote><para>We are born weak, we need strength; helpless, we need aid; foolish, we need reason. All that we lack at birth, all that we need when we come to man's estate, is the gift of education. </para></quote><para>While society has of course developed significantly since then, these words still reflect the underlying importance of education. Education equips our young people with the skills to reach their potential and to shape our future. Education is our greatest investment for future success and prosperity.</para><para>From the outset I want to say how much I respect and admire the work of educators across this great nation. They are the great unsung heroes, and their work in teaching our nation's youth is a huge and critical responsibility—one that I know they take very seriously and undertake with great passion. The Howard government fully understand this—an understanding reflected in our strong track record in the area of education. Under this government, all schools have received greater support because we value their contribution to society. In every budget, and in grants to every state and territory for every year since 1996, school funding has increased.</para><para>This legislation builds on that foundation by continuing the two-pronged approach to education that has delivered real results to children in Australia. The first fundamental tenet that has underpinned our approach to education has been the provision of additional resources for Australian schools. In the next four years, the government will deliver over $31 billion to Australian schools. This is the largest ever funding commitment, and it is an increase of $8 billion on the previous four years. By increasing financial assistance to both government and non-government schools, particularly those serving the neediest communities, the government are playing their part in helping students get more from their education.</para><para>Over the next four years, state and territory governments will receive almost $10 billion in supplementary funding for their schools. This represents an increase of almost $2 billion over the previous period in this area—a product of the government's policy, which delivers increases of six per cent per annum. From next year, Catholic systemic schools will be fully integrated into the socioeconomic status funding model. This means that every non-government school in Australia, regardless of affiliation or denomination, will receive funding on the basis of the socioeconomic status of the communities they serve. As a result, Catholic systemic schools will share in over $12 billion over the next four years. Independent schools will continue to be funded according to the socioeconomic status model and will receive over $7 billion during the coming four years.</para><para>These funding arrangements demonstrate two key points of differentiation between the coalition government and Labor. The first is that under this government every student and every student's family in Australia will be financially supported, regardless of the school they attend. The second is that under this government no Australian school will have its funding cut.</para><para>The crux of the issue here is choice and the right of Australian parents to have that choice. This government supports the right of parents in my electorate and across the nation to choose the school that best meets their child's needs. Labor, in contrast, for some strange reason want to punish those parents that choose to send their children to a non-government school. They want to punish them by taking away valuable resources from children for their education.</para><para>In addition to this general funding, the Howard government is also investing more in specific programs designed to help those students that need a little extra help. The $2 billion Literacy, Numeracy and Special Learning Needs program has received an increase in funding of 25 per cent. This includes additional support for students in both government and non-government schools that need extra assistance. The new tuition credit initiative will provide help for those children that have not attained the minimum reading skills as measured by the year 3 national reading benchmark. Up to $700 worth of tuition will be available for students on a one-to-one basis out of school hours by appropriately qualified, screened and vetted tutors. Parents will be able to redeem their tuition credit to choose the most appropriate type of assistance for their children. </para><para>This initiative is an important and practical step in the government's work of ensuring that all students have the necessary fundamental skills in literacy and numeracy. However, as I mentioned earlier, these additional resources are only part of the equation. The second fundamental tenet of the coalition's approach to education is to make the country's investment in education work more smartly. We understand that we have a responsibility to ensure that our children get the most from the public investment in education. That means providing the right framework to achieve excellence and to promote performance outcomes. The success of introducing national literacy and numeracy benchmarks demonstrates the value of this kind of approach, and we are building on past achievements with these new measures. These measures will work to ensure our increased funding does deliver improved educational outcomes for our children.</para><para>The first initiative in this area is greater national consistency, which is something that I have spoken about before in this House. At present, for some antiquated and outdated reason, the education systems of each state and territory in this country differ markedly from each other in a range of ways. These are differences that cause enormous difficulties for over 80,000 students and their families who move interstate each year. This will finally begin to change under this reforming legislation. State and territory governments, along with school authorities, will have to agree to implement by 2010 a common school starting age and common testing standards. This will not only help address one of the challenges faced by those students who move interstate but will also ensure that all Australian students meet key educational benchmarks.</para><para>The second initiative is in the area of better reporting to parents. Too often, parents are not provided with a real understanding of their child's progress. Under the new funding conditions, school reports will be required to be written in plain language and include assessment of their achievement against national standards. Parents will also be provided with greater reporting about school performance. All schools will be required to publish school performance information. This will enable parents to assess schools comparatively and, where appropriate and where needed, better hold their school accountable. This information will include national literacy and numeracy benchmark achievement rates, year 12 results, school leaver destinations, staff and student retention rates and staff and student absenteeism rates.</para><para>The third initiative is greater autonomy for local schools. As I travel around to schools in my electorate, one thing that strikes me is their diversity—a diversity that needs to be acknowledged. Principals, teachers and the local school community are best placed to know how to best address the challenges their school faces. We need to give them the autonomy, support and encouragement to do just that. Of course, along with greater autonomy comes greater accountability. Parents cannot expect schools to be accountable for meeting targets when their hands are tied. This legislation provides local schools and principals with that much-needed flexibility to better achieve this. </para><para>The fourth initiative is creating safer schools for our schoolchildren. It is vital, if we are to ensure our children get the most from their education, that they feel safe and protected at school. All parents and teachers would agree that bullying is never acceptable, but not every school has a clear protocol in place for dealing with incidences of bullying when they occur. All schools will now be required to implement the national safe schools framework. This framework sets out the guiding principles for schools to follow in providing a safe learning environment.</para><para>The fifth initiative is ensuring a common commitment to physical activity. We have heard a lot lately about the increasing incidence of childhood obesity and the decreasing level of physical activity among our young people. These trends create a significant challenge for our society, particularly in the area of health and its impact. Under the new funding conditions, all students in the compulsory years of schooling will have to undertake a minimum of two hours of physical education as part of the curriculum. Again, this is a practical initiative aimed at getting real results for our children.</para><para>Finally, the sixth initiative is to emphasise the role of values, elevating that role to a core position as an even more important part of Australia's education system. The government will be seeking the states' and territories' endorsement of the national framework for values education in Australian schools. In addition, every school will be required to have a functioning flagpole and to fly the Australian flag. This is an initiative that many schools in my electorate and across Australia are already openly embracing.</para><para>These bills represent a comprehensive plan for reform of Australian school education over the next four years. It is a plan that not only invests additional resources in our local schools but also ensures our children get the maximum return. We hear a lot in this place about the importance of making positive change. Unfortunately, we also hear a lot of negative whingeing and whining from Labor when it comes to change of any kind. My view is that the initiatives in this legislation are another very positive step forward in supporting children, in supporting parents, in supporting educators to do even more great work in their daily lives. Nelson Mandela summed it up well when he said, `Education is the most powerful weapon you can use to change the world.' We in this place are charged with the responsibility of designing and establishing policies and initiatives that support positive change. We should get on with discharging this responsibility as a matter of urgency, for the benefit of all Australians.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>32170</page.no><name role="metadata">Hall, Jill, MP</name><name role="display">Ms HALL</name><name.id>83N</name.id><electorate>Shortland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It really surprises me to hear the member who preceded me quoting Nelson Mandela, because I think his interpretation of education and quality education is that it is for everybody, not just an elite few.

In doing so I wish to place on record my disgust at the way in which the Howard government has managed education in Australia since it came into power. Australian families could be forgiven for believing that the Howard government has a vendetta against teachers who teach in public schools, against parents who send their children to public schools and against the 70 per cent of students who attend those public schools. </para></talk.start><para>In the Shortland electorate over 80 per cent of students attend public schools. Under the Howard government, they have been continually disadvantaged. That is not right. Education should be quality education for all children. It should not be differentiated. It is an absolute disgrace that an Australian government would favour one section of students. Under this government, unfortunately, there has been a favouring of those students who attend private schools, particularly if that private school happens to be an elite private school.</para><para>The Howard government would have to be the most conservative government in Australia in the last 40 years. It has set about implementing its conservative agenda. Part of that conservative agenda it hopes to achieve through education, spending 70 per cent of the education budget on the 30 per cent of students that attend private schools. That is not acceptable. This government talks about choice and about providing choice to people to attend the school of their choice and to attend private school. I would argue that choice has to be real choice. Choice has to be choice that links into availability—availability of those elite private schools. I can assure the House that there is not one of those elite private schools within the Hunter or within the Central Coast of New South Wales, which is the area that the Shortland electorate covers. Choice to attend private schools also has an income association. Fees in some of these elite private schools are as high as $15,000 a year. It is well and truly outside the capacity of many families within the Shortland electorate and other electorates throughout Australia to be able to afford to send their children to these schools.</para><para>I have done a bit of research on the income levels of families whose children attend private schools and families whose children attend public schools. Both at primary and secondary level, public schools have a larger proportion of students who come from low-income families. In public schools 42 per cent of students come from low-income families, whilst in private schools that figure is around the 20 per cent mark. If you were to look at the elite private schools, that would be further differentiated. When I look at that and at the government's argument of choice and providing families and students with choice, I would argue pretty strongly that that choice is not real choice. A much smaller proportion of students in public schools come from high-income families than in private schools. In fact 47 per cent of students in private schools are from high-income families whilst only 21 per cent of students in public schools are from high-income families. It becomes a socioeconomic issue. It is all about fairness and access to education. If the government is pushing its funds into private schools, it is favouring private schools and 30 per cent of students—the majority of whom come from high-income families—attend those schools, it sounds to me very much like we have a very elitist system developing within this country.</para><para>King's School have had a 165 per cent increase in their funding over the period 2001-04 under the government's SES funding formula. I have to say that that does not sit well with me, particularly when I have schools in my electorate like Belmont High School. They have contacted me because they need over $3 million in major capital works over a three-year period. However, things have changed a little since I received their letter detailing the facts of what they need. There was a fire at the school and one of the buildings was completely destroyed. This has caused enormous distress for the teachers, the pupils and the families of those pupils. I would like to congratulate the school and everybody involved in that school community on the way they have worked together to try and get over the great drama and devastation that they felt at the loss of that building and the way that has interfered with students preparing for their HSC exams. Belmont High School also need a multipurpose centre, a performing arts centre, technology access, building modification, upgrade of staffing facilities, upgrade of electrics to sustain the IT expansion that is needed, paraprofessionals to help the teachers with the bureaucratic functions and allow them to concentrate more on what they are trained to do—that is, to teach the students—and additional general assistance to help in the maintenance of the school. They also need additional staff for support programs—programs that the Howard government is placing emphasis on. It is a school that is no longer fit for its purpose of C21 learning. </para><para>I would argue that the students who attend Belmont High School should not be disadvantaged in the way that they have been under this government. Warners Bay Public School is another school that contacted me. They have very limited resources, particularly in the language field, and they need more access to TVs and DVDs. The kinds of things that develop their learning and knowledge are probably a little more important than the cricket pitches, playing fields and extra swimming pools that have been built within some of the elite category 1 schools. They need more reading resources, covered walkways, PA systems and a full-time computer consultant. The list goes on and on.</para><para>It makes me very angry that schools in the Shortland electorate are going without, and will continue to go without under this legislation, whilst schools such as King's thrive. It is not about providing more playing fields and better sporting facilities; it is about ensuring that the students I represent in this parliament have access to a quality education, an education that will ensure they have equal opportunity in life.</para><para>Another indication of some of the differences in the level of funding is that, in the 2004 federal recurrent funding, public primary schools received $539 per student and the wealthiest private schools received $830 per student. In public secondary schools, the funding was $803 per student. In the wealthiest private schools, it was $1,099. I say that that is not good enough. I say that the students I represent in this parliament deserve an equal deal. They do not deserve to be treated as second-class citizens. The Howard government's approach to education is consistent with its general philosophy, its approach to life and what it believes should be the order—that is, if you have everything, you should have more; wealthier people in our community deserve more; if you are an average student from a wealthy family, you deserve the best education money can buy; if you are a brilliant student from a poor family, a working-class family or just an ordinary Australian family, you deserve a second-class education. The cake is for the wealthy and the friends of the Howard government and the crumbs from the table are for the 70 per cent of students who attend public schools—and it is 80 per cent of students within the Shortland electorate. I do not believe that that is good enough.</para><para>I do not believe that schools within the Shortland electorate should be disadvantaged to the tune that they are disadvantaged. If the Howard government gave the same amount of federal funding to public schools that it does to private schools, what would that mean for the schools in the Shortland electorate? For Belmont High School, it would mean nearly $3 million. For Belmont North Public School, it would be in excess of $500,000. For Belmont Public School, it would be in excess of $1 million. For Blacksmiths Public School, it would be in excess of $250,000. For Budgewoi Public School, it would be nearly $2 million. For Caves Beach Public School, it would be in excess of $1.2 million. For Charlestown Eastern Public School, it would be in excess of $700,000. For Charlestown Public School, it would be in excess of $600,000. For Dudley Public School, it would be in excess of $500,000. For Eleebana Public School, it would be in excess of $1.2 million. For Floraville Public School, it would be in excess of $1.3 million. For Gateshead Public School, it would be in excess of $400,000. For Windale Public School, which is the school in the most disadvantaged area in the Shortland electorate, it would be in excess of $700,000. There are many schools that I could detail, but if I do that I will run out of time. </para><para>But the message is that those 80 per cent of students who attend the quality public schools in my electorate, with the dedicated teachers and parents who work, run raffles and do everything that they can just to get the basic equipment for the schools, deserve the same share of the education dollar from this federal government as those elite public schools. In fact, they deserve more because they are struggling. The kids who go to those schools deserve the same opportunities in life as those children who go to the King's School, Shore or whatever elite private school it might be. Students should not be disadvantaged. Education is our future, and if we have one group of students getting a quality education and another getting a second-class education it is not very good for the future of Australia.</para><para>The Howard government's record in supporting public schools, as I have just demonstrated, has been appalling. It is worthwhile reviewing some of its performances since it was elected. It is definitely shown by private schools. I think I have demonstrated that most adequately so far. Some of the measures that have been introduced include the abolition of the new non-government school policy. There have been huge increases in funding to private schools. There has been the introduction of the new SES funding model, biased to the more wealthy private schools, and establishment grants to encourage the growth of private schools. I think that this is really a condemnation of the Howard government. What it has done to education since it came to power should be more than enough to see it voted out of office at the next election. We have heard the Minister for Education, Science and Training stand up here and make light of the real concerns of the people who come and visit me on a daily basis, people who are concerned about the fact that their school does not have the most basic of equipment. Their concern is that this Howard government is showing such a preference for the wealthiest schools, and that really makes me annoyed.</para><para>More than 50 of the wealthiest schools got an increase of $1 million over the last four years. Another thing I found quite interesting within the Central Coast area—in the electorate of Robertson, adjoining my electorate—was that there has been a decline in the number of students attending private schools. But that decline was not followed with a decline in funding to those schools; in fact they received an increase. Unfortunately it does not work that way for public schools, as we all know in this House. I think it is really important to note that over the years, as a nation, we have valued public education. Public education is the key to a successful future for this country. I think it is time that the Howard government rethought its approach to education with it spending so much money on students going to private schools and so little on those attending public schools. Public schools are inclusive; it is education for everyone. By investing in public education we are investing in democracy and in the future. </para><para>The Howard government's record speaks for itself. The sad thing about the Howard government's record on education is that it spells missed opportunity for Australia. The success of a nation is determined by the level of education and skill of its population. It should be quality education for all. We should be ensuring that the best and brightest students have the ability to fulfil their potential. They should be able to access education because of their ability, not because of their ability to pay. In the world we live in now, in a global economy, if we are going to be a successful nation it is so important that we have this educated and highly skilled work force, and that is only achieved by ensuring that our kids have the ability to get that quality education. We do not need a society where we have an underclass. We do not need a society that fits in with the Howard government's picture of the world.</para><para>The Labor Party recognises this, and that is why we have given the commitment to fund all schools based on need. Labor will significantly increase funds to public schools and redistribute money from the wealthy private schools to the needy Catholic and independent schools. We will ensure the certainty of a quality education for everyone. We will ensure that public education is not second-class education but is given the respect and resources it needs. Incentives will be put in place for the most experienced teachers to continue to work within the system. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>32174</page.no><name role="metadata">Hunt, Gregory, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HUNT</name><name.id>00AMV</name.id><electorate>Flinders</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R2108">Schools Assistance (Learning Together-Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Bill 2004</inline> and the related <inline ref="R2110">States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Legislation Amendment Bill 2004. </inline>I come to this chamber with a passion for local and community education. Very recently I had the fortune to walk 500 kilometres around my electorate over a period of 19 days. That walk was based on raising awareness of and funds for juvenile diabetes. At the heart of the walk were visits to 51 schools around the Mornington Peninsula, Westernport and Bass Coast. To see so many primary, secondary, government, non-government, Christian and ecumenical schools together in such a short period of time gave me a unique sense of the quality, worth and energy of education within my area. Whether it was Tootgarook Primary School, San Remo Primary School, Rye Primary School, Dromana Secondary College, Rosebud Secondary College or many of the other schools, there was a great commitment from the teaching staff, the students and the parenting community to the worth and quality of the education provided for students.</para></talk.start><para>Having looked at the schools in my electorate, I want to start my speech by talking about a very simple principle, and that is that a commitment made should be a commitment honoured. It is with great regret that I raise in the House the fact that it now appears that the Somerville Secondary College, which was promised two years ago by the Victorian government for delivery at the commencement of 2005, will not be built until 2006. Over 130 families have enrolled their children in the school. For the town it is a critical part of bringing and binding Somerville together—not just Somerville but also Tyabb and Baxter. The towns need that school. It is a school which was promised and to which the Commonwealth has committed and paid over $2 billion. That money is in the bank, waiting to be used, waiting for the school to be started.</para><para>A newspaper from my electorate this week carried the heading `Delay on new high school'. The opening paragraph read:</para><quote><para>A secret briefing between council officers and the education department last week was advised that Somerville Secondary College will not be built until 2006. </para></quote><para>For two years now 130 families have relied on the promise that the school would be available. A community has relied on the promise of the Victorian government that a school would be available. That promise has been breached, the faith has been broken and the school will not be built. The school will be a year late. By then the $2 million will have sat there for three years with no action. A site which is bare, vacant, ready for action and ready for commencement tomorrow remains inactive. Not a sod has been turned; not a hole has been dug.</para><para>My message is very simple. It is the same message that the community will be giving out in a week. That message is: `Mr Bracks, keep your promise; build our school now.' Along with the Westernport Basketball Association, I will be holding a community rally for Somerville Secondary College on Sunday, 15 August 2004, between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m., at the Somerville Recreation and Community Centre—or the basketball stadium, as it is known. We will be doing that as a community, to lay down the very principle that a commitment given should be a commitment honoured. That is a very simple principle.</para><para>Within my electorate of Flinders we have a critical need for an educational commitment to be honoured. We have a critical need within the town of Somerville and the related towns of Tyabb and Baxter for the Somerville Secondary College to be provided now, not just for the students but also to provide the missing link in the development of Somerville as a close-knit and tight community. It is a critical need. It was one which was promised two years ago. It was one which we have been assured repeatedly will be delivered, and it will not be. We will do all that we can to ensure that the students, parents and residents of Somerville have that school and that it is delivered now—in time for 2005. Anything less would be an utter and total breach of faith.</para><para>Against that background, I want to look at the larger picture presented by these bills. These bills jointly achieve a very simple thing: they help to deliver $31.3 billion for schools, from the Commonwealth, over the coming quadrennium. It is an increase of $8 billion over the current quadrennium, or four-year period. It is the largest funding commitment to Australian schools in Australian history. Above all else, it enshrines a series of principles. The first principle is that parents have the right to choose the type of education and the type of school that they want for their children. The second is that every child is entitled to some form of assistance from the government in the process and passage of education.</para><para>We do not impose on children from upper income families barriers to going to state schools. We do not impose penalties on children who attend Catholic or other non-government schools. But we do fund on the basis of need; we do recognise on the basis of need. That is why, on a per child basis, there is a dramatically higher proportion of public funds which go to fund public education. It is a simple, clear, undeniable fact. It can be obfuscated and abused, but the fact is simple: on a per capita basis the overwhelming balance of funds goes from public sources to public schools. That is right; it is proper. It is not proper that there should be no funding at all. It is not right that there should be no funding for entire groups of students, many of whom come from double-income families where both parents are working hard simply to help their children attend the school of the parents' choice. The third principle is that the legislation strengthens schools and builds national consistency. The fourth principle contained in this legislation is that it renews the government's commitment to school education for the next four years. </para><para>Looking at the reality of what is proposed in these bills, I simply want to highlight a few key points. Firstly, as I mentioned, there will be $31.3 billion for schools across Australia over the period 2005-08. Secondly, there is a significant increase in state school funding in the next four years. There will be $9.8 billion in supplementary funding to state governments for schools, an increase of $1.9 billion. Of that, $7.2 billion will be in recurrent grants. That is a 28 per cent increase over a four-year period in recurrent grants. That is a great step forward. Thirdly, on the Catholic school front, we will see the delivery of $12.6 billion over the next four years to the neediest of the non-government schools. As a result, Catholic schools will receive $362 million more as a collective. I think that is a tremendously important initiative. Fourthly, there will be an increase in funding for independent schools. Fifthly, in terms of special purpose grants, there is an increase in funding for literacy and numeracy, on the basis that they are the foundation of learning and knowledge going forward. Those are the important steps that are contained within these two legislative actions.</para><para>I came to this House with a passion for and commitment to education. I recently had the opportunity to visit, in one three-week period, 51 of the schools within my own electorate and to work with kids who contributed so much to other children by fundraising for juvenile diabetes. I am proud of their work, and I commend them, whether they are from Dromana secondary, Rosebud secondary, Kooweerup secondary or any of the other many schools in the electorate. But I conclude by noting that there is a gap. Somerville secondary college needs to be built. The community deserves to have it built. It was promised that it would be built. It should be built. For that reason, I say to the Victorian government: honour your promise and build our school now.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>32176</page.no><name role="metadata">Irwin, Julia, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs IRWIN</name><name.id>83Z</name.id><electorate>Fowler</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In his announcement <inline ref="R2108">Schools Assistance (Learning Together—Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Bill 2004</inline>, the Prime Minister made a great fuss in this chamber about every school in Australia having a flagpole. That was to be one of the conditions for receiving federal funding. That statement caused me a great deal of worry because many schools in the Fowler electorate, which I represent, do not have a working flagpole. They have an Australian flag and they display it proudly, but, for reasons that I will explain, they do not have a working flagpole.</para></talk.start><para>I should add that schools in the Fowler electorate are among the most disadvantaged schools in Australia. They have high numbers of children from low-income families, they have high numbers of children from families that do not speak English at home, and there are many children who are living with only one parent. In a lot of cases, they are living with grandparents. So I was alarmed by the announcement which could mean that those most disadvantaged schools in our system could miss out on federal funding. That would be a tragedy. But what the Prime Minister's announcement shows is just how wrong this government's priorities are and what a disaster they are for children in many parts of Australia.</para><para>To explain why, I should tell the House a story told to me about a typical school and its flagpole. As you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, members can provide an Australian flag to schools and other organisations in their electorate. The member was happy to meet the request of the principal of a local school, who phoned to say that she had arranged for a new flagpole to be erected at the school. She asked if the member could attend a special function to present an Australian flag and to have the flag raised on the new flagpole. When the appointed day came along, the member arrived at the school, where he was met with some very disappointing news: the previous night, a less than civic-minded citizen had cut and removed the rope from the flagpole. </para><para>The ceremony went ahead, with the member presenting the flag to the school, but, as the students could not raise the flag, they proudly held it out for the assembled students to see. As the story goes, it was one of those wonderful occasions when the children sang <inline font-style="italic">Give Me a Home among the Gum Trees</inline> and the lovely Bruce Woodley song <inline font-style="italic">I am Australian</inline>. I will not sing the song—I have a shocking singing voice—but I am sure you know the words, and I am sure those words bring a lump to your throat too. Of course, the children also sang the national anthem.</para><para>The principal was very upset and was determined to have a working flagpole. To replace the rope cost only a few dollars, but the problem was how to get the rope through the pulley at the top of the flagpole. While some of the year 6 students volunteered to climb the pole, the principal ruled that out as it could be too dangerous. So, from the school's minor maintenance budget, the principal paid for a new rope and the hire of a cherry picker to replace the stolen halyard at a cost of over $200, and for a few days the school proudly flew its Australian flag.</para><para>Members might have already guessed what happened next: the same or another less than civic-minded citizen returned to the school to cut and remove the rope again. The principal was in despair. What should she do? She could have spent another $200, knowing that almost certainly the rope would be stolen again. More importantly, she could think of many other urgent projects to spend her minor maintenance budget on—things which affected the safety of students and staff, or repairs to much-needed equipment. Wisely, she chose to leave the flagpole ropeless. She placed the school's Australian flag on the stage of the school's small assembly room, where it still flies today safe and secure.</para><para>When I visit schools for their end-of-year assemblies, the Australian flag is there in the hall. The children sing <inline font-style="italic">Give Me </inline><inline font-style="italic">a </inline><inline font-style="italic">Home among the Gum Trees</inline>, they bring a lump to my throat when they sing `I am, you are, we are Australian,' and of course they sing the national anthem. They are proud and patriotic schools—but many do not have a flagpole. The teachers are some of the most dedicated that I have met—but their schools do not have a flagpole. The students work hard to overcome their disadvantages and they achieve good results—but their schools do not have a flagpole. The minister would have us think that these schools do not deserve federal funding. That tells me a lot about how wrong-thinking the legislation we are debating tonight is.</para><para>Debate interrupted.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>32177</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

I wish to thank the Geebung Zillmere RSL club for providing the rooms for the evening. I guess we were all surprised by the huge turnout, with about 50 people standing in addition to the 300 that were seated. The success of the night shows there is an incredible interest and quest for knowledge out there for information on prostate cancer. While the audience was mainly 300 blokes, there were about 30 wives, girlfriends and daughters attending. I know from the calls coming into my office that many wives and partners were just as enthusiastic about the event as the men were. </para><para>At my invitation, Dr Peter Heathcote agreed to speak at the forum, in an effort to spread the word amongst a key group at risk—men over 50. Men over 50 with a first-degree relative who has had prostate cancer are three times more at risk than men on average. On average, one in 10 men will experience prostate cancer and, on average, if someone has a first-degree relative who has had prostate cancer they are three times more likely to experience it. Doug Sparkes, a local who is fighting his own battle against prostate cancer, found the evening very informative. He said, `The thing with prostate cancer is that unless you are tested you may never know you have got it.' There should be more interest in prostate cancer and more information. He said, as we all know, that it is `as big a killer of men as breast cancer is of women.' That is a strong case for much more public awareness about both these dreadful cancers.</para><para>It was good to see many others come along, particularly family members. Sisters Karen Maguire and Michelle Eales attended for their father, who is also fighting prostate cancer. They said they came along in support of their family, so that they could better understand the disease and help their mum and dad. As Michelle said: `I'm a hairdresser and women come in all the time and will tell you about their problems, but that's not the case with men. A lot of men don't say how they feel, and they suffer in silence. Let me tell you, not talking about it doesn't help at all.' More information is needed, which is why the federal government will, I hope, in the not too distant future put its full weight behind a much needed public awareness campaign about prostate cancer in our community.</para><para>I would also like to remark on today's events. Today the Howard government has been forced to admit that it would have clawed back the promised $600 budget bonus for families after the election by cutting future increases in fortnightly family benefits. It is about time that the Howard government put Australia first, instead of playing politics with the lives of families and the financial support that goes to them. Through the cuts, which have been the centrepiece of this year's budget, the $600 bonus was to be eroded in five to seven years. I know that members opposite would not even be aware of the sneaky clawback clause that was put into the legislation. So now, after months of denying there was a clawback, the Minister for Family and Community Services was today back-pedalling, saying special legislation is now required—admitting what Labor has been saying for months and admitting to the Senate that special legislation will be required to stop this sneaky clawback.</para><para>Despite the minister's weasel words, it is clear that the government always intended to claw back benefits after the election. The clauses contained in the legislation rushed through the parliament after the budget would not have been drafted in this way unless the government wanted a mechanism to claw back the payments after the election. The truth is that the Howard government wanted to play Santa Claus before the election, only to be Scrooge afterwards. The clawback shows the Howard government is up to its old tricks, using sneaky indexation clauses to claw back money from the pockets of ordinary workers. </para><para>This is yet another example of the Howard government putting its political interests before the long-term interests of Australian families. Australian families need a family payment system which is accurate and which delivers generous payments regularly and which does not leave them with a long-term debt. One in three of all Australian families have a debt in the family payment system—those debts are currently averaging $900. Because of the 27 payments in this financial year, next financial year that average debt could head to $1,300 and upwards. It is yet another example of the Howard government not being frank with Australian families about the extent to which its family payment system gives them debts. That is why we need a Latham Labor government committed to generous, timely and regular family payments which substantially eliminate the risk of debt in the family payment system.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Paterson Electorate: After-Hours GP Service</title><page.no>32179</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>32179</page.no><name role="metadata">Baldwin, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BALDWIN</name><name.id>LL6</name.id><electorate>Paterson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight to speak on behalf of the Hunter After Hours GP service, which has been running in my local area since 1999. By way of background, in 1997 I was approached by local doctors to help establish an after-hours medical service near Maitland Hospital to provide medical treatment and advice and. in particular, to reduce the out of hours pressure on the 237 local doctors. We were successful in gaining funding for a trial of the GP access after-hours service to be based at Maitland Hospital and later the service was expanded throughout the Hunter region and is funded by the Australian Government at $6.5 million each year.</para></talk.start><para>Since October 1999, almost 85,000 people have been through the service as in-patients, seeking treatment for lacerations, soft tissue injuries, allergic reactions, fractures, infections, foreign bodies in eyes, and colds and flu. Almost 67,000 people have obtained medical advice from the hotline, another 800 have had a home visit by a doctor, and there have been 580 funded transport operations to the hospital. This year alone, 40,000 patients have seen a GP after hours, 45,000 people have called the telephone hotline service for medical advice, 560 patients have received home visits from the GP service and there have been 330 funded transport arrangements to the hospital.</para><para>The after-hours GP service was and still is a good idea. I applaud the Howard government for giving it its start and for contributing around $12 million over the last four years. I believe in this service and am absolutely committed to it. When the contracts for the funding of this service were drafted, there was a requirement that an evaluation be carried out prior to the Australian government recommitting the funding.</para><para>I have no problem with a review of this service. All programs which receive Commonwealth funding and taxpayer investment should be evaluated to ensure that they are meeting the needs of the community and that they are cost effective. The issue is, however, that the Hunter Urban Division of General Practice say the service will be closed in March 2005 if funding is not renewed before the end of the year. Why? Because the contract also specifies, rightly so, that this service must not operate in deficit.</para><para>At the moment, without a commitment to funding beyond June 2005, the budget will blow out because the Hunter Urban Division of General Practice is prudently factoring in staff entitlements in the event of the service closing down. That truncates around 10 weeks of running costs from the current financial year budget. I want to see this service continue uninterrupted. It is a service that is popular with the patients and is used the way it was designed to be used—for ailments and injuries which cannot wait but do not necessarily need to be presented to an emergency room. </para><para>The Access After Hours Service is also useful for our local nursing homes. It means a doctor can visit a nursing home out of hours rather than a resident being transported by ambulance to the hospital. Tonight I am calling on the Minister for Health and Ageing to ensure that this service will continue to operate past March 2005. An evaluation of the service is due, but the results need to be taken on board. I do not believe there is enough time left to do this properly before the next budget, so I want the review to take place sooner rather than later to give both doctors and patients some security with the service. It has been a great model of service to patients and support to doctors. In a regional area this service is something we can be very proud of and should continue to support. However, I have been personally disappointed with the Hunter Urban Division of General Practice and their personal attacks on me in the Hunter media on this issue, despite the fact that I have always supported and will continue to support this service. Why? Because it benefits my constituents and the practitioners alike. Of the 85,000 people who have used this service, around 10 per cent live in Paterson. The other 90 per cent come from the Hunter, Shortland, Charlton and Newcastle.</para><para>I ran into the Minister for Health and Ageing yesterday and mentioned the `intense and nonstop efforts of the Hunter Labor MPs', as printed in the <inline font-style="italic">Newcastle </inline><inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline>, attributed to Dr Arn Sprogis from the Hunter Urban Division of General Practice. He said he had a couple of very soft letters but had not been contacted personally by the above mentioned members. I am disappointed but not surprised. I stand here alone, defending the access to the after hours service. Again I say that this valued after-hours GP service provides a necessary and quality service that meets the requirements of my constituents. In conclusion, on behalf of my constituents I call on the minister to listen to the Hunter community, evaluate the service now and keep providing the funding to keep it going beyond March next year and operating in confidence.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Trichothiodystrophy</title><page.no>32180</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>32180</page.no><name role="metadata">Vamvakinou, Maria, MP</name><name role="display">Ms VAMVAKINOU</name><name.id>00AMT</name.id><electorate>Calwell</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This Friday marks the annual Jeans for Genes Day, a day which is very well known to all of us for promoting the recognition of rare genetic disorders and for raising awareness about the need to conduct research and find cures for people who suffer from rare genetic conditions. Tonight I want to talk about a family in my electorate of Calwell whose little boy Sammy Joe Liistro suffers from a rare genetic disorder called trichothiodystrophy. It is so rare that Sammy Joe is one of only 14 children to have this condition in Australia. Sammy Joe's mother, Maria, recently came to see me to seek my assistance in her battle to raise awareness about her son's condition and to also hope to pursue a better quality of life for him. Maria has written a letter to all federal members of parliament and she has asked me to read this letter. It states:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Dear Members of Parliament</para><para>I am writing this letter as a parent of a child who has a critical illness in the form of a rare genetic illness called <inline font-weight="bold">Trichothiodystrophy</inline>, which means that any exposure to UV light is potentially fatal due to the severe irreparable damage that it causes. This exposure to UV light breaks down his DNA killing the cells and destroying his immune system. This impact on his immune system means that he is susceptible to frequent infections, which have often led to hospitalisation and on occasions have placed Sammy Joe in a critical condition. The effects of Trichothiodystrophy are fatal and as a result my son's life expectancy and quality are greatly reduced. If he goes out into the sun he screams with pain, his hair falls out, his skin blisters, he becomes nauseous and becomes bedridden. (This happens even when my son is fully clothed) </para><para>After 14 agonizing years I went to the United States, which finally led to the correct diagnosis of this disorder. Sammy Joe finally received the medical care that he needed. The medication that the American doctors prescribed had a remarkably instantaneous impact on my son's life. Upon arriving back to Australia I found that Sammy Joe was continually let down by the Australian medical system to the point that his current quality of life was at risk to the level that a further deterioration could lead to death. It further frustrates me that the simplest of medical care in the form of the correct medications for my son is currently in jeopardy because of doctors' lack of understanding. The doctors here are failing to follow up on the most basic medical advice given to them by the experts in America. It has been noted by a leading Geneticist that we have reached the limits of our current medical knowledge and that there isn't enough funding to do research on this disorder. There are 13 other children in Australia that are suffering from this condition.</para><para>This situation needs to change immediately. It is not acceptable and I'm not going to put up with it. Research needs to be funded right now to alleviate the suffering of children with this condition.</para></quote><para>Two years ago in this House we debated and voted on the stem cells research bill. Many members who supported this bill, and I was one of those members, did so because we believed that this legislation would give people like Sammy Joe Liistro hope of finding a cure for their rare genetic disorders. I hold faith and look forward to Australian medical scientists, like their counterparts in America, being able to continue to conduct the necessary research into rare genetic disorders such as trichothiodystrophy so that cures can be found for kids like Sammy Joe Liistro.</para><para>Sammy Joe Liistro is a special child, but he also has a very special family and, indeed, an extraordinary mother. Maria Liistro wants her son to have the best possible quality of life: to be able to get out of bed every morning, to enjoy life, to attend school and, as Sammy Joe constantly says to her, `to make the hurt go away'. Efforts have been made to improve Sammy Joe's quality of life, but it is obvious that more research is required into this very rare genetic disorder. I would like to encourage Australian scientists, doctors and geneticists who are interested in conducting research in this area to take a particular interest in trichothiodystrophy because, even though only 14 children may suffer from this condition in this country today, it is so difficult to diagnose that it is possible that a lot of other kids may have this condition and go undiagnosed. Incidentally, as rare as it is, Australia is the only country in the world that has such a great number of people suffering from this genetic disorder. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Child Support Agency: Payments</title><page.no>32181</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>32181</page.no><name role="metadata">Schultz, Alby, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SCHULTZ</name><name.id>83Q</name.id><electorate>Hume</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr Deputy Speaker, if I illegally accessed your bank account, I would be charged with a criminal offence and probably jailed. The reason for me saying that and rising here tonight is to illustrate and raise within this forum the way in which the Child Support Agency is—criminally, in my view—not only removing money from people's bank accounts but not allowing those people to undertake the process that is built into legislation to prove to the Child Support Agency within a 28-day period that they do not owe that money.</para></talk.start><para>The Child Support Agency are not only taking the money out of the bank accounts of individuals; they are actually giving it to the payee before the payer—who has had it removed from his account in this case—has an opportunity to prove that it did not need to be removed nor was it in fact appropriate and legal to remove it. Let me read to the House a letter from one of my constituents. I have in fact written to the appropriate minister about this constituent and another constituent. This particular letter is to the Child Support Agency. I will not refer to the constituent, nor will I refer to the constituent in the second case. The letter reads: </para><quote><para>I object in the strongest possible terms to the heavy handed tactics that you have applied to me in your <inline font-weight="bold">THEFT</inline> of my tax return that you advised me of last week.</para><para>I received a letter from your agency dated 10th July, 2004 in which you gave me 28 days' time in which to lodge an objection to your assessment of alleged monies owed by me to the ex-wife of $4,766.71. I lodged my objection today—</para></quote><para>today being 23 July—</para><quote><para>well within this twenty-eight day period. Today I also received written advice from your agency that you have already taken <inline font-weight="bold">MY</inline> tax return of $2,895.14, and paid the ex-wife this amount <inline font-weight="bold">before</inline> the expiry of the objection period. I would have thought that you would have at least held this in trust until such time had elapsed to even see if I lodged an objection, and then after that until you assessed such an objection. To add insult to injury I also paid last month's Child Support today, too. My calculations clearly show that I only owe the ex-wife $621.90 as you will see when you get that correspondence.</para><para>I want to know how you propose to pay the balance back to me in a <inline font-weight="bold">lump sum</inline> now that you have already paid out the money. I immediately rang your agency and spoke to someone who only identified himself ... as Joel. He told me after speaking to a supervisor that my tax refund had already been paid to my ex-wife, and that there was nothing that I could do about this. He also told me that the $2,895.14 that you have <inline font-weight="bold">STOLEN</inline> from me may be able to be recompensed month by month at the rate of say $40 per month. (What a joke). If this happens I will simply not pay any Child Support until such time as you catch up with what you owe me. If you can remove funds in a lump sum like this then I consider that I am well within my rights to do likewise.</para><para>I now <inline font-weight="bold">DEMAND</inline> that you re-assess this matter and write to me advising me of what you propose to do to rectify this matter.</para></quote><para>It gets worse. Another person who believes that he is not in arrears had $9,000 removed from his bank account. I believe the Child Support Agency has been grossly negligent in that case by failing to acknowledge my constituent's complaints, failing to properly consider the court orders imposed in 1989 before imposing additional child support payments on him, losing court documents sent to them and then claiming this large sum of money as arrears from his bank account without proper authority. The CSA is still to examine these court documents—the ones that my constituent sent in 1997—but the CSA conveniently lost those documents. It needs to have them to determine whether or not my constituent in fact owes money and whether his payments have been calculated correctly. I firmly believe that, under the orders put in place by a court in 1989, the constituent, since he left work in 1990, should only have been paying a certain amount of money and not what the Child Support Agency said he should be paying. Rather than being in arrears, based on that information I am assuming that my constituent has in fact paid more than the court requires him to. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment: Renewable Energy</title><page.no>32183</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>32183</page.no><name role="metadata">Sidebottom, Sid, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SIDEBOTTOM</name><name.id>849</name.id><electorate>Braddon</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to register my disappointment with some local Tasmanian Liberal senators in response to the so-called energy white paper, Securing Australia's energy future, which I think should be more aptly named <inline font-style="italic">Securing Austr</inline><inline font-style="italic">alia's traditional energy future</inline>. What disappoints me is that not only have they sought to be straight out apologists for this rather regressive energy white paper but they have also undermined the actual renewable energy industry in Tasmania, most notably wind power and hydro. I am speaking particularly about Senator Abetz and my more local Liberal senator, Richard Colbeck. </para></talk.start><para>I noticed very early in the piece, around 1 July, that Senator Abetz as per usual went on the ABC as an apologist for the government without consideration of the facts of the case in relation to the government's refusal to accept the recommendation of the Tambling report to increase and/or at least maintain the current MRET level until 2010 and even beyond. Senator Abetz suggested that employment in the agriculture, fishing, quarrying, mining and forestry sectors in Tasmania would be adversely affected by an increased MRET losing up to—he claimed—2,400 jobs and up to 113,000 jobs Australia-wide. Not only are these figures totally and utterly exaggerated but at no time do we actually get a quotation of the source for these figures. What is also disappointing is that Senator Colbeck later in the piece regurgitated these exaggerated, unsubstantiated figures.</para><para>The irony of all of this is that the energy in the sectors mentioned is predominantly derived from diesel, as people in this House no doubt know, and it bears no relationship to MRET. Yet, of course, Senator Abetz goes on his merry way to purport these outrageous claims about so-called job losses if there is an MRET increase. Senator Colbeck continued this perverted presentation of potential job losses and also alleged substantial increased costs in electricity in a report in the <inline font-style="italic">Advocate </inline>newspaper of 29 July. He said that an increased MRET would mean higher electricity prices for Tasmanian households and businesses. Senator Colbeck said:</para><quote><para>The European experience had shown that an increased MRET of up to 20p.c.—</para></quote><para>yet the MRET increase that was being discussed was five per cent, but he said 20 per cent—</para><quote><para>delivered power prices up to 3.6 times more than in Australia.</para></quote><para>He went on to say:</para><quote><para>So if a Tasmanian household has an average annual power bill of $1500, under a 20p.c. MRET level that exists in Denmark, they could possibly face a power bill of about $5400.</para></quote><para>Further, he said:</para><quote><para>And under an 8p.c. MRET level that exists in Germany they could possibly face a power bill of about $3750.</para></quote><para>So what we have is a completely different MRET system in Europe and different energy costs. When this is then compared to Tasmania and current electricity prices, he comes up with this gobbledygook. I recommend that Senator Colbeck and Senator Abetz go and look at some of the information and references available to assist them to come to a more considered estimate of the non-job losses that would result from an MRET increase of five per cent and also the noneffect on GDP. Also, of course, they would see a potential convergence of cost in energy with coal and gas by 2020 if we had an MRET increase, even to the level of five per cent. I suggest that they come and see me and I will give them at least three or four good references that they can use instead of undermining an important industry in Tasmania. Undermining the strong possibility of a blade manufacturing plant on the north-west coast of Tasmania is what it means if the MRET is not increased—<inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Medicare: Services</title><page.no>32184</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>32184</page.no><name role="metadata">Billson, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BILLSON</name><name.id>1K6</name.id><electorate>Dunkley</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is a great pleasure to rise tonight in the few minutes that are available before stumps at today's sitting of parliament to talk about how the government's Medicare enhancement package is delivering benefits for the community that I represent. It comes as no surprise to anybody that I am particularly interested in this matter. As you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, the community that I have the great honour to represent is a growing area in terms of population influx, particularly in the Langwarrin area and Mornington East. We are seeing an increasing population at a time when we are frankly struggling to attract new doctors to our area as a consequence of this doctor shortage that has placed some pressure on some of the health services and particularly on the current doctors in our area to provide for the level of care local residents rightly expect and seek. </para></talk.start><para>Fortunately, the measures to enhance the Medicare system that the government has implemented are very responsive to those local conditions. Incentives to attract doctors to our community to either join an existing practice or relocate or establish a practice in our area is seeing doctors coming into our community and adding to the stock of talent that we have available to service local health needs. The incentives for practice nurses, as you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, are a great way of making sure that doctors are doctoring. Practice nurses can attend to other issues such as wound management, taking blood pressure and histories of some patients and immunisation tasks.</para><para>The safety net itself sees a great deal of support and peace of mind provided to people with chronic illnesses or some quite significant health incident that sees out-of-pocket non-hospital expenses. This feature has been with the Medicare system ever since it was introduced. It is a feature that Labor has just been happy to see continue and roll on, but it is a feature that has often cost some members of our community quite an amount of expense. There is now a safety net in place to assist citizens that have those health requirements and incur those out-of-hospital, out-of-pocket expenses.</para><para>The increased rebate for GPs when they are treating concession card holders and children is also delivering benefits. Incorporating other practitioners—physiotherapists, dentists and the like—in a GP managed care plan for a chronic illness or condition is another positive measure. All of that good work is going on at a time when the Labor Party wants to talk about access to doctors in my community without offering anything at all that would actually bring about change. In fact, I would say that the Labor health policy is a placebo. There is no active ingredient whatsoever to respond to the actual conditions on the ground in the community that I represent.</para><para>Simply paying everybody more of a rebate is not going to see doctors in inner Melbourne or on the North Shore of Sydney choose to come and settle in the greater Frankston and Mornington Peninsula area. You are more likely to get a bulk-billing consultation in inner Melbourne than you are in my community because of the increased number of doctors for the population in those areas. Simply paying everybody more as a doctor's consultation subsidy through the Medicare system is not going to encourage doctors to change where they are located. That is what the Labor Party seems not to understand, but it is something that the community that I represent very much recognises. While the Labor Party are masquerading some concern, they are not offering anything that will actually make a difference.</para><para>Worse than that, right at this very moment the Labor Party at a state and federal level are actually undermining the work that many of us are putting in to improve health services. I talk about the after-hours access to GPs program. The federal government has asked the state government to identify service centres that should attract some of that financial assistance. The Frankston Medicentre, which has been operating for two decades quite successfully and which is now experiencing some financial pressure as it has to attract doctors to participate in that program, was on the original submission from the Bracks government. But guess what happened? It has fallen off. The Bracks state Labor government, with either the adherence or the indifference of local state members of parliament, has seen the Frankston Medicentre fall off, to be replaced with the Williamstown Hospital in the Premier's own electorate. Either that is an appalling oversight or error, or it is just simply playing politics with the health needs of our community. I call on the Labor Party to either get out of the way or support my work to improve access to health services for the Dunkley community. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para> (Hon.

Many issues are very important to them, but one of the issues which I believe will be uppermost in the minds of many when they cast their vote, especially the people in the electorate of Oxley, is the future of Australia's education system. All Australians quite rightly expect an education system that is second to none. That is why we in the Australian Labor Party have always been, and always will be, committed to building and maintaining an education system that is world class. Labor believes in providing quality education for all children, regardless of the school they attend, because a first-rate education is essential to ensure that Australia fosters a nation of achievers who will lead us throughout the 21st century. That is great news for the schools in my local area, which will benefit greatly under the policies of the Australian Labor Party.</para></talk.start><para>I recently received a series of letters from some of my constituents who are concerned about education funding. They indicated to me that a quality education system is extremely important to them. I agree with them. Let me assure these people, and indeed all the people of my electorate, that everyone in the Australian Labor Party considers a quality education system to be of paramount importance. A Latham Labor government would ensure that all schools in the Oxley electorate, and in fact in Australia, receive the funding they need to deliver the best outcomes for educating our children. That is why Labor will introduce a needs based funding system whereby all schools—government and non-government—strive to reach a strong national standard for resources and results. Our funding system will be good for all schools, regardless of where they are from. We will not be setting sector against sector. We will not be setting school against school. We will not be setting public against private. We will guarantee to maintain the overall level of funding for non-government schools. Labor also supports parents who choose non-government schooling for their children. It will provide public funding to all schools. Labor introduced major federal funding for non-government schools in the 1970s, and it extended this commitment through further increases under the Hawke and Keating governments. A Latham Labor government will continue that tradition.</para><para>In the not too distant future Australians will be asked to choose between a tired, out-of-puff and out-of-ideas government, led by John Howard and Peter Costello, and a new, fresh approach to government that will provide opportunities for all Australians under the leadership of Mark Latham. When it comes to education, the differences between the two choices are stark. Labor will deliver a first-class education system—and it is widely acknowledged that Labor is the party for education. In contrast, under John Howard's education policy many kids will miss out on a good education because their parents simply cannot afford it. For John Howard, the chequebook is more important than the textbook. For us in the Labor Party, all kids are equal, all schools are equal and everyone should have the same opportunities—opportunities based on merit and hard work and not based on the size of their chequebooks or the limit on their credit card.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Casey Electorate: Warrien Reserve</title><page.no>32187</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>32187</page.no><name role="metadata">Smith, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANTHONY SMITH</name><name.id>00APG</name.id><electorate>Casey</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise this morning to speak about an area of environmental significance in Croydon North in the Casey electorate. Warrien Reserve was recognised by state and federal governments decades ago as a vital area of urban environmental concern, containing many native plants, birds, insects and animal species. Its committee of management and hard-working volunteers have protected, preserved and worked to enhance the area for more than 50 years. It has received numerous state and federal grants over that time. Recently, work has focused on preserving the habitat to protect a rare and endangered frog that has been discovered in the reserve.</para></talk.start><para>The preservation of the habitat of this area is now being threatened by inappropriate development, which is planned to occur on adjacent land next to the reserve. The history of this sorry story and the planning process involved at Bonnie View Road in Croydon North reads like a nightmare. In 1999 a subcontractor for Remington Homes, also known as Pivotel, illegally clear-felled and totally moonscaped more than 6,000 square metres of land that had been purchased. They did so without any permits whatsoever. In 2001 the subcontractor was convicted and fined $8,500 for that act. Video and photographic evidence taken by residents on the day shows urban environmental butchery on a massive scale. The council officer seeking to prevent the illegal act, who was just trying to do his job, was physically assaulted and removed from the site.</para><para>The story gets worse. Just a few weeks ago the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal approved a 17-unit development on the site, overriding the Maroondah council and the views of the residents. It did so in spite of the illegal clear-felling and took the view that, because the land was now clear as a result of the illegal act, the development could go ahead. This muddle-headed logic does not just ignore illegal acts but actually rewards them. I believe the VCAT decision at Bonnie View Road was absurd. I believe it should be looked at again and overturned. Clearly, if the law in the case is defective, the state government and the planning minister at the state level, Mary Delahunty, should step in and rectify the deficient law so that planning processes do not reward environmental butchers of the type that we have seen.

That is why on 20 February this year the shadow minister for health, Julia Gillard, the state member for Drummoyne, Angela D'Amore MLA, and I visited Concord hospital for the announcement that a Latham Labor government will immediately grant Concord hospital an MRI licence. </para><para>Those in the chamber will no doubt recall I have consistently raised this issue for more than two years. On 15 May 2002 I asked the then Minister for Health and Ageing, Senator Kay Patterson, to grant Concord hospital an MRI licence after visiting the hospital at the request of the then chief executive officer, Mr Matthew Daly, and the head of radiology, Dr Lloyd Ridley. Dr Ridley, in particular, explained the benefits of this equipment to me and asked me to investigate the possibility of Concord hospital receiving a licence to provide this important MRI service.</para><para>Sadly, for two years the Howard government has refused this request. Again and again I have asked the government to grant Concord Repatriation General Hospital an MRI licence and allow it to provide Medicare-eligible MRI services. In answers to my questions on behalf of Concord hospital on 19 August 2002, 22 October 2002, 14 May 2003, 8 September 2003, 6 November 2003, 11 February 2004, 11 March 2004 and 11 May 2004, the government has over and over again failed to give any indication that it will grant the MRI licence.</para><para>Today I report that last week the government cynically tried to deceive the people of the inner west by circulating a leaflet titled `MRI machine for our local hospital' that claims the Howard Liberal government will issue an MRI licence for our local hospital. Even if you can assume the Liberal Party is referring to Concord hospital, this is nothing more than a dishonourable attempt to salvage the government's credibility on this issue by deliberately misleading my constituents. The Liberal Party bosses, who have no doubt forced my Liberal opponent to put his name to this piece of nonsense, should hang their heads in shame.</para><para>Today I have asked the minister to explain whether or not a decision on the MRI licence has been made, who has been informed of this decision and when it will be announced. Why will Concord hospital and the 9,972 constituents who have signed my petition be the last to know? I conclude by thanking everyone who has supported my campaign on this issue for the past two years. I particularly thank Mary Venchiarutti, John Pasqua and Diana Brough from Concord's radiology department, Nigel and Caroline Freeman from Strathfield's Foot Fix Clinic, the <inline font-style="italic">Inner West Courier</inline> and the tireless Milka Valdivia for their support throughout this campaign. On their behalf, I again ask the government to stop playing politics and immediately grant Concord hospital an MRI licence.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment: Indian Myna Bird</title><page.no>32188</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>32188</page.no><name role="metadata">Entsch, Warren, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ENTSCH</name><name.id>7K6</name.id><electorate>Leichhardt</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I raise a matter that is critical to our environmental future. Far North Queensland is currently under attack from a plague of common or Indian myna birds, a bird listed in the top 100 chart of the most invasive species in the world. This introduced exotic species is spreading at an alarming rate. Not only are the Indian mynas capable of wiping out most of our native bird species but they are a major threat, through parasites and disease, to many of our native mammal species which nest in tree hollows. Can you imagine a country without parrots, without sugar gliders and feather-tailed gliders? Unless something is done, this is the future that we face.</para></talk.start><para>Ideally, our state and territory governments could declare the Indian myna a pest, but they are reluctant to do so and it is not hard to see why: the costs would be quite substantial. Unfortunately, I am also getting the message that there are some in the Queensland state government who believe there is no known or proven method of efficient eradication—but really this is not an excuse to sit back and do nothing. There has to be a way of controlling and eradicating these birds, but it will take time and consolidated effort. Judging by the overwhelming response of the people of Leichhardt, they not only want to do something now but they are very keen to get involved and they certainly want to help. </para><para>Last week in Cairns I launched an Indian myna minimisation program, using a trap designed by Dr Chris Tidemann of the Australian National University. `Overwhelming' is the only word to describe the response received from the Cairns community—from local wildlife and environmental groups, the Cairns City Council and local businesspeople. These are people like Andy Anderson and Dick Bolton from the Bird Observers Club of Australia, and Ian Clayton, the environmental coordinator for the Cairns water and sewage treatment plant. Ian and his site manager, Vern Atkinson, are monitoring a trap that I set at Cairns sewage treatment plant, which is home to literally thousands of Indian myna birds. Bob Boneham, the owner of a commercial enterprise, Amalgamated Pest Control, in Cairns was actually one of the first to call me as soon as he knew that we had a trap that was designed to catch Indian mynas.</para><para>I have spoken to the minister for the environment and will be seeking funding to continue the research of Dr Tidemann into the development of a trap capable of catching an entire roost of up to 1,000 birds at one time; and I will be calling on my fellow members of parliament to recognise the very serious environmental problem that needs to be taken up to fight to control the Indian myna bird, not just in Cairns but also right throughout Australia. I will be calling also on state governments to assist. They must assist by declaring the common Indian myna bird a noxious pest and start to put their hands in their pockets, not sit back and say, `No, there's nothing we can do, because it's too hard.' We have to do it and we have to do it now. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Medicare: Safety Net Threshold</title><page.no>32189</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>32189</page.no><name role="metadata">Hall, Jill, MP</name><name role="display">Ms HALL</name><name.id>83N</name.id><electorate>Shortland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I, like many members of this parliament, have had numerous complaints made to me since the introduction of the government's so-called Medicare safety net. My office has been inundated with complaints, and when I am in shopping centres people are constantly approaching me and telling me how the system does not work for them. The complaints that I receive from people are that they will never become eligible for the safety net because the number of times they visit the doctor will not bring them to the $300 or $700 safety net limit. I have also received complaints that doctors are restructuring their fees to take advantage of the safety net. I also receive complaints from people who do not understand the system and feel that they are being misled by the government.</para></talk.start><para>But no complaint I have received is worse than the one I am going to share with the House today. A pregnant woman, Marie, who lives within the Shortland electorate, has emailed me her concerns about the new Medicare safety net. She starts by pointing out to me that this was designed to ease the medical burdens on families. She is a young woman who is on maternity leave after having her third child, and they are really struggling for dollars. As a family with young children they visit the doctor and pharmacies quite regularly and their medical expenses are high. She registered with the Medicare safety net as soon as the legislation passed through this parliament and was most disappointed when she found out that she would not qualify for it immediately, simply because she has deferred her family payment costs from Centrelink until tax time. She did this because she was constantly being sent debts. Due to the unworkable nature of the system, she thought that it was much better to deal with it that way. </para><para>So, because she is getting her family tax payments in that manner, the system does not recognise that she is receiving family tax payments and she will not be eligible to receive the safety net until 2005. She has already incurred over $300 in medical costs and she feels that this is very unfair. In 2005, she will be in exactly the same position because, once again, she will not be eligible until she puts in her tax return. She feels this is very unfair on families. It is another example of the government disregarding families and also an example of the unworkable nature of the Medicare safety net. It is proof why the government needs to embrace Medicare and increase bulk-billing—not undermine the system. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Medicare: Safety Net</title><title>Casey Electorate: Environment</title><page.no>32190</page.no></subdebateinfo><title>Casey Electorate: Environment</title><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>32190</page.no><name role="metadata">Smith, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANTHONY SMITH</name><name.id>00APG</name.id><electorate>Casey</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to follow on from my previous remarks in recognising some important environmental volunteers in the electorate.

I trust that the previous speaker will not in any way mislead her constituent and that she will email her constituent back with Labor's policy on the safety net, which is to abolish the safety net from day one of a Latham Labor government. It is all very well for the previous speaker to come in here and talk about the safety net and the ability to access it in time, but the bottom line is that the Labor Party will abolish that safety net. They will remove it from hundreds of thousands of families who have signed up and are accessing it at the moment. They will take away a financial benefit in the health system from families and people right across the board.</para></talk.start><para>I will now follow on from my earlier remarks in recognising some environmental volunteers. I mentioned Warrien Reserve in my earlier contribution. I would also like to mention some important work that is going on at the nearby Hochkins Ridge Flora Reserve, where a similar group of volunteers are working very hard to enhance that urban bushland. They have worked hard over a number of years but have recently put together, with the aid of some federal government funding through the Envirofund, a detailed pamphlet outlining many of the native plants and wildflowers and listing some of the dangerous introduced weeds. This pamphlet includes many photographs taken by Helen Moss, who is a dedicated environmentalist in the area. The pamphlet is designed as an educational tool and has been distributed to all of the nearby schools.</para><para>This is an example of some very practical environmentalism, where some of the hardworking volunteers have sought, with the assistance of a partnership with the federal government, to spread the understanding and knowledge of the local environment so that people in Croydon North and in the Casey electorate can be environmentally aware and know of the very strong environmental areas that are there that can be witnessed. For the schoolkids to have such a pamphlet is fantastic. It is a tribute to all of those who worked to put it together. It is a first-class publication, and I hope that it can be a model for many other environmental groups not only throughout the Casey electorate but also throughout the Dandenong Ranges and the rest of Victoria.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

I was fortunate to attend the funeral of his father, the former Speaker and former member for Scullin, in South Morang. As the member for Melbourne Ports, I have been to many funeral services of a great many notable people, but I do not think I have been to a funeral service where there was such a comprehensive account of the person's life, particularly his family life. His life was outlined in the most moving way by his daughter and by his grand-daughter, who spoke on behalf of Wendy, Mrs Jenkins senior. The speech by the national or state—I am not sure—president of Lions also showed an aspect of former Speaker Dr Jenkins's life that was incredibly interesting.</para></talk.start><para>It is very difficult to combine public life and parliamentary responsibilities with an interest and a continuing involvement in an organisation like Lions International, but here was an example of a person who managed to combine both community service and parliamentary service. I thought it was very interesting that in a former Labor government we had five doctors, and there was a very interesting account of the move from general practice into politics. It was also very interesting that Mrs Jenkins had not wanted to marry a doctor or a politician but ended up doing just that. As I said, it was one of the most moving memorial services I have been to and—I am about to cede to the member for Batman on this condolence motion—an account of someone's life the like of which I have not heard at many other funeral services, with the integration of his political, community and family life. It was one of the most moving services I have been to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>32191</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MARTIN FERGUSON</name><name.id>LS4</name.id><electorate>Batman</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In speaking to the condolence motion for the late Dr Harry Jenkins, I would like to speak on behalf of not only myself and my family but also a large section of the electorate that I currently represent which was previously represented by the late Dr Harry Jenkins. In historical terms, in 1969 there was a redistribution which saw the proposal to abolish the seat of Darebin and move the seat of Scullin further into the northern suburbs of Melbourne. As a result of a local campaign, the seat called Darebin<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>disappeared and the seat of Scullin was effectively re-created in the northern suburbs of Melbourne. It is interesting to note that a large section of that new seat of Scullin was actually what is now represented by the seat of Batman, which existed at the time but covered, to a large extent, an entirely different geographical area. Part of that also included the seat of Reservoir, which was represented by Dr Jenkins in the Victorian Legislative Assembly for eight years, from 1961 until he resigned in 1969, when he contested and won the federal seat of Scullin.</para></talk.start><para>I also note in passing that in the same year, 1969, the new seat of Prospect was established in the western suburbs of Sydney, which is where I grew up and which was not that different to the area I now represent in the northern suburbs of Melbourne. By strange coincidence, it was then expected that my father, who was a friend of Dr Jenkins, would be elected as the new federal member for Prospect, but as a result of a discussion with his wife, Mary, it was decided that, as he had five children of school age, he would remain in the state parliament, whereas Dr Harry Jenkins left the state parliament and chose to represent in the federal parliament the area he had always lived and worked in. </para><para>As the current member for Batman, I know that what Dr Jenkins said in his maiden speech really is a statement of how he cared about the region. He referred to the fact that he resided for most of his life in the electorate he represented and noted that the area was `very much a cross-section of urban Australia, with people from all walks of life pursuing their day-to-day activity with the hopes and aspirations that we have come to expect from Australians'.</para><para>From my work as the current member for Batman I know that he was a good and loyal representative in the state and federal parliaments. More importantly, he was also exceptionally well regarded for his community work and his work as a medical practitioner. I acknowledge that Dr Jenkins worked as a medical practitioner in that area with the father of the late Premier of Tasmania, Jim Bacon, who unfortunately passed away at an early age. Around the community of Reservoir a lot of the more elderly citizens fondly remember the medical work of both Dr Harry Jenkins, whose practice was in Thornbury, and the father of the late Jim Bacon. They were distinguished and well-respected medical practitioners.</para><para>In his maiden speech Dr Jenkins talked about issues that were very much part of the nature of the debate we confront today: the importance of health care, Medibank and Medicare, and the issue of the environment and conservation. These are issues that I am pleased to say his successor, Harry Jenkins junior, has pursued with rigour not only in the Main Committee of the House and the House of Representatives but, importantly, in the work of the committees of the House. His father, as a longstanding member of the House of Representatives, did what he could to promote and develop the committees to ensure that they received the recognition and respect they deserve as part of the day-to-day workings of the House. I understand from his parliamentary career that he not only served the Labor Party well but also served the committee structure well through the positions he held as a representative of the Labor Party and the various offices and positions he held in the House of Representatives.</para><para>He did not just contribute to major debates on issues that we still deal with today such as health care and the environment. As part of its work the Procedure Committee, of which I am a member, has produced a report about how we might relax the rules governing the televising and broadcasting of parliament. This is an issue that is always fraught with danger because there are some people in the House of Representatives who believe they should not be exposed to as much public scrutiny as others believe. Dr Jenkins was credited with relaxing the rules governing the televising and broadcasting of parliament to allow their use by news services, and he proposed the unit which continually televised both houses, with media outlets able to use the footage when they wanted. I am pleased to say that in the recent parliamentary break a report of the Procedure Committee was released out of session which suggested that we build on the breakthrough achieved by Dr Jenkins when he was the Speaker, which was really aimed at trying to further make the House the people's house and subject to greater scrutiny and accountability of the people who have the privilege to actually serve in the House of Representatives.</para><para>Like the current Speaker, Dr Jenkins was required from time to time to discipline people. It pleases me no end to note that in 1984 he had the pleasure and the privilege of disciplining the current Prime Minister, Mr Howard, associated with backbenchers Wilson Tuckey and Alan Cadman. I would like the Treasurer to nominate which of those three who were removed from the House on that day deserved it and which two he believed behaved out of character. It is not for me to suggest which of those people would be nominated by the Treasurer. </para><para>More seriously, can I say that Dr Jenkins made a very important contribution to this House. I am pleased to note that not only was he a longstanding, proud member of the Australian Labor Party but he also was a member of my own union, the Miscellaneous Workers Union. He brought to this House not only an understanding of his work as a medical practitioner and a commitment to the people he represented but also something that we regard as exceptionally important; that is, membership of the Labor Party and also our affiliates, in this instance my own union—which I had the privilege to serve as national secretary—the Miscellaneous Workers Union.</para><para>Let me now talk about Harry Jenkins's service in the Labor Party. Some years ago when the Left first decided that it had to establish a national organisation, people such as the then Senator Gietzelt suggested that we had to be very careful about forming such an organisation. When some of the interstate national meetings were held, people would travel on different planes so as not to create the impression that there was any real organisation. I understood from discussions around the breakfast table and reports about some of these meetings when I was much younger that when my father travelled interstate to attend some of these meetings it was Dr Harry Jenkins who was given the responsibility of picking him up from Melbourne Airport and returning him to Melbourne Airport at the end of those meetings, which probably explains the first contact between our two families in different cities.</para><para>On behalf of myself, my family and my electorate, I express to the Jenkins family our sincere gratitude for the sacrifices they made in allowing Dr Harry Jenkins to serve the northern suburbs of Melbourne. He served with distinction. His capacity to make a contribution to this House was assisted by the sacrifices that his family made because of the nature of the job that we do as members of the Commonwealth parliament. I would also like to express my sympathy to his wife and family. I, like the member for Melbourne Ports, was fortunate to attend the memorial service on Monday to see what a wonderful extended family he had and also to see the wide attendance by a broad range of community representatives, which was a very public statement about the respect they had for Dr Harry Jenkins.</para><para>As a member of our great party, the Australian Labor Party, I want to say that Dr Harry Jenkins served us with distinction. We are all the better for having had him as a member of our party. He has left a mark not only on the parliament but also on the Australian Labor Party and all the community organisations that he served, both within Australia and internationally. I extend my condolences to the Jenkins family and thank the House for the opportunity to make these remarks to acknowledge the passing of a great Labor representative.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>32193</page.no><name role="metadata">McGauran, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McGAURAN</name><name.id>XH4</name.id><electorate>Gippsland</electorate><party>NATS</party><role>Minister for Science</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—If Harry Jenkins was not the best Speaker I have served under, there were none better. It is always perilous, I am sure members will agree, to compare modern-day champions with those of the past, because of all the differing circumstances and contexts. We often like to think that Lonhro is the great race champion of the turf today and to compare him to Kingston Town and others of a different generation, but such comparisons are next to impossible to make because you cannot line them up. And so it is with a Speaker of 20 years ago compared with a Speaker of today.</para></talk.start><para>I think that Harry Jenkins had a number of factors in his favour that have made him one of the great Speakers since Federation. For example, he was coming on the back of Speaker Snedden, who, as much by personal estrangement from the Prime Minister of the day as anything else, had established a strong reputation as an independent Speaker, so there was more of an assumption within the parliament that a Speaker was considerably detached from his or her party of allegiance. Also, the parliamentary tradition of the time was much stronger than it is today. The Speaker's authority was largely unquestioned—frequently tested, to be sure, during the course of a parliamentary day but never outrightly challenged with the same degree of frequency as it is today. </para><para>Even taking that into account, Dr Harry Jenkins was a brilliant Speaker, because he also had a number of factors working against him which current-day Speakers do not have to cope with. For instance, the parliamentary chamber in Old Parliament House was very small. It is something that those of us who served in it miss enormously. You could see the whites of the eyes of your opponents. Parliamentary debate was up close and personal in those days. You could almost reach out and touch your opponent.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>RH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kerr, Duncan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Kerr</name></talker><para>—Or throw a glass of water.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>XH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McGAURAN</name></talker><para>—Or throw a glass of water, or clamber across the desk to try to get to an opponent on the opposite side, as in a notorious incident. Consequently, it was more of a hothouse, and I mourn its passing. It was a true debating chamber in which little quarter was given and none asked for. The temperature was a lot higher in those days and that added to an atmosphere of cut and thrust, so I think emotions ran a lot hotter in those days than they do now in our very big chamber with its degrees of separation and almost emotionless form of debate. In those days, people were passionate and were fierce, and Dr Jenkins had to cope with the hothouse.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Also, Dr Jenkins had a cabal of very difficult members to deal with who had come in in the 1983 election: Gerry Hand, John Saunderson, Pete Steedman, Pete Staples—all of whom gathered in the one area up towards the back of the Old Parliament House across a narrow aisle from me and the National Party. They were unrestrained in their exuberance and their challenge of the traditions and authority of the House. That was not just in dress, although it is now legendary—and I am sure other members have spoken of it—how Pete Steedman would come in in his leather jacket and no tie, and there was the incident cited yesterday in the House about Peter Staples wearing a colourful cardigan; I have a faint recollection of that. But also Steedman would challenge Dr Jenkins with extravagant or, to put it more accurately, foul language and Dr Jenkins would not turf him out. I am afraid that some of the worst words in the swear book were used by Pete Steedman, and occasionally by others, to provoke Dr Jenkins. He would not hear them, deliberately so. He had to control them and he did it extremely well, with patience and with a great deal of shrewdness. Then there were people like Alan Griffiths and John Brumby, who, seated in a different section of the parliament, would also vigorously contribute to debate.</para><para>Dr Jenkins was founded in the great traditions of the Westminster debating style and context, but he had a large number of members who came in determined to bring down that edifice and remove any remnants of the suggestion it was a club where members treated each other more as friends than foes. He did it, as has already been touched on by every speaker, by dint of personality. He was a kindly person, to be sure, and he had great humour. I still remember an almost conspiratorial laugh. He loved almost to giggle with you as an aside, and you felt a degree of intimacy with and confidence in him that some people can engender by sheer force of personality and humour. He was a truly fine person. He was boyish in some ways, but he was not a weak man. He had a pronounced limp, and I always felt he was in pain, so he would snap, either in the chair or outside, if you were unreasonable. Because I was so young and new, I saw him as a person of more advanced years and I, for one, would back off. When Dr Jenkins needed to assert the authority of his office, he would not hesitate a nanosecond to do so. Nobody ever thought they could use Dr Jenkins's natural humour and gentleness to push him to breaking point. He was an authoritative Speaker. </para><para>My other great recollection is of his wife, Wendy, who was so often with him. In fact, I struggle to think of Dr Jenkins without thinking of Mrs Jenkins. She came to Canberra a great deal, to the extent that her family commitments and obligations allowed, and I would often see them as a couple. They were very close, as is evident from their close family unit, and I extend to Mrs Jenkins my heartfelt sympathy for her terrible loss.</para><para>In the end, if you had to point to one factor in Dr Jenkins's career that brought together these different strands—personality, high office and local member—it would be that his appointment as Ambassador to Spain met not a skerrick of criticism. There was not even a whisper of `jobs for the boys', either privately or publicly. It was welcomed by the opposition. I do not know of many other appointments of that kind that would have been endorsed so unanimously. On our side we thought it was a great appointment and that he would do Australia proud. He certainly did that for the relatively short time that he was able to fulfil his duties as Ambassador to Spain.</para><para>In conclusion, Dr Jenkins's memory will never leave me or those who served under him or, in the case of his Labor Party colleagues, with him. He was an outstanding Speaker who takes his place among the very great Speakers. The true explanation for his success as a Speaker and as a local member was his personality, values and deep convictions. Personally and on behalf of The Nationals, I wish to extend an expression of sympathy to his son, Harry—the incumbent member for Scullin—and his family.</para><para>As a postscript, I note that Dr Jenkins was never to be underestimated. He was obviously a shrewd and professional politician. On our side, at least, we never expected that his successor would be his son, Harry. Maybe it was the talk of the Labor Party, but it was certainly not canvassed publicly. I can remember that the newspapers of the time spoke of some of the high-profile possibilities to succeed Dr Jenkins. It was confirmation, if you like, of our admiration for Dr Jenkins as a true pro that he was able to work with his son to get the best candidate into the seat, notwithstanding anybody coming in from the outside. Dr Jenkins, as Speaker and as a Labor Party operative, was never to be underestimated either as a man or as a professional.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>32195</page.no><name role="metadata">Kerr, Duncan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KERR</name><name.id>RH4</name.id><electorate>Denison</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This condolence debate has been conducted with a generosity of spirit that is sometimes seen in this House on these occasions but which is sometimes strained. Often when this House loses somebody who has given significant service, there is respect for the achievement of the person who has died, but that is also tinged with the fact that the person has been bloodied and has bloodied others in the political process. In remarks that have been made on all sides of the House, no reserve has been expressed about the admiration and affection that was felt for Dr Jenkins. Whilst I did not serve in this House with him, on a number of occasions I had the pleasure of meeting him, usually in the company of his son, the present member for the seat, and felt a little of why people would have such high regard for him. Dr Jenkins's intuitive reaction to meeting somebody with whom he had previously had little contact was to reach out to find common ground with them, do everything he could to make that person comfortable, assist them on issues they were concerned about and give them friendly advice. That was certainly my experience of Dr Jenkins, and I have quite a lasting memory of him. I can picture his face and how he related to me and those around him, even though those occasions were less frequent than they would be, for example, for other people who have spoken. </para></talk.start><para>I chose to speak today because I was unable to attend the funeral in Melbourne and I thought that it would be inappropriate not to express a regard for Dr Jenkins on a very personal basis. I know that he had a very large record of achievement as a Speaker in this House. When I first entered this parliament it was shortly after he had left. His successor was elected at a by-election immediately before I entered, and so Harry Jenkins junior and I were amongst a group of members who had a lot to do with each other in those early years. But the reputation of his father, Dr Jenkins, was very large in the place. It was a very well-regarded reputation then and it remains so.</para><para>I heard some things I did not know in the remarks from the member for Batman about Dr Jenkins's part in the genesis of the Left. Sadly, despite the enormous efforts of his successor and his skilful administration of the affairs of the Left, it is no longer the case that it is necessary to travel in separate aircraft to demonstrate sometimes the disorganisation of our faction. But, that aside, I really have learned nothing that I did not know already about Dr Jenkins, because everybody has in the past spoken of him with such high regard.</para><para>When I met him, he was struggling with giving up smoking, something that I too struggle with. I gave up for a period of 11 years and then foolishly thought one night, at a time when I was less sober than I normally am—and I am a very rare and occasional drinker—`I'll have a cigarette. It won't do me any harm. I can put it down again. In 11 years I've not had one.' I have been struggling with the habit since then—for the last seven years.</para><para>Dr Jenkins was a lifelong smoker. He was struggling with the habit because of his health. He knew that it was bad for him, and I saw him go through a succession of different devices to try to deal with his craving. I think he ended up with a cigarette holder which contained no cigarettes and no nicotine substitutes but which at least assuaged the sense that he had to go through the motions of smoking. It was quite a strange sight to see Dr Jenkins with his empty cigarette holder, puffing away occasionally but to no effect, as a result of his continual battle with tobacco. We in this parliament are still working through some of the related issues about putting in place policies which do the utmost to discourage people from taking up cigarette smoking because sadly, once a person does take it up—as the experience of Dr Jenkins and my own experience testify to—it is very difficult to abandon it entirely, even when one has persuaded oneself that one has.</para><para>I too want to say something about the affection and love that was given to Dr Jenkins by his wife, which has been reflected on and remarked on. I think it was a great sadness for the family when Dr Jenkins had to go into a nursing home. If it had not been necessary, it would not have happened. I think it distressed his wife as much as it distressed Dr Jenkins. It was very touching to hear the present member for Scullin indicate the pleasure that his father got from representing him on an odd occasion or two. Even when he was in a nursing home and quite frail, he was still able to do some kind of public service by representing the current member for Scullin in proceedings—for example, with the RSL. </para><para>In conclusion, all I would say is that few people will ever leave this place with the affection and goodwill that Dr Jenkins left it with. Few people generate the kind of instantaneous affection and respect that he did, and few people will go with so little insincerity in the high tribute that is being paid to them by members on all sides of this parliament after their passing from it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>32197</page.no><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name><name.id>0J4</name.id><electorate>Berowra</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Attorney-General</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to associate myself with this motion today and with my colleagues' generous remarks about the late Dr Harry Jenkins.

It is something that is not often spoken of, but people that you travel with from time to time often become better known to you than others with whom you do not have that opportunity.</para></talk.start><para>I can remember back in 1982—it is perhaps a new story—travelling as part of a delegation with some other members to Pakistan and India. We were there at the time of Ramadan. I do not think I was taking enough water and was significantly dehydrated during that time—something that I was not very aware of. I went later to join another delegation in the Cook Islands—it was only a matter of the passing of several weeks; Harry Jenkins and I were both there representing the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. We had our opening ceremony and I had to excuse myself; I suddenly found that I was experiencing excruciating pain—I am told it is the male equivalent of childbirth.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>SE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Bishop, Bronwyn, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>0J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name></talker><para>—Bronwyn says there is nothing that could equate to the pain of childbirth, and I can see that. I went to my room and was lying on the bed in absolute agony, sweating profusely. Somebody had grabbed Harry to come around and offer a diagnosis. He walked into the room, looked at me and said `renal colic,' and walked out. I had been given a perfectly good diagnosis, I can tell you. A local doctor then came around and was getting ready to cut me open to relieve the pain and suddenly it just finished: the stone passed. I managed to retrieve it and it was subjected later to some analysis and I have not had renal colic since, so we clearly know it was related to my period of dehydration. I do not know how many of us experienced Harry as a very competent medical practitioner, but he was certainly able to diagnose that matter very quickly and very professionally—but I suspect he had a fairly detached bedside manner.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The only other comment I would make is that those who know my family know that I do not suffer the debilitative, degenerative disease that my late father suffered, and so I relate very much to the fact that Dr Harry Jenkins suffered a debilitative condition that made service much more difficult. For that reason I admired him even more, because I have seen what demands such a disease places on the human body and what is required. He demonstrated not alone by his service in this parliament, his service to his electorate and his service to the nation but by his willingness to be engaged—particularly in the Lions movement, which involvement he kept on after he left this place—that public service for which we can greatly admire him.</para><para>I apologise to the family that I was not free to be at the service of celebration of his life; I would have liked to have been. But I do want to be associated with this condolence motion and the remarks of my colleagues and to say that I regarded Dr Harry Jenkins as a friend. I admired him greatly and I admired what he was able to do and achieve. To Wendy, I send my personal regards and those of my wife, Heather. To young Harry—I know we can refer to him that way now; I heard the Speaker do so yesterday and I almost chastised him—we feel for you; we greatly admired your dad. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>32198</page.no><name role="metadata">Beazley, Kim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEAZLEY</name><name.id>PE4</name.id><electorate>Brand</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to associate myself with the remarks associated with this motion. I am standing alongside Harry's son. He graces this chamber and has many of the attributes of his father; he may not know that. His father was a tremendously fair person and a man who revered this institution of ours, a man who understood its workings inside out. It was a privilege to serve with him. I listened to `young Harry', as the speaker before me described him, yesterday in the chamber and thought that it was with enormous dignity that he carried that off. As somebody who faces the possibility of having to do something similar myself if I stay much longer in this chamber, electorate willing, I guess that I could learn a very great deal from the way in which the current member for Scullin handled the sad demise of the former member for Scullin.</para></talk.start><para>I served five years with Dr Harry Jenkins in our parliament. I came in 1980 and, from recollection, he left in 1985. I can remember his presence in the caucus. He had a reputation when he came into the federal parliament. Life was tough in the Victorian state parliament. It was an era in which, if you were a state member, you did not have staff, and library resources were limited. To be a person who made an impact in a state legislature was very difficult indeed, and most of our people did not. It was a hopeless state, from the Labor Party's point of view, in which Victorian state politics found itself for the best part of 30 years. It was a vale of tears for somebody who was an opposition member in the Victorian parliament. Harry made a reputation as a man who knew how to fight in parliament. He was a tough-minded operator, a person who looked to his constituents but also looked to his constituents' needs and understood how they might be filled by a better performance overall by the state government.</para><para>I understand—I was not in Victorian politics—that Harry's tough reputation was one of the reasons why he was so readily endorsed for entry into the federal parliament, and he graced us with his presence. When he was here, another side of Harry Jenkins was seen: the man of standing orders, the man of parliamentary procedure, the man who had such a profound belief in the good that the chamber of the House of Representatives could do in itself, for the ordinary citizen of Australia, by being the sort of chamber that teased out the essence of every issue that it considered, teasing it out because ordinary members of parliament were well treated. That was Harry Jenkins's view. When he was Speaker, Harry Jenkins attempted to implement that view.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">A quorum having been called in the House of Representatives—</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Sitting suspended from 10.39 a.m. to 10.44 a.m.</inline></para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>PE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Beazley, Kim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEAZLEY</name></talker><para>—Before that brutal interruption, I had in fact nearly finished my speech. I was at that point in my remarks when I was remembering the fair and erudite way in which Dr Harry Jenkins chaired the proceedings of our chamber, the House of Representatives. An abiding memory I have of him is of the frustrated look that he could get on his face, occasionally patting the side of the chair, when saying to honourable members, `You're not helping the chair.' If there was an expression that became most associated with his Speakership it was, `You're not helping the chair'—and indeed no-one was. No-one was helping the chair, and that was very unfair because, if ever a chair deserved help from the assembled ranks of the House of Representatives, it was him. Subsequent to his service in the House, he became an ambassador of this nation and served the nation well. </para></talk.start></continue><para>We have great reason as a party to remember his service with gratitude and we have reason as a parliament to remember his service with admiration. We can see an example in the view he held of the significance of the House of Representatives chamber and occasionally in our cynicism let that float through our veins. It is that sort of view that is a restorative, not simply for good temper but also for a good sense of what it is that we are about and how important the things we do are. I extend my deepest sympathies to all of Harry's family, but particularly to my colleague the member for Scullin, who himself is building up an admirable reputation for exactly the same attributes that his father possessed and exhibited so abundantly in this place.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>32199</page.no><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JENKINS</name><name.id>HH4</name.id><electorate>Scullin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank the chamber for this further opportunity to make some remarks. Debates such as this have been very helpful not only to me but also—as I found in conversation last night—to my family. I thank the honourable members for Melbourne Ports, Batman, Denison and Brand and the Minister for Science and the Attorney-General for their remarks today. It has been very helpful to have the observations of others.</para></talk.start><para>The member for Melbourne Ports made some very interesting third-party observations of the thanksgiving service. His observations were very helpful: that, in an attempt to convey the nature of dad, we did that with some success; and that the people who gathered together were a cross-section of the people whom my father had touched along the way—from representatives of many ethnic communities that are in the areas that we represent through to long-term family friends and distant family relations.</para><para>The member for Batman gave a very generous and gracious outline of the respect that dad has in the areas that he represents—but of course dad had represented for a long time at both state and federal level. The sincerity of his expression of wishes on behalf of the Ferguson family was very much appreciated. As Martin said, that is a generational thing—it is a fact; we do not turn our back on it; that is the way it is—and it has been very important to us.</para><para>The Minister for Science was really overwhelmingly gracious, and I know that he talked with great sincerity about my father and my father's time as the Speaker when the Minister for Science was a younger version of the `Ginger' that I know now. We both have that hair colouring, and he has allowed me from time to time to refer to him by that nickname. He made some interesting reflections about the great battles down in the old chamber. He did not refer it to it this way but it was the Moscow corner and cockies corner—and it was very willing. As Peter said today, it was close and it was very willing. It was the furthermost point in the chamber from the chair, so sometimes dad honestly did not know what was going on there. He knew because jaws were flapping that there was some serious combat on, but it was just a bit difficult in the hurly-burly.</para><para>The then National Party member for Fisher, who is now the Liberal Party member for Fisher, used to get into trouble. I have told him that the Speaker's Gallery was behind cockies corner. My mum used to sit in the Speaker's Gallery and, because my dad really did not know what was going on, my mum, bless her soul, would point at who she thought were the transgressors. On one occasion, this meant Peter Slipper got outed because my mum had dobbed him in. But I did appreciate that, on behalf of the National Party—among whose members Dad developed many friends in his time here—the Minister for Science came to the Main Committee to make the comments he did. </para><para>It was interesting to hear the member for Denison because, whilst he was not here while Dad was here, he talked about the times that he had actually met him and the generosity of spirit that Dad gave with his time in listening and communicating with people, which is a reflection that many have made. Dunc also mentioned Dad's struggle with giving up smoking. He finally did it in his 70s and, as Duncan describes, it was not just the nicotine aspect of the habit, it was having something to do with his hands; it helped once he got that under control. The little holder went with him—it was placed in the casket—because that was very much something that was the nature of the Dr Harry that we knew in the end. But it was a struggle. I had patients that came to me and said, `Your dad gave great advice. He said, “Stop smoking and you will feel a lot better.” I have given it away and, gee, life is much better. There is one thing that puzzles me: he's still smoking. What is the problem?' Really, it was in Dad's make-up. It was just such a hard struggle and, as I said, he did not really do it until his 70s.</para><para>Of us all, the Attorney-General has had the longest association, in a parliamentary sense. I have had opportunity to talk to him about his association with Dad in the past. I appreciated his remarks. I knew that he would have been thinking of us on Monday and I appreciate that he came here. I will not enter into a debate on the side of the Attorney-General with the member for Mackellar about the pain of a kidney stone but, having suffered one, if it is compared to childbirth—and it is not quite—it does make an interesting discussion. Certainly, that was a talk that, unfairly, perhaps breaching patient confidence, I had with my dad about the incident in the Cook Islands.</para><para>Phil talks about Dad's ability to diagnose and his bedside manner. He actually displayed all that up until the end. I was in emergency at the hospital when he came in and he was being dealt with and everything. He was suffering from pneumonia and he said, `I have got a pain here in my left side. I think it will be the lower lobe of my lung that is congested.' Off he went to have the X-ray. Up goes the X-ray. Which lobe of the lung has got the cloudy stuff?—I am not into the techo things. He was absolutely right, and he had been able to do that. The young doctor who attended him right to the end had only really known him a matter of hours, but in talking to the family he said, `I think he was giving me cheek. Actually, I think he ticked me off'—and he probably did. With the professionals dealing with him, he would always be offering his advice about what he thought they should be doing.</para><para>The member for Brand referred to Dad's state service and the lack of resources. I can remember when either the front porch or the front den was the electorate office and constituents would knock at the front door. There was no assistance; we dealt with them at home. Mum, who had keyboard skills, was the only secretarial support that Dad had in those days—and it was a very difficult period. It was that 25 years of darkness in Victoria and it was such a difficult struggle for the Victorian Labor Party post the split. It was not until recent times that I realised how hard it would have been. My father went into the state parliament in 1961 and it was only a matter of six years. Now I know what six years is in parliamentary life. It has given me a different comprehension of what a struggle it would have been when he first entered the state parliament. Kim has talked about the way in which he dealt with things: the standing orders, the fact that he tried to be fair, and his expression about the House not helping him. But, really, he always emphasised that the loneliest chair in the chamber is the Speaker's chair, because nobody is there to help you. </para><para>To everybody who has contributed to this debate, I thank you very much. There was just one thing that I did not speak about yesterday. Dad was a sufferer of Kennedy's disease. It is one of the variations of motor neurone disease. Some will remember him here with his ungainly gait, and that was as a result of the muscle wastage that comes with the degenerative loss of the motor neurones. He battled on with it, having had it diagnosed some 30 years ago. He had a very slow version. Some people only survive two or three months after having it diagnosed. So yesterday I wore this blue cornflower, which is the symbol of the Motor Neurone Disease Association, of which Dad was a patron and which was a great support to Dad, Mum and the rest of the family. In conclusion, I once again thank the House for the honour they have bestowed upon Dad, my predecessor as the member for Scullin, by not only the condolence motion yesterday but this take note debate in the Main Committee today.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Scott, Bruce (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

I am also advised that he is not an Australian citizen. </para><para>(3)	The investigation and prosecution of offences under Commonwealth law are matters for appropriate investigative authorities, including the Australian Federal Police, and the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions.</para><para>(4)	The International Criminal Court's jurisdiction is limited by the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court which created it. The Statute recognises that States Parties have primary jurisdiction to try genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity under their domestic legal systems. Under the Statute, a case is inadmissible in the International Criminal Court (ICC) where a State Party is investigating or prosecuting that case, or where the State Party has investigated and decided not to prosecute, unless the State Party is unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution. In addition, the ICC may not try a person who has been properly tried in another court for conduct which would constitute genocide, war crimes or crimes against humanity. Within these limits, the ICC has jurisdiction where the person accused of genocide, war crimes or crimes against humanity is a national of a State Party to the Statute. Australia is a State Party, having ratified the Statute on 1 July 2002. The ICC Statute entered into force for Australia on 1 September 2002.</para><para>The crimes of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity set out in the ICC Statute have been included in Australian domestic law under Division 268 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code. This allows Australia to domestically investigate or prosecute a person for conduct overseas which is alleged to constitute a crime under the Statute. Any such case would be inadmissible in the ICC during that investigation or prosecution and the person could not be tried in the ICC if they had already been tried in an Australian court. The Declaration by Australia made upon ratification of the Statute states that Australia will not surrender a person to the ICC until Australia has had the full opportunity to investigate or prosecute any alleged crimes.</para><para>(5)	All States Parties to the ICC Statute have obligations to cooperate in relation to the prosecution of crimes within the ICC's jurisdiction. The International Criminal Court Act 2002 establishes procedures in Australia's domestic law to allow Australia to comply with these obligations, including requests for the arrest and surrender of persons and other requests for cooperation. States Parties, like Australia, do not have additional obligations under the ICC Statute which specifically apply when their citizens (for example, Australian citizens) are the subject of prosecution in the ICC.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Iraq</title><page.no>32217</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 3653)</subtitle><id.no>3653</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>32217</page.no><name role="metadata">Melham, Daryl, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Melham</name><name.id>4T4</name.id><electorate>Banks</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 16 June 2004:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Did Australian officials attend the first meeting of the International Coordination Committee for the Safeguarding of Iraqi Cultural Heritage (ICC) convened by the Director-General of UNESCO in Paris on 24 and 25 May 2004; if so, (a) what are their names and positions, and (b) what was the outcome of the meeting?</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>32218</page.no><name role="metadata">Downer, Alexander, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Downer</name><name.id>4G4</name.id><electorate>Mayo</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Foreign Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(a)	Ms Robyn Stern, Deputy Permanent Delegate of Australia to UNESCO, attended the formal opening session of the first meeting of the ICC for the Safeguarding of Iraqi Cultural Heritage in Paris on 24 May 2004.</para><para>(b)	The ICC meeting agreed on seven final recommendations.
