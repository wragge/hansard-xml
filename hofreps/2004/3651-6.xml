<para class="block">Australia’s land transport infrastructure is critical in supporting future economic growth and in meeting the nation’s social, economic and community needs.</para>
<para>The purpose of this <inline ref="R2231">bill</inline> is to reform the framework for Australian government funding of land transport infrastructure. It represents a great deal of work by the government, and in that context I would like to particularly thank Senator Ian Campbell for his help working with me in his capacity as Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads, and, more recently, the member for Robertson. He and I are both proud and excited to see this major reform in place. The arrangements for which the bill provides will replace over time those contained in the Australian Land Transport Development Act 1988 and the Roads to Recovery Act 2000.</para>
<para>Australia’s land transport infrastructure faces major challenges over the next 20 years and beyond. Freight and passenger volumes will rise. User requirements, reflecting the very real pattern over the last couple of decades, will become infinitely more varied and complex. International competitive pressures will demand continuing improvements in the productivity and reliability of logistics chains.</para>
<para>In order to meet these challenges, the government considers that fundamental change is needed in the way that land transport infrastructure is planned and funded in this nation.</para>
<para>The arrangements set out in this bill signal a move away from the longstanding fragmented approach to land transport investment based on the needs of single transport modes and single jurisdictions.</para>
<para>The bill will assist a change of investment focus to nationally important transport corridors and to finding the best solution to transport requirements irrespective of transport mode.</para>
<para>The government has set out a comprehensive program for addressing Australia’s highest priority national land transport needs. The government will support the program with an unprecedented level of investment.</para>
<para>In the five-year period to 2008-09 some $8 billion will be provided for investment on national roads and railways. Some $1.6 billion will be provided to meet transport needs at the regional and local level. And $180 million is being provided for the highly effective National Road Safety Black Spot Program, which has saved—and continues to save—many Australian lives and much trauma.</para>
<para>I turn now to the key features of the bill.</para>
<para>The bill establishes arrangements to apply to six categories of funding:</para>
<list type="bullet">
<item>
<para>AusLink national projects;</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>AusLink transport development and innovation projects;</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>land transport research organisations;</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>AusLink strategic regional projects;</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>AusLink Black Spot Projects; and</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>the AusLink Roads to Recovery Program.</para>
</item>
</list>
<para>This bill also provides a mechanism for the approval of projects and funding, and for the attachment of conditions to funding, under each of these categories.</para>
<para>Pivotal to the funding of the AusLink national projects will be the national land transport network. The bill provides for the network to be established by ministerial determination.</para>
<para>The national land transport network will be the focus for the government’s drive to direct its investment to strategic transport linkages of highest national importance.</para>
<para>The national land transport network will move beyond the separately planned and funded national rail and road networks and ad hoc rail/road intermodal developments to a single integrated network.</para>
<para>The national land transport network which the government proposes to establish under the bill will encompass the former national highway system including its connections through urban areas, the major interstate rail network and other nationally important interstate and interregional transport links, as well as links to ports and airports.</para>
<para>Details of the transport links to be included in the initial national land transport network determination were set out in the AusLink white paper. They reflect the assessment of many proposals advanced during a very extensive consultation process.</para>
<para>The bill allows for variations to be made to the national network. The government will periodically review the network’s composition.</para>
<para>The bill provides for the minister to approve individual road or rail projects on the national network as AusLink national projects.</para>
<para>The $8 billion to be provided over the five years to 2009 will enable approval to be given to a broad range of strategic priority projects.</para>
<para>These include projects on the Pacific Highway, the Hume Highway, the Sydney to Brisbane and Sydney to Melbourne interstate railways, the Bruce Highway and Brisbane urban road links in Queensland, the Geelong Bypass and Calder Highway in Victoria, the Great Northern Highway and the Peel deviation in Western Australia, the Port River Expressway in South Australia, and the Bridgewater Bridge in Tasmania.</para>
<para>The Australian government will also contribute towards the cost of maintaining road links on the national network.</para>
<para>While the national land transport network will be the focus of the government’s planning and funding responsibility, this does not mean that it has full financial responsibility for all projects on the network. The network includes links that were previously jointly funded or fully funded by the states.</para>
<para>The government has indicated its intention to invest in those projects that are of national priority and have substantial national benefits. The government has a clear expectation that states and territories will invest in those projects on the national network which provide benefits at the state or territory level. This means that, in many cases, project costs will be shared with state and territory governments.</para>
<para>Funding arrangements to be negotiated with states and territories will vary according to types and details of individual projects. The government will continue to fully fund many projects on the former national highway system—especially, for example, remote interstate links because of their importance in providing national connectivity and the minor contribution of local traffic to their costs.</para>
<para>The government intends that the identification of longer term investment priorities will be progressed, in close consultation with the states and territories, through the development of planning strategies for each corridor on the national land transport network.</para>
<para>The government has started developing bilateral agreements with the states and territories which will cover cost sharing as well as cooperative planning arrangements. These agreements will ensure that there is clarity of responsibilities between jurisdictions.</para>
<para>The government will also, under AusLink, involve the private sector in the development and funding of Australia’s infrastructure. This will enable important infrastructure projects to be completed in a more timely fashion and enable governments to take advantage of private sector expertise.</para>
<para>The development of a high-performing national land transport system cannot be achieved without well-focussed research and the encouragement and application of innovative technology and practices.</para>
<para>It will be necessary to identify deficiencies on the national network, formulate corridor strategies, and devise and demonstrate innovative transport solutions.</para>
<para>The bill therefore provides for funding of transport development and innovation projects that would potentially improve the efficiency and safety of transport operations on the AusLink national network.</para>
<para>Projects eligible for funding under this category include planning and research and development of new technology or practices.</para>
<para>The bill includes provisions to also enable funding to be directed to organisations whose activities are concerned with land transport planning and research. This particularly includes organisations which are jointly funded by the Australian, state and territory governments.</para>
<para>The bill will enable the government to build on the substantial support already being provided for local roads under the Roads to Recovery program over the four-year period 2001-05.</para>
<para>The bill provides for the extension of the Roads to Recovery program for a further four-year period from 1 July 2005. The provisions in the bill closely mirror the provisions of the Roads to Recovery Act 2000. Payments under that act will cease on 30 June 2005. Future funding will be governed by the terms of this bill.</para>
<para>In all, the government is allocating $1.45 billion for Roads to Recovery over the five-year period to 2008-09.</para>
<para>All councils will receive funding allocations for expenditure on the construction and maintenance of local roads on much the same basis as the current program’s formula approach. The funds will be paid directly to every local council, as they are under the current program, and under similar guidelines. This will provide funding certainty and will help all councils to sustain service levels across their local road systems.</para>
<para>Local councils will also be the direct beneficiaries of the arrangements which the bill will establish for funding AusLink regional strategic projects.</para>
<para>Support for these projects aims to enhance the ability of regional industry and communities to compete in the national and global marketplace, as well as improving access to employment and services. The government will also provide support from within this funding stream for local roads in unincorporated areas where there are no local councils.</para>
<para>The bill will provide for the continuation of the black spot program, which is a critically important part of the government’s road safety strategy. The government has currently committed $180 million to continue the black spot program in the period up to 2008-09.</para>
<para>The black spot program has proven highly cost-effective in targeting those road locations where crashes are occurring.</para>
<para>Road crashes cost the Australian economy $15 billion every year. Black spot projects save the community many times the cost of the relatively minor road improvements that are undertaken. The raw figures say nothing of the human trauma involved in serious road accidents.</para>
<para>The bill includes a range of other machinery provisions. The bill sets down mandatory conditions that will attach to Commonwealth funding for approved projects. The minister will be able to specify that a project approval is subject to a funding agreement between the Commonwealth and the funding recipient. There is also provision for the minister to determine additional conditions which will apply to a project or projects not covered by a funding agreement.</para>
<para>The provisions of the Legislative Instruments Act requiring registration and tabling will apply to all legislative instruments made under the AusLink legislation. But it is proposed that the ministerial determination of the national land transport network, the schedule of Roads to Recovery funding allocations, and ministerial determinations of conditions associated with funding will not be subject to the disallowance and sunsetting provisions of the Legislative Instruments Act. The reasons are set out in the explanatory memorandum.</para>
<para>The initiatives announced by the government and to which this bill will give effect followed an extensive consultation process. It involved numerous meetings with states, territories, local government, and private sector organisations as well as consideration of no less than 550 written submissions.</para>
<para>Under the arrangements for which this bill provides, we will:</para>
<list type="bullet">
<item>
<para>drive the development of our key road and rail links and ensure they are forged into a single, high-performing and safe national network. As a minor diversion, during the campaign I talked to people about busy roads such as the Pacific Highway—which the member for Robertson is well familiar with—and told them that one of the problems was that we had not done things in a coordinated way in Australia. We upgrade our roads and immediately they are filled with more cars. We simply have to do it in a more coordinated way and upgrade rail at the same time as we upgrade the roads. We need to do that in a coordinated and sensible fashion so that what belongs on the roads goes on the roads and what belongs on rail goes on rail. When I said that, people would spontaneously applaud. In a sense, that is the sort of nutshell description of the commonsense approach that we are seeking to move to;</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>move beyond the entrenched arrangements for separate road and rail funding which hampered rail development—and hampered, really, our management of road assets, too;</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>recognise the critical importance of links to our ports and airports in supporting a globally competitive transport system—and we look forward to the states doing more with the ports, given that we are busily providing proper links into our ports; and</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>maintain support for the maintenance and upgrading of local roads networks and for the development of key regional links.</para>
</item>
</list>
<para>Again, I would like to thank my friend and colleague the member for Robertson for his outstanding contribution and work in this area. I am very proud of this legislation. I regard it as being of landmark quality and I think it will deliver much better outcomes for taxpayers, for transport users and indeed all of us who are dependent one way or another on efficient transport networks in this country. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.</para>

</motion>
<para class="block">This is a relatively straightforward aspect of winding up of the current arrangements. The principal purpose of this <inline ref="R2237">bill</inline> is to provide for transitional arrangements under which the <inline ref="R2231">AusLink (National Land Transport) Bill 2004</inline>, when enacted, will progressively replace the Australian Land Transport Development Act 1988 as the legislative framework for future Australian government funding of land transport infrastructure.</para>
<para>The Australian Land Transport Development Act 1988 will be substantially amended but will continue in force for the time being.</para>
<para>The bill provides that, on commencement of the AusLink (National Land Transport) Act, no new declarations may be made and no new projects may be approved under the Australian Land Transport Development Act.</para>
<para>There is provision for the minister to determine that projects previously approved under the Australian Land Transport Development Act will be carried over to the new AusLink act (and thus administered as AusLink projects). All other projects are to be completed under Australian Land Transport Development Act conditions.</para>
<para>The bill also provides that the operation of the Australian Land Transport Development Special Account will cease on commencement of the AusLink act.</para>
<para>To replace the provision of funding through the Australian Land Transport Development Special Account, the bill provides for a special appropriation for the balance of 2004-05. This special appropriation will be required to cover AusLink expenditure, projects continuing under the Australian Land Transport Development Act, and new Black Spot projects. From 2005-06, all of these categories will be funded through annual budget appropriations.</para>
<para>There are some further amendments to the Australian Land Transport Development Act that repeal sections that have long ceased to have practical administrative effect.</para>
<para>The annual reporting provision of the Australian Land Transport Development Act has been amended so that an annual report will only be required in a year in which money is paid out in respect of projects continuing to be administered under the Australian Land Transport Development Act.</para>
<para>This bill will provide for an orderly transition to the new funding arrangements which the government proposes for the AusLink program.</para>
<para>May I conclude by saying that in the short time we have been back in this House I regard myself as fortunate and privileged indeed to have been able to introduce two pieces of legislation which to me are extraordinarily important. One set up the National Water Commission and provides the mechanism for us to move as quickly only as the commitment to sound ecological outcomes shared by us and, I hope, by the states will enable us to do. And here we have groundbreaking legislation which for the first time since Federation, if it is picked up productively and cooperatively by the states and by the private sector, will enable us to plan properly for our transport infrastructure needs—and those needs are very real, with the national transport task growing much more rapidly than the economy and growing rapidly in complexity, and people’s expectations, I think, are also growing very rapidly. They expect high-quality on-time delivery all the time, every time. We really do need to ensure that scarce resources are efficiently spent on well-planned infrastructure. It is a great delight to now present the explanatory memorandum to this, the lesser of the two bills—but still important—that institute our national land transport plan.</para>

<para class="block">This <inline ref="R2235">bill</inline> amends the Navigation Act 1912, the principal Commonwealth act relating to the safety of ships.</para>
<para>The bill will:</para>
<list type="bullet">
<item>
<para>remove the requirement for assessors of nautical experience to advise the court in a prosecution for a breach of regulations relating to the prevention of collisions and the display on ships of lights and signals;</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>clarify that a breach of regulations relating to prevention of collisions and the display on ships of lights and signals may be prosecuted on indictment; and</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>revise certain penalties in the Navigation Act which relate to navigation near ice and the rendering of assistance following an accident at sea or where persons are in distress at sea.</para>
</item>
</list>
<para>When proceedings are being heard for an offence against regulations relating to the prevention of collisions and the use of lights and signals on ships, the Navigation Act currently requires a court to be assisted by ‘not less than 2 assessors of nautical experience appointed under Part IX’ of the Navigation Act.</para>
<para>Part IX was repealed in 1989 and so there is no mechanism for the appointment of nautical assessors. The bill will rectify this left-over anomaly.</para>
<para>The bill will also make it clear that an offence against the regulations which prescribe measures to be observed for the prevention of collisions and the provision and use on ships of lights and signals is an indictable offence.</para>
<para>Currently, the maximum penalty for an offence against the regulations for an individual is a fine of $10,000 and a term of imprisonment of two years. In accordance with the Crimes Act 1914, it would appear that this is an indictable offence.</para>
<para>However, in an unreported Victorian County Court ruling—which caused me some concern—in November 2003, the court found that offences against the regulations can only be prosecuted summarily.</para>
<para>The bill will remove the possibility of confusion.</para>
<para>The Navigation Act requires each person in charge of a ship involved in a collision with another ship to:</para>
<list type="bullet">
<item>
<para>render practicable and necessary assistance to the other ship;</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>stay by the other ship until there is no need for further assistance; and</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>give information about the ship to the master or person in charge of the other ship.</para>
</item>
</list>
<para>The maximum penalty for breach of this requirement is currently a fine not exceeding $20,000 or imprisonment for a period not exceeding 10 years, or both. The bill will provide that the maximum penalty is expressed simply as imprisonment for 10 years.</para>
<para>The Navigation Act requires the master of a ship to cause his ship to assist persons on or from a ship or aircraft who are in distress.</para>
<para>The maximum penalty for breach of this requirement is currently a fine not exceeding $10,000 or imprisonment for a period not exceeding four years, or both. The bill will provide that the maximum penalty is expressed simply as imprisonment for four years.</para>
<para>The Navigation Act provides that the master of a ship or aircraft in distress may requisition the most suitable ships which answer his or her calls for assistance. The master of a requisitioned ship must proceed to the assistance of the persons in distress.</para>
<para>The maximum penalty for breach of this requirement is currently a fine not exceeding $20,000 or imprisonment for a period not exceeding 10 years, or both. The bill will provide that the maximum penalty is expressed simply as imprisonment for 10 years.</para>
<para>The Navigation Act requires a master to keep a record of any information received about a ship or aircraft in distress at sea and, if the master does not proceed to the assistance of persons from that ship or aircraft, the reasons for not proceeding.</para>
<para>The bill will increase the maximum penalty for breach of this requirement from $2,000 to 50 penalty units.</para>
<para>Each of the above penalty provisions which will be expressed only as a term of imprisonment may, in accordance with a formula in the Crimes Act 1914, be converted into an additional fine for an individual and into a fine only for a body corporate. For an individual, a term of imprisonment for one year means that there is the possibility of an additional fine of $6,600. For a body corporate, a penalty expressed as a term of imprisonment for one year converts to a fine of $33,000. I present a signed copy of the explanatory memorandum.</para>

<para class="block">The government is committed to ensuring that prudential regulation and the consumer protection functions associated with prudentially regulated entities are adequately funded and that the regulators have adequate resources and expertise to perform their functions properly. Part of this commitment is ensuring that the framework for setting the financial sector levies is up to date and continues to raise the necessary funding from industry in an equitable and sustainable way.</para>
<para>As such, the government commissioned the Review of Financial Sector Levies to evaluate the arrangements for determination of levies imposed on the financial sector that support the operations of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, and certain operations of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the Australian Taxation Office.</para>
<para>Fundamentally, the task of the review was to consider how the burden of funding the relevant regulatory activities might best be distributed between all of the regulated entities. At a broad level, the central issues involved the horizontal distribution of levies between different institutions or industry sectors and the vertical distribution between larger and smaller institutions.</para>
<para>The review was chaired by the Treasury and undertaken jointly by Treasury and APRA in consultation with ASIC and the ATO. Extensive consultation was undertaken with industry, including roundtable discussions and consideration of formal submissions made to the review.</para>
<para>The review and the government’s response were released in May 2004. Several key recommendations were made to alter the existing financial sector levy framework. The recommendations aim to ensure that levies are collected fairly and efficiently between industry sectors and from all entities within industry sectors. They also aim to ensure that APRA, in particular, has a sustainable funding base that is able to meet any changes in APRA’s future budget requirements equitably and efficiently. In general, the recommendations allow increased flexibility in the way levies are collected to ensure that these goals can be met. This <inline ref="R2238">bill</inline> and the other six levy bills that are being considered concurrently contain the legislative changes necessary to implement the new levy-setting framework.</para>
<para>The bill proposes that there be two separate elements to the determination of financial sector levies. The first element has a cost of supervision based rationale with a percentage levy rate on assets subject to minimum and maximum amounts. This element is essentially the same structure as the existing levy framework where the levy determinations are based solely on the cost of supervision. The second, and new, element reflects the potential financial system impact of an entity and addresses vertical equity concerns. It will be a low percentage levy on assets, without a minimum or maximum amount for individual regulated entities. The government proposes to set levies such that the portion of the total levies raised from this second element will be between 10 and 30 per cent of APRA’s total levy funding requirement in each year.</para>
<para>These arrangements recognise the particular importance of regulating the largest institutions in our financial system as the larger the financial institution the greater the likely impact on the financial system and economy in the event of it facing financial difficulties or failing. The relationship is not one which tapers off in a way that would make a cap on the amount paid by an individual institution appropriate. Therefore the government considers that system risk can be taken into account through a single levy rate applied to the assets of an institution and without a floor or cap.</para>
<para>In addition, because the current cap arrangements involve zero marginal levy rates, once the maximum levy cap is reached many consider that these arrangements breach vertical equity norms. For example, the levy amounts paid by the largest banks are little more than the levies paid by the much smaller and less complex banks. The new element of the levy determination framework seeks to address this inequitable outcome.</para>
<para>The bill will allow changes in the levy arrangements for many of the smallest APRA regulated superannuation funds—referred to as SAFs—by separating their levy determinations from those of other superannuation funds. This recognises that it is common for a single approved trustee to manage a large number of self-managed funds and for the main focus of prudential attention to be on the trustee rather than each of the individual funds. In particular, this will allow SAFs to be levied at lower minimum rates than other superannuation funds.</para>
<para>More generally, through its response to the review, the government has ensured that changes to the levy determination arrangements will not lead to increases in the amounts paid by the smallest financial institutions. This, in part, reflects the government’s acceptance of the review’s conclusion that system risk and vertical equity considerations, as well as cost, should be taken into account in the determination of levies. Furthermore, the government considers that small financial institutions fill an important niche in terms of alternative service provision, competition and choice for consumers.</para>
<para>Along with ensuring that all regulated institutions pay an equitable share of levies, the government considers that it is very important to maintain the long-term sustainability of the levy funding base so that it can respond efficiently and fairly to any changes in the prudential regulation funding requirements. This bill enhances the sustainability of the funding base through two means. First, an increase in the statutory maximum levy able to be levied on institutions in each sector for the cost of the supervision based element. And, secondly, an increase of three percentage points in the indexation factor applied annually to the statutory maxima.</para>

<para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">At the May 2002 ministerial meeting on public liability insurance, the Commonwealth, state and territory ministers agreed to a range of measures to address insurance industry concerns. These measures included the establishment of a panel of experts to review the law of negligence.</para>
<para>This review was established to assist governments to formulate a consistent approach to the problems of rising premiums and reduced availability of public liability insurance.</para>
<para>The members of the review were the Honourable Justice David Ipp, Professor Peter Cane, Associate Professor Donald Sheldon and Mr Ian Macintosh.</para>
<para>The terms of reference of the review were broad and required it to consider, amongst other things, the application, effectiveness and operation of common-law principles applied in negligence to limit liability arising from personal injury or death. The review was also asked to develop and evaluate principled options to limit liability and the amount of damages awarded in given cases.</para>
<para>In addition, the review was asked to consider the interaction of the Trade Practices Act 1974 with the common law principles applied in negligence.</para>
<para>The review recommended a number of changes to the Trade Practices Act. The Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Act (No. 2) 2004 implemented a number of these recommendations. The <inline ref="R2233">Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill 2004</inline> will implement remaining review recommendations and complete the government’s tort law reforms.</para>
<para>Unfortunately, the reason that we are here debating this today is that the opposition did not support this bill in the last parliament. The bill effectively gives an opportunity to the legal profession to jump from state to federal jurisdictions and, in doing so, circumvent the very purpose of tort law reform.</para>
<para>In particular, this bill will implement review recommendations 19 and 20. Recommendation 19 recommends that the Trade Practices Act be amended to prevent individuals bringing actions for damages for personal injury and death under the misleading and deceptive conduct and other unfair practice provisions of part V division 1. Recommendation 20 recommends that the act be amended to remove the power of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to bring representative actions for damages for personal injury and death resulting from contraventions of part V division 1.</para>
<para>Part V division 1 of the Trade Practices Act prohibits, under civil law, unfair practices in trade and commerce, including misleading and deceptive conduct. Part VC division 2 of the act, containing the offences provisions, applies criminal sanctions to similar conduct.</para>
<para>The measures contained in this bill will amend the Trade Practices Act to prevent individuals, and the ACCC in a representative capacity, from bringing civil actions for damages for personal injury or death resulting from contraventions of part V division 1 of the Trade Practices Act. As a consequence, these measures will ensure that plaintiffs continue to seek damages for personal injury or death by pursuing a right of action under the common law rather than by relying on part V division 1 of the Trade Practices Act.</para>
<para>These reforms are aimed at limiting public liability claims costs in order to reduce pressure on insurance premiums and assist in delivering affordable public liability insurance.</para>
<para>To date, there have been some claims for damages for personal injury or death brought under part V division 1 of the Trade Practices Act. By introducing these measures, this bill will ensure that the Trade Practices Act cannot be used to undermine state and territory civil liability reforms.</para>
<para>The bill does not amend the range of other civil orders and remedies that are available under the Trade Practices Act for unfair practices in trade and commerce that are in contravention of part V division 1. The bill will have no impact on the availability of criminal sanctions under part VC division 2.</para>
<para>The bill will also continue to allow actions for damages for contraventions of part V division 1 for personal injury or death which result from smoking or other use of tobacco products, subject to a limitation period of three years from the date of discoverability.</para>
<para>I commend the bill and present the explanatory memorandum.</para>

<para>That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Maribyrnong Immigration Detention Centre (MIDC)—Additional accommodation and related works.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">The Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs proposes to undertake additional accommodation and related works at the Maribyrnong Immigration Detention Centre in Victoria. The government supports and endorses the role of the Public Works Committee and appreciates the value that the committee adds to projects. It is important that the public can be assured that proper scrutiny of the new detention centre activity, as provided by the Public Works Committee, has been undertaken.</para>
<para>The Maribyrnong Immigration Detention Centre mainly caters for visa overstayers or those whose visas are cancelled because they have failed to comply with their visa conditions. People refused entry to Australia at international airports and seaports are also detained at this centre. Generally, residents stay for a short period, though there is a minority of longer term residents who, for a range of reasons, are unable to be transferred to the Baxter immigration detention facility at Port Augusta in South Australia, which is better able to manage residents who are likely to remain in detention for a longer period. The centre now can accommodate up to 76 residents.</para>
<para>The current physical layout of the facility only allows for the separate management of single adult males, females and families. The background of residents has been changing and a growing number have criminal backgrounds and/or a history of illicit drug use. The new works will provide improved separation between the population groups that will enhance the ability to manage welfare risks. The expansion will provide additional accommodation and provide wide-ranging additional amenity to the residents that is not available in the current confines of the building. The works will also make the centre more secure for staff. The estimated cost of the proposed works is $7 million. Subject to parliamentary approval, documentation work is scheduled to commence in February next year and construction is to be largely completed by early 2006. I commend the motion to the House.</para>

</talker>
<para>—The <inline ref="R2190">Workplace Relations Amendment (Agreement Validation) Bill 2004</inline>, which is before us at the moment, reflects the government’s response to a recent High Court decision commonly referred to as the Electrolux case. In September, the High Court delivered its judgement on what is called the Electrolux matter, that matter previously having been before the Federal Court. In essence, the case concerned a question as to whether bargaining agents’ fees, where employees are required to pay a fee to a union as a contribution to the cost of negotiating an agreement, could legitimately be included in a certified agreement made under the Workplace Relations Act. There is no doubt that this majority decision has led to uncertainty and some difficulty for people involved daily in the bargaining process. This is particularly so as a result of the various interpretations that have been made since the decision was handed down.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I want to indicate some of the interpretations made about the High Court decision and bring it back to the issues that the High Court really made decisions about. Firstly, although not determined by the High Court, it is at least arguable that certified agreements which include a matter not pertaining to the employment relationship are now void. Although the Electrolux decision went no further than its findings in relation to bargaining fees in determining what is, or is not, a matter pertaining to the employment relationship, the decision is being taken by some to support a contention that a significant number of matters, some of which may have been routinely included in enterprise bargaining, are no longer enforceable. The issue of which matters rightly pertain to the employment relationship in my view remains a significant matter of contention and debate and will for some time to come. We have already seen, for example, differences on the part of individual commissioners on issues such as whether leave for union training is or is not a matter pertaining to the employment relationship. It is disingenuous to suggest unanimity on these issues about what is or is not a matter pertaining, and it is disingenuous to believe that this is going to be resolved early and speedily by the commission.</para>
<para>However, the effect of this uncertainty and the varying interpretations since the Electrolux decision was handed down have certainly left employers and employees not knowing whether their current agreements, negotiated in good faith, are now enforceable—not only to the extent of the now pertaining matters but also in terms of the agreements in totality. There is certainly no certainty as to whether protected industrial action previously taken in accordance with the law is in fact now quarantined from future retrospective legal action. While a full bench of the Industrial Relations Commission may in due course resolve differences of interpretation within the commission, in my view this will not necessarily be finally determinative. Indeed, one can readily envisage further appeals on a whole range of matters being taken back to the Federal Court and indeed to the High Court again.</para>
<para>It is against this background that the agreement validation bill has been introduced into parliament. It does seek to address some of these uncertainties, but in my view it is a limited and unsatisfactory response in that it only deals with one aspect of the uncertainty—namely, the validity of agreements and individual contracts or AWAs which were certified before the handing down of the Electrolux decision. When you look at the details that are contained in this bill, it can only lead to a conclusion that the government’s response will not settle the uncertainties that are out there. The intent of this bill is to retrospectively validate all those parts of certified agreements and AWAs that pertain to the employment relationship, but only those parts. Presumably, those aspects considered non-pertaining would be unenforceable but would not undo the validity of the remainder of the agreement. In our view, the preferable response, and the one that has been advocated by the member for Perth, would be to validate the whole of the existing certified agreements that have been lodged and allow these to continue to have effect until such time as the agreement expires. That is the alternative proposition that is being advanced in response to the government’s fairly limited response to the Electrolux case.</para>
<para>Why do I say that the government’s response is limited? Let me go through a number of issues. If we were just to adopt the government’s bill, at best employers and employees would know that their previously negotiated agreements stand, but none of them would necessarily know which clauses are in and which are out, which clauses are matters pertaining and which are not. Far from resolving issues arising from the Electrolux decision, the bill allows uncertainty to continue because many clauses of existing certified agreements would have to be tested, and indeed may not be tested for some time to come. Under the government’s limited response, until each contentious provision in an agreement is properly and authoritatively considered, be it by the Industrial Relations Commission, the Federal Court or indeed the High Court, it will continue to remain unclear which parts of an agreement are enforceable. The proposal would retrospectively interfere with the substance of many thousands of agreements that have been negotiated and entered into in good faith by the parties.</para>
<para>A matter of concern that has also been discussed in the other place is the issue of the quarantining of protected industrial action that at the time was lawfully taken in reaching the agreement, insofar as an agreement may now be deemed to have matters contained within it that do not pertain to the employment relationship. The whole issue of retrospective quarantining of protected industrial action is an issue that I do not think this bill in any way adequately addresses. Nor do I think that the bill resolves uncertainty about bargaining and certification in the post-Electrolux era. Those aspects draw me to the conclusion that the bill is a limited response to a difficult situation that exists. I think that a bill which only partially validates certified agreements is neither sensible nor practical and will only fuel a climate of further uncertainty and continued speculation about matters which do and do not pertain to the employment relationship.</para>
<para>A more certain way forward would be for the government to accept the proposals from this side of the House. In so doing, it would lead to a situation where all existing certified agreements would be validated, allowing each provision within those agreements to continue to have effect until the date on which the agreement expires. This approach would have the following benefits: it would provide certainty by validating agreements in their entirety; it would recognise that the agreements were made in good faith and that often the conditions that finally appear in those agreements also involve a process where conditions have been negotiated away to achieve a final outcome. In the course of bargaining and reaching an agreement a lot of things are on the table and, as we know, some issues get bargained away for a final outcome. On top of that now, the government is suggesting, or leaving as an open-ended question, that even after the bargaining has occurred there still might be provisions and clauses in the agreements that do not pertain to the employment relationship. I do not think there is justice in retrospectively changing the elements of an agreement negotiated in good faith and in accordance with the law. If workers, at the time of negotiating their agreements, took industrial action believing it was protected under the law, they should continue to expect legal protection from any action which may be subsequently taken against them.</para>
<para>In concluding my remarks on this bill I want to make a few points about the government’s contradictory position on the issue of enterprise bargaining. We often hear about these issues, and my colleague the member for Rankin, in his former responsibility as shadow minister, would have been in this chamber on many occasions when the government kept talking about the need to get rid of third party intervention and allow employers and employees to reach their own agreements. We have often heard that, haven’t we? To put that in some context, it was the Labor Party that first moved towards enterprise bargaining and broke down the rigidities of what historically had been a highly regulated and centralised system. In so doing it was our intention, and I think the government at least purports to have the same intention, to allow people at the enterprise level to regulate their own relationships, rights and obligations, outside the scope of the commission’s intervention. As far as the commission was concerned, the number of allowable matters that could be included in arbitrated awards was reduced but the push was on to have the parties bargain at the enterprise level without restraint, providing it was in accordance with the law as was reflected in the Workplace Relations Act.</para>
<para>If parties at the workplace are expected to negotiate the substance of the rights and obligations which will govern their relationship, it seems logical that they should be given a broader scope to determine the range of matters that might be relevant to the employment relationship at each specific enterprise. The bill before the House really highlights a dilemma for this government. In rejecting Justice Kirby’s reasoning for a broader ‘pertaining to’ test for agreements, as compared to arbitrated awards, ironically the majority of the High Court have effectively strengthened the hand of state intervention in the employment relationship. The government’s bill in effect denies this parliament the opportunity to decide what matters legitimately could and should be included in negotiated agreements. As Electrolux shows, the Industrial Relations Commission, the Federal Court and the High Court can easily disagree on whether a provision or provisions pertain to the employment relationship, so protracted litigation and continuing uncertainty will continue until reliable precedents are established on each of the contentious provisions.</para>
<para>A quote in the Parliamentary Library’s brief sums up the dilemma that the government faces:</para>
<quote>
<para>As well as generating uncertainty, <inline font-style="italic">Electrolux</inline> can also be seen as a re-exertion of active state intervention in workplace relations. Following more than a decade’s worth of reforms in which self-regulation at the workplace or individual level has been promoted, <inline font-style="italic">Electrolux</inline> requires the Commission and courts to play a more integral role in policing the borders of self-regulation. While employers and employees remain free to determine the content of agreements, subject to certain minimum requirements, the breadth of those agreements has been circumscribed.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I know this was not the outcome the Labor Party envisaged when we moved to the system of enterprise bargaining. Indeed, for the government the contradiction is even more obvious. How does the government justify its support for a decentralised industrial relations regime where parties are urged to come to their own enterprise specific agreements without outside interference? By ‘outside interference’ the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations means without the influence of unions. This is the talk we hear from the government, ‘Let the employers and employees sort out their own arrangements.’ But at the same time this government brings a bill before the House which will limit the matters that can be negotiated in good faith at the workplace level. That poses a real dilemma for the government.</para>
<para>I am not suggesting that the climate of uncertainty post-Electrolux is not a difficult one to grapple with, but I contend that the government response is very limited. It will do nothing to dampen down the uncertainty. It fails to appreciate that each of the potentially conflicting views about what is or is not a matter pertaining to the employment relationship is going to take considerable time to resolve. It could well be that matters relating to that go back to the High Court again.</para>
<para>The approach suggested by this side of the House is the sensible and practical response to a difficult and uncertain industrial relations climate. I think we would have greater certainty, and more people knowing and understanding their rights and obligations, if the government took the step of validating all existing agreements and individual contracts in their totality, while the matters are yet to be resolved in terms of what is and what is not a matter pertaining to the employment relationship.</para>

<para>—In the Electrolux decision, the High Court ruled that an agreement must be fully about matters that pertain to the relationship between the employer and employees. It found that any agreement containing provisions that do not pertain to the relationship between the employer and employees is invalid. That means that even if 20 items were contained in an agreement and just one of those is a non-pertaining matter, then the entire agreement is invalid. That is the effect of the High Court decision.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It also means, very disturbingly, as the member for Throsby has pointed out, that if industrial action took place in pursuit of that agreement and that agreement contained just one provision that did not pertain to the relationship between the employer and employees, then that industrial action, though legally protected at the time, could be judged to be illegal. An employer could pursue the organisation, normally a union, that organised that protected industrial action. What an outrageous situation we would have if, under the laws of the land as they applied at that time and under the Workplace Relations Act, a union validly took protected industrial action in pursuit of an agreement. If that agreement was then signed and certified by the Industrial Relations Commission but was subsequently found by the High Court to contain just one provision that did not pertain to the employment relationship, industrial action could then be found to be illegal. Legal proceedings could be taken successfully against the union. That is the impact of the High Court’s decision.</para>
<para>The government’s response is very inadequate, in my view. The <inline ref="R2190">Workplace Relations Amendment (Agreement Validation) Bill 2004</inline> before us today validates those provisions in existing agreements that pertain to the relationship between an employer and employees, but does not validate any other provisions—that is, non-pertaining provisions. The problem here is: what is a non-pertaining matter? We do not know. The legislation today validates all the pertaining matters but not the non-pertaining matters—and we do not know what the non-pertaining matters are. The courts and tribunals are grappling with this at the moment, so if the government were fair dinkum about resolving uncertainty, it would validate all provisions of all agreements, whether they are pertaining or non-pertaining matters.</para>
<para>Is a non-pertaining matter a restriction on the use of casuals? If employers and employees come to an agreement in good faith that there will be some limitation on the use of casuals then presumably they should be entitled to do that. But the High Court may well have ruled that they cannot do that because perhaps it does not pertain to the relationship between the employer and employees. As another example: if an employer and employees—who may or may not be represented by a union, as it may be a non-union agreement—agreed to apply restrictions on the use of contractors, is that a pertaining matter or not? We do not know. What if they reached an agreement on the conditions under which a union could enter the employer’s workplace? Is that a pertaining matter or not? We do not know. What if they came to an agreement on deductions for union dues? We do not know whether or not that is a pertaining matter.</para>
<para>Relevantly for the coalition, perhaps an employer and its employees might reach an agreement where the employer, for example, says that it will pay some or all of the private health insurance premiums of its work force so that the work force has access to private facilities. It seems to me that, if they did come to that agreement, it is a matter for the employer and the employees. I do not know whether that is the case, though, because that could be a non-pertaining matter. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations is at the table. Perhaps he would like to speculate on whether the payment by an employer of the private health insurance premiums of staff is a pertaining or non-pertaining matter? The worrying aspect of this legislation is that it does not clarify that at all and does not validate any such agreement. Perhaps there are agreements where such provisions have been inserted, but the minister will not be able to tell the parliament in his summing up whether that provision relating to private health insurance premiums, for example, is a pertaining or non-pertaining matter.</para>
<para>This legislation resolves some uncertainty, but there are very broad areas remaining that need to be clarified and could have been clarified in the legislation, as the member for Throsby has pointed out. The option that the government could have pursued and chose not to is to validate all of the pre-existing agreements—agreements reached in good faith, agreements that the parties have willingly signed and then taken off to the commission for certification. But the government will not do that, and it will not do it for one reason: far from being a non-interventionist, deregulatory government, this government wants to interfere in the relationship between employers and employees. Most particularly, it wants to interfere in a way that deunionises workplaces. So it does not want arrangements agreed between employers and employees through a union which may in fact be to the advantage of trade union membership.</para>
<para>Let us understand that this government talks the talk of noninterference, of enterprise bargaining and of governments and other third parties staying out of things, but it does not walk the walk. It does not walk the walk because it wants to interfere. It is all part of the Orwellian structure around this government, where it makes particular claims about freedom, flexibility and noninterference but, when it comes down to it, it wants to interfere all right.</para>
<para>The government says it is a great supporter of enterprise bargaining, as if it invented enterprise bargaining. Labor introduced enterprise bargaining as a central organising principle of the industrial relations system and Labor will retain enterprise bargaining as the central organising principle of the industrial relations system. But this government does not really believe in enterprise bargaining. I say that because the legislation that the government introduced in 1996 places no obligation whatsoever on an employer to bargain. An employer does not have to bargain with employees if the employer does not want to. Certainly the employer does not have to bargain with the chosen representative of employees. And if that chosen representative happens to be a union then an employer can veto negotiations with the union.</para>
<para>This cannot really be a notion of bargaining as everyday Australians would understand the term. Bargaining, as far as this government is concerned, as enacted in the legislation, is such that the employer does not need to bargain at all and the employer can veto negotiations with the employees’ chosen representative if the employer does not like that chosen representative—in this case, a trade union. The government certainly does not require bargaining, and it is hostile to the notion of collective bargaining.</para>
<para>The irony here is that this year the government, having reviewed the report of the Dawson committee inquiry into small businesses, decided that small businesses, where they supplied goods or services to a large business, would be able to bargain collectively—that is, to get together to maximise their bargaining power. Labor agreed with that. Labor agreed that small businesses should be able to get together and bargain collectively as suppliers to a larger business. But I asked the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations during question time whether he would now agree to employees—workers—being able to bargain collectively with an employer, and the minister’s answer was, ‘They can already.’</para>
<para>The fact of the matter is that, if an employer vetoes negotiations with employees who seek to bargain collectively, that is the end of the matter. A right to bargain collectively that is vetoed by an employer is no right at all. So here we have the giant contradiction of the government saying, ‘It is good that small businesses should be able to bargain collectively, but we will not give that basic right to the working men and women of this country. We will give and have given to employers the right to veto negotiations with a collective group of employees, whether represented by a union or by themselves in a non-union bargaining process.’ And that is why I say that they talk the talk of choice, freedom and flexibility but very rarely do they walk the walk.</para>
<para>The reason that the government is opposed to collective bargaining and in fact does not require bargaining at all is that its model, its dream for the Australian workplace, is individual bargaining through Australian workplace agreements. The minister is at the table—I do not think he would disagree with that proposition, because every second day he comes into parliament lauding the wonderful virtues of AWAs. He says they are terrific; they are the way to go, and that is what we should have. Get rid of all this enterprise bargaining; get rid of this collective bargaining; get rid of trade unions, and it should be just a direct deal between employers and employees through AWAs.</para>
<para>The government has been on about this for 8½ years. After 8½ years of vigorous promotion, no matter how the minister wants to manipulate the figures and say it is ‘14 per cent of the number you first thought of’ covered by AWAs, there is only one figure that counts, and that is that AWAs still cover less than three per cent of the Australian work force. If they are this marvellous instrument for unleashing productivity growth around Australia, if they are so fair to employees and if they are so wonderful for employers, why haven’t these employers and employees rushed to sign up to these marvellous AWAs? The answer is: perhaps employers and employees are not all that fond of them.</para>
<para>Perhaps employees, particularly those on low incomes, consider AWAs to be a device for violating basic safety net award conditions in a race to the bottom—to undermine their pay and their working conditions. I am not sure, but on the evidence of it, after 8½ years of vigorous promotion of these magical AWAs with all these productivity-unleashing benefits and the happiness that flows out of AWAs and these individual negotiations in the workplace, you would reckon 97 per cent of the work force would be on them. But 97 per cent of the work force have said, ‘No, we don’t like AWAs.’ But they are going to get them rammed down their throats in this term of parliament, because this legislation today—the manifest inadequacy of it—is all part of the government stripping away any alternative to AWAs.</para>
<para>The government started in 1996 by stripping away the automatic right of working Australians to bargain collectively. It stripped away the right of employees to bargain collectively and, indeed, stripped away the right of employees to insist that bargaining takes place. It allowed employers not to bargain at all, and yet it has the temerity to call this system ‘enterprise bargaining’. So for 8½ years it has been stripping away any and all alternatives to AWAs, and this legislation continues that process by validating only those provisions that pertain to the relationship between employers and employees and refusing to validate those provisions arrived at in good faith that may not pertain to that relationship.</para>
<para>There is plenty of method in the government’s madness, because they want the single instrument to determine the relationship between an employer and an employee to be an AWA. But let us be clear about this: they still do not like negotiation; they do not like bargaining in relation to AWAs. The government say, ‘What really should happen is that an individual should go up against a large, powerful employer with no collective bargaining power and negotiate these highly flexible AWAs.’ There is very little to zero evidence that any negotiation takes place.</para>
<para>I hear from people who are on AWAs and I have not heard of one who walked into a workplace and said, ‘I’ve had a look at this AWA and there are a couple of aspects that don’t suit me, so I’d like to negotiate that.’ I have not heard of one case where an employer has said, ‘That’s fair enough, because these are flexible instruments where we can get into a genuine negotiation and arrive at arrangements that are good for you and good for me.’ But I have heard a litany of examples of employers saying, ‘Hold on. We’re not actually negotiating these things. We’re not going to vary them, because if we vary one then we’re going to have all this trouble. Others will say, “I’d like a variation that suits my individual circumstances too. I’d like a variation”—so that there might be genuine flexibility in working hours, for example—“that suits my arrangements in relation to the work of my partner.”’</para>
<para>I have not heard of any cases where an employee has said, ‘I’d like an arrangement where I start a little earlier and leave a little earlier because I would like to pick up the kids after school.’ I do not hear of too many cases—I have not heard of one—where an employer has said, ‘You’ve got a good point there, because the government told us when they were bringing in AWAs that they are really for flexibility and for the best working arrangements that we can arrive at between the two of us.’ No—rather, AWAs are routinely uniform for a business. How do we know that? Because the Senate estimates process has told us; because the people on AWAs have told us.</para>
<para>Senate estimates has heard of a process called ‘streamlining’. Streamlining is another of these Orwellian euphemisms. Streamlining is the Office of the Employment Advocate getting a bunch of AWAs—say 100 at a time—picking out one, checking it out and giving them all a tick, knowing full well that the other 99 have exactly the same terms and conditions, because the Employment Advocate knows that there is no negotiation of these AWAs. They are laid down and prescribed by the employer for the employee, who is offered an AWA on a take it or leave it basis—that is, ‘Take the AWA or you do not get the job,’ or, if you are an employee already on staff, ‘Take the AWA or leave this place.’</para>
<para>So where is the evidence that these AWAs are unleashing all the productivity gains in the Australian economy? I have not seen one respectable report suggesting that AWAs have unleashed productivity gains for Australia. If you look at the <inline font-style="italic">Intergenerational Report</inline>, Productivity Commission reports and other academic reports, you will see that the truth of the matter is that there is no compelling evidence that the spread of AWAs throughout the Australian work force would unleash some magical productivity yield.</para>
<para>What AWAs are essentially about is not flexibility but further tilting the bargaining power to employers, who then can lay down, as the only viable instrument under this government, terms and conditions of employment that can breach the basic award conditions and provide those terms and conditions to the employee on a take it or leave it basis. There is no genuine negotiation in the overwhelming majority of AWAs—perhaps in 100 per cent of AWAs. I alert the House to this government’s agenda to compromise and so damage every alternative to an AWA that the AWA is all that is left. That is the Howard government’s dream, and it has nothing to do with productivity and everything to do with its ideology of making sure that working Australians have no collective bargaining power and that the employer can lay out the conditions of employment with no negotiation with employees.</para>

<para>—in reply—I thank all members for their contributions to this debate. The principal purpose of the <inline ref="R2190">Workplace Relations Amendment (Agreement Validation) Bill 2004</inline> is to provide assurance and peace of mind to those parties who entered into agreements prior to the High Court’s decision in the Electrolux case. I thank members opposite for their recognition of the purpose of the bill in providing certainty as an important and urgently required measure. Passing the bill and ensuring that parties who have been operating under agreements in good faith can continue to rely on those agreements is the highest priority.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>A number of members mentioned in the debate the validation of industrial action taken in support of non-pertaining matters. The government considered that there are strong legal, practical and policy reasons not to validate industrial action. In particular, there are constitutional limitations on conferring protected status on past industrial action that failed to meet the requirements of the act for protected action. The government considered that it was unlikely that anyone would sue in respect of past industrial action that was not protected due to the Electrolux decision. Generally, the purpose of such legal action is to obtain an urgent injunction to stop ongoing unlawful industrial action. It is rare that such matters continue beyond the interim injunction stage, because parties have usually settled their dispute by the time a matter comes on for final hearing.</para>
<para>The government is not aware that any person has initiated legal action since the High Court’s decision seeking damages over long-settled bargaining disputes. However, in the interests of securing the urgent passage of this bill, the government has accepted an amendment moved by the Democrats in the Senate that will validate past industrial action to the extent that it is constitutionally possible. Like certified agreements, the validation only applies to industrial action taken prior to the High Court’s decision on 2 September 2004. After that date parties were in no doubt as to the requirement that protected industrial action may only be taken to support claims that pertain to the employment relationship.</para>
<para>The government does not agree with the proposition advanced by members of the opposition that the bill should validate agreements in their entirety, including provisions in agreements that could be found to be non-pertaining matters. To validate matters in certified agreements and AWAs that do not pertain to the employment relationship would be to go against the intent of the Workplace Relations Act. It would also go against the long-held principle about what may be included in industrial instruments. While I note the opposition’s view that the government should validate the whole deal made between the parties and not just part of it, it remains open to the parties to continue to honour arrangements to provide non-pertaining matters outside their certified agreement. Indeed, Senator Murray recognised that such matters are already being dealt with by alternative mechanisms. Put simply, the government fails to see the necessity for such an amendment and, indeed, the opposition is not proceeding with it in the House.</para>
<para>The bill as it stands is merely reflecting the current state of the law. The approach taken in the bill provides for consistency between agreements certified prior to Electrolux and agreements going through the certification process now and in the future. The government does not agree with the Labor Party’s claims that the Electrolux ruling itself has created more uncertainty about the application of the ‘matters pertaining’ test. The High Court’s interpretation of the Workplace Relations Act is consistent with Hight Court and other long-established legal precedents that apply to awards. Validating all matters in agreements certified prior to Electrolux would result in two streams of agreements—one containing non-pertaining matters and the other without such matters. Effectively through this amendment the opposition would be asking the government to introduce new and different rights to the employment relationship. Indeed, too much of the Senate debate focused on what this bill does not do. The bill was never intended to solve all of the issues raised in the Electrolux case. The government stands firmly behind the bill, which addresses simply and effectively the principal concern of parties over the validity of their agreements. I once again commend the bill to the House.</para>

<para class="block">This <inline ref="R2210">bill</inline> makes minor and technical amendments to the Copyright Act 1968 and the US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act 2004—that is, the US FTA Implementation Act—to improve Australia’s implementation of its copyright obligations under the Australia-United States free trade agreement, hereafter referred to as ‘the agreement’.</para>
<para>It is worth recalling that the copyright provisions in the US FTA Implementation Act were very extensive and covered a number of important areas of reform such as giving performers, for the first time, economic and moral rights in sound recordings and broadening criminal offences to target commercial copyright piracy.</para>
<para>These important reforms reinforced Australia’s reputation as a country which responds to the challenges of the digital age with international best practice copyright laws.</para>
<para>However, there are some areas where the copyright amendments could be made clearer.</para>
<para>This clarity is important to both international and domestic stakeholders that need certainty about the operation of Australia’s copyright laws when they are trading in Australia.</para>
<para>Over recent months there has been a series of fruitful discussions between the government, domestic stakeholders and the United States government about the operation of certain amendments made to Australia’s copyright laws in the US FTA Implementation Act.</para>
<para>I want to emphasise that the government is very clear that it has implemented all of its obligations under the agreement.</para>
<para>I also want to make it clear that the agreement has not been changed.</para>
<para>However, I do see merit in making some minor and technical amendments to improve the operation and practical effect of the new copyright provisions.</para>
<para>I wish to emphasise that the vast majority of stakeholders are in favour of urgent passage and commencement of the bill.</para>
<para>Although there have been some concerns raised about the carriage service provider liability provisions in the bill, we believe the amendments as currently drafted implement the obligations under the agreement and will work in practice.</para>
<para>I would like to address some of the concerns raised in relation to a carriage service provider’s obligation in items 11 and 13 to act to take down material if it ‘becomes aware of facts or circumstances that make it apparent that the copyright material is likely to be infringing’ as a condition to taking advantage of the safe harbour provisions.</para>
<para>These provisions implement article 17.11.29(b)(v)(B) of the agreement. This article provides that the safe harbour is conditional on a service provider ‘expeditiously removing or disabling access to material residing on its system or network on obtaining actual knowledge of the infringement or becoming aware of facts or circumstances from which the infringement was apparent …’</para>
<para>I want to make it clear that the intention of these provisions is to deal with genuine copyright infringements in the online environment.</para>
<para>It is not the government’s intention that a carriage service provider wanting to take advantage of the safe harbour scheme will have to disable or remove material, or access to material, merely because it becomes aware of an allegation or claim of copyright infringement. Likewise, becoming aware of a court action where there is a claim of copyright infringement will not, in itself, require a carriage service provider seeking to use the safe harbour to take down material.</para>
<para>The intention of the government is that a carriage service provider seeking the benefit of the safe harbour will only have to remove material when it is apparent, on the face of the facts and the circumstances known to the service provider, that material will probably, as opposed to possibly, infringe Australia’s copyright law. For example, a carriage service provider might become aware of a copy of the latest Harry Potter movie at a site on its network before it has been publicly released in the cinema.</para>
<para>As is currently the case, carriage service providers will not be required to actively monitor their systems or networks for such material. Nor will they be required to make independent investigations once they become aware of potential copyright infringement. The probable infringement has to be apparent.</para>
<para>The government has consulted domestic stakeholders on the draft bill and has outlined the amendments to the United States government.</para>
<para>This consultation process involved a positive exchange of views.</para>
<para>The government is also consulting with appropriate stakeholders on the regulations containing details of the safe harbour scheme to address other concerns raised by the carriage service providers.</para>
<para>The government believes that these amendments in the bill will clarify the practical effect of the copyright amendments made in the US FTA Implementation Act and continue the ongoing improvement of Australia’s copyright laws.</para>
<para>I commend the bill to the House and seek speedy passage. I present the explanatory memorandum.</para>
<para>Leave granted for second reading debate to continue immediately.</para>

<para>—The <inline ref="R2210">Copyright Legislation Amendment Bill 2004</inline> deals with Australia’s copyright laws as a direct consequence of arrangements entered into by the government under the US free trade agreement—an FTA in which the details were obviously not properly finalised, and that is the reason we have this legislation before us today. The government says that the bill makes various minor and clarifying amendments to the Copyright Act. This, in our view, is not the case. The amendments are not minor or clarifying; they are detailed and complex, with potentially wide ramifications. They have important new implications, not so much for copyright owners but for the disseminators of copyright material—in particular Internet service providers, referred to as ISPs.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>With the rapid advance of technology and the high uptake of the Internet in Australia, this has major ramifications for the free and unimpeded flow of information. In the information age, we have to encourage that dissemination of information. We have to facilitate it because we do not want barriers established to prevent that free flow of information. It is essential that we get this right if we are to become a knowledge nation. So, far from being minor and clarifying, this legislation in fact simply highlights another failure of the government to get the detail right in the US free trade agreement. The government has had the best part of two years in developing and negotiating this agreement, and yet it is still making changes to our laws to meet our obligations. It is hoped that this bill will be the last of it.</para>
<para>It is true that Labor did have concerns with the US free trade agreement, and we also have concerns with this legislation. Labor was prepared to play a constructive role in relation to the US free trade agreement. However, Labor’s offers to work with the government were rejected. The government did itself and the FTA a great disservice by the secret nature of the negotiations. The lack of transparency and consultation created unnecessary problems, resulting in a flawed FTA. The FTA should have been comprehensive. It should not have had a carve-out for sugar. The long phase-in for tariff cuts on beef, dairy and other agricultural products are further obvious deficiencies. The increasingly restrictive arrangements the minister agreed to with regard to intellectual property are another concern.</para>
<para>In its initial form, the FTA threatened Australia’s Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and local content on television. Labor amended the free trade agreement legislation not only to strengthen the agreement but to protect the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and local content. The government accepted those amendments. This was a demonstration of the constructive role Labor was prepared to play when given the opportunity. It showed clearly that the agreement itself could be strengthened. We still believe the FTA should have been a better agreement. There should have been no carve-out for sugar, as I indicated before. The FTA should have contained a most favoured nation provision in relation to agriculture. It should not have extended copyright in Australian by 20 years. These proposals from Labor were not accepted by the government.</para>
<para>It is hoped, in the context of all these problems, that the government does not make the same mistakes if it goes down the path of negotiating a free trade agreement with China. It is to be hoped that in the scoping study that the government is now involved in—and if that leads to further free trade negotiations next year—the government will be more consultative, more transparent and more forthcoming with the detail to ensure that the Australian public is fully capable of understanding what may be in any agreement.</para>
<para>Labor did not negotiate the US free trade agreement, but we did support it in the parliament in August. But we are now back again to amend Australia’s copyright laws because the government failed to get the detail right. When Labor amended the free trade agreement to protect the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and to protect local content, the government—the Prime Minister in particular—said that Labor were trying to sink the deal, that our proposals were inconsistent with the free trade agreement. It is now quite clear that the hold-up in the free trade agreement had nothing to do with Labor’s amendments. They did not sink the deal. Rather, it was the government’s failure to correctly legislate to give effect to Australia’s obligations that threatened the free trade agreement.</para>
<para>Labor’s preferred approach to advancing this nation’s trade objectives is through the World Trade Organisation, the WTO, and the multilateral round of trade negotiations. We also believe that this can be enhanced in concert with regional forums such as APEC. The gains through the WTO and, regionally, through APEC will be much greater than anything that can be obtained at a merely bilateral level. With the finalisation of the US free trade agreement, it is now imperative that the government recommit its resources and efforts to achieving a successful conclusion to the WTO Doha Round.</para>
<para>It is well known that the government was negligent in its responsibilities in allowing the Cairns Group to fracture and diminish in importance, giving rise to the G20 group of countries. Whilst Labor welcomes the formation of the G20, I ask the minister to recommit his effort as chair of the Cairns Group to ensure it contributes to a successful outcome on agriculture in the Doha negotiations, because a successful outcome on agriculture is essential if the Cairns Group is to remain a relevant, cohesive and functional organisation capable of contributing to future WTO rounds that will inevitably address new, challenging and complex areas in trade policy.</para>
<para>With regard to copyright issues it is apparent that the US knew what it wanted and bargained hard for the extension of Australia’s copyright protection from 50 years to 70 years from the death of the author. The government has admitted that this was its biggest concession to the United States—a big concession with no apparent logic or analysis to support this change in Australian policy. It is a change that, according to a group of eminent economists—including Milton Friedman—will result in a financial return of no more than a few extra cents for copyright owners, whereas the restrictions on the flow of information that will result could deny access to useful material to millions of potential users.</para>
<para>It is important to protect the interests of copyright owners—Labor accepts that—but it is also important to do it in a way to ensure we do have a free flow of information across the Internet as we develop our knowledge economy. So we have to get the right balance between copyright owners, users and facilitators of information, such as ISPs. The government failed in its duties to get the balance right by agreeing to extend the term of copyright by 20 years.</para>
<para>In light of this significant concession, it would have been reasonable to expect Australia to get something significant in return. That is not the case. This bill now poses new problems for Australian copyright interests. Items 11 and 13 of the bill address the copyright obligations of Internet service providers. Unfortunately, the government has not learnt from its previous mistakes with the FTA. Items 11 and 13 appeared without consultation with the Internet industry and came as a complete surprise. Labor was concerned about these new items in their own right. We did not see this, however, as another opportunity to hold up the free trade agreement. Rather, the legitimate concerns of copyright stakeholders had to be addressed.</para>
<para>Following the introduction of this legislation into the Senate on Tuesday last week, I met with the Internet Industry Association of Australia on 2 December to discuss the amendments. Later that afternoon, I raised my concerns directly with Minister Vaile here in the House, and I wrote to him on the same day setting out those concerns in detail. In particular, those concerns go to the potential of these amendments to shift the balance of Australia’s copyright interests. They have introduced some new checks to our copyright laws that could undermine the balance. They have created new areas of uncertainty for ISPs in regard to their potential liability arising from alleged copyright breaches. They also have the potential to remove important protections for ISPs’ customers, denying them the right to prevent their legitimate material from being taken down.</para>
<para>In light of these concerns, on Monday this week Labor referred the bill to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee for examination, to give stakeholders the opportunity to have their say on the bill. While the technicalities of this bill can be debated, it is apparent that the government has committed, with the US, to implementing the bill as is—leaving no scope for amendments to clarify the situation. Officials have advised that the concerns raised by ISPs would be addressed by accompanying regulations. However, those regulations have not been made available to us for examination. The House is once again being put into the position of assessing legislation without seeing the detail of accompanying regulations that will affect the operation and the impact of the legislation. On 7 December, I received a letter from Minister Vaile responding to the concerns I raised in my letter to him. I have checked with the minister and I seek leave to table these two items of correspondence.</para>

<para>—Notwithstanding the inadequacy of the arrangements outlined in his letter, Labor accepts the minister’s assurance that the concerns of ISPs and copyright users arising from these amendments will be resolved through regulations. The minister has made it quite clear that those regulations will flesh out the legislative safe harbour provisions and the rights and obligations of copyright owners, users and ISPs. Labor also takes assurance from the minister’s commitment that:</para>

<para class="block">Labor will keep the government to its commitment to resolve the concerns of ISPs and copyright users in accompanying regulations. ISPs and copyright users must monitor the implementation of this scheme closely and promptly report any problems that arise to the government. In our view, this is not an ideal outcome, but given the minimal time that parliament has had to scrutinise these bills and Australia’s commitments under the FTA—due to commence on 1 January—it is the only way that we can proceed at this point.</para>
<para>The exchange of diplomatic notes between Australia and the US on 18 November was the final step for our two countries to bring the FTA into force on 1 January next year. On 24 November, I wrote to Minister Vaile seeking a copy of those letters to ascertain what the government had committed to. I seek leave to also table a copy of that correspondence.</para>

<para>—I thank the minister and the House. The Australia-US letters were finally released last Friday, 3 December—10 days after they were exchanged. The contents of those letters are very instructive for the references they make to key areas of Australian public policy. The government has made further commitments to the US on key areas of public policy without any consultation with Australian stakeholders. Notwithstanding Labor’s rock-solid legal advice that our amendments to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme are compliant with both the text of the free trade agreement and with our obligations under the World Trade Organisation TRIPS agreement, the US expressed concerns in its letter. Labor’s amendments to protect the PBS were developed on the basis of sound legal advice. It was released publicly. It was fully scrutinised and supported by accompanying legal counsel advice. The government has produced no legal advice to counter it or to contradict it, and neither has the United States.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>As I said earlier, the government supported Labor’s amendments. Therefore, I call on the government to recommit to those amendments and to push back on any US attempts to challenge those amendments in the future. Without any consultation with stakeholders or parliament, the government has committed to review Australia’s domestic policy relating to the criminalisation of all forms of satellite signal piracy. This will include unauthorised distribution or receipt of signals by commercial establishments and within the home, and shall conclude no later than 1 July 2005. Australian law is based on the view that copyright breaches or piracy of pay TV that occurs in the home should be subject to civil, not criminal, penalties. We do not want to be in a position where teenagers can be subject to jail terms for this type of activity. Such a penalty would be excessive. For these reasons, Labor calls on the government to restate its view that Australia has a different approach to the US on the criminalisation of pirated satellite signals in the home, and to give an explanation of its commitment to the US to undertake a review of our penalties in this area. We want to know what it has committed to in this regard.</para>
<para>So you can see there are a lot of issues that we still have concerns about. It is for that reason that Labor is moving a second reading amendment to this bill. It is particularly in the light of the government’s continued failure to get the detail right on the FTA as well as those issues that I have outlined. Accordingly, I move:</para>

I say in conclusion that Labor does support the US free trade agreement now that it has been strengthened by Labor’s amendment. We have our concerns about these other amendments to the copyright legislation but believe the most sensible thing to do in these circumstances is to put our concerns on the record, monitor the outcome and bring to conclusion the implementation of the free trade agreement between us and the United States.</para>

<para>—To endorse the Australia-US free trade agreement is a very sensible position for them to take, even if belatedly. The member opposite interjects that they strengthened it. The amendments which were made by the Australian Labor Party were not in our view necessary; however, because the free trade agreement was so important to Australia we were prepared to wear those amendments as the price of making sure that the very many benefits that will flow through to the Australia economy as a result of the implementation of the free trade agreement from 1 January next year will occur as quickly as possible. The <inline ref="R2210">Copyright Legislation Amendment Bill 2004</inline> will amend the Copyright Act 1968 and the US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act 2004.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The bill has been prepared in response to ongoing concerns of the US government and some industry stakeholders about the implementation of some of the copyright obligations of the Australia-US free trade agreement in the US free trade agreement act. The member for Hotham has moved a second reading amendment, and it will not come as any surprise to him to know that the government is not prepared to accept that. In fact, given the exchange of correspondence which has taken place recently between the minister and the opposition, one wonders why, other than for the reason of cheap political point scoring, the opposition is moving this pious second reading amendment at all.</para>
<para>In his letter to the opposition, the Minister for Trade pointed out that some details, such as when Internet providers are required to block web sites which allegedly breached another person’s copyright, could be clarified by a special regulation. This has secured the opposition’s general support for the final bills that will implement the free trade agreement. I think it is regrettable that the second reading amendment has been moved but it is heartening that the opposition has been prepared to support the bills in the other place and it is good to see that the opposition does not want the bill currently before the House denied a second reading.</para>
<para>With regard to the amendments moved by the member for Hotham in the debate on the second reading, I would like to place a few facts on the parliamentary record. The implementing legislation passed by the parliament in August, prior to the election in which Labor was so comprehensively defeated, was fully consistent with our obligations under the Australia-US free trade agreement. However, the legislation amended the detail of some extremely technical aspects of Australia’s copyright law in particular and, by necessity, did so without exposure drafts and without the benefit of extensive consultation with practitioners.</para>
<para>Once concerns were raised with the government that some technical aspects of the legislation either had unintended consequences for industry or could be more clear about the breadth of activity they were intended to encompass, it would have been an irresponsible government that was not prepared to introduce amending legislation. The minister was prepared to look at what was put to him, and this legislation is a consequence of those consultations. I think that it is always wise to take on board advice given to you, to digest it and to then decide whether the advice is appropriate or not. As a result of that process being followed, we are now debating the Copyright Legislation Amendment Bill 2004.</para>
<para>Another point I would like to make is that this bill will not enable parties other than the copyright owner or an exclusive licensee to force a service provider to take down allegedly infringing material. The safe harbour scheme is voluntary. A service provider is not forced to comply with the conditions in the safe harbour scheme, including items 11 and 13. A service provider can choose not to comply with the conditions in the safe harbour scheme, for example, by ignoring a notice that makes it apparent that material is likely to be infringing but, as a result, the service provider will not enjoy the limitations on remedies available under the scheme.</para>
<para>A service provider that chooses to access the safe harbours is not obliged to take down material that is merely alleged by a party to infringe copyright. This bill provides that a service provider seeking to access the safe harbours need only act if it is apparent that the material is likely to be infringing. The bill recognises that constructive knowledge of infringements can arise through circumstances other than through notice from a copyright owner and that this is a clear Australia-US free trade agreement obligation. It is also consistent with US legislation that safe harbours be contingent on expeditious take-down once a service provider obtains constructive knowledge of infringement.</para>
<para>I pointed out before that the government were of the view that Labor’s amendments were unnecessary. That remains the government’s view. We are not going to resile from that view, but we did not oppose the amendments in order that the bill could pass. The detriment to the Australian economy caused by Labor’s recalcitrance would have been of such great moment that we believe that, on balance, it was better to allow the amendments to pass so that we could get the benefits of the historic Australia-US free trade agreement, which would not have occurred if it had not been for the relationship between our government and the United States government.</para>
<para>The exchange of letters between the Minister for Trade and the US Trade Representative covers a range of implementation issues. Mr Zoellick took the opportunity to restate the US’s position on the Labor Party’s amendments. The US continues to reserve its right to challenge their consistency with our international obligations at some stage. That is the US position. The government’s position is as we have previously set out. It is good that there is a great deal of bipartisanship, shall we say, with regard to the substance of this bill. This bill is a very important element in the implementation of our free trade agreement obligations with the United States and, on that basis, I am particularly pleased to commend this legislation to the chamber.</para>

<para>—I also rise to support the <inline ref="R2210">Copyright Legislation Amendment Bill 2004</inline>. I note and support the comments of my colleague the member for Hotham, our spokesperson on trade. He has covered very thoroughly Labor’s position on the bill, the trade implications and our concerns in the copyright area. I intend to focus primarily on the copyright issues that will obviously have an impact in my portfolio area of Attorney-General.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The government says that this bill makes various minor and clarifying amendments to the Copyright Act. Clearly, Labor does not view that as being the case. The amendments are not minor and are not clarifying. In fact, they are quite detailed and complex and in some areas remain of concern and confusion to the industry. They have important new implications, not so much for copyright owners themselves but for the disseminators of copyright material—in particular, Internet service providers.</para>
<para>As you are aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, Labor did not negotiate the Australia-US free trade agreement but we did support it in parliament last August. We are now back again amending Australia’s copyright laws because the government failed to get the detail right in the initial implementation bill. When Labor amended the bill that was put before the House to protect the PBS, the Prime Minister accused us of trying to knock over the deal. It is now clear that it was not Labor’s amendments that were threatening the deal; rather, it was the government’s failure to correctly legislate to give effect to what it alleges are Australia’s obligations under the free trade agreement.</para>
<para>With regard to copyright issues, it is apparent that the US knew very clearly what it wanted when it entered into these negotiations and bargained hard for changes in the copyright areas—particularly the extension of Australia’s copyright protection from 50 to 70 years from the death of the author. The government have admitted that this was their biggest concession to the US—a big concession with no apparent logic or analysis to support this change in Australia policy. Labor has expressed its view previously that it did not believe we should have extended copyright by a further 20 years.</para>
<para>So in the light of this significant concession which was made as part of the package of the free trade agreement, it would have been reasonable to expect that Australia would have got something in return on copyright. Unfortunately, that was not the case and we see it even more clearly in this bill. The Copyright Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 amends the Copyright Act in response to concerns expressed by the US that the previous legislation had not met our free trade agreement obligations.</para>
<para>The original free trade agreement implementation bill was enacted after the government accepted Labor’s amendments, as I have noted before, to protect the integrity of the PBS and the Australian television local content rules. This bill has now been introduced by the government to correct what it and the US believe were the inadequacies in that original legislation. According to the government, this bill attempts to clarify the responsibilities, particularly of ISPs, in relation to infringing material posted on the Internet.</para>
<para>Labor’s second reading amendment goes to our concerns about the process followed to get the bill to this point and the uncertainty about the practical effect of the bill on significant players in the industry. I intend to structure the rest of my speech on this bill around the terms of Labor’s second reading amendment, moved by the member for Hotham. Labor’s amendment at part (a) notes with concern the failure of the government to previously correctly implement its obligations under the United States Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act. We must say from the outset that it is disappointing that the issue was not effectively resolved in the first bill. These changes which the government now seeks to rush through in the final week of parliament for this year to meet the free trade agreement deadline of 1 January next year have caused considerable concern amongst some stakeholders in the Internet industry, after they had been led to believe that the original legislation in August covered their copyright obligations under the government’s free trade agreement.</para>
<para>Given that the government thought it was necessary to introduce the bill to clean up the perceived inadequacies, we believe there was an obligation on the government to thoroughly and effectively consult with the affected industry players who had had the original copyright regime pulled from underneath them. Unfortunately, we believe that this process has been botched. Strong concerns have been expressed by the Internet Industry Association, Internet service providers individually and the Australian Digital Alliance about both the consultation process and the effect of these proposed changes. These stakeholders believe that, while the government consulted with them on an earlier draft of the legislation, the bill now before the House has added two significant changes: namely, items 11 and 13, which significantly expand the responsibilities of ISPs to monitor and take down material on their sites. In terms of the consultation process, major service providers believe the government should have been more transparent in its intentions and provided greater opportunity for feedback, particularly on these additional terms of the bill. The amendments are not, as I have noted before and as the government claims, minor and technical.</para>
<para>In terms of the substance of the changes, ISPs, the Australian Digital Alliance and indeed the Labor Party are greatly concerned that these amendments will significantly expand the rights to demand the removal of material from the Internet beyond copyright holders and exclusive licensees to others. Part (b) of the second reading amendment which was moved by the member for Hotham deals in some more detail with these concerns in relation to take-down notices. We have concerns that the bill has the potential to enable persons other than copyright owners or exclusive licensees to force an Internet service provider to take down allegedly infringing copyright material from their system. This is no mild worry. The practice of computer-generated mass take-down notices being issued in the US, without any real person making an assessment of the material and potentially with no copyright interest involved, could, if the practice developed here with this new regime in place, put a heavy burden on our ISPs and therefore their customers, presumably through passing on any costs and perhaps with no resulting benefit to copyright owners.</para>
<para>It is also the strong concern of some stakeholders that this bill goes beyond what is required by the free trade agreement in terms of copyright law and, in some people’s view, beyond what is required by ISPs under the existing regime in the United States. I understand that the government disputes these claims. The expansion of the right to demand the taking down of infringing material going beyond copyright holders and exclusive licensees, or the potential for this expansion, has led to significant concerns amongst ISPs which include that access to safe harbour provisions will become unnecessarily onerous and that the process for complying with them is currently ill-defined and potentially unnecessarily difficult to comply with. Although the government says the use of these safe harbour provisions is optional, clearly ISPs want to be able to gain that protection if it is at all practicable. In particular, the insertion of items 11 and 13 into the bill has placed an obligation on the ISPs—or carriage service providers, as they are termed in the bill—to expeditiously take down material if they are: ‘aware of facts or circumstances that make it apparent that the material is likely to be infringing’. ISPs and the Australian Digital Alliance have expressed grave concerns that this threshold test for the requisite knowledge is far too low or at least not adequately defined by the act and would require them to take down a lot of material without much substance being required to the request that has been made. As already mentioned, it also does not require that a direction to take down material comes directly from the copyright owner or exclusive licensees.</para>
<para>Labor is gravely concerned that this practically extends Australia’s copyright laws so that someone other than the copyright owner or the exclusive licensee can require an ISP to take down allegedly infringing material and be forced into taking this action if they are to access the safe harbour provisions. The government has sought to assure the opposition that the relevant clause does not automatically require an ISP to take down material where there is merely an allegation of an infringement; the ISP need only act where there is a likelihood that the material is infringing. This, according to the government, is intended to ensure that the ISP can be held to have constructive knowledge of an infringement without the requirement that the copyright holder or exclusive licensee notify them. But we are also concerned that this could place a very heavy onus on the ISP to make an assessment of the validity of each and every claim that Internet material is infringing each and every time they receive some sort of notification that they are hosting infringing material. That is regardless of whether (a) the actual copyright owner or exclusive licensee has requested the take down of the material or not; and (b) the notification on face value appears frivolous or is from some dubious source. They will still be worried that they need to take action to maintain their protection under the safe harbour provisions.</para>
<para>As these terms are new to Australian copyright law, the ISPs are uncertain about the level of evidence that will meet the likelihood test. Understandably, they remain uncertain about what must be put before them to activate this test and therefore remain uncertain about how to gain protection against liability under the safe harbour provisions. The bill itself is silent on the rights and process for those who are accused of posting infringing material to contest a take-down notice. The government has informed us that these issues will be fleshed out in regulations. The member for Hotham has already expressed concerns that we must of course take this commitment on face value as the regulations in this regard have not been provided to us. Obviously, the government is on notice that we will pursue this commitment and examine closely the terms of the regulations when they are provided to us to ensure that these matters are adequately clarified.</para>
<para>Part (1)(c) of the second reading amendment goes to the range of interests that need to be balanced between copyright owners, users and Internet service providers. As the terms of the amendment note, the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee held a brief hearing on the effect of this bill on Monday night this week. At this hearing, several major stakeholders, including major ISPs, outlined their concerns—many of which I have already expressed—that the balance between the rights of copyright owners, users and the ISP has been disrupted. The reasons for their concerns have already been outlined. In contrast, the parliament should note that other stakeholders, like the Australian Record Industry Association and other copyright owners, are strongly supportive of the amendments in this bill. As also noted earlier, without the guidance of the regulations we feel it is difficult to gain a true and accurate picture of how the copyright regime will operate after this bill comes into force and whether the balance is adequately maintained with the additional protections that will be forthcoming in the regulations.</para>
<para>At the hearing of the committee on Monday, officers of the Attorney-General’s Department could not be drawn on the content of the proposed regulations which will attempt to address this uncertainty and whether they will continue to consult with stakeholders. Once again, the House is being put in the position of assessing legislation of some significant impact without accompanying regulations that will affect the operation and impact of this legislation itself. Labor has no alternative but to accept the assurances received from the Minister for Trade and has no reason to doubt that they will not be kept. It is difficult for truly informed debate within this House to occur without all of the provisions being in front of us. Obviously, as the member for Hotham has also noted, we put strong emphasis on the assurances received from the trade minister that the concerns of ISPs in particular, as well as those of copyright users, will be resolved through the introduction of adequate regulations. The minister has made it quite clear in his correspondence that those regulations will flesh out the legislative safe harbour provisions and the rights and obligations of copyright owners, users and ISPs.</para>
<para>Labor also draws some confidence from the minister’s commitment that:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... the Government will keep implementation of the scheme under close review and, as necessary will consult with stakeholders on any issues that may arise, including appropriate responses.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Labor will hold the government to its commitment to resolve the concerns of ISPs and copyright users in those accompanying regulations. ISPs and copyright users must monitor the implementation of this scheme closely and promptly report any of their problems to the government as they arise. This is not an ideal outcome but—given the minimal time the parliament has to scrutinise these bills, and Australia’s commitments under the FTA—it is the only way that we believe we can proceed at this point.</para>
<para>In parts (1)(e) and (1)(f) of the second reading amendment, we raise issues of concern relating to the consultation process. We recognise that the government, as I have said, has committed to continuing to consult—or, I might say, ensuring that it does consult—widely with the industry to get its regulations right and ensure that those safe harbour provisions are workable for all in the industry. This will necessarily include a continuing review of the regulations to ensure that any inadequacies can be ironed out and that they can be made to operate fairly.</para>
<para>We should put on record that the consultation process—particularly to date with stakeholders like the Internet Industry Association—has not been adequate in terms of the additional provisions that were added in this bill and in terms of providing a proper indication of the government’s intention. It seems that this process has heightened rather than allayed people’s concerns. Perhaps once the whole package is forthcoming those concerns will be shown to have been unnecessarily held. We certainly hope that this process in regard to the regulations will improve in the future, and our amendments make clear that we intend to hold the government to its commitment.</para>
<para>Practical access to the safe harbour provisions is essential to ensure that there is a credible balance between effective action by ISPs to removing infringing material in the interest of copyright owners while at the same time providing fair protection against liability to both copyright owners and web site owners, who may be susceptible to having take-down notices issued against them. Again, adequate consultation with the industry is essential to ensure that these regulations are workable.</para>
<para>Finally, I would like to cover the issue that has also been flagged in part (2) of our second reading amendment, in relation to pay TV piracy, because the bill does make further amendments to the copyright laws and makes clear that piracy of pay TV on a commercial scale is a criminal offence. But there are no sanctions in the bill on private piracy in the home. We do note with some apprehension that there is intended to be a review of Australia’s laws in relation to the criminalisation of piracy of pay TV in the home and that Australia has committed to do that by 1 July next year. Again, we will be watching this process closely. As the member for Hotham also pointed out, Australian law has been based on the view that copyright breaches or piracy of pay TV that occurs in the home should be subject to civil and not criminal penalties. As the member for Hotham has indicated, we do not want to be in a position where teenagers can be subject to jail terms for this type of activity—such a penalty would be excessive. Clearly, this is not an unnecessary concern, given that action has been taken in some other countries against, for example, a 12-year-old—which I think is the latest example reported in the media—for this sort of activity.</para>
<para>Part (2) of our second reading amendment calls on the government to again place on the record its difference of opinion with the US with regard to the criminalisation of pirated satellite signals in the home. It is imperative that the government gives this parliament an explanation of its commitment to the US to undertake this review of our domestic policy relating to the criminalisation of all forms of satellite signal piracy, including the unauthorised distribution or receipt of signals by commercial establishments and within the home. We would like the government to clearly put on record that it does not intend to change its longstanding approach to dealing with these matters in the home in a civil rather than criminal manner. Obviously, we will be talking and working with the government as this review is undertaken and will make sure that our views are clearly known to the government as we have expressed them here today.</para>
<para>In conclusion, it is clear that we are not in an ideal position while we are debating this bill today. It would not have been necessary to even be here and have this debate if the government had done its job properly to start with. There should have been a more comprehensive consultation process to iron out all the practical problems with the proposed changes, particularly for the ISP industry. Finally, the regulations should have been available to us and to stakeholders to assess in order for us to be able to debate the true impact of this bill. Nevertheless, we understand and accept the government’s assurances and will keep an eager eye on future changes to ensure that these commitments are met. I commend the bill and the second reading amendment to the House.</para>

<para>—The government, it seems, is not waiting until July next year to impose its arrogant disregard for process on this place. It seems that that is happening now, with the treatment of legislation in the past few days. I think that the <inline ref="R2210">Copyright Legislation Amendment Bill 2004</inline> tops the list for contempt of proper process. I will just refer to a couple of comments that Senator Ridgeway made on this bill in the Senate—a speech, I must say, that was incorporated into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> because so little time was made available for proper debate. He said in part:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote>
<para class="block">The events of this week do not constitute the Senate doing its job properly.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I would add that they do not constitute this place doing its job either. He continued:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The Government released the text of the Bill only days ago, after what seems like only the most cursory of consultations with Industry. The Minister describes the Bill as making ‘minor and technical’ amendments, a claim that is patently false—</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">according to Senator Ridgeway—</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... Industry was consulted on a version of the Bill that didn’t even include the most controversial provisions.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The Internet Industry Association, the Australian Digital Alliance and the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee have grave concerns about the content of the bill. Also, the Selection of Bills Committee in the Senate held an extraordinary meeting that had to report within 24 hours. That meeting lasted two hours. As I understand it, there was insufficient time for more than one substantial piece of evidence to be taken. All witnesses were asked to provide substantial amounts of further evidence on notice. Yet the bill has gone through the Senate and is back here for this second reading debate.</para>
<para>The government, through its Minister for Trade, agreed in an exchange of letters with US trade representative Robert Zoellick to implement certain changes to the Copyright Act after the US determined that the US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act 2004 did not fully implement certain provisions of the agreement. In no uncertain terms and with the clear threat by the US to take appropriate remedial action should Australia refuse to implement the changes demanded, this government has, true to form, rolled over and complied and so has removed any pretence that Australia had retained any flexibility in formulating its own exceptions to the stated rules. As noted in the <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline>, these letters agreeing to the changes and prescribing how obligations under the agreement will be implemented are now part of the legal interpretation of the agreement itself. Thus the FTA comes into force on 1 January whether this bill is passed or not.</para>
<para>This has effectively obliged Australia to comply with new rules that have received no scrutiny or input from this parliament, and has in fact circumvented the parliament’s ability to choose how best to apply the agreement through law. There is no surprise here, given that the Australian parliament has had no opportunity to debate the terms of the free trade agreement itself but only the enabling legislation—and even then it was an empty debate that was allocated just 24 hours.</para>
<para>So what are the changes to the agreement, achieved through the amendments to the Copyright Act under this current bill—changes that the explanatory memorandum assures us are minor and technical? I want to point to three areas of concern. One area is temporary reproductions. In the current version of the agreement, temporary reproduction of a copyrighted item, such as the temporary copy stored in a DVD player’s memory before transferring a picture to the screen, can be an infringement of copyright unless those copies fall under an exception. One of the listed exceptions prevents the normal playing of digital media, as described above, from being an infringement as long as the reproduction is temporary and a necessary part of a technical process of use, as described above. Thus if the copy of the movie lodges itself somewhere in the dark recesses of memory in your DVD or computer for the longer term, it is an infringement of copyright. An exception to this exception is if the original media is itself an infringing copy.</para>
<para>The bill deals with another exception to the exception. This is where the exception does not apply, where the original copy is from another country and would be an infringing copy if it had been made in Australia. Note that in this case the infringing copy could be a legitimately licensed copy in the country from which it is bought, legitimately bought in that country and then brought to Australia by your unsuspecting consumer. Thus we now have a situation where not only the actual copying and selling of an infringing item is illegal but where simply watching or listening to a DVD that an Australian has legitimately bought in, say, the US, will, as I understand it, be an infringing act.</para>
<para>Under the existing act, such a person is offered protection from criminal prosecution in that ‘profit’ is defined to exclude private or domestic use. An infringement does, however, open up the possibility of civil action. Any protection in the existing Copyright Act is rendered somewhat ambiguous with the new exception to the exception. Thus we now have a situation in which the government is agreeing to severely limit the right of a consumer to do what they want with property they have legally purchased. Here we have Australia agreeing to police, on behalf of the copyright owners, the exclusive right of the copyright owners to determine an Australian individual’s personal use of legitimately purchased works.</para>
<para>There are yet more effects flowing from this seemingly minor amendment—this exception to the exception—that are incredibly counterintuitive to the idea of free trade of a free market. Intuitively it is understood that a healthy market economy depends on different companies being allowed to compete with each other and so driving the market to efficiency. That is a basic law of the market; this is free trade. However, there is a real possibility this bill may constitute an effective ban on parallel importing. Parallel importing is when a copyrighted product is legitimately purchased in one country, where it was legally manufactured under licence from the IP holder, and imported to compete on the Australian market as a generally cheaper product. A clear example was raised by Weiss et al about the Australia-US free trade agreement in their book <inline font-style="italic">How to Kill a Country</inline>. I refer people to the book for their Christmas stockings. It is the importing into Australia of a drug that is produced cheaply under licence in India, rather than from the actual patent owner, who is invariably producing the same drug at triple the cost in the US. Here is where parallel importing, so vital to a healthy market economy, could be rendered a criminal offence according to my reading.</para>
<para>The second point is criminal provisions. Section 10 of the existing copyright legislation states that a non-infringing copy is:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... a non-infringing [article] whose importation does not infringe that copyright.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">So far so good. A non-infringing article is a non-infringing article. Theoretically this allows parallel importation. However, the discussed exception to the exception—as the exception does not apply where the original copy is from another country and would be an infringing copy if it had been made in Australia—begs clarification as to whether this also applies to legally imported goods that are legally manufactured under licence in another country.</para>
<para>This is an incredibly important point because if such imports could be considered infringing copies then their importation would also be considered a criminal act due to the ‘by way of trade’ and ‘obtaining commercial advantage or profit’ provisions of the <inline ref="R2118">US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Bill 2004.</inline> That said, the <inline ref="R2210">Copyright Legislation Amendment Bill 2004</inline> goes another step towards easing the requirement of prosecutors to demonstrate that infringements were performed by way of trade and with the intention of obtaining a commercial advantage or profit, to having to demonstrate only one of these items by way of trade or with the intention of obtaining a commercial advantage or profit.</para>
<para>This brings me back to the temporary copy amendments represented by the bill, copies which theoretically have little or no economic significance to most copyright holders—or do they? Kim Weatherall, Associate Director of the Intellectual Property Research Institute of Australia and Lecturer in Law at Melbourne University, makes it clear that it is about market monopoly and raising barriers to competitors in the marketplace. Consider these points Ms Weatherall raises on her Internet page—points that are recognised internationally as matters of concern. The inclusion of temporary copies into copyright protection laws has enabled copyright owners to try to force video stores to buy more expensive ‘rental’ versions of films despite the absence of an exclusive rental right. This inclusion has been used in litigation by Sony to argue for the current incredibly anticompetitive practice of embedding regional playing codes into DVDs and DVD players to allow them to work only when the same are bundled with the same. My recollection is that this practice got Microsoft in some trouble.</para>
<para>In the US, copyright for temporary copies has been used to corner the market for software troubleshooting services. I question whether the same sort of services provided by the plethora of Australian computer businesses would fall under the commercial advantage provisions that incur criminal penalties under Australian law. In Canada, Ms Weatherall suggests, it has been used as an argument to make ISPs liable for activities of their users.</para>
<para>My third point is on probably the most publicly contentious part of the bill, under which carriage service providers—businesses that supply Internet or telecommunications—may be liable for their customers’ breaches of these copyright laws. When a person uses an internet service provider to transmit or store infringing information, even storing it on the user’s own systems, uses it to host a website or uses the provider’s search engine to visit an online location that breaches copyright, that provider is now liable. In the original bill the service provider was liable for criminal prosecution if the provider received financial benefit and if they were aware of the practice and did not act to stop it. ‘Financial benefit’ did not include usage fees from the offending user, nor did it include increased income from a higher level of use due to lower charges.</para>
<para>This bill replaces actual knowledge of the infringement with having received notification only, which may be spurious, and determines that financial benefit could be something as innocuous as the difference between ‘industry practice in relation to charging for services’ and what the CSP charges. Whose industry, whose practice—what exactly does that particular phrasing mean? It is clear that any service provider who is providing and benefiting from keen competition by offering lower user fees is immediately open to suffering abuse under these provisions. It may be that this government could be complicit in stifling innovation and competitive pricing in an industry that is known for exactly those qualities.</para>
<para>Now CSPs can be liable even if they are not aware or could not reasonably have been aware that infringement is occurring on their network. This is a requirement of the FTA. Australian CSPs, in order to avoid criminal prosecution, must expend their time and energy policing other people’s copyrights. This promises to be a considerable use of resources that has the potential to severely impact on a service provider’s operations and, indeed, viability. In the US, copyright owners and ‘hired guns’ use computers to trawl the internet, automatically issuing ‘take down’ notices to CSPs and threatening legal action. These infringements need not be valid, but they are enough to censor material or seriously disrupt a competitor’s business, with hundreds of thousands of such notices being issued in the US already.</para>
<para>There exists in our legislation no procedural fairness to protect service providers so targeted. The minister may say that it is all going to be covered under regulations, so I will be interested to see what they are and why indeed they have not been available. There is no process required to determine whether there is in fact a copyright infringement before the material must be removed, and there is no protection for CSPs, who are between the devil and the deep blue sea. They face potential liability as regards their customers if they remove material that is not infringing copyright, or they face liability as regards the copyright owners if the material does infringe copyright, which itself is a far wider net than ever before.</para>
<para>I have said before that the Australia-US free trade agreement is antithetic to free trade and market competition. It subjugates Australia’s sovereignty in favour of protecting aggressive and monopolistic markets and, in this case, potentially diminishes competition in the huge global IT market and the rights of Australian consumers to choose. None of these issues have been on the public agenda enough. I have just got my head around the consequences. They need much further debate and exposure, as indeed does the US FTA, but there is no time for that. Under the current circumstances I certainly cannot support this bill, and I invite the minister to respond to my concerns.</para>

<para>—I thank the members for Hotham, Fisher, Gellibrand and Calare for their contribution in this debate. The <inline ref="R2210">Copyright Legislation Amendment Bill 2004</inline> is an important step in the process that will lead to the commencement of the Australia-United States free trade agreement on 1 January next year. I would like to remind the House about the signing of the agreement that has been struck with the largest and most dynamic economy in the world. It is a historic achievement that this government is proud of, as should be the whole Australian community, for the overall benefits it will bring to the country. This debate is about a specific section of the agreement: matters relating to copyright. I note that the member for Calare is inviting a wider debate, but I do not intend to take that up.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The copyright provisions in the US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act 2004 passed by the parliament in August were fully consistent with our obligations. I also remind the House that those copyright provisions were extensive and covered a number of important areas of reform. It is not surprising that some finetuning and clarification has been required in some areas in the bill that is before us today. I repeat that the amendments are mostly minor and technical in nature and involve no changes to the agreement or major policy changes to the Copyright Act. It would have been irresponsible for the government not to clarify the practical operation of certain provisions once industry concerns were raised.</para>
<para>The member for Hotham has today raised some matters arising from the Minister for Trade’s letter to him addressing concerns in relation to Internet service providers. I do not propose to address these issues in detail, but I should make a couple of observations. First, the concerns that the ISPs have about the conditions in items 11 and 13 of the bill, in relation to automatic bot notices, need to be put in context. The safe harbour scheme is not compulsory. The ISPs can choose to not comply with the conditions in items 11 and 13 of the bill and to not respond to take-down notices. This means that carrier service providers do not take advantage of safe harbour provisions, which reduces the remedies available to them, and their liability is determined under existing law.</para>
<para>Second, many of the ISP concerns relate to matters that are probably being dealt with in the regulations which are currently being prepared. I met with representatives of the ISPs and gave them my assurance that we would consult with them on the regulations. I want to emphasise the Minister for Trade’s commitment that the government will keep implementation of the scheme under close review and, as necessary, consult with stakeholders should any matters arise.</para>
<para>One final matter raised by the member for Hotham concerned the pay-TV piracy review. Australia does have a different approach to issues of criminalisation of conduct in the home in relation to unauthorised satellite signals. It is our view that the trade agreement did not require criminalisation of activity of this type. However, domestic stakeholders have raised the issue with the government. For this reason, the government have undertaken to conduct a comprehensive review of the law. The review is appropriate—no decision has been made on this issue—and it will commence in early 2005 and hopefully be completed by July.</para>
<para>The opposition has proposed an amendment. The amendment will not be supported by the government. Some aspects of it are unexceptional, but there are other comments in it that we find unacceptable and for that reason we oppose it in totality.</para>
<para>The government believes that the amendments in this bill will continue the ongoing improvement of Australia’s copyright laws. The amendments will ensure that Australia’s reputation for having legislation providing for strong copyright protection is maintained. It will ensure our legislation remains comparable to the standards of our major trading partners. Both copyright owners and users will benefit from the changes that clarify the practical effect of the amendments made to the US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act 2004.</para>
<para>The government will always aim to achieve copyright legislation that strikes an appropriate balance between the rights of owners and the rights of users. I remind those who continue to harbour doubts about the provisions of the bill or who believe that copyright law reform will cease that further reviews of copyright legislation in a number of important areas are planned in the near future. I again thank all those members who have contributed to the debate and thank the House for its support for the bill. Hopefully we can wind it up quickly.</para>

<para class="block">The fight against the illicit drug trade in Australia and internationally remains a high priority for the Australian government, consistent with the government’s Tough on Drugs strategy. The offences of importing and exporting illicit drugs across Australia’s national border are some of the most serious federal offences.</para>
<para>In relation to drugs such as heroin, judges have the capacity to impose sentences of up to 25 years imprisonment where the offence involves a trafficable quantity of the drug and up to life imprisonment where the offence involves a commercial quantity. Consequently, sentences of life imprisonment have been handed down. To date, the option of life imprisonment has not been available in relation to certain other illicit drugs, such as amphetamines, because the Customs Act has not prescribed ‘commercial quantities’ for those drugs.</para>
<para>I understand in a recent case involving the importation of 200 kilograms of methylamphetamine, known as ‘ice’, the judge suggested that, if there was a commercial quantity listed, he would have been able to consider imposing a life imprisonment penalty. In that case, the maximum penalty that could be imposed was the penalty for the lower threshold ‘trafficable quantity’, being 25 years imprisonment. Prior to the judge’s comments, the Attorney-General’s Department sought to address this issue by preparing regulations but have concluded that this could not be done because the drugs in question are already listed in the act.</para>
<para>This <inline ref="R2251">bill</inline> will prescribe commercial quantities for all illicit drugs currently covered by the drug importation offences in the Customs Act and therefore ensure that judges have the full spectrum of penalties available to them when sentencing those found guilty of importing large quantities of any illicit drug, including new and emerging drugs.</para>
<para>The Australian government is committed to a proactive approach to ensure that judges will always have the capacity to make the penalty for drug offences reflect the seriousness of the crime.</para>
<para>Next year the government will be bringing forward further improvements, including new serious drug offences for inclusion in the Criminal Code. In the meantime, it is essential that this anomaly in relation to sentences be addressed. I therefore commend the bill for speedy passage, and present the explanatory memorandum.</para>

</talker>
<para>—I rise to speak on and support the <inline ref="R2251">Customs Amendment Bill 2004</inline> and the message from the Senate. This is an important piece of legislation that seeks to enhance sentencing options available to judges in cases where individuals are caught smuggling commercial quantities of dangerous drugs as defined under schedule VI of the Customs Act 1901. For the benefit of members, schedule VI of the act proscribes a list of 130 narcotic substances, each with a specified amount known as a trafficable quantity—that is, a quantity associated with low-level drug dealing. This means that anyone in possession of a trafficable quantity can be charged under provisions that prevent that level of drug dealing. However, as the schedule currently stands, only 21 of these substances specify an amount known as a commercial quantity—that is, a quantity associated with high-level drug dealing. The reason why the other 109 substances did not have commercial quantities specified at the time is simply that, to the best of everyone’s knowledge, they were not being imported in commercial quantities, nor was this foreseen by legislators in introducing the original act.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The intention of differentiating between trafficable and commercial quantities is a good idea, and I am certainly pleased that Labor can contribute to tightening up the provisions regarding the other 109 substances listed in schedule VI. By defining a commercial quantity for these substances, this bill adds a sentencing option for judges that includes life imprisonment. The maximum current penalty available for illegal importation of these substances is 25 years, because that is the maximum penalty for importation of trafficable quantities. By spelling out the commercial quantities as we do in this bill, we allow for judges to impose a more severe sentence for people who seek to import dangerous substances into our country.</para>
<para>Labor are concerned about the importation of illegal drugs into this country and we fully support the excellent work of the Australian Customs Service and the Australian Federal Police in their recent successes against drug importers. The amount of MDMA, also known as ecstasy, that has been detected by Customs has almost doubled over the last two years. That is excellent work, but by no means has this put a stop to the availability of this drug in the community, as recent reports in the media show. From figures from the Parliamentary Library and the Customs Service it is clear that more ecstasy is being imported into Australia. As recently as 1993 there were few seizures of ecstasy at the customs barrier. In 1994, 2.9 kilograms were seized. However, just in the period from January to August 1996, 29.9 kilograms were seized. Astoundingly, in 2003-04 that figure was 873 kilograms, so there has been a frightening increase.</para>
<para>There is also evidence to suggest that Australia could again be the target of drug lords who wish to import heroin. Members may be interested to know that, since the removal of the Taliban in Afghanistan, opium poppies have returned to the fields as an acceptable cash crop for farmers. The effect of more heroin coming onto the market may well make Australia an increased target for heroin imports over the coming few years. Labor will be monitoring this situation closely and will be holding the government to account for any increased availability of this most insidious drug.</para>
<para>Members, there are a number of steps that Labor has taken to satisfy itself that this bill will not have an unjust effect. Firstly, this bill will not be retrospective. Secondly, I have checked the bill and it does not make any attempt to modify or vary the existing commercial quantities specified for 21 schedule VI drugs. Further, and finally, Labor has successfully amended the bill in the Senate to include a 12-month sunset clause that will enable all members and senators to review and scrutinise the effectiveness of these measures before more substantial changes are made.</para>
<para>I remind members of the House that the bill is providing an additional option to judges but is not inserting any mandatory provisions. To that extent, the bill is a stopgap measure, but it is a measure Labor have considered carefully and amended to ensure the safeguard of a sunset clause. We recognise, in light of recent court decisions referred to by the Attorney in his second reading speech, that there is a valid reason for this measure. In short, this bill will have the effect of making additional penalties available to the courts in the very serious area of illicit drug importation in commercial quantities. That is a worthy goal. Labor are happy to support that goal and therefore commend the bill to the House.</para>

<para>—I rise to speak in the second reading debate on the <inline ref="R2218">Private Health Insurance Incentives Amendment Bill 2004.</inline> The bill amends the Private Health Insurance Incentives Act 1998 and also the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. It implements the coalition’s election commitment to increase the private health insurance rebate from 30 per cent to 35 per cent for people aged 65 to 69 years and to 40 per cent for people aged 70 years and above. The Prime Minister made this commitment on behalf of the coalition on 22 August 2004. These additional rebates are available on both hospital cover and ancillary cover. The higher rebates will apply to individuals who meet the age threshold and to couples and families where one or more of the persons meets the age threshold. The bill makes provision for what should happen in the event of the death of the older family member or divorce or separation.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Like the existing 30 per cent rebate, the higher rebates will be available to be claimed as premium reductions through the private health funds, a direct payout from Medicare offices or a tax offset in annual income tax returns. The government claims that the cost of this provision will mean that premiums will be reduced by $100 to $200 a year over the existing cost for a couple or a family meeting the age threshold. The bill also contains an amendment that will ensure that people with a veterans gold card are not affected by the application of Lifetime Health Cover. This aspect of the bill is to take effect on 1 April 2005.</para>
<para>As we well know, the Howard government has had a great deal of difficulty keeping its promises when it comes to private health insurance. This is a government that promised that its policies would put downward pressure on premiums. Indeed, in the 2001 election the Prime Minister actually said that there would be downward pressure on premiums and that private health insurance would have to be more affordable and attractive to consumers. Back then he said that his government’s policies would ‘lead to reduced premiums’—and those are his words, not mine.</para>
<para>The truth is that, despite a suite of policies supporting private health insurance, the 30 per cent rebate and lifetime cover, private health insurance premiums have continued to rise. Indeed, in the last three years, private health insurance premiums have risen by an average of 22 per cent. We must remember that, when we are talking about averages, by definition many Australian families and pensioners are facing price increases that are much larger than that. Earlier this year, the Minister for Health and Ageing did not even have the courage to make the announcement of price increases himself. He obviously knew that he would be severely criticised for once again going out and doing media showing that the Howard government was breaching commitments that it had made to the Australian people.</para>
<para>We need to remember that this is the health minister who, on the very day when applications for premium rises were submitted to him—the applications that he is supposed to scrutinise and only tick if every cent claimed in the premium increases can be justified—basically shrugged his shoulders and said, ‘C’est la vie—such as life—prices go up and the price of private health insurance will continue to go up.’ It is against a background of broken promises in the area of private health insurance that the government made this new commitment and introduced this bill. Of course, we have to worry about what will happen with the price of private health insurance over the medium to long term.</para>
<para>Clearly the additional rebate for older Australians in the short term will provide an extra government subsidy to the cost of private health insurance for them and will bring the cost down, but we need to remember that prices will continue to go up. The track record of this government has been that, if the private health insurers ask them for a premium increase, they basically shrug their shoulders and say yes. When they shrug their shoulders and say yes, it is only a matter of time before the dollar advantage gained by older Australians out of this current bill is overwhelmed by the dollar disadvantage caused to them by the price of private health insurance continuing to go up. So someone over the age of 65 or 70 with private health insurance today who says, ‘That’s going to make my private health insurance cheaper and I won’t be paying as much in the short term,’ needs to remember that in dollar terms over the longer term they will inevitably be paying more as the Howard government continues to tick off private health insurance increases without adequate scrutiny or rigour. We know that will be the future of private health insurance.</para>
<para>I will now talk about what the bill does in the short term. We know that there are about one million Australians over the age of 65 with private health insurance. Of those, about 350,000 are aged 65 to 69. We know that the percentage of older Australians with health cover is less than the national average, which is currently at 43 per cent, and declines with increasing age. I think it is very important to note that, because the benefit of this bill in bringing down the cost of private health insurance for older Australians in the short term—though, of course, in dollar terms over the longer term they will end up worse off than they are now—by definition, is only assisting older Australians with private health insurance. And, given that the private health insurance of older Australians is actually at a lesser percentage than the national average, the vast majority of older Australians rely on the public system for their health needs. If they need something done—if they need a hip replacement or cataract surgery—they will be relying on the public system. There is, of course, absolutely nothing in this bill for them.</para>
<para>As we well know, with older Australians being the greatest users of our health system, many older Australians who are privately insured still need a strong and vibrant public system when they face ill health. The reality for an older Australian who faces a health emergency is that it is far more likely than not that they will be reliant at the end of the day on a public hospital emergency department for their initial treatment, and they may well end up being reliant on a public hospital bed for their ongoing treatment. This bill, aimed as it is at people with private health insurance, does not provide an answer for the vast majority of older Australians who rely on the public system and it does not provide an answer for the privately insured older Australians who are still reliant on the public system for either emergency treatment or some of the more complex procedures that are still only done in the public system.</para>
<para>Disturbingly, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you may be aware, evidence has been reported in newspapers that privately insured older Australians have actually been turned away by private hospitals, despite their insurance. They have been told to go and rely on the public system because of the complex and complicated nature of their condition, meaning that they are going to be a long-term stayer in a hospital bed and so they are not seen to be a profitable case that the private system is prepared to deal with. So despite having private health insurance they end up being turned away and they become reliant on the public system. These things have been a matter of public record and have actually caused some of the most senior doctors who deal with the needs of older Australians to talk about what bad value for money private health insurance can be for some older Australians, because when they need treatment they do not actually get to rely on the private cover that they have purchased with their very precious dollars. We need to remember, of course, that so many older Australians are on strictly limited incomes.</para>
<para>What will be the effect of this bill in the private health insurance market? There we run into the world’s greatest mystery—we run into a debate that the government cannot resolve, even amongst its own ranks. In the ordinary course of events you would figure that, if in the short term these additional rebates bring down the price of private health insurance for older Australians, there may be some older Australians who choose to join private health insurance funds for the first time. In making that determination we need to say that there are of course some policy complexities here because of the penalty arrangements coming out of the lifetime ratings cover arrangement. We have an arrangement now where if you get into private health insurance in your later years you pay a premium for joining private health insurance late rather than joining it when you were young. That is the effect of the government’s lifetime ratings policy. So there is an intersection point between the lifetime ratings policy and this rebate reduction, which means that there is truly only less expenditure in the short term for people who choose to join private health insurance if they fall in the age category above 70 and are on the 40 per cent rebate that is dealt with in this bill. You would figure that if private health insurance, at least in the short term, has been made less costly in dollar terms it would induce some more older Australians to get private health insurance. The very fundamental point as to whether these rebate increases for older Australians are going to encourage any more older Australians to take out private health insurance is a point that the government simply cannot agree on amongst themselves.</para>
<para>Mr Deputy Speaker, let me take you to two completely contradictory statements. The Minister for Health and Ageing, Tony Abbott, stated that the rebate increase for older Australians would mean that more older Australians would take out private health insurance. His direct quote on radio 3AW in an interview with Neil Mitchell on 23 August 2004 was:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">But we think there will be a modest increase in the total number of people with private health insurance as a result of this.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Obviously Minister Abbott was not listening to his Prime Minister, an unusual event for Minister Abbott, because his Prime Minister, on the day before at a press conference, had made the statement that this new scheme of arrangements was:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">.... an additional reward for older Australians who really value their private health insurance to keep that health insurance, and it will be a valuable additional incentive for them to do so.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">We have two completely contradictory statements: we have the Prime Minister saying that this additional private health insurance rebate for older Australians is basically a bit of a reward for older Australians who have private health insurance, not that it is going to encourage anyone new to join private health insurance, and the very next day we had Tony Abbott—clearly unaware of what the Prime Minister had said, or maybe for the first time in known history he was sustaining a different view from the Prime Minister—on radio saying, ‘No, this will induce more older Australians to join private health insurance.’</para>
<para>To have government ministers at odds with each other, making contradictory statements, is hardly a new event in this place. Anybody who has been watching question time over the last few days would well and truly know that happens as a matter of routine. But this is a very significant contradiction and it has a great deal of implication for private health insurance holding generally and for the cost of private health insurance premiums for every Australian. If I can just explain that: what we know from all of the published data is that older Australians take out more from the private health insurance system than they put into it by way of contributions. As a result of our community ratings system, older Australians are paying the same private health insurance premiums as younger Australians. Younger Australians are physically healthier on average and consequently they use the health care system less. The amount they take from the private health insurance pool is less than their contributions, so younger Australians are net contributors to private health insurance. Older Australians are net takers from the private health insurance pool—that is, the amount that they pay in their premiums is less than the amount they draw down on the private health insurance pool because of their disproportionate use of the health care system. The import of that is that the more older Australians we have in private health insurance being net takers out of the private health insurance pool, the higher the cross subsidy from younger Australians.</para>
<para>If Minister Abbott is right and the effect of this private health insurance rebate change is to induce more older Australians to take out private health insurance, then that necessarily means that the premiums of younger Australians will go up to support that additional burden on the private health insurance system. So we need to know whether Minister Abbott is right, because it has implications for every family in Australia who holds private health insurance. Every family in Australia has the right to know whether this policy measure will cause more older Australians to join private health insurance and, given they are net takers from the system, consequently cause premiums to go up for everyone. You would have thought that a government that was contemplating a measure like this—a measure that would be putting an additional impost in the form of increased premiums on all Australians who had private health insurance—would have produced economic modelling about this point which was absolutely robust and which could show us what premium increase is being contemplated. It is not rocket science. All you need to do from the data is work out the sensitivity of the demand for private health insurance to price and then work out from that data what will be the result for this group of Australians in the dollar expenditure on private health insurance being less in the short term. It is exactly the same as saying, ‘If you put the price of apples down, you are probably going to sell more apples,’ and an economist can come along and tell you how many more apples you should expect to sell as the price falls. An economist would be able to draw up a model which says, ‘If apples are $1 each, then you will sell so many of them; if apples are 1c each, then you will sell so many more of them’—they would be able to quantify the number.</para>
<para>That is all we are asking the government to do with this bill. We are asking it to draw up that kind of economic model—just a straight demand and supply curve—and to work out the elasticities. We are asking it to do that with this bill and to tell us its best robust assumption about how many older Australians will join private health insurance as a result of these new rebate arrangements and the consequences of that for the premiums of all Australians. It is a very straightforward inquiry, but, as on many other occasions, when you make a straightforward inquiry of the Howard government the last thing you ever get is a straightforward answer. It is because we have received no straightforward answer that it is the intention of the Labor Party, whilst allowing passage of the bill in this place, to ensure that that information is put before the public by sending this bill to a Senate legislation committee. We think that Australians who have private health insurance are entitled to know the premium consequences of this bill for them. That cannot be too hard an ask. It has apparently been too hard an ask to date. We have not had that information supplied to us, we have not seen that information supplied to the Australian people and we require it to be supplied.</para>
<para>There has been an assertion made by the government that the legislation will result in a one per cent increase in the private health insurance uptake. The assertion is that that translates into around 10,000 people or families and, further, that that has a negligible consequence for premiums. Perhaps that is right. But if it is, then it ought to be possible for the Howard government to produce the economic modelling that proves it is right. It has not been produced, and we require it to be produced. That will be the purpose of this bill going to a Senate legislation committee.</para>
<para>On the question of economic modelling, there is another issue about this bill which concerns me. I have raised this before in earlier debates about the Howard government’s policies on older Australians. Day after day in this House, we have Treasurer Costello wandering around talking about his much vaunted <inline font-style="italic">Intergenerational Report</inline>, talking about the consequences of ageing for Australian society and for policy settings of government and talking about what we may or may not need to do as a society to deal with the consequences of ageing to ensure that we have sustainable government policies. The Productivity Commission very recently produced a report which talks about the likely rise in the percentage of GDP that the government spends on health, modelled over 40 years. They say that, under current policy settings, government expenditure on health is about six per cent of GDP and that will rise to 10.8 per cent of GDP by 2044-45.</para>
<para>Treasurer Costello points to these statistics and says that as a society we have got to be very careful about what it is we do to deal with the consequences of ageing and the intergenerational consequences of any policies that we adopt. I agree with Treasurer Costello that we should be looking at intergenerational modelling and modelling, over 40 years, of changes to health policy. Unfortunately, that has not been done here. Here is another change to—and expenditure on—the health-care needs of older Australians, who we know to be a growing class of Australians. The Treasurer makes it his business, day in and day out, to talk about the intergenerational consequences of policies, yet here is the Howard government committed to a new expenditure for older Australians and it has done no intergenerational modelling of the cost. My simple question is one that ought to be answered by a government purportedly concerned about these things: what does the 40-year modelling show about the expenditure on this measure, given we know that the class of Australians to which it applies will increase over time? That is not a hard question for an economist to answer. There would be people in the department and beyond that could whip up an answer to that pretty quickly. They could do it over a 40-year cycle and tell us what the cost of this will be to the Australian community in 2044-45, what percentage of GDP will be devoted to this policy by 2044-45, what percentage increase is predicted on expenditure of this policy over that 40-year cycle and whether this policy is sustainable in view of that.</para>
<para>The Howard government cannot have it all ways. You cannot send Treasurer Costello in here to say, ‘Intergenerational equity and intergenerational modelling are diabolical. We have got to deal with the consequence of ageing and, because of that, we have got to hike up the price of prescription medicines by 30 per cent.’ You cannot have the Treasurer say that one day and then have the Prime Minister and the minister for health announce something on another day, without paying any regard to those intergenerational consequences. If it is good enough for the Treasurer to say, ‘Let’s hike up the cost of prescription medicines by 30 per cent because of intergenerational equity issues,’ then it should be good enough for the Howard government to produce the 40-year modelling of this policy setting. We have not seen it, and we will be pressing the government for it.</para>
<para>There has been some strong expert criticism of these policy measures because of the sustainability issues for private health insurance. One of the strongest economic proponents of the government’s 30 per cent private health insurance rebate is Professor Ian Harper, who produced the economic work on which the government relies most frequently to prove, in its view, that the private health insurance rebate at 30 per cent is an effective policy. Professor Ian Harper is the expert of choice for the Howard government when it comes to the proposition that the economic modelling supports the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate. Given that, it is fairly important to look at what he says about this policy measure. In the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> on 5 February 2004 he said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">You could feasibly ask the question: ‘what about a bigger rebate for under-30s?</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">When the Howard government made their election announcement, Professor Harper said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">If I were John Howard, I would have increased the rebate for younger people ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That was reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> on 28 August 2004. Here is the government’s expert of choice suggesting that this is a flawed policy measure, and that the best thing to do for the long-term sustainability of private health insurance is put in additional rebate arrangements for young Australians, obviously with the aim of getting more of them into private health insurance. As I said before, they are net contributors to, not net takers from, the system.</para>
<para>I think some of the questions that the Howard government should answer are: whether or not it has looked at that suggestion from Professor Ian Harper; whether it has modelled the consequences of that suggestion for the sustainability of private health insurance; and why, when the government is electing to make this expenditure, it has chosen to make it on private health insurance rebates for older Australians instead of on private health insurance rebates for younger Australians. If it were going to devote the money that is to be spent in this bill to the purpose of supporting additional private health insurance rebates, why wouldn’t it do that at the younger end of the population spectrum rather than at the older end? We have not had an answer to that.</para>
<para>Finally, on the question of modelling, we have not had a clear answer—and we believe that we deserve one and certainly the Australian people deserve one—to what the presumed increase is year-on-year that private health insurance premiums are going to have. Obviously if you say, ‘We’re increasing the rebate,’ you have to make an assumption each year as to how much premiums are going to increase and therefore how much your rebate expenditure is going to increase, because it is a percentage. So the department has made such an assumption but it is not broken down in the figures. There is all this mumbo-jumbo about why it is or is not broken down, but we think we are entitled to know what the Howard government are expecting the future of private health insurance to be and what they believe premium increases are likely to be.</para>
<para>On that point, the best information we have had is the information from the department of finance when it costed Medicare Gold. Inherent in the assumptions of the department of finance was that it was expecting an escalation in private health insurance premiums of 14 per cent each year. Some experts who have looked at these figures for us suggest that modelled into these figures is an expectation that private health insurance premiums are going to go up by 15 per cent each year. If that is the case, if the government are expecting private health insurance premiums to go up by such extraordinary amounts—14 per cent or 15 per cent—then we believe that they should be honest about it. As I have said, it is not our intention to hold up passage of this bill in this place but we will be pressing for these details when the Senate committee meets. I move:</para>

<para>—Might I say that I have just heard quite an amazing speech from the member for Lalor in which she has put a case for risk rating in the health insurance area. In other words, presumably by government subsidy in this case, she has put a case for the removal of community rating. To be honest, I personally hope that she does have her Senate inquiry, because I can give her all the figures she says do not exist. She is so interested in the figures that when you start to tell her how the system would work under private insurance she runs out of the chamber. She is demanding that people need to know; she is demanding that all the detail be put on the table. I am going to take up her invitation and give her some round figures now. I look forward to the inquiry when I will go and demonstrate how it will work—as we did in 1988 when it was tested for accuracy by actuaries and leading economic people, who were used by the Labor Party in the last election. This is just the point. I have said of the member previously that she appears arithmetically challenged and she carries on with the fact that there is no cost if you put people back in the public system.</para>

<para>—I was referring, in terms of arithmetic, to the arguments put by the member for Lalor when talking about the cost of private health insurance. She would like to know the exact cost of these rebates, which I support fully. By the way, I must declare an interest: I will be a beneficiary. But the fact of life is that there seems to be an assumption that the more people you move into the public system the less money it costs. Of course, that is not supported by budgets that have been written since this occurred. It is a fact that everybody who takes out private insurance, even under the maximum rebate proposed in this legislation, will still contribute out of their own pocket 60 per cent of the cost of their medical treatment. If you shift people over to the public system on certain occasions when the private hospitals cannot provide the service, the appropriate health fund continues to pay the public hospital. Public hospitals are out there every day looking for privately insured patients to help with their underresourced budgets. Of course, public hospitals are typically funded on the basis of a block budget, which makes every patient a liability to the financial managers. When one gets into private health insurance, the hospitals concerned get paid by the private health company for the service rendered. If the number of patients doubles, they get double the money and have the capacity to double the infrastructure and services, and that is the real problem with Medicare.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The member for Lalor has just put forward a powerful case suggesting that maybe there should be a rebate for younger persons for a policy of risk rating. In 1988, a policy that I prepared did just that. I put to the House an interesting situation which nobody would contemplate—that is, a government deciding to tell the Australian people that everybody who earned less than, say, $20,000 did not have to insure their home anymore and that the government would pay for it if it burnt down. Just stop and think about what would happen to the premium costs of all those who earned more than $20,000 if that great block of premiums were taken out of the system. Nobody in their right mind would contemplate that. The fundamental principle of insurance is to maximise the number of policyholders to minimise the premium by spreading the payout for the loss of a home, for instance, across so many people. Of course, your home burning down is a highly unpredictable event.</para>
<para>The member for Lalor just reminded us that older people put the greatest burden on the health system. We know that, and I trust we all have the compassion to accommodate their needs. When one risk rates the community based on the principle that everybody is in private health insurance and cannot forum shop as they do today, one sees that young people think (1) I am paying a Medicare levy and the government therefore owes me something and (2) I am virtually indestructible. Young people can accept with some confidence that Medicare will look after them if they get hit by a bus or have a premature heart attack, but if at a younger age they suffer a worn-out hip or a sporting injury—which young people do—that will be considered elective surgery and either they will pay for it out of their pocket or, as quite often happens, their football club will pay for it. They will be treated like everybody else—as a liability to the budget of a public hospital—and they will wait their turn.</para>
<para>I want to consider some relativities about what each age profile in the community takes out of the health system. I will quote the figures from 1988 that we put together with the aid of leading actuaries on exactly that principle. As I said, the figures were not questioned at the time. We found that, when everybody under 18—children, if you like—was put in one category, the premium required to support them was about $6.50 each per week. These figures can only be relative today. When we looked at the group of people between the ages of 18 and 60, the cost was somewhere around just under $10 each per week. When we looked at those above the age of 60, the cost was $26 each per week.</para>
<para>This legislation takes us one step closer to what was proposed at the time. The interesting thing about those figures is that, if everybody was put into private insurance at that point in time and the government chose to pay 100 per cent of the premium costs for every kid in the country—a very generous move, I imagine, considering the wealth of some parents—as well as for every aged pensioner and if the government provided, as we later did, a budget commitment of 80 per cent of the $26 premium for every person of pensionable age and addressed the issues of the unemployed and the middle-aged, the cost of all those subsidies, targeted as they were, would have been $4.3 billion. The cost of Medicare in that year was $7.3 billion. So, considering that the Medicare levy was just over $2 billion, you could have refunded that levy to all Australians, had some money in the bank as a government and had everybody privately insured with no waiting lists. I checked it out with every hospital in my electorate. They are small hospitals, and each and every one of them would have been better off financially under an arrangement of being paid per service rather than by being paid as they were by the state government with a block grant.</para>
<para>We would have provided a service, we would have maximised the benefits of putting all the money into private health insurance, we would have targeted people, and no Australian would have paid more than $10 a week for full access to doctors and hospitals at any one time. If the member for Lalor is so interested—and I do not think she has put up a bad argument—in the amount that people are charged for their private health insurance, she should get real about private health insurance. The minute you run parallel systems and all the good risks take the system they think costs nothing, you immediately end up with the outcome we have that she explained. She said—shock, horror!—‘Old people take more out of private health insurance than they put into it.’ Of course they do! And people who live in a forest tend to have their houses burnt down more often but they pay a risk rating for that purpose and nobody complains about it. These are the realities. The same applies with a car and other things. That is how commercial insurance operates.</para>
<para>As I said in the beginning of my speech, the situation with any other form of insurance where you encourage certain people not to insure is that the cost to others goes up. This legislation is designed to go further in a universal way—and I must question that approach—than one proposed years ago. I think I am with the member for Lalor: I would like to see everybody in private insurance. We cannot do British National Health. The Australian Constitution forbids the conscription of doctors. You cannot ring them all up one day and say, ‘As of tomorrow, whether you like it or not, you are on the government payroll.’ We can never have British National Health, but we have a group of people who think that only a public entity can deliver a service. That is the real issue. This is the philosophical issue which my side of politics supports. They think there are votes in it.</para>
<para>I think there would be votes in it if everybody knew that they had a genuine equal right to hospital services and that those services would be available to them if they were all privately insured. I have quoted the figures in this regard. I would like to think that this committee being proposed by the member for Lalor might try to update them and be honest about the situation. The commercial and arithmetic fact is that running a government health insurance system and a private health insurance system in parallel will always create distortions. Because of a constitutional requirement, Australia has only one choice to sort out that problem. I know it is not going to happen. I hear my minister every day tell us what a wonderful scheme we have, yet people are still on waiting lists. What would happen if we were to change sides in this House? In Western Australia, we saw what the Gallup government tried to do pre the last election in relation to the health system. They were going to fix it. They promised. But what we now have is a situation where ambulances go around the Perth metropolitan area every day to try to find somewhere to put patients. That is all that they achieved: nothing. As I said, when you have a public system where you are not paid for each patient, you have to be terribly careful as a financial administrator about how many patients you let through the front door. That is the downside of the system.</para>
<para>More people would take on private insurance if it were risk rated. I have given the House an indication of figures provided to me by actuaries at that time as to what that risk rating would be. Furthermore, it is appropriate for the government to say that everybody in need gets a subsidy. What is also rather interesting is that, instead of having a huge bureaucracy, sending money back and forth, approving applications and all that, you could provide that subsidy, for instance, to an aged pensioner—on evidence of having private health cover—simply by increasing their pension. You just have to reprogram the computer. We have a variety of ways of funding children, and you might add to those. In other words, if you subsidise people on their purchase of private health insurance, you need have no special administrative body at all. That is a clear cost saving.</para>
<para>Because I know other members want to speak, I make this point: if you want to start arguing the cost of private health insurance, as the member for Lalor has, if you want to investigate it, investigate it on the basis also of it being the sole provider. State governments can then make up their minds whether they want to be in the business of funding hospitals. They might choose to sell them and we could get a proper competitive market-oriented system. But you cannot have both if you want to give a good service and do it at a fair cost to the individual. I have quoted those figures in that regard. I am looking forward to a letter from the member for Lalor asking me to come along and give the committee the benefit of research that was properly conducted which goes back to 1988, which I still have in my possession.</para>

<para>—I start by acknowledging that the previous speaker has very strongly-held beliefs in relation to Medicare and takes quite an anti-Medicare position. I would like to remind him of some of the problems that existed before Medicare was in place. The main problem was the fact that many people who went through the health system were unable to pay for their treatment. They were unable to afford to take out insurance, and when they failed to pay their hospital bills they were prosecuted. I do not think that that is the type of system we need in Australia. I do not think that is the type of system that the majority of members of this House would like to see in place. I think that the previous speaker is really out of kilter not only with what we believe on this side of the House but also with what the government has put forward. I would like to put on record that I totally oppose the system that the member for O’Connor was talking about. I do not think that it would benefit the majority of Australian people. I do not think it would benefit the older people whom this legislation looks to help. And I certainly do not think that it would benefit the majority of people whom I represent in this House.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The <inline ref="R2218">Private Health Insurance Incentives Amendment Bill 2004</inline> is the vehicle that the Howard government is using to deliver on its election promise to increase the private health insurance rebate for people between the age of 65 and 69 from 30 per cent to 35 per cent, and for people over 70 years of age from 30 to 40 per cent. This applies to both ancillaries and hospitals. This election promise was announced by the Prime Minister on 22 August. I believe that it is not based on sound health economic principles. I believe that it is based on flawed principles. I do not think that it is the best and most efficient use of our health dollars and there are some major problems with it. While Labor will let this piece of legislation go through the House, I strongly support the amendments moved by the shadow minister, and I will talk about that a little later.</para>
<para>The Prime Minister used this as an election bribe in the lead-up to the election. He did not think about the implications of it in terms of delivering health services and in terms of health costs. He did not look at it from the point of view of the long-term implications of actually keeping the costs of health insurance down. It is based on some of these premises that this legislation is very flawed. I do understand that the Prime Minister likes to look after his friends in the private health insurance industry and I think he is doing this here. Rather than delivering health care dollars directly to the Australian people—directly to health services—he is giving health dollars to the insurance industry. That whole process is quite flawed.</para>
<para>This rebate, as I have already mentioned, is bad policy. I will deal a little bit with the legislation here: like the existing 30 per cent rebate, the higher rebate will be able to be claimed as premium reductions through a private health insurance fund, a direct payout from Medicare offices or a tax offset in annual income tax returns. The premium discount option is used by 95 per cent of taxpayers and the cash payment option is available for those retirees who no longer pay income tax. The simple fact that 95 per cent of premium payers take it in that discount option demonstrates that premiums are very high and that the government’s policy in this area has not really worked.</para>
<para>I would like to mention at this point that despite the introduction of the 30 per cent increase there has been a continual spiralling in the cost of health insurance. It went up by 4.9 per cent in June 1999 and by 1.8 per cent in March 2000. I give full credit to the previous Minister for Health, Minister Wooldridge. He vetoed a 3.25 per cent increase that HBF wanted to introduce in that year. But, come 2002, the premiums went up 6.9 per cent. In March 2003 they went up 7.4 per cent, and in February they went up by 7.58 per cent. It has hardly done much to stop the increase in private health insurance, has it? In addition to that, the money that is going into propping up the health insurance industry is money that could be spent within the health industry providing health services and health care to all Australians.</para>
<para>Currently, over one million Australians over the age of 65 have private health insurance. Of these, 350,000—or a bit over—are aged between 65 and 69. The percentage of older Australians with private health insurance is less than the national average, which is currently 43 per cent. That declines with increasing age. Many older Australians held private health insurance before the introduction of Medicare and Medicare Private. Some of them have retained it, but they really do struggle to keep up with the rising cost of premiums. The Prime Minister is giving this little token to them, but this in itself will not remedy the situation. The Prime Minister has given statements which conflict with those of the Minister for Health and Ageing. The Prime Minister, on 22 August, said this increase was:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... an additional reward for older Australians who really value their private health insurance to keep that health insurance, and ... a valuable additional incentive for them to do so.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">But the minister said he thought that this would lead to a modest increase in the total number of people taking out private health insurance. It is quite interesting to look at the effect that the 30 per cent rebate has actually had on increasing the number of older people who take out private health insurance. I have the figures here. There has actually been a decline in the number of people over the age of 75 taking out private health insurance—a decline of about one per cent since the rebate was introduced. Older people are voting with their feet. They know that the services that are available in private hospitals are limited. Private hospitals work on the premise of getting people in, treating them and getting them out fairly quickly. That is great for operations like cataract operations but not for the more complex operations. When it comes to more complex operations, older Australians tend to need the services that are provided in our major public teaching hospitals. To think that this legislation will encourage more older people to take out private health insurance is flawed. To be quite honest, I think the Prime Minister is living in fairyland.</para>
<para>Whilst the premiums that private health insurance companies are charging are constantly increasing, the profits that they are making are also increasing. I do not think you can justify that in any way. I was looking at the disclosure of interests for councillors following the last council election in my area. NIB, one of the private health insurance companies, gave political donations to a group of candidates. I am yet to understand how local government relates to private health insurance, but NIB gave donations to the conservative grouping that was running for the Newcastle Council. To my way of thinking, that is not good use of policyholder money. I have been contacted about this matter. The members of that private health insurance company were most distressed that their money was being used not to deliver better health insurance to them but rather to fund a local government election.</para>
<para>Members of private health funds raise with me the fact that they go to hospital and have their operation but when it comes time to pay their bills they find that there is a gap. In some cases it is a very significant gap and it places them in extreme financial hardship. The government should be looking at and addressing the relationship between private health insurance companies and private hospitals and looking for a way that they can remove this gap. It is all very well saying, as the previous speaker did, that everybody should be forced to take out private health insurance and that that would be the only system we would have in place. If that were the situation, I would hate to think how many people in this country would be unable to afford to have the health treatment that they needed.</para>
<para>The policy of private health insurance has always been fraught with problems. It is quite interesting that private health insurance premiums have risen by 22 per cent over the last three years and by about 33 per cent over the last five years. At the current rate of premium increase, the benefit of the five per cent rebate in dollar terms will be wiped out in less than a year. So the lower premiums promised to all those aged 65 to 69 will be eroded in only one year. That is hardly a good outcome for them. The 10 per cent that is going to be offered to people aged 70 years and over will be eroded in only two years.</para>
<para>I will spend a bit of time on the amendments that the shadow minister raised—I think that would be in the interests of the House and everyone in this debate. The first amendment highlights the fact that private health insurance does not provide real choice in health care. As I have mentioned, there are significant costs for people who take out private health insurance, and there are real limits—some procedures are not covered through private health insurance. Last July BUPA stopped paying no-gap benefits for medical perfusion procedures, which are utilised during cardiac surgery; Australian Unity has restricted some psychiatric and rehabilitation benefits; and the Howard government are hot to trot on legislation to limit gap coverage on prostheses. I do not understand how this is real choice. It is not real choice for a pensioner with very limited finances who is told that they can have a procedure in a private hospital because they have private health insurance, but at the end of the day they are going to have to pay a gap of somewhere between $1,000 and $2,000, and maybe well over that. To my way of thinking, that is not real choice.</para>
<para>That links to the second part of this amendment—that is, ensuring that private health insurance delivers real value. I do not think it does. This government has a strong philosophical commitment to anything that is private, but for us to go down this path we need to be sure that this is the best way to deliver benefits to people and to ensure that they get the health treatment that they are entitled to and deserve. Money spent on health is about better services and better health care. I honestly cannot see how this legislation will deliver that.</para>
<para>The third point in this amendment is about the government failing to address the health care needs of older Australians. The other issue, which I have not spent time on, relates to modelling. The modelling that has been done is flawed to say the least—in fact, I think it is as good as nonexistent. Good modelling that systematically examines this issue needs to be conducted. This is particularly important regarding the question of whether older Australians can be induced to take out private health insurance through real or perceived decreases in prices. When it comes to lowering the cost of health insurance, the real issue, as previous speakers have mentioned, is trying to get more young people to take out private health insurance. This legislation does nothing towards that.</para>
<para>This government is philosophically committed to private health insurance and that clouds its judgment. The Howard government has failed to deliver real health benefits to older Australians. This legislation is not about delivering health services and care to older Australians; it is about propping up the health insurance industry and looking after its friends. This is a government of ideologues who are committed to private health insurance at all costs. It is not a government that is about delivering positive health outcomes for all Australians in the most timely and economically efficient and effective manner. This is a government driven by its philosophy, not by what is best for Australia and Australians. In no area of policy is this more obvious than in the area of health. I urge the members to support the amendment moved by the shadow minister. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—There should be commemoration and remembrance by all Australians today because it has been ten short weeks since Medicare Gold was proposed by the opposition spokesperson for silly ideas, as I will explain later. On a more reflective note, the end of this year could well have been the time where private health insurance fell to such a low level that it ceased to exist in this country. In 1995 it was falling at 2.2 per cent per annum and in the absence of three brilliant policy interventions by the coalition government there could well have been adverse selection, leading to only the sickest taking out private health insurance, falling numbers of people going into private hospitals, spiralling costs of private health care insurance and eventually—possibly—the end of the private health insurance sector that we know today.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Today also marks a somewhat ideological aphasia on the other side of this House to even acknowledge that there can be any form of health provision apart from a strictly universalised and government provided one. But today health is no longer a handful of proven drugs and a very rudimentary surgical arsenal. Health today offers many choices that Australians can enjoy in both the public sector and the private sector.</para>
<para>Against the policy incentive that is being moved today, the opposition continue to plead universality then concede that point by talking about an 85 per cent reward for bulk-billing. They deny private health insurance and allow it to wither away while in government but on the other hand tolerate a 30 per cent rebate—purely because soft Labor voters in internal polling clearly support it. They first object to a PBS copayment and then support it. In the interests of universality they will scrap a safety net. Then finally they come here today to speak against what is effectively a finessing of the private health insurance rebate.</para>
<para>I noticed that the member for Lalor was at a loss to find figures that would be of any use to her in ascertaining whether an increase in the private health insurance rebate would be effective. And yet here it is in front of us. On August this year, Palangkaraya and Yong published a paper titled <inline font-style="italic">Effects of recent carrot-and-stick policy initiatives on private health insurance coverage in Australia</inline>. It is there to read. In it, they acknowledge that the issue is extraordinarily complex and that these figures will not necessarily become clear cut and easily available. They refer to lifetime health cover having an influence on between 42 per cent and 75 per cent of the overall increase in PHI membership. These are not precise figures.</para>
<para>At what point have the opposition found it difficult to extract the figures they need from a rather fulsome left-wing health-economic-academic sector to which they have a number of ties? Perhaps they should ask one more time. Keep in mind, Mr Deputy Speaker, that these are serial policies introduced by the coalition government that are overlaid—one on top of the other. It is not easy to tease them out and work out which one of them is actually responsible for any increase in PHI levels, because each year, as someone becomes a year older, the lifetime health cover penalty goes up two per cent. One cannot easily tease that out without removing lifetime health cover altogether and trying to look at two populations. Remember, Mr Deputy Speaker, as we increase the private health insurance rebate—as we are doing today—with an incentive, the effect of the two per cent increase in the lifetime health cover premium is also slightly decreased. It is an incredibly complex analysis, and a problem to which I suspect even the health spokesperson for the opposition will never find an answer.</para>
<para>Australians are a varied people. We value choice—we always have—in the private and public sectors. But against these ideas today are the opposition, with a single-stringed violin playing the same old tunes about universality long after they have been rejected by the bulk of the Australian people. There is an ideological resistance there to PHI, and they will die in the ditch to stop the rebate, then let it through, then come along today and dissemble about the lack of data to back up the proposal that we increase it.</para>
<para>Let us put this into perspective. There is $3,600 spent on every Australian for public health insurance and, for an increase of $300, we move 44 per cent of Australians onto private hospital waiting lists and off state public hospital waiting lists. Today we are talking about raising it by between $50 and $200 for a family. These are only relatively small expenditures compared to what we spend every day on public health insurance, yet they have an enormous impact at state level. Needless to say, most state hospitals simply turn down the dial, cut back a couple of surgical lists each week, make nursing theatre staff that little bit harder to find, and they capture all of the surplus and all of the savings that accrue through nearly half the population having private health cover.</para>
<para>This government believes in the spectrum of choice for Australian health care consumers. As Australians we all value different services in health or education, or even choices within the private sector, that we are capable of making every day. There is evidence of choice. The opposition might have an argument if only the 44 per cent of wealthiest Australians chose private health cover, but it is not the case. A third of the top three deciles choose not to take it. Nearly a third of the poorest three deciles choose to take it. This is not a case of rich versus poor.</para>
<para>Enter Medicare Gold. I move slightly away from the bill because this is the counterpoint. The alternative presented by the opposition spokesperson for silly ideas—that was the member for Lalor—was a proposal that we spend not $2.6 billion—</para>

<para>—The member for Lalor has proposed spending not $2.6 billion to cover nine million people and move them into private health cover but double that, $5.2 billion, to cover just 1.2 million people. Instead of $6 billion coming into the overall health system through PHI, we have 400,000 senior Australians moving out of that health pool who are the loyal and long-term members with private health insurance. Women predominate in these age groups; they are more risk averse and more likely to take out private health insurance. They would all be lost in this age group had PHI been done away with.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>What has been proposed as an alternative to this bill, in the form of Medicare Gold, is triage by birth certificate. Australians cannot be divided into two neat groups of those under 74 years of age and those over 74. That is effectively what would happen. To quote the Prime Minister, eliminating waiting lists for those over 75 is great for those over 75. We know from state governments and their health systems that that can only lead to penalising those under 75. So, the alternative to the incentive in this bill is a government-sponsored entitlement mentality that, as soon as you reach the age of 75, all services are available; but for those under 75 they are not. It was effectively a clayton’s form of PHI—a private room and a doctor of your own but nothing that made a great deal of difference to health outcomes. We today support the incentive and the increase. But it is important to underline that it is not being done specifically to raise the numbers in private health insurance. It is a reward for long-time loyalty to making the choice and taking the decision to look after one’s own health.</para>
<para>The member for Lalor was concerned that she had no data on elasticity of demand. I do not think that is a terribly important figure today. If she has to know the estimated elasticity of demand—that is, how much one increases the PHI rebate and then how much of an increase one gets in PHI membership—it is negative 0.23, if that really makes a difference to gaining her support for this bill. But it is predominantly cushioning, if you keep in mind that lifetime health cover targets about 72 per cent of the population between 30 and 65. It is entirely appropriate then to do something else for those over 65.</para>
<para>There is one last very good reason for doing so. In any health care encounter with a hospital, it is typically going to be either emergent care or elective care. As one gets older it is more likely to be emergent than elective, simply because of the logical assumption that with age one becomes less healthy and requires more visits to medical providers. As one becomes older, the provision of emergent care through a state public system is reasonably reliable and PHI thereby becomes slightly less attractive. The evidence for that is the fall in PHI levels. Insurance levels fall from the 40 per cent or so for those under 65 years of age down to 30 per cent and down to as low as 20 per cent for those over 80 years old, which the member for Shortland alluded to. So, for many of these people, an incentive, a reward or a cushioning for increasing private health insurance costs is entirely appropriate.</para>
<para>There is also a notion of intergenerational equity, because many Australians—and we have the figures from the work by Elizabeth Savage—have had private health coverage for a long period of time. The greatest impact of the coalition government’s three initiatives has been for people aged 40 to 65. It is entirely appropriate then to have an incentive that benefits those who are over 65. To say that perhaps there should be a reward for those under the age of 30 is just a matter of policy options, but keep in mind that lifetime health cover remains an extraordinarily effective policy intervention for individuals below the age of 30.</para>
<para>Today’s legislation is effectively about a finessing of the private health insurance system which is part of a broad range of health services which is internally contestable, accountable and provides choices—whether a person wishes to have public or private care. It is also a measure of the Australian people’s demand for choice. This is not so much an agenda being pushed by this government as a reflection of Australians’ preference for choice in health—as they have with access to a universal Medicare rebate, as they have with a safety net, and as they have with ancillary and combined private health insurance coverage. Finally, this is about health insurance which is becoming more affordable. I commend this bill because, in effect, it makes private health cover easier and more affordable to retain into one’s senior years of life.</para>

<para>—I rise to speak to the <inline ref="R2218">Private Health Insurance Incentives Amendment Bill 2004</inline>. The purpose of this bill is to increase the private health insurance rebate from 30 per cent to 35 per cent for people aged 65 to 69; and to increase it to 40 per cent for people aged 70 years and over. This was a commitment made by the Prime Minister during the election period, and I think that is one aspect we really have to analyse: what was the purpose of making this commitment during the election period? I think that one could say that, at the end of the day, regrettably, this was just one part of a large swag of proposals put forward by the Prime Minister as a bid to buy votes. We have contradictory views about what really is the benefit of the bill. When interviewed on 3AW, the Minister for Health and Ageing said:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote>
<para class="block">We think there will be a modest increase in the total number of people with private health insurance as a result of this.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That was 23 August, the day after the Prime Minister launched this policy and said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">It is an additional reward for older Australians who really value their private health insurance to keep that insurance.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Was the Prime Minister being more honest and up front in admitting that this was about an additional payment or—if I can describe it as such—an additional bribe to older voters? Or is it in fact what the health minister would have us believe, and that is that it has some purpose in health policy—that it is a contribution to making our health system more efficient? I think, unfortunately, in this case, the Prime Minister would appear to be closer to the mark. And that is the tragedy of this legislation—a piece of legislation that has a cost of around $450 million a year.</para>
<para>One of the debates that we need to continue to have if we are going to spend these large amounts of money is whether the money can be directed more efficiently to get better outcomes for improving our health system. I think that we need greater contributions to the debate than the sorts of contributions that we have had here today that decry the opposition’s genuine attempt during the election campaign to put forward an alternative proposal, the Medicare Gold proposal, to extend and build on the success that has been Medicare and Medibank.</para>
<para>In the minister’s second reading speech, he indicated that the people who will benefit from this bill are a generation that believes in self-reliance. He said:</para>
<quote>
<para>This is a generation whose byword is self-reliance and whose commitment to private health insurance cover has helped to keep the whole system going.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Thirty years ago, when Medibank was put in place—when there was no universal health cover—it did not take much self-reliance to understand that private provision through private health insurance was something that should be looked at. This is a generation that can remember an era before Medibank, when access to all aspects of the health system was dependent on a person’s ability to pay. We forget this sometimes. Perhaps one of the reasons that younger people are not enamoured with private health insurance is that they know that the universal provision gives them access to what is acknowledged to be a fine health system—a system that we can make better. But when you hear the stories of the people of the generation that this bill is attempting to benefit, people who remember when it was not only the journey to the general practitioner but also any subsequent admission to hospital that was dependent upon a person’s ability to pay, you see that it was a different era and a different mind-set that people had to have. Thank goodness we have moved on from when a patient could be in the ward and the hospital arbiter came along and negotiated a fee and decided to what extent a patient would be a charity case. Sometimes there really needs to be a recognition of what the health system was like a short time—30 years or a generation and a bit—ago.</para>
<para>The figures show that private health insurance take-up is directly inversely related to a person’s ability and household income. The member for Bowman neatly aggregated figures to one-thirds to try to make it appear that the percentages were not that far out of whack. But in households where the income is under $20,000 there are 23 per cent of people with private health insurance, and in households with incomes over $100,000 the percentage is 84 per cent—and the points in between form a curve that just goes up. That is a different statistical analysis to that given by those opposite in trying to justify that there is not much difference. It is clear that there is a great difference. It is even clearer if we look at the age of the people in those households. It is acknowledged that older Australians already have a higher percentage, no matter what their income is. And those who have had private health insurance will get the benefit of the increased rebate.</para>
<para>But if in fact it is as Minister Abbott suggests—that is, that this is an attempt, at a cost of $450 million a year or whatever the figure is, to increase the level of private health insurance in the age groups in question—let us look at the capacity and the ability to pay, just on the basis that, for those aged 65 to 69, there will be a five per cent differential or, for those over 70, a 10 per cent differential. Then, let us look deeper and take in other aspects of the policy, because, in different circumstances, the cost of private health insurance can be quite considerable and quite different for people in similar circumstances. That is because of the lifetime health cover penalty. For example, a 68-year-old person who wants to take out comprehensive cover might pay in the order of $1,400 a year after the 35 per cent rebate. If they had bought private health insurance before July 2000—and therefore were not subject to the lifetime health cover penalty—they would pay only $845. If we are really serious about tackling the problem that the government suggests that we have with providing health services to older Australians, let us go to things like that. So the incentive in this bill for people to take out cover really loses all impact.</para>
<para>Older Australians are aware of what has happened since the private health insurance rebate came into existence. They are aware that it has not curtailed the way in which the premiums have increased. Again, this goes against what was suggested at the time that this policy was put in place. If in the past the Prime Minister and the ministers responsible have not been able to assess the impact properly, why should we believe that on this occasion they are going to do any better? Why should we believe that there will in any way be downward pressure because of these rebates? In fact, if we look at the different costs for treatment of different age groups, it is clear that there will be greater pressure if this bill is successful in increasing the numbers taking out private health insurance in the age groups that we are suggesting.</para>
<para>Some of the justification that is given for a measure like this that is targeted at older Australians is that the government has re-found its <inline font-style="italic">Intergenerational Report</inline> of 2002-03, which was put down in the 2002 budget. We have the Treasurer going around the countryside saying ‘demography is our destiny’—that is his catchcry—‘and these are the issues that we have to look at.’ But in an interview on the ABC on Thursday, 25 November, what did the Treasurer say about health costs by age group? He said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The cost of health care for somebody between 35 and 54 is $1,700, on average. If you’re over 85, it’s $7,900. So in that older group of Australians, health care costs per person are four times what they are for younger Australians.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That was the Treasurer setting out the facts.</para>
<para>During the election campaign, when Labor talked about Medicare Gold and indicated that, because private health insurance hospital cover would be taken over by Medicare Gold for older Australians, premiums should drop for younger Australians due to the differential between the amount of resources required, it was pooh-poohed. But that is what we are facing. We acknowledge that senior Australians will have this impact. I say to anybody who suggests that any of the proposals that are put forward are unaffordable: does that mean that we should give up?</para>
<para>The differential between the costs for older Australians and the costs for younger Australians will not change because of the way that the bills are paid. The differential will not change if they are paid direct from public coffers, if they are paid in a shandy between private and public provision or if they are paid directly by private provision. Basically, the core of those costs is about the treatment that is involved, its complexity and the way medical technology makes treatments available.</para>
<para>The challenge for Australia—having acknowledged that fact—is to be serious about the way the effort is shared. We have a system that has the complication that the public provision and public effort, under a federal system, is shared between the Commonwealth and the states—and that brings with it certain problems. It is also shared because we have private provision and public provision. To the extent that those opposite champion private provision and self-reliance, it is consistent that we have a piece of legislation like this because it is an attempt to encourage a shift across that divide.</para>
<para>But is it the most efficient way? It is not often acknowledged or mentioned now that the 30 per cent rebate was put in place because of the crisis we had with waiting lists for people to gain treatment in hospitals. The 30 per cent rebate now goes across the wide range of things that private health insurance provides, but at the time it was introduced it was an attempt to acknowledge that waiting lists in hospitals were a problem that needed to be tackled. All we hear about now is that it is about the magical limits and the percentage of the population that has private health insurance, without going into what that means. At best, the evidence is conflicting about the effect this has had on waiting lists. I believe it has had a negligible effect on waiting lists, on the basis of the stories and cases that come through my office. So until we get back to trying to set goals which are achievable, which we understand and which are not at the periphery, we are never going to tackle some of these issues properly. We are never going to tackle them properly unless we have the bigger debate.</para>
<para>We have a system that is based on the 30 per cent rebate, which is support of an industry sector—the health insurance industry—which indirectly leads to provision of health services, and we never understand what is lost by putting in these measures with the steps removed. When people suggest that perhaps it would have been better if the money had been directly given to the health system—that it would have been more efficient—again, people think that is nonsense. It is the aspect that is overlooked in the discussion on Medicare Gold, which was about creating efficiencies, avoiding the nonsense of duplication and avoiding the nonsense of competing interests between federal and state governments—which mean nothing to older Australians; they just want access to treatment. If there is a measure that can bring savings of $500 million to $600 million to the system, shouldn’t we be looking at that? But, no—in the argy-bargy after the election, we just throw it out; it is not worth continuing the debate. That is nonsense; it is worth continuing the debate.</para>
<para>The other aspect I want to go to relates to the comments the Treasurer has made about the response to the <inline font-style="italic">Intergenerational Report</inline>, which he has now picked up on again. In an interview on the ABC, in tackling the ‘demography is destiny’ question, he said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">We’ll either deal with it in small licks early on, or be forced to deal with it in larger dislocation later on.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">If we are dealing with it in ‘small licks’, I would like to be assured that the small licks, when aggregated, are actually moving in the same direction. I am not sure that they are, and I do not think the Treasurer knows whether they are. I think this is piecemeal. When measures come out of the blue during an election campaign, I simply ask: what is going on? Where is the context for these measures? Has there been development of policies that this might be one part of? What is the next move from this government? Do they know? I do not believe they do. I say to the Treasurer: forget about the small licks. I agree with the ‘early on’ bit, but let us get the solution up front. If he has to put in partial measures, I am happy to do that—if the resources are not available—but do not have this nonsense that we are going to do it in small licks when the small licks do not relate to each other. That is the aspect that is destroying this debate about public policy: it should be in context. If the Australian public are to have a whole system that is effective, they deserve that we operate that way. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—The opposition’s history in government is fairly chequered as far as delivery on its election promises is concerned. The Howard government though, having put forward policies to the Australian people prior to the last legislation and having received a mandate to implement those policies, is particularly keen to receive the support of the parliament to enable us to deliver in full and on time the promises that we made. We were re-elected at the last election with an increased majority, and the principles contained in the <inline ref="R2218">Private Health Insurance Incentives Amendment Bill 2004</inline> implement a promise made to Australians aged over 65 with private health insurance.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I do find it somewhat astounding in the second reading amendment to see the Australian Labor Party wanting to refer this bill off to a Senate committee. The government put forward a platform prior to the last election and said to the Australian people, ‘If you re-elect us, we will bring in a bill which will implement our policy,’ and this bill implements that policy. We went to Australian people and we said, ‘If you re-elect us, this is what will happen’—and the Australian Labor Party possibly wants us to break our promise to the Australian people. They are not happy that this bill implements what we said we would do for the Australian people. They want to send it off to a Senate committee and to see that committee probably butcher the bill so that as a government we are unable to deliver in full.</para>
<para>The Australian health system is an excellent one; it is a system that is being presided over by this government. On the Sunshine Coast, more than 10,000 people in my electorate of Fisher will benefit directly from this proposed increase in the private health insurance rebate for older Australians. I suspect that, if honourable members opposite took a sampling of public opinion in their respective electorates, they would find that thousands—in some cases, tens of thousands—of people would benefit from the proposed increase in the private health insurance rebate for older Australians. I do find it somewhat difficult that some of these members could actually stare down their constituents who would benefit from this proposed improvement in the private health insurance rebate and somehow say that they want to make it more difficult for their older Australians to remain in private health insurance.</para>
<para>This bill represents a real win-win situation for all Australian health service consumers. As I said, in my electorate of Fisher, taking in part of the Sunshine Coast and hinterland region, more than 10,000 people aged over 65 will benefit from the policy change included in this particular bill. More than 10,000 people aged over 65 have private health insurance. In total, 49 per cent of adults—almost 40,000 people—in the electorate have health fund cover.</para>
<para>I have to say that I thought it was really unfortunate that during the election campaign the Labor Party, Greens and Democrats all indicated that they opposed the higher rebate for people aged over 65; indeed, even worse given the statistics, that the Democrats and the Greens are opposed to the existing 30 per cent rebate on private health insurance and want it abolished. It took quite some time for the Australian Labor Party to commit itself with respect to the 30 per cent rebate. I am not convinced that, if the Australian Labor Party were ever re-elected to the Treasury bench, the rebate would survive. But the Greens and the Democrats have been up front; they have said that they are opposed to the existing 30 per cent rebate on private health insurance and they want it abolished. Is it any wonder that many people have deserted the minor parties when they see that the minor parties are simply unable to stand up for older Australians who, during their working lives, have worked so hard to make Australia the wonderful nation that it is.</para>
<para>Australia is a wealthy country and I believe that we owe to our pensioners and retirees incentives to enable them to remain in private health insurance. Many of those people, during their working lives and during the period when they had fewer medical needs, were in private health insurance. Part of the aim of the legislation currently before the chamber is to make it possible for as many of those people as possible to remain in private health insurance.</para>
<para>Opposition to the government’s proposal is very short-sighted indeed. In effect, opponents of the higher rebate are saying that they want older people to pay more for their health insurance than would be necessary if the higher rebate were provided. At the same time, we find that honourable members of the opposition tend to whinge and whine and bleat and complain about the unacceptable public hospital waiting lists, particularly for elective surgery. We ought to appreciate, of course, that public hospitals are the responsibility of the state governments. I just think it is really short-sighted for the Australian Labor Party to say that a policy such as that being implemented by this bill ought not to be supported, because the obvious consequence of the failure of this legislation to pass would be that more people who, with the benefit of this legislation, would be able to access private hospitals would be forced back on to public hospital waiting queues, making it even more difficult for those people who cannot afford private insurance—even with the rebate—to receive public hospital cover.</para>
<para>Without this rebate, many older people who have paid private health insurance cover for years would simply be unable to remain in private health insurance. Many of these older people are on fixed incomes and you would find that they would be disadvantaged at a stage in their life when the nation ought to be making it possible for us as a community to say thanks to them for their wonderful contribution in prior years. Potentially many older Australians may suffer from serious illnesses and would have a high priority for a public hospital bill and, if they drop out of private health insurance, it means the public hospital waiting queues will grow ever longer. I would have thought it should have been compelling logic that if we are able to encourage as many people as possible to remain insured, especially senior Australians, that is good for the overall health system.</para>
<para>Most honourable members would be aware that, statistically, people aged over 65 use more hospital services than any other age group. In the electorate of Fisher for example—and I suspect that our statistics are probably not dissimilar to those from other electorates, although Fisher is one of the oldest electorates in Australia—almost 8,000 people over 65 used their private health insurance to cover hospital treatment last year. To put it another way, combined they spent more than 32,500 days in hospital. These figures prove that if opposition to the proposed higher rebate forced even small numbers of older Australians to drop their cover the impact on the public system could be devastating. The 30 per cent rebate has made it possible for many older people on fixed or low incomes to remain insured, and the increases proposed by the government which have been opposed by our opponents will make it even more affordable for them to remain insured.</para>
<para>As I said, this bill implements a key election commitment to Australians aged over 65. Indeed, it implements a key election commitment given to the Australian community, and this policy was one of the reasons why this government was returned and the opposition languishes on the other side of the House. This bill implements a key election policy, and that should be sufficient reason for this parliament to pass it. I said before that it also makes good health sense as far as our health system overall is concerned to have this policy implemented into the law of Australia. This bill will give Australians aged over 65 the continuing choice of doctor, hospital, priority of care and amenities such as private rooms that Labor’s Medicare Gold—often called fool’s gold—would have taken from these Australians.</para>
<para>Even the opposition would concede that the government campaigned strongly in the election campaign on this issue, especially with respect to Medicare Gold. Nobody could seriously suggest that the government does not have a mandate to implement its policy. The government certainly has a mandate to have passed by the parliament the Private Health Insurance Incentives Amendment Bill 2004. The aim is to increase the affordability of private health cover for older Australians at a time of life when they are most likely to need health services. These people contributed to private health insurance during their working lives, during their younger years when they enjoyed good health, yet we so often find that people have been to see me as a local member and, I suspect, other honourable members to explain how they simply cannot afford to remain in private health insurance at a time when they have increasing health needs. That is why this government will not apologise for the incentives which were promised during the election campaign and the incentives which it seeks to implement through the bill currently before the chamber.</para>
<para>Older Australians, particularly those on fixed and low to moderate retirement incomes, deserve a further reward for contributions paid over many years of health fund membership. How on earth could the opposition in some way, shape or form suggest that it is equitable that people who have struggled to pay private health insurance premiums over the years should be forced out of private health cover because they simply no longer have the income to remain in private health cover? Not only is this policy—the proposed change included in this bill—something for which we have a mandate, it is also giving decency and equity to senior Australians.</para>
<para>The higher rebate will mean a saving on a typical couple or family policy of around $100 to $200 a year over the 30 per cent rebate. The opposition would have us believe that the measure rewards the older and sicker health fund members and does nothing to help bring or encourage younger and fitter people into private health cover. Of course, our 30 per cent rebate did a lot to encourage people to resume health cover. Older people taking out private health insurance are people who should be supported by the community, because as a nation we owe so much to those people. The Australian Labor Party opposed this policy in the last election. I have to say, given in particular the ageing of the Australian population, it is extraordinarily difficult to understand how they could justify such a punitive and discriminatory approach to Australians who, during their working lives, helped to make this nation what it is today. I suppose it does indicate just how out of touch the Australian Labor Party has become, just how removed it is from ordinary middle Australia, just how it has lost the ability to understand what older Australians need.</para>
<para>This government brought forward the policy which increased the rebate from 30 to 35 per cent for people aged 65 to 69 and to 40 per cent for people aged 70 years and over because we thought it was fair, equitable, appropriate and the right thing to do. As with the current 30 per cent rebate, the new rebates will be able to be claimed as a premium reduction through private health insurance funds—and this happens in about 95 per cent of cases presently—as a direct payment from Medicare offices or as a tax offset in annual income tax returns. The higher rebate will be available for hospital cover, ancillary cover and combined cover. The higher rebates will apply to individuals who meet the age thresholds and to couples and families where one or more of the persons covered in the policy meet these age thresholds. They will also be available for people who do not pay income tax. It is absolutely incredible that the Australian Labor Party, by seeking to refer this bill to a Senate committee, is seeking to force the government to break a key promise made to the Australian people prior to the last election. I strongly urge members to support the Private Health Insurance Incentives Amendment Bill 2004 and, in doing so, assist the government to implement an election promise made to senior Australians.</para>

<para>—My question is to the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs. Now that the minister has had 24 hours to reflect on the matter, will she correct her misleading statement to the House yesterday and her conflicting accounts of the way in which the Horse Australia 2005 grant in Rockhampton was to be made public? If, as the minister told the House yesterday, she believed the press release announcing the grant had been issued on 31 August 2004, why did she that same day write to Mrs Clelland of Horse Australia, telling her to keep news of the grant confidential?</para>

<para>—There is no contradiction here. I did not issue the press release from my office. However, can I say that, with regard to this project, I believed at the time that the project had been announced. I would just like to take you back for a moment to the points that I have made about Horse Australia. The CEO of Horse Australia was advised on 31 August. Mrs Clelland confirms that she was told of the grant on 31 August. I believed the project had been announced, although the press release was not issued by me. If my office does not issue the press release, it is generally forwarded to the relevant member or senator. It is generally the case that recipients of grants and the senator or member concerned liaise on a suitable date, time and venue for an announcement. This is usually done within a matter of days and certainly never more than within a few weeks of the confirmation of the grant.</para>

<para>I assumed, not unreasonably, that such a good project would have been announced long ago. This was a misunderstanding, and I apologised to the House for it yesterday.

<para>—This is the last sitting day and the last question time for the parliament this year, and I am delighted to inform the House that Australia’s unemployment rate has now fallen to 5.2 per cent. This is what public policy is about. It is not about wasting the time of parliament on pointless, insubstantial nitpicking; it is about creating real jobs for real Australians. That has been the objective of our government, and I am proud of the fact that our government have presided over what is now a 27- to 30-year low in the level of unemployment in Australia. In the government’s first term of office, we created 370,000 new jobs. In the second term, we created 430,000 new jobs. In the third term, we created 635,000 new jobs.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Not only did we create, over those three terms, almost 1.5 million new jobs in this country, but we have also presided over increases in real wages of more than 12 per cent in the time that we have been in government. This is about 10 times greater than the real wage increases that occurred in the 13½ years of the Hawke and Keating governments.</para>
<para>All of this is unconditional good news for the people of Australia. However, it could be even better if the Labor Party would get out of the way: they still have an opportunity this afternoon. If the Labor Party in the Senate were to change their position on the unfair dismissal laws this afternoon, we could send the still-unemployed of Australia a wonderful Christmas present by removing the barriers to further employment in small business by reforming the outrageous unfair dismissal laws of this country. But no: Scrooge-like and insensitive to the needs of the unemployed in Australia, Labor will go to Christmas clinging to their outdated, union dominated hostility to the reform of our unfair dismissal laws.</para>
<para>We can have a ‘4’ in front of our unemployment figure. We could have had it earlier, but the people who have stood in the way of still-lower unemployment are the members of the Australian Labor Party. They should go to Christmas realising that not only has this government delivered low unemployment and high real wages but they, the members of the Australian Labor Party, are stopping the creation of even lower levels of unemployment in this country.</para>
<para>I want to thank the businesses of Australia and the employees of Australia for the contribution they have made towards delivering this wonderful Christmas present for the unemployed of our nation.</para>

The letters involved in this—and I refer the House to the statements made by me and the departmental liaison officer—relate to three packages of Regional Partnerships projects. One project was Horse Australia, and I approved another two packages of projects in October, signed off on the projects and signed the relevant letters to stakeholders. As we explained before, all of this was then handed back to the department. As the departmental liaison officer has made clear, he posted those at a later date and date-stamped them. That date was after I became the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, but I signed all projects and all correspondence before I was sworn in as Minister for Veterans’ Affairs.</para>

<para>—I thank the member for Macquarie for the interesting question. I am pleased to inform the House that I did meet the members of the newly appointed National Indigenous Council this morning. This body is chaired by the highly respected magistrate from Western Australia Mrs Sue Gordon. It is a council that includes a wide range of representatives of the Indigenous people. It has a very good mix of people from different parts of the country and from different age groups. It includes people of a variety of views not only on Indigenous policy; it includes, as the House will know, a federal Vice-President of the Australian Labor Party, Mr Warren Mundine. I particularly welcome his very constructive involvement with this body.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I was particularly impressed with the great sense of hope and optimism that this council brings to the very daunting challenges in the area of Indigenous policy. I do not think there is any doubt that there have been signs of something of a sea change in the attitudes of people towards the way forward in relation to Indigenous policy, and the involvement of the people on this council is a very, very encouraging sign indeed. I made it very plain to the members of the council that they would comprise the principal source of advice to the government on Indigenous issues. That does not mean that the government will not from time to time talk to other bodies and other people, but this body will be the principal source of advice to the government.</para>
<para>Both yesterday and today, the council had meetings with some five or six ministers in the government as well as the secretary of my own department and the heads of other government agencies, and all the members of the council have expressed their great satisfaction with the level of involvement of ministers and senior officials. In our discussions we did talk about the importance of the reciprocity that underpins both the government’s concept of shared responsibility agreements and traditional Aboriginal culture. The negotiation at a local level of shared responsibility agreements is an important element of our approach to Indigenous policy.</para>
<para>I was particularly encouraged by the reference by many members of the council to the need in future to base Aboriginal policy on the development of a more entrepreneurial culture. One or two of the members in particular raised the desirability of moving towards embracing concepts of private landownership as an advance on the concept of everything being owned by the community and not enough encouragement being given to individuals and families to own their own properties. I indicated that the government would respond in a generally positive way to that point of view, and it does represent a major step forward and a break from past attitudes which I think have acted as a brake on progress and solutions.</para>
<para>I note that this morning there was some discussion about aspects of the shared responsibility approach and, in particular, there were some comments being made about an agreement with the community of Mulan. In that connection, I particularly welcome the approach being taken by John Kobelke, the Western Australian Minister for Indigenous Affairs. He very strongly supports the approach that has been taken by the community. His views are very much in line with the approach taken by the government and, in that sense, reject the rather negative and old-fashioned views on this subject that have been expressed by Senator Kim Carr, speaking on behalf of the Australian Labor Party in this parliament.</para>

<para>—I thank the honourable member for Fisher for his question. The Australian Bureau of Statistics reports that retail sales have fallen by around one per cent since June. But according to the Australian Retailers Association, it is expecting a big build-up to Christmas this year with sales increasing by seven per cent in New South Wales, up to $11.5 billion. In Victoria retailers are expecting consumers to spend a record $8 billion on Christmas gifts, which is an increase of seven per cent. So that looks like a strong Christmas retail sales period.</para>

Will she tell the House precisely where this matter is dealt with in the 3 December statement? If she cannot do so, will the minister now tell the House whether, when she was sworn in in October, she informed the Prime Minister or the Deputy Prime Minister of the conflict of interest of her staff member Mr Ken Crooke in the A2 milk matter, as she is obliged to do under the ministerial code of conduct?</para>

As it was a short-term appointment, I gave him permission to retain the directorship of his one-person consultancy, in accordance with the guidelines, on the understanding that there would be no work that interfered with his duties in my office or provided conflict of interest.</para>

<para>I would like to go to the question of his company. Mr Crooke has advised me that his company employs no outside staff. His wife is the company secretary and receives a small annual fee. It does not hold any shares in any other company. Mr Crooke holds two ordinary shares in his company, his wife has one share, and each of his children holds a share. Neither Mr Crooke and his wife nor any other member of his family holds or has ever held shares in the company A2 Dairy Marketers or any other company or entity associated with that company. As per my statement to the House, I informed the House that Mr Crooke was required to ensure that he had no conflict of interest. In fact, as you would read from his statement, he immediately cancelled his consultancy with A2 milk.</para>

<para>—First, I thank the honourable member for Pearce for her question. I know that she has asked several questions about Iraq over the course of this year, 2004, and I appreciate her interest. I am delighted to answer this question before a delegation from Iraq—people who are enormously welcome here in Australia. We are delighted to have them and we are delighted to have helped them to achieve freedom as well. We are proud of the role we played to help you.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Let me make a couple of points about this. First of all, we want to see elections in Iraq on 30 January. We will do everything we can to contribute to those elections taking place. The free people of Iraq should be entitled to vote. Despite the efforts of terrorists to stop them voting, I know there is enormous determination in the international community to ensure they can vote. We are assisting with the electoral process. We committed $5 million through the United Nations in support of that process and $1 million for governance initiatives. Indeed, members may be interested to know that two Iraqi electoral officials observed our own Australian federal election in October.</para>

<para>—Yes, I believe they thought it was a very good election. I do not doubt they were very happy with the result as well, let’s face it, since this was, after all, an issue during the election. It is also worth noting that the Australian Defence Force is equipping a Fijian deployment to protect United Nations personnel supporting the Iraqi election process. We are happy to be providing that assistance as well.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Let me conclude by saying that this is one of many questions I have been asked about this issue of Iraq, our troops in Iraq and our contribution to Iraq throughout this year. In this last question time of the year it is worth reflecting that, throughout this year—or not throughout this year; from 23 March onwards—there has been an alternative view on this question. That alternative view is the Leader of the Opposition’s notorious ‘troops out by Christmas’ policy—a policy not endorsed by the shadow cabinet when it was announced, not supported by many people in the Australian Labor Party, and which the Australian public rejected. Whatever the public thought about the original role we played in throwing out Saddam Hussein, they knew that we should not cut and run.</para>
<para>The Labor Party spokesman on defence, the member for Barton, said in an interview on Monday that he and Kevin Rudd are going to spend their Christmas having a series of discussions with Iraqi representatives here as well as with United States and United Nations representatives. We have had 10 policies since 23 March from the Labor Party on ‘troops out by Christmas’. Despite our offers of briefing, which have never been taken up, we are now told that after Christmas there will be an 11th policy. An 11th policy will be produced. What is Labor’s 11th policy going to be? It will not be ‘troops out by Christmas’. All we know of Labor’s position now is that they will work out their position over Christmas. It is going to be very interesting to watch.</para>
<para>We do know that the Labor Party made a catastrophic mistake with their policy this year. If they had had briefing from us, listened to what we had to say and learned a bit from people who know something about this issue then Labor could have been part of helping the free people of Iraq. We are proud of the role we have played. We did a great thing last year and a great thing this year in helping the people of Iraq. The House can rest assured that, in 2005, we will continue to do so.</para>

<para>—Mr Speaker, as you are the next-door neighbour of the member for Mallee, I am sure you are also interested in the answer to this question, given that both your electorates, and particularly the electorate of Mallee, earn hundreds of millions of dollars in export earnings for Australia and create many thousands of jobs in that part of Australia. During the course of this year Australia has been instrumental in securing an historic agreement to eliminate global agricultural export subsidies. By stealing our export markets and reducing international prices, export subsidisers for decades have severely damaged Australian farm exports, including dairy, beef, sugar and wheat. While I am on the subject of wheat, I would also like to join my colleagues in recognising the delegation from the Iraqi Grains Board who are visiting Australia at the moment. I welcome them to our country and wish them all the best during their stay in Australia.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Analysis shows that ridding the world of export subsidies would increase Australian dairy exports by more than $600 million. Ridding the world of export subsidies would increase Australian sugar exports immediately by $40 million. As chair of the Cairns Group, we are determined to open up new farm export markets in the current round of global trade negotiations. An ambitious outcome would create important new export opportunities and jobs—more jobs, as our government has been committed to over the last eight years—in Australia, particularly in the Australian farm sector. The World Bank has estimated that the global economy stands to gain $600 billion from a successful round in the WTO. It is important, vital and incumbent upon the major subsidisers—the European Union, the United States and Japan—to stand up to the protectionist forces within their democracies, within their countries, and play a leadership role. An ambitious outcome on agriculture in the Doha Round is Australia’s No. 1 trade policy priority, and Australia will continue to fight every step of the way to ensure that our farmers can compete better globally and continue to generate more employment opportunities in regional Australia.</para>

<para>—Well, nobody from the opposition, to the best of my knowledge, has ever asked me a question about Papua New Guinea, yet it is our nearest neighbour. In 8½ years I do not think I have ever been asked a question about Papua New Guinea. Maybe I am doing the opposition an injustice, but I doubt it. I will be leading a delegation of seven Australian ministers to the Australia-Papua New Guinea Ministerial Forum next week, which will take place in Lae. This is a very propitious time to be leading this delegation because this has been the second year in a row of growth for the Papua New Guinea economy and there have been signs of recent improvement in economic management. I think many members know that Papua New Guinea faces serious long-term development challenges: law and order, problems with corruption, poor governance, and so on. The House would be aware that it was just 12 months ago, almost to the day, in the Adelaide Hills, at Mount Lofty, that our government agreed with the Papua New Guinea government to what is called the Enhanced Cooperation Program.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Under this program we will be deploying 210 Australian police and 64 senior officials and judges to Papua New Guinea in order to assist the Papua New Guinea government to meet its challenges. Already 64 police have arrived and 32 officials have been deployed. Joint police patrols began on the streets of Port Moresby on 2 December. So this ministerial forum comes at a good time. It is an opportunity for us to take stock of how the Enhanced Cooperation Program is working. This, of course, is an example of the activism of the government in international relations, including in the South Pacific, and making sure that instead of just a policy of benign neglect we have a policy of very real activism to help Papua New Guinea and other countries in the region achieve serious reform, overcome the problems of poverty and deprivation, deal with issues like HIV-AIDS and provide overall a more secure, a more satisfactory and a more prosperous region.</para>

<para>—I thank the member for Paterson for the question, because yesterday a suite of legislation that enables counter-terrorism arrangements to remain responsive passed this House and the Senate. It is a response to the ever-changing global security environment in which we are operating. I want to acknowledge the importance of the parliament’s ensuring the passage of these bills. It enabled us to deliver on an election commitment to reintroduce this important legislation, which regrettably was unable to be dealt with before the parliament was dissolved. I note that there were a number of inquiries that ensured that that happened.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The effect of the bills, once royal assent is achieved, is as follows. First, they allow law enforcement officers greater use of surveillance devices to ensure they can keep ahead of the increasingly sophisticated technology used by terrorists and criminals. The legislation also provides police with easier access to stored communications such as text messages and email. One bill protects sensitive national security information in criminal proceedings to ensure that we do not identify people who may provide advice and whose lives could be at risk or identify systems that we use that are important in collecting intelligence information, and to ensure that we still have access to intelligence information from abroad which might be jeopardised if it were to be used in public. But we do not want to see a situation where prosecutions do not proceed because of those difficulties.</para>
<para>Finally, ASIO has been enabled to carry out security assessments in relation to a wider range of activities involving ammonium nitrate. That product is a common fertiliser and is used in the mining industry as well, but it was also used with devastating consequences in Oklahoma and is known to be a product of choice for bomb-making in our own region by Jemaah Islamiah.</para>
<para>Only two months has elapsed since the election. The government made it clear that it had the intention of getting on with the job of protecting and securing the Australian community, and we have been able to do so with the passage of this legislation. I am grateful for the support that has been received for that. I cannot guarantee a terrorist attack will not occur in Australia. Some people have said it is inevitable. I have never used those words, but we need to do everything in our power to ensure that we protect Australians and the Australian community and to prevent a terrorist act from occurring here. That is why I always place a sense of urgency on every bill that has national security implications. I regard our counter-terrorism arrangements as an unfinished canvas, one we need to continually refine and adapt if we are to meet the needs of protecting Australians.</para>

<para>—I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question. I know how concerned he is to see agreements like this go ahead and to see more agreements like this go ahead. The social fabric of this nation will be built up by dozens and, ultimately, hundreds and thousands of agreements like this. That is how you build a stronger country—not by the kind of nitpicking that we have seen from members opposite today, alleging impropriety on the basis of no substantial evidence. Under this proposed agreement, the government will provide funding to enable fuel bowsers to be established in the Mulan community. Also under this agreement, local Indigenous people have undertaken to clean their community up, to ensure that kids go to school and take the actions necessary to tackle the scourge of trachoma, which now afflicts their communities.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This agreement is a practical demonstration of Noel Pearson’s dictum that Indigenous people will only advance if they are allowed to take responsibility for their own lives. The Leader of the Opposition was actually asked about this very agreement on ABC radio this morning and he said that shared responsibility was a Labor Party invention. He said mutual responsibility is ‘a longstanding Labor principle’. It might be that, but he has not told Senator Kim Carr, because Senator Kim Carr was on ABC radio just a few minutes later saying that the agreement was patronising, coercive and insulting. The question for the Leader of the Opposition is: does he agree, deep down, with Senator Carr? I know the last thing the Leader of the Opposition needs right now is another fight with a Senate frontbencher—he has got too many of them running. This is a fight he should have. This is something he should do. He should and must pull Senator Carr into line and this time he would be doing it for a good cause. He would not be pulling a Labor senator into line to save his job; he would be pulling a Labor senator into line to protect the interests of the Indigenous people of our country.</para>

<para>—In answer, very directly, to the Leader of the Opposition’s question: yes, I can confirm that it does provide that. I have ascertained that she did not obtain, as strictly required by the code, the statement from Mr Crooke. The reason advanced by the minister is that it was in the character of a short-term employment. That of itself does not excuse any parliamentary secretary or minister from the requirement to obtain that.</para>

<para>The Leader of the Opposition asks me whether, in the light of that and in the light of her having exceeded her authority and in the light of other alleged misdeeds, I should terminate her commission. The answer is no, I should not terminate her commission. I am glad the Leader of the Opposition has asked this question. Let me deal with the principal allegation. The principal allegation against the minister is that she exceeded her authority by authorising—by approving—regional partnership grants after she had ceased to have any portfolio responsibility for that. That is the principal charge. That charge has simply not been substantiated by the opposition. I have personally read the departmental minute relating to the principal grant that has been under debate in this House over the past few days. It is manifest, on the basis of that document, that the former parliamentary secretary—the now minister—approved that project at 3.37 p.m. on the afternoon of 31 August 2004, when she clearly had the—</para>

<para>—The opposition interjects about the insertion of the time. Knowing that the caretaker period was to commence at 5 o’clock on 31 August, it was, I might say, commendable prudence by the parliamentary secretary to actually insert the time that she approved the particular grant. It has been explained, both by the DLO and by the minister, that the letter in question was not dispatched until a date early in December, by which time the minister had ceased to be parliamentary secretary and had become a minister. There is therefore absolutely no substance at all to the allegation that she exceeded her authority. There was a clerical oversight. There was a clerical oversight when the now shadow Treasurer wrote to the current Treasurer on his old letterhead of shadow minister for family and community services.

<para>Of course there was a clerical oversight, but we have witnessed from the Australian Labor Party over the past few days an attempt to beat life into an issue that has not involved any misdeed by the minister. Yes, there was a noncompliance with an item in the code, and I will plainly say that. But that alone is not in my view a sufficient reason to require the minister to hand in her commission. But I will tell you something that will be required: in a few minutes time there will be tabled in this House a royal commission report that will detail a chain of events whereby—</para>

<para>—I simply say in relation to what the Leader of the Opposition has put to me concerning the behaviour of the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs that the charge against her was that when she approved these grants she was the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs and not the parliamentary secretary. That was the charge. Now, all the evidence indicates that she approved these grants while she was still the parliamentary secretary and, through clerical inadvertence, the letters were not sent out until after she had become the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs. It is plain on any examination of the file that that is what has happened and, deep down, the members of the Labor Party know that is the case. They know that the last two or three days has been a total charade designed to cover up the embarrassment the Leader of the Opposition is now facing. Nobody with any skerrick of objectivity in this place could think otherwise.</para>

</continue>
<para>Of course it was a clerical error that those letters were not sent out, and of course this will be a lesson to any parliamentary secretary in the future who does not obtain the statement of those pecuniary interests. But taking into account the totality of her behaviour, to require her resignation on the basis of this is an insult to a proper administration of the concepts of ministerial responsibility, particularly coming from a group of men and women whose ministerial predecessors, asleep at the wheel, allowed the taxpayer to be ripped off to the tune of $42 million.</para>

<para class="block">What we have seen here is the classic Howard government charade, the classic Howard government defence of saying it is merely a clerical error and merely noncompliance with the ministerial code of conduct. The truth is the clerical error is about the allocation of $220,000 of public money, and the noncompliance is in fact a stunning breach of the ministerial code of conduct.</para>
<para>Let there be no doubt about the extent of the breach. The ministerial code of conduct says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">At the time of commencing their employment, ministerial consultants and members of ministers’ staff (including electorate officers) are required to complete statements of private interests on forms supplied by MaPS. The employing minister endorses the statement in writing after satisfying him or herself that there is no conflict of interest.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">We now find out that Mr Ken Crooke did not lodge the statement of interest, that the ministerial code had been breached, that the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs subsequently became aware of his conflict over the allocation of funding to A2 milk marketers, that she did not tell the Prime Minister and that she was sworn in as the new minister under false pretences. The Prime Minister would have the House believe that that does not matter and that it was simply a short-term contract and a short-term matter that was quickly dealt with.</para>
<para>What was dealt with was the fact that Mr Ken Crooke, who previously worked for Joh Bjelke-Petersen, came to Canberra for four months to allocate $400 million of regional pork rorts. This was no small matter. This was no mere bagatelle, no passing parade through Parliament House; this was someone sent by the Queensland National Party to support the member for Dawson in the misallocation of $400 million of regional pork rorts. Why wouldn’t the Australian taxpayers be worried about that? Why wouldn’t the hardworking Australian taxpayers say that it matters when someone has staffing responsibility and is working for a parliamentary secretary who is allocating $400 million of regional pork rorts in the lead-up to the federal election? Why wouldn’t they say that a parliamentary secretary who failed to have the appropriate paperwork and the appropriate declaration lodged under the ministerial code of conduct should be dismissed?</para>
<para>The truth is that she was sworn in as the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs under false pretences. She had breached the ministerial code of conduct as the parliamentary secretary. The Prime Minister calls it non-compliance. It is a clear breach and it again demonstrates that this Prime Minister will not take responsibility for the misconduct and the maladministration of his executive government. He tries to excuse it away as a clerical error. Most Australians would love to make a clerical error to the tune of $220,000 for a funding grant and lose the letter and effectively lose the grant for three months. Most Australians cannot dream of that amount of money coming their way in a three-month period, let alone dream that their expectations that $400 million of regional funding grants might be treated seriously by the government.</para>
<para>The Leader of the House has a Costello-style smirk on his face. He knows for a fact that Ken Crooke was a man on a mission. He came to Canberra for four months to assist in the distribution of $400 million of the regional pork rorts, mostly under the SONA secret guidelines. Why wouldn’t people take this seriously? The government wants to give us lectures about economic management but what sort of government excuses away the maladministration of $220,000 in a grant as a clerical error? What sort of government says that a pecuniary interest in the allocation of these massive programs does not matter? It is a government that has no economic credentials and standards of its own. If the government is willing to excuse away maladministration and dishonesty of this kind and breaches of the ministerial code of conduct, it will excuse away any bad behaviour and mistreatment of public funding by the executive government.</para>
<para>This minister must go. She was sworn in as the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs under a fraud—the fraud that she was a cleanskin and the fraud that she had complied with the ministerial code of conduct as parliamentary secretary. She told the House today that that was not the case and the Prime Minister admits that the code has been breached but he has failed to take action. Now the House should take action by censuring this minister. What we are seeing here through the Prime Minister’s failure to act is the massive arrogance and hubris of the Howard government. We have seen it through the three weeks of parliamentary sittings, best summarised by the Deputy Prime Minister’s statement at the end of one of the question time periods when he said: ‘We won. That is about the end of it.’ Basically, the parliament and the opposition can go jump.</para>
<para>We can find conflicts of interest relating to $400 million funding programs. We can find maladministration relating to significant grants but, according to the government and the Deputy Prime Minister, the government won and that is about the end of it. It is true that the government won the election but it does not own the money of this country. That is owned by the Australian taxpayers and part of the legitimate role of the opposition is to say that it should be spent properly, that the ministerial code of conduct should be complied with and this joke of a minister should be dismissed from the executive government.</para>
<para>We have seen a record level of rorting, the shocking abuse of public money through the regional pork rorts and the secret SONA slush fund. In the case of the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, we have seen a record display of ministerial meltdown. The Minister for Veterans’ Affairs has only been in the job for six weeks but she has already racked up a serious conflict of interest through the infamous and well-named Ken Crooke and through the breach of the ministerial code of conduct. She knew about the directorship. She knew he had not lodged the paperwork or made the statement about the breach and the conflict of interest. We have also seen the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs twice mislead the parliament about the Horse Australia project in Rockhampton. We have seen one extraordinary statement of ministerial correction prior to question time to try and get Mr Abbott off the hook, given his misleading of the public earlier in the day. We have seen umpteen lost letters and grant announcements. She still cannot tell the parliament how many of these lost letters have emerged since the election to be date-stamped and sent out as part of her maladministration. We have seen her extraordinary inability to answer questions in the House of Representatives, yesterday hiding behind her feeble statement. Plus we have seen her problems in the media in trying to explain whether or not her husband works for her and whether or not he has a parliamentary email address. All of this is contrary to the ministerial code of conduct. What we have seen from Minister Kelly is a land-speed record for ministerial meltdown. She has had problem after problem and inability after inability to explain herself in the House of Representatives. You know she is going badly when you hear the whispering on the government back bench saying, ‘Bring back Danna’ or ‘Crikey! She makes Wilson look good’ or ‘Even Bronwyn would be doing better than this.’</para>

<para>—This is how well she is going. On Brisbane radio earlier today the member for Fisher said, ‘I’m not suggesting for a moment that Ms Kelly has handled this matter as elegantly as we could have. I do understand the frustration when a number of questions are asked and what do appear to be less than complete answers are given.’ The host of the radio program said, ‘She looked highly evasive though, Peter, didn’t she?’ The member for Fisher replied, ‘Well look, I’m not suggesting that she has performed well at all.’</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>You’re going bad when the member for Fisher puts in the slipper! This is a bloke who cannot even open a toilet door, and he is saying, ‘The minister’s got to be flushed away.’ She is hopelessly incompetent. She has been found guilty of maladministration and breaches. She cannot answer questions. She hides behind the statement that was made yesterday. I have to say that this statement of course looked simple enough. To members in the House yesterday, who got a copy of the tabled statement, it looked pretty simple: 2½ pages of verbiage from the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs. But it turned out that it was actually an encyclopaedia of information. Every single thing you could conceivably ask the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs could be answered by the statement. If you had asked her yesterday who was going to win the second race at Randwick, she would have said it was in the statement. If you had asked her what Santa is going to bring you for Christmas, it was in the statement. Who was going to win the footy next year? It is all in the statement.</para>
<para>This is a minister who humiliated herself yesterday with an inability to handle the basic discharge of executive government by answering questions in the House of Representatives. In reality, she has no explanation for her behaviour and no defence for the rorting, the maladministration and the breach of the ministerial code of conduct. Yesterday, she was hauling that folder up and down, clinging to it like a security blanket. We were all wondering what was in the folder—probably 200 copies of the statement. That is the best she can do.</para>
<para>It is a minister who has been guilty of gross incompetence, breaching the ministerial code of conduct, losing letters, losing grants—massive maladministration over a six-week period; a land-speed record for ministerial meltdown. She should go and this Prime Minister at long last should display some decency in standards with regard to his executive government and find himself a new Minister for Veterans’ Affairs.</para>

<para>—I second the motion. Another calamitous day, with the member for Dawson well and truly up Dawsons Creek. Just like yesterday, she was relying on her statement about the Horse Australia grant. Such was her reliance on the statement, no matter what we asked, she referred to her statement. Even when we stopped asking about horse rorts and started asking about milk rorts, she still referred to her statement. Today, we learnt a couple of new things. The first thing was that we got the collective noun for rorts: a batch of rorts. So when we asked her, ‘How many letters?’, she told us there was a batch of letters. The second thing we learnt today was that the ministerial code of conduct had not been complied with. The relevant documentation had not been filled out and no statement had been obtained—a breach of the code of conduct. Never mind, the Prime Minister was happy to excuse it.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>When we asked the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs about Mr Crooke’s retention of the directorship and the question of conflict of interest, she said she gave Mr Crooke permission to retain his directorship on the condition that he would not carry out work as a director of this company. It was extraordinary. Presumably he told the minister he would not carry out this work. But he went off to the Queensland minister for primary industries, armed with his business cards as a director of that company, in the company of other directors and personnel from A2 Dairy Marketing Pty Ltd. Who was it that Mr Crooke was purporting to introduce as his replacement at the meeting with Mr Palaszczuk? No-one else at the meeting was introduced in a government or public liaison capacity. Beyond that, the minister told us she did learn of this meeting. Clearly that implied a breach of the code of conduct because Mr Crooke, notwithstanding whatever understandings he had given the minister, went to this meeting and talked about matters to do with the A2 milk project. But did she advise the Prime Minister when she became aware of his attendance at this meeting of the breach of the code of conduct? No, she did not, and she answered in the House, ‘No, no, no.’ It was a matter of no concern to her. The ministerial code of conduct is a matter of no concern to her.</para>
<para>We believe that this minister needs to be censured for her breach of the ministerial code of conduct. We believe she needs to be censured for misleading the House. We asked her again today how is it that she could believe that a press release was sent out at the time of her signing the Horse Australia grant yet, at the same time, write to Mrs Clelland of Horse Australia asking her to keep news of the grant confidential. She had no explanation for that matter. Notwithstanding that, when the Prime Minister says that he believes the principal charge against this minister is about that Horse Australia grant, that is not correct. The question which the Leader of the Opposition proposed was about the grant to A2 Dairy Marketers and the fact that $1.2 million of taxpayers’ money went to a company, the lobbyist for whom was a staff member in her office. The fact is that the minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and Prime Minister have been unable to give us an acceptable explanation as to how this occurred. They have not been able to give us an acceptable explanation for this breach of the ministerial code of conduct.</para>
<para>We have a minister who has breached the ministerial code of conduct, misled the parliament and the people of Australia and not produced documentation to back up her claims that this is all about clerical errors. You would believe it was a departmental madman if you took the minister at her word on this. She has not come clean with the Australian people. She has improperly awarded $1.27 million to the A2 milk company. She has failed to deal properly with the conflict of interest issues involving her employment of Mr Crooke. What a calamity! The House deserves better than this. We deserve proper explanations for what has happened with these grants. We deserve the provision of documentation, and we deserve to have ministers who can administer this program in the public interest, not in the National Party’s electoral interest, not as some kind of National Party slush fund but something genuinely supporting regional Australia. We have had grants to the city—$220,000 in the electorate of Wentworth. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—Let us turn to the subject matter of the allegations made against the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs. The first allegation is that she improperly made a grant to the horse centre in Rockhampton. It should now be abundantly clear, even to the slow learners opposite, that the grant was quite properly approved on 31 August, prior to the commencement of the caretaker period. All that happened was that a hardworking departmental liaison officer, in error—it was a minor clerical error—date-stamped letters 2 December that had been signed on 31 August.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Then there is the allegation that she improperly employed a Mr Ken Crooke. As she has made abundantly clear in statements to this House both written and oral, she was aware of his consultancy work for A2 milk and required him to sever his commercial relationship with A2 milk prior to his employment, and he did so. The third allegation is that the meeting which Mr Crooke subsequently had with the Queensland Minister for Primary Industry and Fisheries was in breach of guidelines. As Mr Crooke has pointed out in his statement, which was tabled to the public last week, the consultancy arrangement had terminated and he only went to that meeting as a courtesy because an earlier meeting had been cancelled by the Queensland minister.</para>
<para>The fourth allegation asks: how could she have believed that the grant to the Rockhampton horse centre had been announced, given that she had written to the proponent of the scheme saying that the announcement would be made by Senator Boswell? It is simple—she understandably thought that Senator Boswell had issued a press release. There is nothing sinister about that. The fifth allegation claims that she must have misled the parliament because she said on Queensland radio on 17 September that the Queensland minister supported the project and he had not put out a press release about it. There are many ways of finding out the attitude of a Queensland minister apart from either (a) having a press release from him or (b) being informed about a meeting in breach of a statement that you had earlier made to the parliament. She told us precisely how it had happened today.</para>
<para>Finally, the sixth allegation against the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs is that she failed to adhere to the ministerial guidelines in respect of her non-requirement of a formal statement of interest from Mr Ken Crooke. As the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs has made abundantly clear to this parliament, it was a very short-term contract of just three months. As the Prime Minister has made clear to the parliament, yes, it was a technical breach but the fact of the matter is that there was nothing wrong with any of the grants that were handled by the minister when she was the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. There has been nothing improper, nothing immoral and nothing corrupt about her behaviour. On those grounds, she certainly does not deserve to be sacked because of what is at most a mere technical breach. In fact, she has abundantly complied with the substance of the guidelines. Let me quote her statement, ‘I was aware of Mr Crooke’s consultancy work for A2 milk and required him to sever his commercial relationship prior to his employment.’ As Mr Crooke said, ‘By arrangement with De-Anne Kelly I ended my consultancy work with A2 milk when I entered into this short-term contract with her.’</para>
<para>What are the ministerial guidelines all about? The ministerial guidelines are all about ensuring that there is no conflict of interest—and the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs did precisely that. She informed herself of the relevant issues and she required her short-term staff member to do everything that could possibly be required under the spirit of these guidelines. There was no conflict of interest.</para>

<para>—Mr Speaker, I draw your attention to page 57 of yesterday’s <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> and, in particular, to the ruling by Deputy Speaker Causley when he sat down the member for Wills and said that in this parliament ‘you cannot criticise or attack another member in this House—only by substantive motion.’ I put to you that this weakens the capacity of the opposition to criticise the government in the conventional way, each day, through the matter of public importance debate. I think this sets an appalling precedent in the House—that opposition members cannot be critical of ministers during an MPI debate. Will you undertake to overrule this shocking precedent and ensure that the Deputy Speaker is made aware of the standing orders and <inline font-style="italic">House of Representatives Practice</inline> and—with the very legitimate speech that was being given by the member for Wills—that similar speeches in the future will not be interrupted and censored in this way?</para>

<para>—Mr Speaker, on Tuesday you responded to a matter raised by me with you on 2 December regarding Michael Long and his supporters, who were prevented from having their photographs taken with the Aboriginal flag on the forecourt. Unfortunately, the account you gave to the parliament is disputed. Michael Long and around 10 other people did not approach Australian Federal Police Protective Service officers; they were approached when they reached the forecourt.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I seek your guidance and ask that you clarify with AFPPS officers the following: firstly, that the group were not to include the Aboriginal flag in photos because it was ‘part of a protest’, according to the instruction given by the Federal Police Protective Service officers; secondly, that the T-shirts that they were wearing, which read ‘The long walk; where is the love?’ may also have been inappropriate because they were part of a protest; and, thirdly, that they would have to move to Federation Mall if they wanted to take photographs. Mr Speaker, despite the advice to you, no photographs were taken in Federation Mall. In fact, the group instead asked the officers whether they could take photographs at the Aboriginal mosaic near the fountain.</para>

<para>—Mr Speaker, it is important that you again ask the Federal Police for their advice. My advice is that the officers contacted their superiors, and after about five minutes the group were told that they could take photographs at the mosaic but not with the Aboriginal flag, which I remind you is an official flag under the Flags Act. Could you please investigate this matter further? I have a statement from this group which I have sent to you that makes it clear that the group remained polite but were deeply offended. In your statement, you said that, as far as the AFPPS officers were aware, no-one in the group was offended. Mr Speaker, I ask—</para>

<para>—On 7 December, the member for Oxley asked me a series of questions concerning the sound reinforcement system in the chamber. As members may know, sound levels are monitored and controlled by an operator in the booth at the rear of the chamber. The operator switches microphones on and off according to the directions of the chair, and is instructed to do so precisely when members receive the call, conclude their contributions or are requested to resume their seats. The operator is required to make a judgment as to the required sound level, taking into account the general noise level in the chamber and the loudness and proximity to the microphone of the particular member. Variations in the volume can occur, and the audio level is monitored closely to ensure even coverage.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I have had the videotape of question time on 7 December examined. There is no evidence on the tape that the member for O’Connor’s microphone was turned on while he was getting a glass of water. However, the member for O’Connor’s microphone was turned on prematurely later during question time, when he made a point of order. The Leader of the Opposition’s microphone was on at the appropriate times and off at the appropriate times, as directed by the call of the chair. The member for Grayndler’s microphone was on when he had the call. There is no evidence of the Leader of the House’s microphone being on when he did not have the call. It was at times noisy in the chamber during question time on 7 December, and it may have been difficult for members to hear at certain times. The system is being closely monitored and will be fully tested at the next opportunity after the House rises.</para>

<quote>
<para class="bold">THE SPEAKER’S SCHEDULE OF OUTSTANDING GOVERNMENT RESPONSES TO REPORTS OF HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND JOINT COMMITTEES</para>
<para class="block">(also incorporating reports tabled and details of Government responses made in the period between 23 June 2004, the date of the last schedule, and 9 December 2004) 9 December 2004</para>
<para class="bold">THE SPEAKER’S SCHEDULE OF OUTSTANDING GOVERNMENT RESPONSES TO COMMITTEE REPORTS</para>
<para class="block">On 9 December 2004, the Government presented its response to a schedule of outstanding Government responses to parliamentary committee reports tabled in the House of Representatives on 24 June 2004.</para>
<para class="block">It is Government policy to respond to parliamentary committee reports within three months of their presentation. In 1978 the Fraser Government implemented a policy of responding in the House by ministerial statement within six months of the tabling of a committee report. In 1983, the Hawke Government reduced this response time to three months but continued the practice of responding by ministerial statement. The Keating Government generally responded by means of a letter to a committee chair, with the letter being tabled in the House at the earliest opportunity. In 1996, the Howard Government affirmed the commitment to respond to relevant parliamentary committee reports within three months of their presentation. The Government also undertook to clear, as soon as possible, the backlog of reports arising from previous Parliaments.</para>
<para class="block">The attached schedule lists committee reports tabled and government responses to House and joint committee reports made since the last schedule was presented on 24 June 2004. It also lists reports for which the House has received no government response. A schedule of outstanding responses will continue to be presented at approximately six monthly intervals, generally in the last sitting weeks of the winter and spring sittings.</para>
<para class="block">The schedule does not include advisory reports on bills introduced into the House of Representatives unless the reports make recommendations which are wider than the provisions of the bills and which could be the subject of a government response. The Government’s response to these reports is apparent in the resumption of consideration of the relevant legislation by the House. Also not included are reports from the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, the House of Representatives Committee of Members’ Interests, the Committee of Privileges, the Publications Committee and the Selection Committee. Government responses to reports of the Public Works Committee are normally reflected in motions for the approval of works after the relevant report has been presented and considered. Reports from other committees which do not include recommendations are not included.</para>
<para class="block">Reports of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit primarily make administrative recommendations but may make policy recommendations. A government response is required in respect of such policy recommendations made by the committee. However, responses to administrative recommendations are made in the form of an Executive Minute provided to, and subsequently tabled by, the committee. Agencies responding to administrative recommendations are required to provide an Executive Minute within 6 months of tabling a report. The committee monitors the provision of such responses. The schedule includes reports with policy recommendations.</para>

<para>—The document I am tabling today provides a compelling picture of a disgraceful financial arrangement between the Australian Labor Party and a Commonwealth government agency. It is an arrangement entered into while the Australian Labor Party was in office, charged with providing good government and looking after the interests of taxpayers.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>In 1992 the Australian Property Group (APG), on behalf of the Commonwealth, entered into a lease with John Curtin House Ltd to accommodate the Audit Office in Centenary House. As we know, John Curtin House Ltd is a Labor Party company.</para>
<para>The agreement comprises:</para>
<list type="bullet">
<item>
<para>A 15-year lease with an option of a further five years;</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>A starting rent based on a much higher position 15 months before any agreement was reached, and then escalating that figure by more than 10 per cent per year until the building was completed; and</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>An escalation clause so that the rent rose by nine per cent every year for the duration of the 15-year term of the lease.</para>
</item>
</list>
<para>After considerable pressure, the Keating government established an inquiry in 1994. However, the findings of the 1994 inquiry did not end the disquiet.</para>
<para>Earlier this year the Senate passed a motion calling on the government to instigate a review of the findings of the 1994 inquiry in the light of later evidence. Former Justice David Hunt was commissioned to inquire into the Centenary House lease. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Hunt and his team for the hard work they put into this inquiry.</para>
<para>I table a document that outlines the differences between the findings of the 1994 inquiry and the 2004 inquiry.</para>
<para>Are the terms of the lease reasonable?</para>
<para>Unlike the 1994 inquiry, Commissioner Hunt found that the terms of the lease were neither reasonable nor prudent from the Commonwealth’s perspective but “exceptionally beneficial” for the Labor Party.</para>
<para>The inquiry found that the rent paid was well above market:</para>
<para>“the rent it [the Commonwealth] has paid for the Audit Office space in Centenary House has always been well over market and will probably remain so.”</para>
<para>When the lease commenced in September 1993, the fair market rate for office space in Centenary House was $290 per square metre a year. But the actual starting rent paid by the Commonwealth was $367.95 per square metre a year.</para>
<para>By September 2004 the Commonwealth was locked into paying over three times the fair market rent for its office space in Centenary House.</para>
<para>I table a graph based on valuation evidence presented to this inquiry which shows the stark difference between the fair market value of the lease at Centenary House and what the Commonwealth actually pays.</para>
<para>Commissioner Hunt also found a number of the terms of the lease are unprecedented, particularly the way the starting rent was calculated and the fixed nine per cent per annum escalator over 15 years. Indeed because of the rent escalation, Commissioner Hunt found that the lease amounts to a “high risk futures contract”.</para>
<para>The commissioner also found that the lease as a whole is not supported by reference to any other transaction occurring in the market at the time.</para>
<para>The commissioner found at the end of the lease the ALP will emerge with a building fully, or almost fully, paid for by the taxpayer. For the ALP it will have been constructed at no financial risk and having had the benefits of a regular and significant surplus cash flow throughout the term.</para>
<para>In simple terms, the inquiry found that the lease represented a huge windfall to the ALP at the expense of the Commonwealth:</para>
<para>“The result was very unsatisfactory for the Commonwealth and exceptionally beneficial for John Curtin House Ltd.”</para>
<para>Commissioner Hunt points out, given the levels of rent to be paid under the lease, the Commonwealth should have been able to acquire the building for a nominal consideration at the end of the lease—since the Commonwealth has effectively paid for the building.</para>
<para>It found that there “had been no negotiation of the terms of the lease in the commonly understood sense”.</para>
<para>The commissioner made adverse findings against former Commonwealth officers in a number of agencies.</para>
<para>Dominic Collins, the Commonwealth officer responsible for negotiating the lease, was thoroughly out of his depth and overwhelmed by the negotiators acting for the ALP. Mr Collins never understood the strength of the Commonwealth’s position or, if he did, he failed to take advantage of it.</para>
<para>The inquiry found that the lease was not negotiated with commonsense in mind:</para>
<para>“Notwithstanding the firmly expressed and strongly pursued wish of the Auditor-General, Mr John Taylor, to be accommodated in the Parliamentary Triangle, it was not essential for the Audit Office to be housed there. Other accommodation was available elsewhere in Canberra where the market was lower than in Barton. Nor were the needs or wishes of any other Commonwealth agency at that time so great as to require the abandonment of ordinary principles of commonsense in the negotiations for the Centenary House lease.”</para>
<para>Commissioner Hunt found that systemic administrative failures in the Audit Office and the Australian Property Group such as failure to investigate the terms of the lease, a lack of candour between Commonwealth officers and lack of understanding of arrangements for funding property expenses also contributed to the extraordinary lease.</para>
<para>The inquiry found that the Department of Finance, at that time, failed in its obligations to maintain budgetary integrity:</para>
<para>“Budgetary integrity is not protected or maintained if agencies can, on behalf of the Commonwealth, enter into commitments they cannot afford.”</para>
<para>Although the commission found that no criticism should be levelled at the conduct of the ALP and John Curtin House, or that there was any evidence of corruption, the fact nonetheless remains that this lease—so very disadvantageous to the Commonwealth and extraordinarily generous to the ALP—was negotiated under the authority of the Keating Labor government.</para>
<para>Responsibility for all this maladministration firmly rests with the government at that time and a succession of Labor ministers who would appear, at best, to have been asleep at the wheel. Their inability to manage a government department says volumes about their ability to manage an entire economy.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Improper fee offered to Commonwealth</inline>
</para>
<para>At some stage during the course of dealings between Labor’s representatives Lend Lease and the APG, a so-called ‘fee’ of $50,000 was offered to the APG. The 1994 inquiry found that, whilst the offer should not have been made, the person making the offer, Ms Penny Morris of Lend Lease—a former official of the Australian Property Group—did not perceive the impropriety of making the offer.</para>
<para>However, the further examination of witnesses and documents by this inquiry allowed Commissioner Hunt to conclude that not only was the offer improper but as a former Commonwealth official Penny Morris knew of its impropriety.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Labor’s view</inline>
</para>
<para>This inquiry found the rent for the Centenary House was way over market.</para>
<para>The inquiry found the negotiating process was badly lacking.</para>
<para>Despite these findings, remarkably, the Labor Party submitted to the inquiry that:</para>
<para>“a new high quality building for the Commonwealth to occupy could not be obtained at that time on any terms more favourable to the Commonwealth than those upon which JCH built Centenary House.”</para>
<para>The inquiry found that unlike other political parties, Labor regularly leased its premises to the Commonwealth:</para>
<para>“Only the Labor Party has leased commercial office space to the Commonwealth with any regularity and frequency. It has done so systematically in John Curtin House since 1975 and in Centenary House since 1993.”</para>
<para>It is clear the ALP did know precisely what was happening. In 1992 former Liberal senator Warwick Parer warned the Labor Party, before it had signed the lease, that the deal was unsound.</para>
<para>The inquiry also found that the Labor Party’s national executive was informed:</para>
<para>“The National Executive was aware at all times of the essential ingredients of the lease transaction.”</para>
<para>Perhaps it is worth inquiring as to who was on the ALP national executive at this time, but I think that is something the inquiry has left for others.</para>
<para>We now ask why would the ALP—which was in government at that time—agree to something so unsatisfactory to the taxpayer?</para>
<para>Commissioner Hunt notes that, following the 1990 federal election, the Australian Labor Party found itself with a substantial debt of $4 million. The ALP took the view that it was important to find some way of placing itself on a more secure financial footing for the future.</para>
<para>This then set the parameters for any leasing arrangement of the proposed Centenary House—the building would be self-funded and would generate a cash surplus every year.</para>
<para>Labor wanted the “‘provision of a long term income generating asset which will assist the ALP to become self-sufficient with respect to campaign and administrative funding’ and ‘minimisation of costs and risks and fixing of variable parameters’, including interest rates and rent escalation.”</para>
<para>So, rather than the terms of the Centenary House lease being negotiated they were decided in advance by representatives of the ALP based on what was necessary to present a risk-free investment.</para>
<para>Why did this inquiry reach different conclusions to the 1994 inquiry?</para>
<para>It is important to be aware of the resources available to this inquiry and the way in which it was conducted because it provides an interesting comparison with the previous inquiry set up by the ALP.</para>
<para>The 2004 inquiry was conducted pursuant to the Royal Commissions Act 1902. The commission was provided with appropriate administrative and legal support, including senior and junior counsel assisting and a team of experienced solicitors.</para>
<para>By comparison, the 1994 inquiry was conducted informally and was largely guided by submissions filed by the parties and the documents they voluntarily provided.</para>
<para>In particular the 2004 inquiry found the parties to the 1994 inquiry generally provided a unified front, apart from the two Liberal Party parliamentarians who appeared unrepresented.</para>
<para>The use of a more adversarial procedure in this inquiry in order to test the common front presented by the parties in 1994, produced a much more detailed picture of the negotiations.</para>
<para>It demonstrated that the impression of a market-determined transaction was incorrect and misleading.</para>
<para>It is understandable that, with the limited resources obtained, and the absence of counsel assisting, it would have been difficult for the 1994 inquiry to obtain or manage the volume of documentation obtained by this inquiry.</para>
<para>It is also clear that counsel assisting this inquiry engaged in a much more thorough, critical and sceptical examination of witnesses than it would have been reasonably possible for the 1994 inquiry to have achieved with only the help of an administrative assistant.</para>
<para>Any government seriously wanting to inquire into these matters would have insisted on a better resourced, more rigorous approach. If the Keating government had properly established the 1994 inquiry and insisted on counsel assisting then it may—and I emphasise that—have uncovered the truth.</para>
<para class="block">
<inline font-weight="bold">Conclusion</inline>
</para>
<para>I have instructed my department to examine whether any action should be taken against any individuals who are the subject of an adverse finding in the royal commission report, particularly the finding of impropriety of the offer of a $50,000 payment.</para>
<para>This inquiry has demonstrated that as a result of the maladministration of Commonwealth funds and resources by the Labor Party in government, Australian taxpayers propped up the Labor Party’s discredited property deal. Ministers at the time did not act in the public interest and they failed in their duty to protect taxpayers.</para>
<para>The inquiry has found that at a fair market rate the Commonwealth would have paid $25.66 million over the course of the 15-year lease.</para>
<para>Instead the Commonwealth will have paid more than $68 million by the time the lease expires.</para>
<para>This means that taxpayers will have overpaid in excess of $42 million by 2007 to help finance Labor’s property deal and their election campaigns.</para>
<para>This inquiry has shown that this whole lease is inappropriate and improper.</para>
<para>John Curtin House, the Australian Labor Party and Mark Latham, at the very least, have a moral duty to immediately agree to a renegotiation of the lease on terms that are fairer to the Australian taxpayer.</para>
<para>I table the ministerial statement and I present a copy of the report of the inquiry by the Hon. David Hunt, Royal Commissioner, into Centenary House.</para>

<para>—I will take the time in speaking on this debate to look at the royal commissioner’s report. I am interested in the Attorney’s interjections, because he believes there is a moral duty that can be performed, even if it is contrary to the laws of this country—which is an interesting position for him to take—and even if it is contrary to the findings of the royal commission. So I am going to take the time to go through this. What is the reality? I know it is painfully clear that the government is aware of this, as well as the Attorney, because they have waited until 4 o’clock on the last sitting day of the parliament, when everyone is packing up and ready to go home, to get this report out. As they know, there is no interest in it, there is no value for them, because the findings that they set out to have this commission make have not been made. They know that after spending $4 million plus of government money, of taxpayers’ money, all it has shown is that, according to the words of the royal commission, no criticism can be levelled at the ALP or John Curtin House.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>It is no wonder to us that they have sought to bury this report in the way that they have. I feel for the Attorney because he put on a brave face when he considered the report of the royal commission today, but it is very clear that there is nothing in this report that provides any foundation for the allegations that were made day in, day out by the Minister for Health and Ageing and others here. It has been a shocking waste of public money and it has been one of the coalition’s greatest obsessions. It actually seems to us that advancement in the Liberal Party depended on a quite unhealthy interest in Centenary House. In the early nineties we know it was the member for Mackellar’s greatest obsession, and she is even here today to make sure that she continues that. It obviously did not work, in her situation, to provide the advancement that she might have thought, but it was nevertheless her great obsession. Then it was Senator Campbell’s obsession; most recently it has been Senator Brandis’s obsession. Of course in this place we have all been treated to lectures day in and day out about Centenary House from the Minister for Health and Ageing. But now, not for the first time but for the second time, Labor has been cleared of any impropriety.</para>
<para>Let us not forget that this is the second royal commission into Centenary House. In fact, two of the last five royal commissions ordered by the Commonwealth have been into Centenary House. You would think that, of all of the pressing issues that there might be in running the country—social issues and problems that might be investigated, the history of a whole range of other matters, and a number of our concerns we could list that have never been subject to a royal commission—the government might have found some other things to spend this money on, but not them. It is a measure, I think, of their arrogance that they would waste this money on a wholly political exercise.</para>
<para>Let us look as some of the royal commission findings, because I think that members, particularly on the other side of the House, will be enlightened that the Attorney decided to leave a few of these out of his statement to the House, so much so that I am not sure that he actually read the same copy of the royal commission’s report that I did. There is an entire chapter in the report which is entitled ‘Whether John Curtin House Ltd or the Australian Labor Party should be criticised’. I will read, for the benefit of the House, a number of quotes from the commissioner’s report:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">… it is appropriate that I do state that no … criticism should be levelled at the conduct of John Curtin House Ltd or the Australian Labor Party.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I think even members on the other side of the House would be able to understand what that means. The Attorney himself includes that in his ministerial statement. But still the Attorney can come in here and suggest somehow that there is something that is improper, even though this is the second time that the Labor Party and John Curtin House have been cleared. I am sure the minister for health will try to also do this. The royal commission also found:</para>

<quote>
<para class="block">No conduct on the part of John Curtin House Ltd was unconscionable or constituted undue influence, unfair pressure or unfair tactics such as might in another context amount to conduct warranting statutory or equitable relief.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Again, the first law officer of the Commonwealth is sitting here, yelling interjections across the table, knowing full well that the royal commission made this finding which said that there was no conduct which constituted any of those matters which might amount to conduct warranting statutory or equitable relief. It also found that the ALP was absolutely scrupulous in ensuring that the highest standards of propriety were observed. As I said, there was an entire chapter devoted to this. If members in this House are truly interested in the matter, may I recommend that they read chapter 15, which makes clear what the position and the findings of the royal commission are in relation to the Labor Party and John Curtin House. As for the government’s contention that there was some sort of sweetheart deal made, the royal commission found this:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">There was no evidence before this Inquiry or the 1994 Inquiry that any Labor politician or executive exercised any undue or improper pressure, tactics or influence over any public servant who had involvement with the transaction.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is pretty clear, even for members on the other side of the House. The commissioner went on:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Nor is there any solid foundation in the evidence to justify a finding that any of those public servants acted in an inappropriate fashion calculated to please his or her political masters ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The report is absolutely unequivocal about this. The report shows there was no suggestion of corruption, fraud or political impropriety on the part of any person involved in the Centenary House lease. It shows that no misleading statements were made in the negotiations which led to the execution of the lease. The idea that the Keating government had some hand in forcing the Audit Office to enter into this lease has been proven, once and for all, to be an absolute furphy. Nothing could be clearer than that.</para>
<para>But the report goes even further. Observers of this parliament would be aware that the whole driving force for the establishment of the royal commission—and we remember it only too well on this side of the House, because the minister for health was like a broken record raising this matter, day in, day out in the House—was a suggestion that the Commonwealth, the landlord, was unable to renegotiate the rent for the Audit Office. What did the royal commission find on this point? This point is central to the whole debate and makes a mockery of the Attorney’s ministerial statement. The royal commission found on this point that no renegotiation was possible. Let me quote once again from the report. Minister Abbott, who I know will be following me in this debate, may wish to take careful note of these findings, because I know it is an area that he has a particular interest in. The report says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">When the Audit Office attempted on a number of occasions to renegotiate or vary the terms of the lease, the directors of John Curtin House Ltd stated that the company was unable to reduce the rent payable under the lease because of its obligations under its contracts with the project’s financiers and the directors would be in breach of their own fiduciary duties to the company to do so.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This is an important quote for members of the House to be aware of. It goes on:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The directors sought and obtained legal and financial advice about their own position and that of the company. The contracts with the financiers of the Centenary House project prevented the company from varying the terms of the lease in such a way as to reduce the rent.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The government cannot come in here and say time and time again, as they choose to, ‘The rent should be renegotiated; the lease should be renegotiated—there is a moral obligation for it to be renegotiated,’ when they know that the company that could renegotiate, in their terms, is legally prevented from doing so. The commissioner has so found. This puts an end to that argument once and for all.</para>
<para>Day in, day out Minister Abbott came into this place to demand that the ALP renegotiate the rent. The royal commission, as I have said, has found what the directors of John Curtin House Ltd were saying all along: such a renegotiation was not possible. I note that the Attorney is now suggesting across the table that it is only a contractual arrangement—which I seem to remember the Treasurer being asked a question about during question time earlier this week or maybe last week. There was a question of payments about to be made to the outgoing head of Telstra, Mr Ziggy Switkowski. It is interesting because Mr Costello, the Treasurer and a colleague of the ministers who are here at the table, Minister Ruddock and Minister Abbott, made very clear that the government thought that the payments to Mr Switkowski were entirely appropriate because the company had indicated that they would honour the contract. The Treasurer said:</para>

His ministerial colleague answers a question in this House, saying, ‘On our side of the House we think you must abide by a contract because that is a legal obligation, and we’re all nice fellows on this side who make sure we keep to our word and keep to the documents we have signed.’ But, astoundingly, the Attorney is the one person who thinks that, if you sign a contract, you should not stick to it.</para>

<para>—It is interesting—and I am disappointed I have to go back to Contracts 101 for the Attorney and point out that you need more than one party to a contract and that the other party might have to consent to a change—because the findings actually make clear that the other parties to the contract, the banks or the financiers, would not have consented to such a change. So it is quite wrong and quite ridiculous for the government to come in, time and time again, with the normal conduct of the Attorney, which is just to assert that something can be done, the same way he asserts a number of other legal things—from the way evidence obtained by torture can be used, to all sorts of other legal obligations—and just assumes that no-one will bother to find out if he is telling the truth.</para>

<para>In this instance, I will put my money on the findings that the royal commissioner has made. We spent $4 million of taxpayers’ money to get his view. His view is not consistent with the Attorney-General’s. I have to say that on this side of the House and—I am pretty willing to punt—in the rest of the community the findings of the commissioner will be believed ahead of the views of the Attorney-General or the Minister for Health and Ageing.</para>
<para>The whole basis for this inquiry—the alleged unreasonableness of the directors of John Curtin House in refusing to renegotiate the lease—has been completely demolished and put finally to rest by this second royal commission, even though it was set up in the most political of contexts. People will remember that it was established in the lead-up to the federal election in a clear attempt to discredit the Labor Party and to distract it from fighting the election campaign. Members of this House will also remember that it was initially timed to report on 15 October, the day before many people believed and expected that the federal election would be called. This second royal commission has trodden over ground that is now 15 years old. It conducted 37 days of public hearings, examined more than 80,000 pages of documents and issued 75 compulsory notices to produce. Despite all this, there is nothing that reflects adversely on the Labor Party. The royal commission has been an expensive embarrassment for the government. They have thrown away nearly $4 million of taxpayers’ money in pursuit of one of their own political obsessions. They are the ones who owe an apology to the Australian public.</para>

<para>—Earlier today, we had members opposite frothing and foaming about $222,000 worth of public money which, they say, has been improperly spent. What we have today is the report of a royal commission which has demonstrated that $42 million was wrongly paid to the Australian Labor Party. It is true that the royal commission did not make adverse findings against the Labor Party, but it did make adverse findings against the Labor government. This is the most spectacular piece of maladministration in the history of the Commonwealth of Australia and the beneficiary has been the Australian Labor Party.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I used to talk about the ‘lease fleece’ and the ‘rent rort rip-off’. ‘A mere $36 million,’ I used to say. I am prepared to say that I misled the parliament and I am sorry. We now have the royal commission’s report—it is $42 million that has been ripped off the Australian public by members opposite. This is the mother of all rorts, orchestrated by the Labor government for the Australian Labor Party. They knew from the beginning that this whole thing was a set-up. This whole thing was a set-up from the start. Let me quote from the royal commission’s report:</para>

<para class="block">There it is: the Australian Labor Party out there on a tax scam—as well as a scam to rip off the taxpayer—and minimising its costs and risks. The Labor Party were in tremendous financial trouble. So what did they do? They went into business—funny business. Not business with the private sector, because they knew no private sector businessman would be stupid enough to enter into this deal. They could not be sure of the private sector, but they could be sure that their own government would enter into a deal of such monumental incompetence and stupidity.</para>
<para>Let me quote the report of the royal commission and detail all of the Australian government agencies and instrumentalities which acted incompetently, on Labor’s watch, to benefit the Australian Labor Party:</para>

<para class="block">The royal commissioner finds there was a rort. He finds that it should never have been done. He finds that the national executive of the Australian Labor Party was aware at all times of the essential ingredients of the lease transaction.</para>
<para>For the benefit of the shrieker opposite, let me just point out who was on that national executive of the Australian Labor Party which knew at all times the essential ingredients of the lease transaction. There was the member for Brand—the shadow leader, the leader-in-waiting—yet again. There was Senator John Faulkner, known to Senator Conroy as Frankenstein. There was Senator Robert Ray. There was the member for Brisbane. There was Senator Peter Cook. There was Senator George Campbell. There was Senator Mark Bishop. There was Senator Chris Evans. There was Senator Sue Mackay. They were all members of the national executive of the Australian Labor Party, which was at all times aware of the essential ingredients of the lease transaction—a lease transaction which should never have been entered into. It was the most incompetent deal in the history of the Commonwealth. They are the guilty party. These are the guilty men. They are guilty in government. As members of the national executive of the Australian Labor Party, they are guilty of knowing about the deal and not doing anything to prevent it.</para>
<para>They were warned. It is not just wisdom after the event that the government now has. Before this deal was ever entered into, members opposite were warned by Senator Warwick Parer, an opposition senator. They were warned back in 1992 of precisely what this problem would be. On 15 January 1992, Senator Warwick Parer issued a press release which said this:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Now that this appalling rort is exposed ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">He knew that before the deal was even signed. If he knew that, why didn’t the member for Brand and all these other geniuses know about it? The press release went on:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Now that this appalling rort is exposed, the Minister for Administrative Services, Senator Bolkus, must publicly advise the Australian Property Group to cease all further negotiations with the Australian Labor Party.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Senator Parer was absolutely right then. The royal commission is absolutely right, and it has found that this is the most incompetent deal in the history of the Commonwealth. And they are still benefiting from it and they are still defending it even this day.</para>
<para>We heard the member for Gellibrand say, ‘It is the law.’ Not even a partner in Slater and Gordon would fall for this one. But the member for Gellibrand comes into this House and says: ‘The law stops us from renegotiating this contract. The law makes us rip off the taxpayer. We are compelled by law to steal $42 million from the people of Australia.’ It is not the law; it is the contract. Mr Speaker, you may not be able to change the law but, by jeez, you can change the contract. Contracts get renegotiated every day, every minute and every hour. If there was a shred of decency about members opposite, they would be slinking out of this chamber today, going to their mortgage holders and saying, ‘We have got to renegotiate this mortgage.’ They may not be able to renegotiate the lease under the terms of the mortgage but they can sure renegotiate the mortgage. Go and talk to the bank. Come on, they are not that unreasonable. They do not want you to be embarrassed. They certainly do not want you to be ripping off the Australian taxpayer to the tune of $42 million a year. Ask them for a renegotiation and I think you will find them very cooperative indeed.</para>
<para>There is a challenge here, a fundamental challenge of ethics and morality. It is a challenge faced by the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition is the ultimate beneficiary of the $42 million now found to have been ripped off from the taxpayer by the Labor Party through this deal. We know he does not like Bob Hogg very much. We know Bob Hogg does not like him very much. Why doesn’t he say, ‘One in the eye for Bob Hogg,’ and repudiate Bob Hogg’s deal. Senator Parer and former Senator Bishop, now the member for Mackellar, are the real heroes of this story. They have consistently campaigned to expose this rip-off. There is one chapter left, and that is for the Leader of the Opposition to give back the money. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—Of course, we are approaching Christmas and, around Australia at Christmas time, families have certain traditions. Some always put up the Christmas tree on the same date; some always bake the Christmas cake on the same date. Today we are seeing the birth of another important Christmas tradition, and that is the last-sitting-day Minister Abbott fiasco. That is the new Christmas tradition in Australia. Let us remember the last sitting day we were here last year before we went on our Christmas break when Minister Abbott gave a stupid and disgraceful speech which then caused him to be repudiated by the Prime Minister. The first instalment of the Minister Abbott last-sitting-day fiasco was last year when he gave a speech which then led to headlines like these: ‘PM chides Abbott over low blow’, ‘PM bags Abbott’, ‘PM tells Abbott to drop personal jibes’, ‘Abbott told to mind his tongue’ and my personal favourite, ‘Howard tries to break a nasty Abbott’.</para>

<para>—We are now on the second instalment of the tradition of the last-sitting-day fiasco courtesy of Minister Abbott. It is kind of cute that this is the week in which <inline font-style="italic">The West Wing</inline> came back on Australian TV. Of course, in <inline font-style="italic">The West Wing</inline> the media advisers all hunker around late on a Friday afternoon. They talk about ‘putting out the trash’. Putting out the trash means late on Friday night they are going to slip out the stories that are so embarrassing for the government that they do not want any coverage of them.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Here we have, in this parliament today, the Australian equivalent of putting out the trash, because so embarrassing is this for the government that they have squeezed it in between a ministerial scandal and Christmas valedictories in the desperate hope that nobody notices. Why is the government so embarrassed? Mr Abbott’s last-sitting-day fiasco is really about this government wasting $4 million of taxpayers’ funds in a completely unnecessary royal commission. It is a first: a royal commission into a royal commission. And this government, for a political stunt, thought it was worth spending $4 million of taxpayers’ money.</para>
<para>This government wasted $71.32 per minute on this inquiry. Australian taxpayers contributed $4 million to this government’s political stunt—a royal commission into a royal commission. It cost $71.32 per minute of the inquiry. All of that money was wasted. They wasted $4 million to find what? Absolutely nothing. The government are putting out the trash today because they are embarrassed that they wasted that $4 million and found absolutely nothing. That is why we are back here with another end-of-sitting-day fiasco courtesy of Minister Abbott.</para>
<para>He must be a deeply embarrassed and sorrowful man today. Consequently, we saw his overacting at the dispatch box to hide his true disappointment. This has been a curious, odd, mad obsession writ large that started in 1994. He proudly announced that the first question he ever asked in this House was about Centenary House. It has been a decade-long obsession starting from the first day he was able to ask questions in this House. We all remember the performances that he used to put on at the end of question time. We used to refer to them as the ‘kicker’ because you would know that question time was about to be brought to an end when Minister Abbott got to his feet. This obsession was so absurd. I have just had a quick look at the statistics and let me tell you that Minister Abbott took 24 questions on Centenary House. Indeed, other government members and senators referred to Centenary House 68 times in questions without notice. This is truly amazing. It is a government out of an agenda and not knowing what to do next. There were 142 speeches made on the matter by government members.</para>
<para>Minister Abbott is in the depths of a decade-old mad obsession that has taken him absolutely nowhere. During the course of this decade-old mad obsession that has taken him absolutely nowhere, Minister Abbott used terminology against the Leader of the Opposition and others like ‘fraud’, ‘fake’ and ‘Tammany-Hall thug’. Today we have seen that bile choking Minister Abbott’s throat because, at the end of his decade-long obsession, having wasted $4 million of taxpayers’ money, he has found absolutely nothing. The Liberal Party stand exposed as having hijacked taxpayers’ funds for their own cheap political stunt. Here they are today, embarrassed and wounded, putting out the trash between a ministerial scandal and valedictories and hoping that no-one notices. Their mad obsession has been brought to an end as a spectacular failure for everybody involved in it.</para>
<para>I think it is a pity that the Attorney-General, as the first law officer, involved himself in this mess. It is one thing for the Leader of the House—who we all know is capable of these acts of obsession, who spent two weeks being hapless and helpless and who almost accidentally destroyed a speaker along way—to be involved in stunts and cheap political tricks like this; it is quite another matter for the chief law officer of the country to stoop so low. I say to the Attorney-General that he ought not to have done so.</para>
<para>Let us be absolutely clear about what this royal commission found—and you need to draw the distinction between what Mr Abbott ranted about and what he actually quoted. The only thing he quoted as a conclusion of the royal commission was that the royal commission used the word ‘inept’. If we were going to have that kind of moral outrage and ranting and raving about ineptness, we would see it in here about the Howard government every day. If there is going to be this kind of obligation put on ineptness, what has the Howard government got to say about accidentally mislaying $8.1 billion of Defence assets? I have not heard an explanation about that. If we want to talk about ineptness, I think mislaying $8 billion worth of stuff might be up there with ineptness. But, of course, we did not see any Howard government ministers’ heads rolling. We did not see any Howard government minister out there saying, ‘There is a moral obligation on the Howard government to resolve the matter of this ineptness—the $8.1 billion of stuff that we have accidentally lost.’ Of course they did not do that. The only thing that the minister could quote was the word ‘inept’, and inept is not a foundation at all for the rest of the speech that he gave in here. All the rest of that speech was flim-flam to try and hide his embarrassment that the bile that he used to spout about this matter is now scalding his throat as it sits there.</para>
<para>As we are about to embark on Christmas holidays—a very important event in the Christian calendar, with the birth of our Lord being celebrated around the world—I say that the Minister for Health and Ageing as well as others in the House might well remember that biblical injunction to not go looking for a speck in your brother’s eye and ignore the log in your own. I remind members of this House of that biblical injunction. Today this government effectively said, ‘The ministerial code of conduct does not matter. Rip that up. There is no code. You can do anything you like. It does not matter.’ The Prime Minister can get up at the dispatch box and say, ‘Yes, the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs breached the code, but code shmode. Who cares? There are no obligations. There are no rules. There are no responsibilities. Nothing happens if you do anything wrong.’</para>

<para>—As the House comes to an end for this year, in the tradition, I would like to extend first to you, Mr Speaker, brief though your occupancy in the chair has been, the very best of good wishes for Christmas and the New Year, to thank you for your many courtesies already to me and the House and to wish you and your family every happiness over the Christmas break. To the clerks—to Ian Harris and to Bernard Wright in particular, both of whom exemplify the very best traditions of independence and integrity in the discharge of their duties—we owe a very special thanks.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In the 30 or more years I have been in parliament, I have marvelled at the capacity of Hansard to make good sense of what many of us say. Unlike a lot of other members, I have never really bothered to correct my greens. I always thought it was a slightly impertinent thing to do. Can I say that, after 30 years, Hansard has never got me into trouble. So if I have got into any trouble, it has been all of my own making. But I do want to thank Hansard very warmly, along with the very wonderfully polite and friendly attendants who make our life as we sit here a lot more enjoyable. I do particularly wish them well. They are a very polite, friendly people. They dart around helping us, and I do want to especially wish them a very merry Christmas. To all the other parliamentary staff, the Commonwealth car pool and those who arrange the bookings—I was a little more familiar with the arrangements of travel bookings a few years ago than perhaps I am now, but I have not forgotten the enormous courtesy of all of those who do that—I do want to express my great gratitude to them.</para>
<para>This has been of course a remarkably active year. It has had the added spice of an election on 9 October, which was very pleasing for the coalition. We have had the opportunity of coming back for three weeks and that has been particularly important for the new members. There have been new members on both sides of the House and many of them are sitting in on this debate. I want to particularly welcome them again to the great institution of the national parliament of Australia. I hope all of them have a long stay. I say that very genuinely. We would be very happy if the numbers remained exactly as they are. I wish no ill will at all to new members on the other side of the House. We can live without winning seats like Prospect, Kingsford Smith and Watson, to name but three.</para>

<para>—Yes. To my good friend the member for Lowe, it was a bit negligent of us that he got there, but then he works it hard, and I understand that. We can live with that, with the status quo. I can genuinely say that I wish all of those members a long parliamentary life. If everybody stayed exactly where they were for a few years, it would be terrific. That applies to a large number of people.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>I especially say to the new members: ‘Welcome. I hope you have been made welcome.’ Speaking for myself on behalf of the coalition, I express my pride in the quality of the new members that have come into the government ranks. They come from very diverse backgrounds. They bring different talents and different skills and their own different personalities. Some of them came easily, and some of them had two fights—I can think of one who did: he had a preselection fight and then he had an election fight. For others, it all suddenly happened in a rush—I can think of somebody who falls into that category. I can think of other members who had to work very, very hard for eight, nine or 12 months to win seats from the other side of politics—one succeeded a very distinguished member of this House who had been a wonderful colleague for a number of years. They have all brought something new and something different. That is what this parliament must do: it must reflect the breadth of the Australian community.</para>
<para>Both political parties have a challenge. It is a challenge for the Labor Party and it is a challenge for our party as well. We live in a time of declining political party memberships. When political party memberships decline, the decision making processes of political parties fall into the hands of fewer and fewer people and the tendency to reward mediocrity, to try and hold out the outsiders and to think that you preselect people on the basis of it being his or her turn next will only in time produce a lower quality of members of parliament. That does not apply to anybody who is here now, but let me say that it is a warning for the future and I am very serious about it. If we end up with a parliament full of people whose only life experience has been politics and nothing else then we will have a very narrowly based parliament. That is very important. There is nothing like having a parliament that is made up of all of the Australian people. It applies to both sides of politics, let me say—it is a challenge that we all face.</para>
<para>I will give a couple of personal thanks. I want to thank John Anderson, the Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the National Party, for the wonderful support that he has given me through the year. I have spoken of this before, but I will speak of it again: there is no more inherently decent human being in public life than the Deputy Prime Minister. I thank him very much for the support and friendship of these past years. To the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, the person who I think is the finest Treasurer this country has had, I express my very special thanks for his stewardship of the economy, his loyalty and support to me and the way in which he prosecuted the government side of the economic case in the election campaign. I express to him, his wife, Tanya, and their family my great thanks. I also give my thanks to Senator Robert Hill, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, and Senator Nick Minchin, the Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate. The Senate, of course, has not been an easy chamber for us; it will continue to be a more difficult chamber for us for some months yet. They do a great job and I thank them very warmly for that.</para>
<para>To all of my ministerial colleagues I owe a special debt of gratitude. One of the strengths of the government has been its unity and its sense of common direction and common purpose. That has been a great deal behind the government’s success in recent times. To my personal staff I owe a special debt of gratitude. Arthur Sinodinos, my chief of staff, has now been with me in that position since the end of 1997. He is a person who had a very good background in the Public Service but adapted to the political environment whilst preserving the respect and cooperation of the Public Service. He has done it very effectively. To Tony Nutt, who I often say knows where more Liberal Party bodies are buried—particularly in Western Australia—than anybody in my party, I express a special debt of gratitude. To Tony O’Leary, who has to deal with the ladies and gentlemen of the media, if I can put it that way, and does it very well, and to David Luff and all the other members of my staff I express very special thanks.</para>
<para>Particularly, this year, I want to put on record my gratitude to Brian Loughnane, the federal director of the Liberal Party, who was the organisational chieftain of our magnificent election campaign, and to the federal president, Shane Stone. I will have the opportunity, with my other leadership colleagues, of meeting the federal executive of the Liberal Party in Canberra tomorrow. It is an opportunity to convey both tomorrow and tonight my great gratitude to the party organisation. I am very happy to say that everything I have achieved in politics I owe to the Liberal Party. I will never forget what the Liberal Party has meant to me; I will never forget what the Liberal Party has done for me. I would never have been a member of parliament without the Liberal Party; I certainly would never have been Prime Minister without the support of my Liberal Party colleagues. Sometimes all of us can get a little carried away with just how large our personal votes might be in our electorate. Sometimes, when you do the analysis of these things, it is very sobering indeed to realise that. What I find very sobering sometimes is that you can have a long-serving member—this applies on both sides—who retires and is replaced by a completely unknown person and, because of the change in the broad political climate, the completely unknown person does infinitely better than the long-serving member that he or she replaced. Therefore, I express my particular thanks to Brian and Shane and all their organisational colleagues for what they have done for us.</para>
<para>I also extend my very best wishes to the Leader of the Opposition and his wife, Janine, and to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and all the other members of the Australian Labor Party. I particularly welcome the new members who have joined us. They represent a different perspective but, nonetheless, I know they come here determined to make an impact and determined to change things for the better. All people, with a few exceptions, come into this place determined to try and improve life for their fellow citizens. I do not think we do each other any good by suggesting that there is total malice residing in the breasts of our opponents and total merit residing on our side of politics. People are really motivated to go into public life for the very best of reasons, and most people I have met in this place have got that motivation.</para>
<para>This is, of course, an occasion of the year that celebrates the birth of the most significant figure in human history, Jesus of Nazareth. It is an occasion to acknowledge the spiritual component of our lives. That is not compulsory. We live in a society where faith is matter of personal choice, and millions of Australians lead their lives according to the Christian religion. A smaller, but nonetheless totally respected, number lead their lives according to other faiths. Many choose not to lead their lives according to any faith at all. That is entirely a matter of personal choice. One of the driving philosophical forces of Christianity is individual choice and free will, and faith in the Christian sense is based very much on an individual choice and an individual embrace of a set of spiritual values.</para>
<para>For my part I have endeavoured, completely inadequately, to live as best I can according to the basic tenets of the Christian religion. It is not something that most Australians choose to wear on their sleeve quite as much as some from other countries do. It does not alter the fact that there is a deep deposit of spirituality in this country which is a very, very strong force for good. For all the brickbats that have been hurled at the Christian churches and for all their failings and for all the failings, personal sins and indiscretions of some of their members, it remains the fact that the Christian religion is the greatest force for good, progress and dignity of the individual in this nation. There is no force which is greater for the enhancement of individuals and the liberation of the human spirit.</para>
<para>I think it is important at a time like this for those who attest to that view to express it, as I do, but I do that in no sense of stricture against those who hold a different point of view. I respect very strongly the secular traditions of this country. I will never be one that will seek to define the worth of somebody’s contribution to public life according to whether or not they hold a particular religious point of view. We are a society that respects all religions, but we should respect our own history and our own traditions. We should not run away from the influence of Judaeo-Christianity on this country. It has been an enormous force for good and it has shaped not only the individual lives of people but also the character of our nation. We will be a poorer nation if we shrink from an understanding of that influence and from the impact that it has had.</para>
<para>In that spirit, can I wish all members of the parliament the very best for Christmas. Have a good time with your families. I intend to. I intend to have a holiday, and I hope the Leader of the Opposition does. I mean that sincerely; I do not mean that in any facetious sense. He has a young family. I remember what it was like when my children were that age. It is important that we do spend a lot of time with our children, particularly at that age. As they get older they spend a little less time with you, I can report, but nonetheless quite a bit, and the bonds that develop with your children at the age that the Leader of the Opposition’s are at are the bonds that make it the case that when they have grown up to adulthood they still want you around—selectively and occasionally, as we all understand. To have a good relationship with your adult children is the most satisfying thing that you can have in life because it is a completely consensual, voluntary thing and it is based upon mutual respect and the compatibility of personalities.</para>
<para>I wish the Leader of the Opposition well. I wish all of my parliamentary colleagues well and, as was a tradition that I developed with one of his predecessors, I extend a handshake to the Leader of the Opposition, wish him well for the Christmas period and look forward to seeing him back in the New Year.</para>

<para>—I join with the Prime Minister in extending good wishes to the members of the parliament, to the staff of the parliament—who deserve to be recognised on this important occasion—and, of course, to the people of the country at such a special part of the year. Politics is a great vocation. It is a chance to serve the people in public office. It is much more than a contest, it is a great distinction, and I am sure in an election year the members who have contested their seats successfully understand the nature of the distinction.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Sometimes in the heat of the battle we forget about the importance of democracy itself—that each of us come with a heavy responsibility to try and build public trust and confidence in the institution itself. I always try and make the point, in attempting to get young people more interested in politics, that when they look at the TV news at night they can see many unhappy examples of how countries are not being run harmoniously and successfully—nations that do not have democratic freedoms and democratic rights. Hopefully around the country Australians are thankful that in an election year, notwithstanding the disappointment we had in the result, the elections were free and fair. That is something to celebrate and something we should always be mindful of in this democratic chamber, particularly as we try and encourage young people to value the importance of our democracy and add to it in future years.</para>
<para>We do need to encourage all Australians to have a higher opinion of our democracy. In the Labor Party we fancy ourselves as the party of change and often feel that our burden is doubly difficult in that we have to encourage people to be interested not only in politics but also in the prospects of progressive change in our society. That for us is one of the foundations of our beliefs, and I am sure all members going into the Christmas period after the white heat battle of an election campaign know the importance of having democratic trust and the confidence of the Australian people.</para>
<para>Like the Prime Minster, I wish all the members of the parliament, their partners and their families the best over the Christmas period. It is a special time of the year. I have always regarded it as the best time of the year, because no matter what you have been doing—your vocation, your calling, your interest, your job—you come together with the joy of giving, the joy of family and the joy of giving love to those that you are close to.</para>
<para>I wish the Prime Minister and his family all the very best through the festive season, and also the party leaders and their families: the Nationals, the Independents, the Democrats, the Greens, other party interests around the parliament and all members in this place. All senators work hard, but I rather fancy that party leaders have extra burdens to bear and perhaps look forward to the holiday period and the love of our families with particular relish.</para>
<para>All the members do work hard, but on this side of the House I want to particularly acknowledge the range of people who have contributed to the management of opposition business. I wish them and their families all the best—in particular the member for Lalor, the member for Grayndler and the member for Hotham. In particular I want to thank one of the advisors to the member for Lalor. We all know she is a brilliant tactician and strategist and we always value her contributions in the House, but behind every great female tactical genius is a good man—that man has been Jamie Snashall—‘Sasha’ to his mates—and we thank him for his service over the past 12 months in helping to pull together the question time tactics and information each sitting day. That is not the easiest task in the parliament, but he has done it well, contributing to the opposition.</para>
<para>Together with Phillippe Allen and now Jack Lake in my office, all the members of the opposition pay tribute to Jamie’s service and we hope that our party, tonight in humour, is going to lift its standard compared to past efforts. In terms of his real vocation, politics and public service, we wish him well in the future.</para>
<para>Mr Speaker, I extend to you, your wife, Penny, and your family all the best for the Christmas period. We know we have given you something of a baptism of fire in the last couple of weeks, but let me assure you that it is good for you. It is character building. The Prime Minister, a man of endurance in public life, knows that sometimes you have to do it tough to reap the rewards later on. I am sure that you understand the goodwill and good wishes that the opposition extends to you for the Christmas period and the term of parliament ahead. I also wish to convey my best wishes to your predecessor, Neil Andrew, who is fondly regarded on all sides of the parliament and who served this chamber with such distinction. We wish him and his family all the best over the Christmas period and the years ahead.</para>
<para>On the Labor side I thank my deputy, Jenny Macklin, for her hard work. I am sure she is looking forward to the Christmas period with her family and her loved ones. I thank all the shadow ministers past and present we have had on the Labor side for their special contribution—the Labor MPs and the Senate team so well led over the years by John Faulkner and now Chris Evans. I pay particular credit and tribute to John Faulkner who, to me, epitomises the best of Labor culture—a man of true solidarity and principle. He is a true believer in the best sense of left of centre politics. His contribution has been particularly important to us and I know that he deserves the break with his family and loved ones in the weeks ahead.</para>
<para>I also want to say a special thankyou to the Labor Party supporters who worked for our cause and our campaign in the recent election—the true believers who put in, notwithstanding the disappointment of the result. When you struggle for a better society the cause always matters and the effort always matters—and, from Tim Gartrell down, I thank every single Labor partisan who worked so hard throughout 2004.</para>
<para>I also want to thank the staff of the parliament who make this place function so well. At one level we have the easy part of it—we turn up in a highly functional and efficient building to serve the people of Australia but we should always be very thankful for those who serve us in this large building. It is not an easy task. The people who work here are great servants of our democratic system. So I thank the attendants, the clerks, their staff, the table office and all of those who add to the smooth functioning of the democratic chamber and the parliament.</para>
<para>Along with the Prime Minister I thank Hansard—you get into these jobs and you do not get to correct the greens as much as you might have as a backbencher—they make sense of our words and do a tremendous job. They keep us safe and sound in the way we communicate to the Australian people and the historians who will look at all these illustrious debates in years ahead and try to make some sense of them.</para>
<para>I thank the staff of the Parliamentary Library. I do not see them as much as I used to. Not only has it come about that I am not writing books these days but I am not reading as many as I used to. So I do not see them but I know that they are providing an exceptionally professional and comprehensive service to all the members and senators. Along with the Prime Minister I urge the new members in this place to not only put in, be enthusiastic and do their work hard and well, but also make good use of the library. We are well served here. We have one of the best parliamentary libraries in the Western world. We should thank the information staff and the research staff—and the new members here would do themselves a good service to use that library as effectively as possible. Labor members, of course, will use it well. Government members can also make good use of the library and be thankful for its services.</para>
<para>I thank the Serjeant-at-Arms and the office that make all things work so well. I thank the Joint House staff, who keep this fine building in great nick and cater to our needs. I thank the cleaners and those who maintain the grounds and the rooms of the parliament—the cleaners in particular. If you ever get in here very early in the morning or tend to leave late at night you will see the cleaners moving in and around the building. I have a soft spot for the cleaners—my mum was one. So to the cleaners who look after us and clean up after us: we really do thank you for that effort in the dark of night, in tough working conditions. To keep our rooms and the space of the parliament so clean and neat is a great tribute to you. They are, in many respects, the silent heroes of the building as they move around. I want to wish them a particularly happy Christmas and I look forward to seeing them in 2005.</para>
<para>I thank the marketing and visiting staff, who do such a great job in bringing thousands of schoolchildren and visitors through the parliament. Visitors see the good and the bad of our work and they get a first-hand view of the place. I think that practical experience counts for a lot more than just viewing the parliament through television.</para>
<para>I thank the switchboard staff. They always work hard, particularly in an election year. They do a great job, and we thank them for their courtesy and their pleasant way of handling our calls and needs through the switchboard.</para>
<para>I thank the caterers, who help us to put the weight on; I thank the health and recreation staff, who help us to take a small portion of it off—never enough, of course, but they do a great service to the parliament and its members.</para>
<para>I want to thank the staff of the opposition—the people who work hard for us in a very practical way—and in particular my personal staff. People do these jobs for the right reason and the right purpose. It is not for the public profile or the personal glorification that might come in a successful public life. The staff behind the scenes are doing things on the basis of belief and conviction. From George Thompson down, in my office and right through the opposition offices, I thank them for their hard work in opposition, which can be frustrating and exacting, but they really and truly put in for the cause of Labor in 2004.</para>
<para>In my electorate of Werriwa, where it is always a great distinction and honour to serve such a wonderful Labor constituency—I have not been there as much in 2004 because of my party leadership responsibilities—I want to thank in a special way my electorate office staff, headed by Lyn Watson but also including Vicki Meadows, Michelle Halloran and Louise Makings for their work in looking after the people of Werriwa. I want to thank my campaign staff and the electors of the seat, who continue to give me the great distinction of serving in this place on their behalf.</para>
<para>As we head into the holiday period, I want to pay particular tribute to the volunteers of our nation, the quiet heroes who selflessly put themselves in harm’s way to protect life and property—people like our volunteer firefighters and lifeguards. While we look forward to Christmas and we know it is a great country in which to spend December and January, we also know it can be a harsh and punishing nation. Unfortunately there will inevitably be difficulties through the Christmas period, and we should always be grateful for the work of the volunteers and professional people who deal with those problems and issues. Also, I want to pay tribute to the volunteers who serve in silence but with no less distinction: our carers and community service workers.</para>
<para>I also thank the young men and women of our armed forces, where Australia has always been so well served. Regardless of our views on the issues of international policy, we always unite as a parliament and we always support our Australians overseas. We thank them for their contribution and their dedication to our great nation.</para>
<para>I also extend best wishes to the members of our diplomatic corps and our foreign aid workers. As the bombing in Jakarta so terribly demonstrated, these days they are very much in the frontline in the war against terror. They defend our national interests and serve the country so well. We should wish them a very good Christmas and thank them for their service to the nation, in particular those Australian aid workers overseas. I always believe that as a parliament we need to do more, as we visit overseas locations, to come back with stories of the productive work of the Australian aid budget. In recent years, I have been to ghettos in Delhi and Jakarta where you can see how the Australian aid contribution helps to feed people. It helps to keep them alive. It is a wonderful service to humanity. At a time when people do wonder about the allocation of scarce government resources, we should always promote the value of the Australian foreign aid budget and the wonderful service it provides to Third World nations and people in absolutely desperate need. So I thank them for their work. They will have a challenging Christmas, as they always do in locations like that, just to keep people going and give them the dignity of a decent human life.</para>
<para>I wish the Australian people a very happy Christmas and a safe and rewarding new year. We are a prosperous nation. It is always said that we are a lucky country, but we cannot take the luck for granted. As we reflect on our joyous Christmas and the love, sharing and giving of family, we should also spare a thought for those Australians who do it tough right throughout the year—Australians who live in poverty. At this time of the year I urge all Australians to give generously of their time and resources to the great charities that look after the poor, the disadvantaged and the disabled. They work right around the year, but that work counts so much more at Christmas time, when we need to share the love and emotion and the caring nature of our country. I wish all Australians a safe and happy Christmas.</para>
<para>Finally, in a very special way, I want to thank my family for their love and encouragement through the course of this year—my wife, Janine; our two wonderful little boys, Oliver and Isaac; my mother; my sisters; and my family. Like other members of the parliament, I desperately long to spend extended time with them in the weeks and months ahead. I look forward to that very much. When we reflect on the love of family, that truly is the spirit of Christmas. I wish all Australians to share in it and all members of this parliament to feel the love and care of this special part of the year.</para>

<para>—I would like to begin by briefly saying that I think it is appropriate for us to lift our minds from the day-to-day political debate and the headlines to recognise the great achievement that makes these valedictories possible. Once again, the Australian people have chosen their government peacefully, through a well-ordered election, not through civil strife or a palace coup. What a blessing that is. The Leader of the Opposition has just acknowledged that the opposition lost, fairly; they still have a very important constitutional role in this chamber. We as a government recognise of course that our stewardship of the country will again be judged by the Australian people in 2007. Peaceful elections are of course a tremendous historic achievement, one that men and women in their millions down through the ages have died for. Today, in many countries less fortunate than ours, men and women across the world still long for, fight for and risk everything for this achievement. It is one we should treasure. We should not allow it to be diminished through cynicism.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Mr Speaker, I thank you for your role. I wish you and Penny all the very best for a festive season. I extend the same wishes to the Deputy Speaker and to June—and to your colleagues who fill that important and honourable seat from time to time.</para>
<para>Prime Minister, I thank you. Can I say to you that, as I think of your stewardship over the country and why people have chosen to extend that stewardship, your qualities come to mind—your personal courage, your tenacity. I think, Prime Minister, of your knowledge of, your understanding of and your commitment to the Australian people. I think that is now sensed deeply by the Australian people, but I suspect that even now they do not know the half of it. Your commitment to them is extraordinary. Your knowledge of their needs and your desire to see the interests of the country taken forward are remarkable. I salute you for that. I thank you for your decency in your dealings with me, my party and the people we try to represent. Can I say to you too, and I hope this does not sound presumptuous, that I count it a privilege to be able to term you a friend for the rest of my life.</para>
<para>I thank my deputy leader, Mark Vaile. He has worked extraordinarily hard in the national interest this year. I salute him for it and I acknowledge the sacrifices that he has made, particularly in his overseas schedules in pursuit of the American free trade agreement and so forth this year. And I thank Wendy—if I may be again presumptuous—for the sacrifices she has made in the national interest.</para>
<para>I extend my thanks particularly to my own colleagues in The Nationals but obviously, in the context of this season, to all my colleagues in this place on both sides of the House. I would, understandably, like to particularly mention Larry Anthony and to say that we extend our best wishes to him and to Jenny. I do not think anyone would argue with the proposition that they poured their hearts and souls into that electorate and into this last election. The people spoke, and that is understood, respected and accepted, but it is a very sad thing for Larry, and we do wish him all the best over Christmas. I know that he was not alone in that disappointment, but I am sure members will understand why I single him out. I thank Andrew Hall, our federal director, and Helen Dickie, our federal president.</para>
<para>Again, I want to say in relation to rural Australia—about which, of course, I am very passionate—that we ought not to have short memories. It is not so very long ago that there was enormous social dislocation out there. There were too many rural Australians who felt discontented and not respected for the role they play. Sometimes they were justified in that; sometimes they were not. But we have, in every way, through economic management and trying to work in partnership with local communities, sought to restore a degree of social cohesion. I think I can honestly say to this House that, as we go into this Christmas, there is a better mood across rural and regional Australia, a greater sense of hope and a greater sense that they are respected and valued—and I think that matters.</para>
<para>I believe very sincerely that social cohesion is a prerequisite for political stability, and political stability is very desirable in a nation like ours, not least of all—because of course it is very important—for economic progress. In that context, I again pay tribute to the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, Peter Costello, who is a good friend and somebody whose counsel and advice I enjoy and interaction with whom I enjoy. I wish him and Tania, after a very long year, all the very best for their Christmas break.</para>
<para>I acknowledge the Clerk, Mr Ian Harris, who helped me out this morning when I came rushing in here with bills that were not signed and what have you. I wish you and your staff all the best, and thank you for your work. The Australian Federal Police, a very respected body in this country who fulfil a very important role, deserve the accolades that have been showered upon them for their involvement in a number of causes here in Australia and, perhaps more particularly and especially, overseas in recent times. I also thank those who help in this House: the Hansard reporters, the attendants, and the people who work behind the scenes, as the Leader of the Opposition acknowledged—the cleaners and so forth. All of that is important work. That is the great foundation stone that is so important to the preservation of our freedoms in this country. We acknowledge the worth, the importance and the dignity of every individual and we thank them in the context of Christmas.</para>
<para>I thank my personal staff, particularly my chief of staff, Peter Langhorne, and wish him, Marlene and their family all the very best. By extension, I ask that he carry on those best wishes to the rest of the team. I would certainly like to acknowledge in this place the love and support I have had from Julia. It is a tough and demanding proposition. In her case, she has kept the home fires burning with four young children, not quite so young anymore—it is amazing how quickly they grow. It is sometimes not quite understood just how difficult it can be to live out in the middle of an electorate that is the size of England and Scotland combined—the distances and the logistics of it all, trying to keep family together when there are no local schools, when getting to parliament and to the office let alone getting to the far-flung parts of the electorate and everyone else’s electorate involves endless travel and endless logistical difficulties. So I thank her and record my appreciation and acknowledgment of the reality that I could not, of course, do it without her.</para>
<para>Christmas is a chance to spend time with our families and loved ones and to look beyond the events of the year to one that occurred a long time ago beneath a star and in a stable outside an inn. I am certainly very conscious that I do not deserve the title ‘Christian’ in the sense that it is often taken to mean someone of virtue and decency. I do say though that I am a Christian believer, and in that context I am very conscious of my own failings, of the times when I am a hypocrite—freely pointed out in this place from time to time, I know. I just assure the Leader of the Opposition and his friends that I am usually aware of it before you point it out, often very uncomfortably so. In the context of my beliefs as a Christian, I am very conscious that the blood of the Cross means that I can personally be forgiven and, as I can be forgiven, there is an absolute responsibility on me to forgive others, to put the past behind and to move on. In the context of Christmas, a good healing exercise of putting those things behind us that are unnecessary and unfruitful to pursue is probably not a bad thing to ponder for a moment. So, in that context, to you, Mr Speaker, to all members of this House, to their families, to their loved ones, to their constituents, here and abroad, wherever they may be serving, wherever they may be living, I wish a happy, safe, holy, relaxed and refreshing Christmas.</para>

<para>—Like most members in this House, I will be very pleased to get on my Christmas break and spend some time with family and friends. I am particularly looking forward to spending time with my family—my parents, John and Moira; my sister, Alison; and my niece and nephew, Tom and Jenna. I did have the opportunity to spend some time with my sister during the opening of parliament. She came to the opening to meet the only truly famous person in the House of Representatives, Peter Garrett, and she succeeded in that task, but she also met the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition when she was here. It has been a long 12 months since we were at the dispatch box doing valedictories, and for some of us on the Labor side it was at the end of what was a pretty tumultuous week. In that set of valedictories, the Leader of the Opposition said about me:</para>

<quote>
<para class="block">and I think it is a step forward for women in the parliament to play a role outside of some of the stereotypes and expectations that we have heard in the past.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I would like to thank the Leader of the Opposition for investing that faith in me then and for continuing that faith in me now. After what has been such a tough year for all of us, can I say that my faith in him is undiminished from that when we were last doing valedictories at this dispatch box. I wish him and Janine and the two boys a wonderful Christmas and some very well-deserved time off. I hope the opposition leader and his family have a great Christmas.</para>
<para>In my role as Manager of Opposition Business I am obviously supported by the tactics committee. I thank my deputy manager, Anthony Albanese—better known to me as Albo over more than 20 years—for his support. I thank Jenny Macklin and Wayne Swan, and, of course, Simon Crean, who supports me still in the selection of House tactics but who has been such a great supporter of me in a number of other ways. I thank him for his continued investment of time and his continued assistance to me.</para>
<para>Elections do bring changes. As the Leader of the Opposition has said, they have brought some changes in my office. I would particularly like to record my gratitude to Jamie Snashall, occasionally referred to by his friends as Sasha, as the Leader of the Opposition has said—</para>

<para>—Yes. Jamie started with me as my one personal staff member when I first moved to the front bench after the 2001 election and we had the shadow portfolio of immigration. He stayed with me when we had added to that the shadow portfolio of Indigenous affairs. He stayed with me when we had added to that Deputy Manager of Opposition Business. He stayed with me when we then moved to health and he stayed with me when I had added to that the responsibility of Manager of Opposition Business. I would have to say that he has been to hell and back in three years in the service of the Labor Party. He has been a tremendous support to me and an incredibly hardworking staff member. He is off to have a bit of a rest now, which he well deserves, but I know that he will be back in the service of the Labor Party and the labour movement very soon, and in a more senior role—certainly not one that has people screaming over his shoulder at five to two, ‘Where’s the question time pack?’</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>I also record my thanks to Ann Clark, who has moved from my office into the Leader of the Opposition’s office. Ann travelled with me extensively last year, including 38 out of the 42 days in the election campaign. It was just her and me rattling around Australia, so it was a pretty big job. You have to get on when you spend that amount of time together. She is tremendous fun and a very great addition to the Leader of the Opposition’s office. I record my thanks to Lesley Russell in my office, who works so hard on our health policy and is continuing to do so still. I record my thanks to my electorate office staff—Carlos, Fitzie and her sister Vicki, Rondah, Henry Barlow and John Ballestrino—for always looking after the electorate so well.</para>
<para>I also record my thanks to the whips. You cannot do the Manager of Opposition Business job without the support of the whips, who play such a great role tactically and in other ways. My thanks go to Roger Price, Jill Hall and Michael Danby. Of course, I also record my thanks to Janice Crosio, who served in that very important job beforehand. I thank my colleagues, who are frequent sources of advice when it comes to tactical matters—things they think you did well and things they think you did pretty badly. They are pretty forthcoming. In that regard, my special thanks go to the members for Banks and Batman, who are always cheerfully prepared to comment on how things have gone and to give some suggestions about how they could or should have gone better. They have helped me a great deal.</para>
<para>I thank the new members who have brought such energy and enthusiasm. They are not at the stage yet where they are making demands of the tactics committee, but I know that it will happen very soon. They will be there with their local issues, demanding a question. My thanks go to them for their new energy and enthusiasm. We will look forward to trying to hold them back from taking over question time next year.</para>
<para>Mr Speaker, I thank you for working with us in the past two weeks. It has not been an easy start, as the Leader of the Opposition has said. I would like to record my thanks to Neil, of course. I will be in South Australia over the Christmas period and I have an open invitation to go and visit him. I may well do so when I am there. We look forward to working with you, Mr Speaker, in the coming year. I record my thanks to the clerks. One of the things you most do in opposition is rely on the clerks’ advice. To the extent that we accidentally manage to get questions in order from time to time, that is normally the product of good advice that we have secured from the clerks. So I thank Ian and Bernie for their assistance, which is very important to us.</para>
<para>I thank Judy Middlebrook and the chamber research staff, on whom we are all so very reliant. I thank Gerard, the Parliamentary Liaison Officer and his staff. We are also very reliant on them in opposition. I thank them very much. I thank all of the remaining staff at Parliament House, who make the building work so well—the Comcar drivers, the security, the attendants, the cleaners, the catering staff and everybody else. I record my very deep personal thanks to Aussies. It is only their coffee that makes the difference between living and dying on some days. I thank them very much for the contribution they make.</para>
<para>I wish the Leader of the House, the Minister for Health and Ageing, Tony Abbott, the compliments of the season and a good break over Christmas. I have been joking with him that we need to negotiate ceasefire dates so that we can both have a restful Christmas. I think there is some merit in that. I wish the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, the Treasurer and members of the government generally a good Christmas break, as I do all of the colleagues on my side of the House. We look forward to being back in this place, once again joined in combat over the dispatch box, in the new year.</para>

<para>—I join with other members who have already spoken. Christmas, of course, commemorates the birth of Christ, and the message is: peace on earth and goodwill toward men and women. I extend my goodwill to all of my wonderful colleagues and the members of the opposition, and particularly to the colleagues who have joined us as a consequence of the most recent election. It gives you enormous new enthusiasm and freshness to see people come into this place who look at it with new eyes and give you new perspectives. Those of us who have been here for a while probably have come to see the parliament through our own perspective and experiences. All of a sudden, new eyes give you new insights and freshness. I want to thank and congratulate each and every one of those new members that have come here to join us.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I think it is important that we approach our task with a sense of humour every now and then. I try and amuse myself at the dispatch box and sometimes manage to amuse some other people as well. Honestly, it is a terrible job, but someone has to do it. It would be a dull old place if we did not manage to amuse ourselves and keep our interest. The day we lose our humour about what we do is the day that the parliament and the nation will be worse off.</para>
<para>I say, not at all in a partisan spirit, that we go into Christmas with more Australians in work than ever before in our history and with unemployment lower than it has been in 27 years. I think that is something that will make it a better Christmas for many more Australians. Nothing destroys a family like unemployment and nothing destroys self-confidence like unemployment. I just hope that those who have found work can keep it and those who are looking for work can find it. I regard that as one of the most important tasks that we have as members of parliament.</para>
<para>We remember those Australians serving overseas in our defence forces at the moment and we value their work. We have Treasury officials at the moment in PNG and the Solomons. I pay tribute to them for the work they are doing in reconstruction. I thank the Secretary of the Treasury, Ken Henry, and the department for the work they do and the contribution they make, which I think in international terms would make them certainly one of the most professional outfits anywhere around the world.</para>
<para>I would like to pay tribute to the Prime Minister for leading the coalition to his fourth election victory. This is an extraordinary performance, on our side of the parliament matched only by the great man, Sir Robert Menzies, who founded our party and led us to more victories. I think on the Labor side it is matched only by Bob Hawke. So that just puts the Prime Minister in a new class of political leader. I extend my congratulations to him, to Janette and to his family; to John Anderson and his wife, Julia—John is one of nature’s gentlemen and somebody who shows great Christian character; to Mark Vaile and his wife, Wendy; and to our Senate team. I particularly thank my Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Revenue, Mal Brough, and his wife, Sue. It is not easy running a revenue system. Australians are very simple in what they want from their politicians. They want them to collect less tax and they want them to spend more money. It is because those two propositions are incompatible that politics exists. If we were able to spend more money and take less tax, then the business of politics would not exist. It is the irresistible force meeting the immovable object that gives rise to the profession of politics. If you are running the revenue system it does not qualify you for sainthood or popularity amongst your colleagues. I pay tribute to Mal for his work and to Chris Pearce, my parliamentary secretary, for his assistance.</para>
<para>Tony Abbott, the Leader of the House, is one of nature’s misunderstood men, a true gentleman and a soft man at heart, who is often misunderstood. People think that Tony is hard, but to deal with him is to melt in his hands. Mr Speaker, I congratulate you for the recognition that you deserve and for your elevation to the great role of Speaker. To you and to Penny I want to wish a very happy and restful Christmas. Ian Harris and Bernard Wright are public servants in the greatest tradition. What I admire is that you advise each side to the best of your ability and never allow personal views to intrude. Whether you are sitting on this side or on the other side, the advice that you give is flawless. Please thank all of the people that work for you, and I thank you for the work that you do. To my own staff, led by Phil Gaetjens, chief of staff, and Lizzie McCabe, who is one of the best people you will ever come across, I want to thank you. I thank each and every one of them. Our federal director, Brian Loughnane, now has a flawless federal strike record—one-zip. Julian Sheezel, our state director, and Helen Kroger, our state president, who have done a fantastic job, I want to thank you as well.</para>
<para>We all indulge ourselves in politics, but it is our families that bear a lot of the brunt. I want to thank my wife, Tanya, my son, Sebastian, and my daughters, Madeleine and Phoebe, who have put up with quite a lot this year. It is particularly hard I think on the mothers, who essentially become single mothers. Whilst we have a little bit more of the fun in the parliament, they are minding the home front. I think it is extraordinarily difficult and I pay tribute to my own family and thank them very deeply for the sacrifices that they have made. Still, this is the greatest honour that any person could have: to be able to stand in the House of Representatives, to represent people in Australia, to be a minister of the Crown, to be entrusted with the ability to make decisions which will shape a nation. This is a great honour and a great privilege. Like many members here, I feel awed by it. I thank the electors and the people of Australia for the trust that they place in us, for our colleagues that share that trust and for our nation, which I hope will go on to continuing strength in the year ahead.</para>

<para>—Very briefly, because much has been said and does not need to be repeated, I wish to pay particular tribute to the clerks, the guardians of the traditions of this place, and to the parliamentary liaison staff, particularly Gerard Martin and his team. The member for Lalor and I have had, I think, a perfectly cordial relationship outside this chamber, if not necessarily inside this chamber, and I thank her for her constructive work in the smooth management of the House. While I am acknowledging and thanking you and congratulating you, Mr Speaker, it is probably appropriate to acknowledge your predecessor. Neil Andrew occupied the chair with distinction and with personal dignity. He was often put upon, but he never lost his cool, and that is to his credit.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I probably should also acknowledge a couple of dear friends who are no longer with us—they are with us in life but not in this parliament—David Kemp, a mentor of mine in the Fightback era; Trish Worth, a former parliamentary secretary and a real fighter, particularly on mental health issues and drug safety; and also someone who left the parliament under difficult circumstances, the former member for Parramatta, Ross Cameron. Ross had his faults, but he was a great contributor. I think that the tone of this House was certainly lifted by him. I thank my staff, particularly Paris Kostakos. None of us can do anything effectively without help. She is my parliamentary adviser and does a great job, and it helps not just the parliament but many people here. Finally, as has been acknowledged, I thank all of our families. They are the conscripts in politics. They have a hard life because of us and they should be remembered now. As Peter Costello and others have said, we are very privileged to be here. The challenge is to be worthy of the privilege that we have been given. May God bless us in this Christmas season and may God help us in the year ahead, because Lord knows we will need it.</para>

</talker>
<para>—First of all I would like to thank all those who have already spoken for their kind words to me as the Speaker—the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Prime Minister, the Manager of Opposition Business, the Treasurer and the Leader of the House—and also to join with them in thanking those who have worked so hard, so professionally and often unseen in supporting the smooth running of this chamber. Previous Speakers have admitted the difficulty in trying to select a few from the list of so many who contribute in so many ways to the day-to-day running of the parliament. I find myself in that same predicament and I apologise in advance to those whom I may inadvertently overlook. But I would like to mention in particular the Deputy Speaker, the member for Page, Ian Causley; the Second Deputy Speaker, the member for Scullin, Harry Jenkins; and the members of the Speaker’s panel—all of whom have, I think, done an outstanding job in both this parliament and the last parliament.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I would also like to mention the Clerk, Ian Harris, and the Deputy Clerk, Bernard Wright, for their very impartial professional advice, which is so important, as has already been said, particularly for a new Speaker. I mention too the clerks assistant, Robyn McClelland and Robyn Webber, and Laraine Brennan. I also mention the Serjeant-at-Arms, David Elder, the Deputy Serjeant, Claressa Surtees, Dalma Dixon, Barry Gwyther and the staff at the Serjeant’s office. I mention Peter Mason and the staff at the Table Office; Judy Middlebrook and the staff of the chamber research office; committee secretaries and staff; other staff of the Department of the House of Representatives; Chris Paterson and the staff of the Parliamentary Relations Office; the Parliamentary Education Office; the messagerial attendants and security staff; the expert and patient people who staff the 2020 help desk; the staff of the first aid centre; the car drivers; the guides; the gardeners; the Hyatt; the cleaners; Aussie’s; the florist; Synergy; Lizzie; Westpac; Auspic; and many others.</para>
<para>But I particular want to pay tribute to the dedication, commitment and professionalism of Hilary Penfold, the Secretary of the new Department of Parliamentary Services, and her staff. There have been enormous difficulties and challenges associated with the restructuring of the administration of the parliament and the amalgamation of the three service departments into one. This has proved far more successful than could have been hoped or envisaged when the new department was established 12 months ago. As usual, the excellent standard of assistance, advice and facilities provided by the staff of the information and research services group and the resource management services group—which includes the library—the client services group, the security and facilities group and the corporate and strategic development group ensure that the services provided to our members of parliament are among the best in the world.</para>
<para>At Parliament House we are very much a family. Some members of it deserve a special mention. I just want to mention two. Monika Velten is leaving after 23 years service in the cafeterias of both Old Parliament House and new Parliament House. I think her cheerful and friendly service has been much appreciated and will be greatly missed. Marie Donnelly recently retired after almost 30 years service in the Speaker’s office. Marie, who has served every Speaker since she joined the department in 1975, was held in great affection and esteem by everyone and will be a very hard act to follow. We only hope she does not carry out her threat to write a book of her experiences with all the material she has collected!</para>
<para>Also retiring from extended service to parliament and the Speaker’s office is Pauline Osmond. Many will know that Pauline came to parliament to assist Bob Halverson when he was elected as member for Casey in 1984. She went with Bob to the Speaker’s office in 1996 and provided outstanding support to my predecessor, Neil Andrew, and then to me since I have become the Speaker. Her advice has always been astute and her contribution excellent, and most importantly her sense of humour, friendship and high spirits have always been essential in the bonding of a very hardworking team. I certainly wish her well.</para>
<para>Best wishes for a speedy return to health go to Andy Hall, one of the people who represent so well the dedication and loyalty often unseen and unheralded from the staff of the Department of the House of Representatives. They make our lives liveable by so willingly and efficiently providing us with the services and support that are necessary for us to undertake our services as members of the parliament. I think we should recognise the efforts of all in that respect. Best wishes also go to former Clerk Lyn Barlin, who is thankfully on the mend after having an argument with a trailer—which unfortunately the trailer won. But he is on the mend.</para>
<para>I would also like to add my special thanks to my predecessor Neil Andrew. Although Neil did speak to me after I became the Speaker, I do not think there is any way that he could prepare me for the challenges that have come with this complex job. I certainly recognise and commend him for the distinction with which he served in this office for six years. As mentioned earlier, a sad note today is the loss of Alan Browning, a former Clerk of the House. He made a contribution to the parliament over 36 years, including over six years as Clerk. Our thoughts are with his family at this time.</para>
<para>I would also like to thank my electorate office, and particularly Megan Campbell, who has been with me now for almost 17 years. She is a very loyal, efficient and dedicated member of my team, together with Jane Macdonald and Lizzie Haskell. I send my best wishes to the staff of the Speaker’s office, especially Peter Gibson, who is senior adviser and chief of staff and who has an amazing knowledge and understanding of this institution. His good judgment and objective, unbiased advice has managed to get me through my first few weeks as the Speaker. Thanks also go to Barbara Williams, who keeps me organised, and Yvonne Bailey, who after some years serving as a Speaker’s attendant is now learning the ropes in the very important role that Marie Donnelly had. I would also like to thank Sarah McArthur, Stewart’s daughter, who has worked as a volunteer in my office over the past few weeks—and I do not think she will ever want to see a Christmas card again.</para>
<para>Finally I want to thank my wife, Penny, and our children, Peter, Melissa, Richard and James, who are my greatest and most fearless supporters. I do not think many people other than those who are in this chamber realise or appreciate just how demanding being a member of parliament is and also how very valuable support from families is. I am sure that you would appreciate that, when you become Speaker, that support is doubly appreciated. As usual, Penny and my family have stood beside me at every step as I go through parliament, and I certainly count their love and support as one of the very special parts of my life.</para>
<para>We have come to the end of 2004 and, as has been said, it has been a very demanding year. No doubt 2005 in its own way will be a very demanding year. I too would like to extend to everyone my very best wishes for a healthy, happy, safe and peaceful Christmas and, hopefully, a very good New Year. I certainly look forward to catching up again with everyone when the parliament resumes in February.</para>

<para>—I rise today to take the opportunity to congratulate a group of students in my electorate who will be competing against students from around the world in an international competition. Normally, one would think that students in my electorate involved in an international academic competition would be students from the University of Wollongong—a world-class institution—but that is not the case on this occasion. This time the competitors are year 6 students from the Illawarra Grammar School. Lauren Aitcheson, Nisha Fernandez, Quynh-Dan Nguyen and Naomi Wootton make up the Illawarra Grammar School’s junior team which recently won the national finals of the Macquarie Bank Future Problem Solving Program.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">The Future Problem Solving Program is aimed at the development of critical, creative and futuristic thinking skills. I understand the program has been operating in Australia since the early 1990s and more than 5,000 students from across the country have participated. In the national finals in Melbourne, 13 junior teams, 29 middle teams and 17 senior teams competed. In this competition students are presented with a scenario and are given two hours to brainstorm 16 potential problems with that scenario, from which they select one problem to create an action plan on how to solve it. It would be nice if we could all pick the problems we want to solve, but it is a good learning experience for the students. They then have three hours to write and perform a three-minute skit to present the problem and how they would solve it. To add to the difficulty of the task, they are required to include given phrases and mystery props. It encourages the students to think outside the box on challenging and difficult issues and is an excellent competition. It teaches the value of time management, team work, critical thinking and decision making—skills that will no doubt be important to them in their future endeavours.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">During this year’s program the team has grappled with issues such as smart clothes, bullying, artificial intelligence and the influence and impact of the media. In the international competition their scenario will be based around the topic of business crime. This year’s junior team is not the only team of skilled problem solvers from the Illawarra Grammar School. It had nine other teams in the national finals in Melbourne, four of which won places. In fact the Illawarra Grammar School is no stranger to success in competition on the international stage. However, the girls heading off to compete at the University of Kentucky next year are the first junior team from the school to compete at an international level. I wish to take the opportunity today to extend my best wishes to the team and to their dedicated coach, Ms Jan Hales, as they prepare for the competition. I am sure their hours of preparation will pay off and I wish them all the best in this international competition. I know they will do our area very proud on the world stage.</para>

<para>—Today I would like to take this opportunity to implore the Labor Premier of Queensland, Peter Beattie, to reconsider his decision to lock horse trail riders and beekeepers out of our state forests. I do not know whom the Premier was speaking to prior to announcing this decision, but it definitely was not the peak bodies of the trail riders or beekeepers associations. They are shocked that this decision was made without any input or consideration from them.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">There are thousands of hectares of state forest in Queensland with presently very limited access to cleared paths for horse riders and beekeeping vehicles. In fact they have no access to approximately nine-tenths of the forest, so logic tells us that they cannot possibly cause widespread disturbance to native animals—not by any stretch of the imagination. I have spoken to many horse trail riders and have been told that they stay to the tracks because they would not want to risk causing damage to their horses. It is exactly the same situation with beekeepers—they use the same trails as park rangers and do not deviate from them because they do not want to damage their vehicles or equipment.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I call on the Premier to explain his decision and to present the scientific proof to back his claims that these two pursuits are causing environmental damage. Can the Premier please list all the native animals that no longer exist because of the presence of horses on the tracks? Can he outline which types of flora are being threatened? It is a fair enough request. If he has got the proof to back up his claims, then let us see it. I for one would like to know how this supposed damage was ever allowed to happen. Mr Premier, knowing the dedication of the many state park rangers, surely you are not casting doubt on their ability to maintain and protect our parks?</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I suspect this decision is based solely on the claims of an environmental group. The Premier should know by now that you cannot make decisions on the opinions of self-appointed special interest groups. The Premier has a responsibility to demand scientific proof and data, to consult with the relevant stakeholders and to make a responsible and informed decision. The forests are beautiful places to spend time in, and they are a very safe environment for trail riders. The alternative is that you force the horses onto our roads, and you are then placing riders and vehicle drivers at serious risk.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I also have to ask: what damage has the honey bee done to our state forests? Certainly the bees were an introduced species in the 1860s, but they now play an important role in pollination. Where is the data suggesting they are causing damage? I can speak first-hand about the care taken by beekeepers when working in state forests. My husband is a beekeeper who currently has permits to work in these forests. I know his procedure when checking his hives. There is only limited road access. The roads are the same ones used by the park rangers. Has Mr Beattie even considered the impact this hasty decision will have on our state’s honey industry? I urge the Premier to go back to the drawing board, to invite all interested groups to the table to discuss it and to let them have input into such an important decision. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I rise today to speak about the very desperate need for an after-hours GP clinic in Tweed Heads. This is a very important health issue in our local area. In fact, there are many important health issues, and we have had a real crisis in our health area, particularly due to the declining bulk-billing rates. In fact, it is virtually impossible to find a doctor who bulk-bills in the Tweed and throughout Richmond. Many families have told me of the difficulties they have with that and the increasing cost of seeing a doctor. This impacts particularly upon the elderly and young families. As we all know, when one child gets sick, the whole family gets sick. Many people have told me that it is just not an option for them to go and see their GP, and they often wait and end up getting sicker.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Currently, we do not have any after-hours GP services in the Tweed, so this creates another major problem. People can get sick at any time, 24 hours of the day in fact. This, combined with the lack of people who are actually able to access GP services during the day, has created a major problem, particularly within Tweed Heads. What ends up happening is that many people present at our accident emergency rooms. The Tweed Hospital is the busiest hospital outside of Sydney. It is nonstop in there. You can go in there at any time of the day and there are people waiting—and a lot of those people are those who cannot afford to access GP services, or they are there because it is after hours. Due to the location of the hospital, with so many visitors to the area, it is always busy. That places an absolutely huge strain on our emergency section at Tweed Heads hospital. The staff at the hospital do a marvellous job under increasingly difficult circumstances. This is a problem that has worsened recently. People have told me that they have often had to wait hours to be seen, often for minor health services they require that could be attended to by a GP. With an elderly population—20 per cent of our population is aged over 65—after-hours services are necessary.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">During the election campaign the minister for health made a commitment to an after-hours clinic, and earlier this week in question time I specifically asked him when the clinic would be opened and what funding it would be provided. He refused to give the families of Richmond an adequate answer, but as their federal MP it is my job to keep the government accountable for the promises it made to them during the election campaign. There was a very positive response to federal Labor’s commitment to an after-hours GP clinic and, in particular, to the fact that it would be co-located at the Tweed Heads hospital. We need to have it co-located at the hospital to ensure the safety and security of patients and staff. Elderly and sick patients should not have to travel to isolated, dark locations in search of treatment, and staff should not be placed in similar situations that compromise their safety. So I will be fighting to ensure that Tweed Heads gets this after-hours GP clinic and making sure the government keeps its election promise.</para>

<para>—I rise today to highlight an opportunity for our community, one that responds to the great hardship and difficulty that family separation presents. I and a number of my colleagues, including the member for Forde and the member for Hinkler, have spent many years trying to improve the way in which our legal framework supports or at least reduces any difficulties that are presented for families that are separating, particularly with the best interests of the children in mind. We know that a lot of the architecture of the community support and government response to family breakdown tends to be very legalistic in its nature. Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, you and I have often talked about the way the family law system and the Child Support Agency, although designed with the best intentions, can often aggravate an already difficult and emotionally distressing time for families, and the best interests of the children do not always seem to be uppermost in people’s minds.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">As a result of that, I have been very active in trying to secure funding for a one-stop integrated family relationship mediation and children’s contact centre to help strengthen families, promote positive parenting and support relationships pre and post separation. What is encouraging about that is the support that exists at a local level, through the community legal service, the community health service and a number of other agencies which deal with the human trauma of separation. What is also encouraging about their commitment to a similar goal is that it now looks like we have an opportunity to secure an outcome, with the government’s announcement that it will be establishing new family relationship centres across Australia to help parents resolve disputes and focus on the best interests of the children.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">At the moment, in the community that I represent, we have a high number of Child Support Agency clients. We have a number of episodes of apprehended violence orders and things of that nature, where family distress has boiled over into hardship and tension within households. That is certainly not in the best interests of children. The GordonCare centre, the contact centre that was established by the Howard government a number of years ago, has been a wonderful new service. Where family tension has stopped a parent from seeing their child, having access and contributing to the growth and development of that child, that is now able to be facilitated through the GordonCare access centre. But even there the resources are stretched and the waiting lists are long.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I am looking forward to working with those agencies that I mentioned, and with Anglicare and the family mediation services that are currently at a very limited level within our electorate, to secure this opportunity that has been made possible by the Howard government and to make sure that a family relationship centre located in Frankston, servicing the greater peninsula area and the bayside area, is something that we can deliver. That is in the best interests of families and the best interests of children and it complements the legalistic framework that we have to live with right now, which does not give us the tools to get the best outcomes for families. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—In recent times I have become most concerned about the direction Centrelink has taken when making determinations on difficult cases. I would like to share with the chamber one of those cases that has created serious concern for me. A young girl, Chantelle Noon, lives at San Remo. She is only 16 years old and she has recently become pregnant. She is four months pregnant and is living with her boyfriend. Her boyfriend was involved in an assault. He was not in receipt of any Centrelink payments until a decision was made on that matter. We have been able to help with that: that decision has been made and Centrelink are now paying the boyfriend some money. But for a period of some six weeks those two young people were living on charity, living on money that they received from his parents to keep them going until such time as they received some money from Centrelink. In addition to that, they had to rely on local charities. That is hardly the start that a young couple, who are going to find it difficult at the best of times, need to start their life together.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">The young girl has been thrown out of home. Her mother will not allow her to return home under any circumstance at all. She will not give her any financial support; she will not give her any emotional support. There has been a letter from her mother stating these facts quite clearly. She will not support this young girl. Centrelink has rejected Chantelle’s claim for youth allowance.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I do not really think this is good enough. I think this is a very heartless decision that has been taken. We have worked closely with the office, and the social worker has told us that she has tried to get around the legislation to be able to make a payment to this young girl but has not been able to do so. She says the reason is the harsh nature of the legislation and the guidelines they have been given on interpreting that legislation. The guidelines say that, because the girl talks to her mother, even though her mother will not allow her to live in her house, even though her mother will not give her a cent to help support her, Centrelink should determine that there is a relationship between the mother and daughter. I think this is very harsh. This is a situation that can scar this young couple for life—a young couple that is going to find it difficult to succeed at the best of times and that deserves some financial support. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—State and federal governments of both political colours have told areas that are suffering challenging agricultural times that they should look to tourism. Yet in the House in the last fortnight we have seen the Labor Party do the exact opposite, showing that they are not interested in the Regional Partnerships program and what it can deliver to regional Australia.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">I want to talk today about the Reginald Murray Williams Australian Bush Centre at Eidsvold. This had its genesis in an agriforestry project. A deputation came to Canberra in November 2000 to start promoting this project. It received assistance under the Regional Solutions Program in February 2001. Then followed an impact statement by the University of Queensland and an agribusiness plan by the Queensland Department of Primary Industries and a site inspection report by the Department of Natural Resources—both Queensland government agencies. Interestingly, they found that it was a good project. When R.M. Williams died, it was decided to expand the project to honour R.M. Williams, who had lived much of his life in the Eidsvold area, and to expand the project, which would be called the Reginald Murray Williams Australian Bush Centre.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The member for Batman actually came to Eidsvold with my opponent in the last election and said it was an interesting project and he would make representations to the state government on their behalf. He has since said it was a project he did not think was viable, so the Labor Party have spoken with forked tongues on this particular project. At the same time as they were doing that, the Leader of the Opposition and Senator Kerry O’Brien were in Bundaberg pledging $1½ million to a turtle interpretive centre, for which, I might add, no federal funds had ever been requested or applied for. On top of that, he also promised $1 million to the Austoft project, where there was no known proponent. We did not even know for what purpose the site was going to be used, and for that particular usage there had been no application.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The Labor Party talk with forked tongues on this sort of thing. They show scant regard for people like the people of Eidsvold—900 people struggling to find an industry, a core tourist attraction, to secure their community. It is a disgrace and stands to their eternal shame not only that they treat country people in a spirit of denigration but also that they speak with forked tongues when they visit those places.</para>

<para pgwide="yes">I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R2227">Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill 2004</inline>. This omnibus bill simplifies and brings into alignment the financial management provisions of a number of Commonwealth acts associated with accrual accounting and generally updates the financial frameworks arrangements. These amendments will align the financial management provisions of 85 acts with the provisions of the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997, which was amended by the Financial Management Legislation Amendment Act 1999.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The amendments to the FMA Act were part of the adoption by the Commonwealth of the accrual budgeting and reporting framework on 1 July 1999. These amendments add to the information requirements for a determination made by the Minister for Finance and Administration that establishes a special account under section 20 of the Financial Management and Accountability Act. The amendments also transfer from the Treasurer to the finance minister powers and functions under 25 acts to approve investments, money raising and guarantees for specific entities that are legally separate from the Commonwealth, and to provide the finance minister with the power to delegate these powers and functions. The bill also updates, clarifies and aligns other financial management and reporting provisions.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Despite the merits of the proposed amendments, it has taken the government over five years to act on any inefficiencies of government departments and entities. The Department of Finance and Administration, which is responsible for developing and maintaining the financial framework of the Commonwealth public sector in terms of accountability and transparency, has been recently examined in an Australian National Audit Office report. This report assessed departmental financial management and reporting against that established by the Department of Finance and Administration. The Auditor-General’s report No. 15, <inline font-style="italic">Financial management of special appropriations</inline>, was scathing in its findings. The report clearly highlighted that the Department of Finance and Administration’s financial management framework has not been followed. This reflects the lack of transparency in the public accounts reported to the parliament. This, of course, raises the question: why did the government allow this financial incompetence and mismanagement to continue for over five years? And, more importantly, what responsibility does the Prime Minister take for this financial incompetence?</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In trying to seek answers to these questions, it is important to note some of the Auditor-General’s criticisms, including (1) drawings by five departments/entities relying on incorrect appropriations from 1998-99 to 2002-03 totalling some $393 million; (2) spending by one department against legislation that had not been passed by parliament between 2001 and 2003, in this instance totalling some $7.26 billion; (3) spending by two entities that was not approved by the parliament totalling $23 million, $6.96 million of which was in breach of section 83 of the Constitution; and (4) failure by two entities to disclose payments totalling some $13.1 billion.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I invite the parliamentary secretary, when she is summing up on this bill, to explain to the parliament why this financial mismanagement continued for so long. I challenge her to explain the situation to the House today. Why were the minister and the government asleep at the wheel? Let me give the parliamentary secretary an example: why did the Department of Veterans’ Affairs operate an illegal operating overdraft in 2002-03 in breach of its contract with its bank? Parliamentary Secretary, these are important issues, asked in the correct spirit—in the spirit of accountability in this parliament—and I invite you to respond.</para>

<para>—in reply—I thank those who have spoken in the debate on this legislation. I particularly thank the member for Hunter for his contribution to the debate, although he seems to be a good reader of newspapers rather than a student of the bill itself. The <inline ref="R2227">Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill 2004</inline> is a comprehensive and detailed bill, and it proposes amendments to 112 acts and the repeal of 28 acts. The FFLA Bill, as I will refer to it, has been subject to external scrutiny. An exposure draft of the bill was considered by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, culminating in the tabling of its report on 20 August 2003. The JCPAA was broadly supportive of the bill and recommended that it be introduced into parliament as soon as was feasible.</para>

<para pgwide="yes">I would now like to turn to schedule 1 of the FFLA Bill. About three-quarters of the contents of the bill represent amendments of a housekeeping nature, in particular aligning financial management provisions in 85 acts with changes made to the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997, the FMA Act, on 1 July 1999. The changes made to the FMA Act were made by the Financial Management Legislation Amendment Act 1999 and were designed to facilitate the adoption of accrual budgeting from that date. The FMLA ACT 1999 abolished separate accounting funds, adopted the concept of a self-executing consolidated revenue fund and introduced the concept of special accounts to replace two of the accounting funds created in the FMA Act. These changes streamlined the financial framework with the best view of how the government’s finances are dealt with in a constitutional sense.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">By bringing up to date the text of 85 acts and so replacing the deeming provisions of the FMLA Act 1999, the FFLA Bill will improve the understanding and operation of the financial framework of the Australian government, particularly in relation to special accounts established by acts. Schedule 1 of the FFLA Bill delivers on the commitment made by the previous Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration in his second reading of the FMLA Act 1999, which he made on 10 February that year. He stated that a consequential amendments bill would be introduced to ensure that terminology in other acts is consistent with the FMA Act as amended by the FMLA Act 1999.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The FFLA Bill also enhances a framework applying to special accounts established in determinations of the finance minister. It does this by specifying additional information to be included in a determination that establishes a special account. Parliament will benefit from this amendment because such determinations are disallowable by parliament over a period of five sitting days before they take effect.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In regard to schedule 2 of the FFLA Bill, most of the amendments proposed in schedule 2 provide for the transfer of powers from the Treasurer to the finance minister to approve investments, money raising and guarantees of certain bodies that are legally and financially separate from the Australian government. This type of amendment covers 25 acts, and most of the bodies affected are authorities subject to the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997. The transfer of these approval powers will co-locate with the finance minister powers relating to the financial oversight of bodies that are mainly funded from the budget. This will provide for more efficient and effective decision making in relation to the resources available to these entities. A similar transfer of power is also included in relation to the High Court of Australia. The amendments in most of the acts also provide for the delegation of powers from the finance minister to an official defined in the FMA Act as a person who is an agency or is part of an agency. Providing delegation powers will facilitate efficient public administration.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The member for Hunter was concerned about the long gestation period of the FFLA Bill. Obviously, this bill is extraordinarily large and complex. It was subject to a JCPAA inquiry, and we required the agreement of all portfolio ministers. In particular, the deeming provisions in the FMLA Act 1999 change terminology in enabling acts.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We have an extraordinarily well-organised financial management structure and system in our country, one which has delivered to this country one of the longest periods of sustained economic growth. To suggest that Australia is anything other than an extraordinarily well-run country in terms of its financial management by the Australian government is a lot of nonsense.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Finally, I recommend that the House of Representatives agree to the FFLA Bill. When enacted, the bill will update, clarify and align a wide range of financial management provisions applying to a range of activities and entities, thereby continuing to enhance the financial management framework of the Australian government generally—which is, I might add, the envy of the developed world. I commend the bill to the House.</para>

<para>—I am pleased to be able to make a contribution to the debate on the <inline ref="R2225">Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Bill 2004</inline>. When we talk about water efficiency and especially about the supply and use of fresh water, it is worth remembering a few important facts. Some 97.5 per cent of the world’s water is salt water and is unfit for human use. The majority of fresh water is beyond our reach, locked in polar snow and ice. Less than one per cent of fresh water is useable, amounting to only 0.01 per cent of the earth’s total water. This could be enough to support the world’s population three times over, but only if used with care.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Water, just like population, is not distributed evenly. Asia has the greatest annual availability of fresh water and, disturbingly, Australia has the lowest. Australia’s rainfall is the lowest of the continents, excluding Antarctica. This low rainfall, combined with very high evaporation, leads to low river flows. Despite this, Australia has one of the highest per capita consumption rates in the world. While two-thirds of all the people on earth use less than 60 litres of water a day, the average Australian uses more than twice that amount during a single shower—something we should all think about in our personal lives.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Access to clean, safe water is fundamental to public health and our quality of life. Australians expect that, when we turn on our taps, the water that comes out will be clean and safe. That expectation is deeply ingrained in our way of life. We take it for granted, but many people in the world cannot. However, Australia’s growing population, combined with our drought-prone climate, means that we simply have to learn to do more with less. Indeed, we are likely to have droughts more frequently if the predicted effects of global climate change kick in. Nevertheless, I am hopeful. I believe Australia can become one of the most water efficient communities in the world; however, we all have to rethink where water comes from, how it is used and how it is reused. Water shortages in New South Wales, Western Australia, Victoria and South Australia in recent times have shown us that the efficient use of water is not simply a response to the current drought. It is an essential step in learning to live with less water without compromising our way of life.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There are no simple solutions to our water shortage. What is needed is a multifaceted approach that combines new sources, new efficiency measures and innovative ways of reusing our waste water. Clearly, water use is one of the key environmental challenges for Australia. Indeed, after climate change, I think it is the most serious issue. There have been manifestations of this in recent times. Over in Perth, there are plans for a desalinisation plant costing an estimated $350 million, simply because there are no local sources of water to meet that city’s water needs. In Adelaide, a great deal of work is being done on salt interception schemes around the Murray River. These schemes are aimed at preventing the deterioration of Adelaide’s drinking water. The work is pretty important because, if nothing is done, by the year 2020 Adelaide’s water will not meet the World Health Organisation guidelines on two days out of five. Just think about that: on two days out of every five in Adelaide—a major capital city in Australia—the water will effectively be undrinkable according to international standards, unless we act.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Melbourne was on stage 2 water restrictions for most of 2003. Sydney’s problems with water have a very high profile. I know the issues all too well. In Sydney we cannot use sprinklers or watering systems at any time and there are restrictions on washing cars, filling pools and general watering of gardens. As of last Thursday, Sydney’s main water supply, Warragamba Dam, was only filled to 43.4 per cent of its capacity. Everyone in Sydney knows water use is a serious issue. The question of water use and water efficiency that is before us in the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Bill 2004 is a very serious challenge facing this nation.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The purpose of the bill is to provide for the establishment and operation of a scheme to apply national water efficiency labelling and minimum performance standards to certain water use products. The aim of water efficiency labelling is to encourage the uptake of water efficient products and appliances in domestic and commercial areas. This bill’s objects are to conserve water supplies by reducing water consumption, to provide information for the purchasers of water use products and to promote the adoption of efficient and effective water use technology. It provides for the establishment of a national water efficiency labelling and standards scheme to be implemented cooperatively by the Commonwealth, state and territory governments. It provides for penalties to be put in place for those who fail to comply with the registration, labelling and minimum efficiency and performance requirements and for an enforcement regime. It is estimated the bill will reduce consumption of water in households and non-residential buildings by five per cent by 2021.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This is an objective which the Labor Party supports, but in fact we determine that it is an inadequate objective. We need to do much more. We really need to use water better and reduce our consumption of water in households and non-residential buildings by five per cent in a much shorter time frame. We need to reduce water consumption much more rapidly than by 2021. It is also expected that there will be some greenhouse gas reductions through reducing water heating associated with these measures. The legislation is being funded from savings identified in the Measures for a Better Environment package and it picks up on recommendation 4 of the Senate inquiry into urban water use.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It is my understanding that those who have been consulted, including the product suppliers and retailers, have actively supported the introduction of this scheme. It addresses the mandatory labelling of most water use products, but in relation to mandatory performance standards it only applies to toilet use. It is the view of the opposition that the legislation is weaker than it could have been, that the environmental benefits would not be fully realised and that there is a case for standards to apply much more broadly. It is the view of the Labor Party that water efficiency performance standards ought to apply to more water use products. It is for that reason that I will be moving, as a second reading amendment:</para>
<motion pgwide="yes">
<para pgwide="yes">That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">“whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that the Government:</para>
<list type="decimal">

<item label="(2)">
<para>should be condemned due to the failure of the Measures for a Better Environment package, from which funding has been drawn to finance this Bill, to deliver environmental outcomes”.</para>
</item>
</list>
</motion>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">We make these points against the background that Australia is one of the highest per capita consumers of water in the world. In Australian households, each person uses around 350 litres each and every day, yet our national reuse of effluent is just 14 per cent. If we could do more to reclaim and reuse stormwater, treated sewage effluent, treated industrial discharge and grey or household waste water, we would be in a much better position to deal with shortages and it would boost our environment and indeed have economic benefits as well.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">An integrated approach which considers all sources of water available to urban areas is needed to achieve a significant improvement in water use efficiency in urban areas. Reclaimed water can be used for a whole range of purposes, such as irrigation of city parks and sports ovals, industrial applications and cooling water. Surplus floodwater can be used to recharge natural aquifers, and safe, treated urban effluent can be used on crops. There are many other uses besides. The government should be working with the states and territories to improve water quality and the environmental outcomes of urban water management. The government should be investigating incentives for promoting stormwater and wastewater reuse and the integration of these issues in strategic planning of urban areas. The government should be using the COAG process to implement national initiatives to promote water saving measures such as rainwater tanks, water saving showerheads and tap fittings, dual flush toilets and increased use of grey water.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Another area I want to mention in relation to urban water use is the research effort. The Commonwealth research effort in this crucial area has largely dried up. The government should be renewing the role of the Commonwealth in research and development in irrigation, water reuse and innovation. Promoting water reuse research will yield many dividends including better design and value from experimental projects and monitoring, covering gaps, integrating project results, ensuring quality control and disseminating information effectively to those who need it. Establishing an urban water research program would support innovation in reuse of stormwater, reuse of effluent, water conservation, water sensitive urban design and urban water planning and management practices.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The government should establish a national program of research to promote sustainable water use in Australia with a particular focus on water reuse. This is a very significant challenge facing Australia in relation to domestic water use. Domestic households account for around 16 per cent of the consumption of mains supplied water in Australia. That is the second largest share of mains water use after the agricultural, forestry and mining sectors, as you might expect. Per household, the amount of water used for indoor purposes appears to be reasonably similar across many of Australia’s larger capital cities. The main indoor use is showering, which accounts for around 29 per cent of indoor consumption, followed by toilet flushing and washing machines, which each account for about 26 per cent. Taps over baths, sinks, handbasins and laundry tubs account for 18 per cent and dishwashers account for one per cent.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In terms of overall domestic consumption, it is worth noting that the amount of water used for outdoor purposes varies considerably between cities, with Perth using five times as much per household as Sydney, although some of the Perth supply comes from bores rather than main sources. I think both sides of the chamber might take this up with our Western Australian colleagues, because it certainly surprised me that there was such an extraordinary difference between the east and the west coasts of the continent.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Between 1996 and 2001, the supply of water to households in the main urban areas of Australia increased at around 3.4 per cent per annum. According to information from the Water Services Association of Australia, water consumption in two state capitals is already beyond the safe yield level, meaning that additional supplies or effective demand measures are required immediately. According to the association, three other capitals will be beyond the safe yield level between 2012 and 2020. That is a very serious situation and it requires action.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Back in December 2002, a Senate committee completed an inquiry into Australia’s management of urban water. The committee commented extensively on the issue of urban demand management, saying that there is considerable scope to reduce water use and achieve efficiencies so that water efficient appliances such as dual flush toilets, low flow showerheads, washing machines and dishwashers can dramatically reduce water use in homes. This approach can be coupled with water efficient gardens, minimal lawns and the use of native plants and efficient watering systems. The committee found that the fundamental factor in a successful demand management program was changing behaviour away from habits such as hosing down driveways and gutters, watering lawns during the heat of the day and having long showers.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">So, what will be the impact of the labelling scheme which is provided for in the bill? According to modelling undertaken in developing the regulatory impact statement, the impact of the labelling component of the scheme will be to reduce total household water use by about five per cent by 2021, as compared with the ‘business as usual’ approach. No modelling has been done for the introduction of efficiency standards across all of the six products that were considered: washing machines, dishwashers, toilets, showerheads, taps and urinals. The regulatory impact statement suggests that, for water users, the cost of water-efficient products will most likely be higher, but consumers will benefit from a net saving because water bills will be lower.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The regulatory impact statement also considered manufacturers and importers, noting that labelling will come into force 12 months after the regulations under this bill are finalised. Consultations with manufacturers and importers indicate that this notice period will be enough to ensure that products are labelled correctly. As water efficiency labelling has an influence on consumer preference, the extent to which the sales of various manufacturers and importers are affected will depend on the water efficiency of their product ranges; manufacturers and importers that offer only products of low water efficiency will obviously be disadvantaged.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Retailers that carry at least some water efficient models should be advantaged. Those that specialise in low-cost products with low water efficiency will be disadvantaged. As the awareness of water labels is likely to build up over time, retailers should have ample time to sell their old stocks and order in more efficient models from a water perspective. The regulatory impact statement also says that the impact of water efficiency labelling on plumbers and builders is likely to be gradual. Plumbers and builders will still be free to select or recommend products irrespective of water efficiency, as many do now, and will be able to remove the water efficiency labels before end users see them; however, the labelling requirement should assist those plumbers and builders who take an interest in, or seek competitive advantage from, advising clients on water and energy efficient products.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We need to involve as many people in the community as possible. We particularly need those in the trades who supply these products to be very conscious of doing their bit by supplying products which minimise water use. We need to promote a culture which encourages consumers to use those products which in the longer term are necessary if we are not to go down the road of being in an increasingly precarious position with regard to the supply of fresh water. There are already programs under way to raise plumbers’ awareness of water product efficiency, including the GreenPlumbers program, run by the Master Plumbers and Mechanical Services Association of Australia, which gets some funding from the Greenhouse Office. I congratulate them for that.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It is also worth noting that the introduction of water efficiency labelling for various indoor water use products is expected to have only a modest effect on household consumption, and that effect will take some time to materialise. The requirement for labelling foreshadowed by the bill is a positive step, but it is only one aspect of managing the demand for water by Australian households. In this context, it would certainly be worth while for modelling to be done on how the introduction of compulsory water efficiency standards for other products, like new showerheads and new washing machines, would affect household consumption.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In conclusion, water is a very substantial challenge for Australia. It is a substantial challenge for our environment. It is a substantial challenge to get our water use right in rural areas and to maintain healthy river systems. It is also a substantial challenge to get our water use right in urban areas, to take action concerning ocean outfalls, to lift our water reuse and recycling and to reduce our water demand so that we can have sustainable practices in our cities and our rural and regional areas. Against that background, we support the legislation. However, we do not think it goes far enough. The opposition believe the government ought to be acting with a great sense of urgency. In our second reading amendment we indicate that the government ought to be delivering water efficiency standards for a range of indoor water use products and that it ought to be taking up what is a significant opportunity to reduce household water consumption.

<para>—I rise with great pleasure today to talk about the <inline ref="R2088">Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Bill 2004</inline>. One of the main objectives of this bill is to conserve water supplies by reducing water consumption, and that is the responsibility of all Australians. It should not just be sectioned out; it is for all of us to consider. The other objectives are to provide information to purchasers of water use products and to promote the adoption of efficient and effective water use technology—something I certainly want to talk about in my contribution today. We all share in the responsibility to use water more efficiently. We talk about Australia being the driest continent on earth. The fact is that the water that we have today is the water we will have in the future. We do not and will not have any more water than we have today, unless we look at other options such as the desalination of the ocean waters surrounding this great island continent.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">This is not just an issue for rural dwellers; it is not just an issue for people on the land. Representing a rural electorate as I do, I often get rather upset at those who seem to shift the blame to farmers as being the villains in so many areas of water consumption in Australia. Many of our farmers are taking up new technologies and using greater efficiency measures with the water that they have, which is the lifeblood of their enterprises. It is for all of us to consider. I think we have to be in partnership with our city and urban dwellers and with our industries, whether they are mining, industries in our cities or the great sporting fields and golf courses that are being built day to day around Australia. We all share in the responsibility to make sure that we use water efficiently now and in the future, to make sure that it is sustainable in the long term.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">One of the great challenges in Queensland is the growth of the population in the south-east corner. I am delighted to have with me in the Main Committee today the member for Blair. He and I share a common vision of the waste water in the south-east corner being shared, rather than what is happening to it now—being pumped into Moreton Bay, which is going to create a significant environmental problem in the future. I will talk a little bit more about that later.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">One of the proposals that was worked on by the Page Research Centre was about the involvement of local government in this responsibility of using water more efficiently. Water today does have a value. Once upon a time I think the perception was that water came out of a tap and it had no value. And it was treated that way. We in this parliament have probably all seen it that way from time to time—we have turned the tap on to clean our teeth and just let it run because we thought it had no value and it has an endless source. But it has a very real value.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The Page Research Centre, which I was working with, released a paper on the way local governments price water to their consumers. Various methods are used by local governments around Australia to price the cost of water to their ratepayers. One of the things that I think were fairly constant, but not universal, was the fact that local governments would set a water charge to their ratepayers—which obviously included the cost of delivering the water, their infrastructure and making sure that the water meets world health standards. They are all costs which local governments deal with and, in order for them to be able to remain viable in delivering this water, they have to be able to charge their ratepayers.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">One of the things that I noticed was that many local governments were charging ratepayers for an allocation of water. If those ratepayers, who are metered, went over that allocation then they would be charged excess water rates. What the governments were not doing was giving a rebate to those water users who used less than that allocation. In other words, those ratepayers who used less than the allocation that was set by the council as the allocation for their residents were actually being penalised. They were not being encouraged to use less, so they would use the allocation because they were paying for it. Those who went over the allocation paid excess water rates, but those who used less than their allocation did not get a rebate.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I would like to see local governments around Australia—and many have started to use the model that was put out by the Page Research Centre—universally start to price their water on the basis of the amount of water people use: the more people use, the more they will pay. Once again, that is an encouragement to use water more wisely and to invest in water-efficient methods around the home. In other words, instead of paying for more water because it is not being used wisely or efficiently, people invest those savings in water-efficient saving measures in and around the house.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I will now talk about a little project in my electorate that I think is innovative and shows great vision by the Dalby Town Council in the way they are now providing water to their ratepayers in the town of Dalby. For many years the town of Dalby and many communities along the Condamine-Balonne river system in my electorate have drawn their water from the Condamine River. For years and years, nearly every summer there would be water restrictions in the town. They are addressing that issue in various ways. One of them is to tap into the underground water reserves—but of course the underground water reserves in that part of Queensland carry too much salt for domestic consumption. So they have invested in reverse osmosis technology—in other words, they are cleaning the water and removing the salts carried in that water so that it can be used within the township of Dalby. That has certainly been a great cost to them, and I acknowledge that they have had some financial support from the state government of Queensland to invest in this reverse osmosis technology. It is not new technology—it has been around for years—but every year the technology improves. That technology is something that can also obviously be used along the eastern seaboard and all around our nation to meet some of our requirements for water.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I commend the Dalby town council for their investment in the reverse osmosis plant. It now provides something like 30 per cent of the town’s water supply. By tapping into the underground water reserves, it releases water for environmental flows into the Condamine. They are replacing what they used to pump from the Condamine for the town supply with underground water that they have converted, through the reverse osmosis process, from water carrying too much salt; and that now supplies part of the town’s water needs.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It also means that there is a greater water supply available to industry. In many of our rural communities, investment in industry has been held back because there is not sufficient water. The first thing any industry would be looking at in coming to a town in the inland of Australia is what water is available. If a town is already on restrictions for much of the year for its residents, usually it finds it very difficult to encourage industry to come to the town, because it would put a greater penalty on the existing residents as the water just is not available. Lack of available water with which to encourage industry to establish in our rural communities has held back many of our rural towns.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There is another project in which I know the member for Blair would share my interest. It is one of those great visionary projects and it has been on the political agenda and the agenda of the communities of the Lockyer Valley, Toowoomba and the Darling Downs probably for 10 to 15 years. I have to commend all those—including local government, farmers and bankers—who have been involved in what was originally called Vision 2000. The year 2000 has passed us by and they have now converted to the name ‘NuWater’. I am a strong supporter of the NuWater proposal. As a group, they have been working for about 10 years now on the proposition of bringing part of Brisbane’s waste water to the Lockyer Valley and over the range to the Darling Downs.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Brisbane currently, as I understand it, produces something like 130,000 megalitres of grey water each year. With the growth in the south-east corner of Queensland, that amount is going to continue to grow to something like 180,000 megalitres of water per year in the next 20 years. Currently, nearly all of that water is just pumped into Moreton Bay. It presents an environmental hazard today, and it is going to increasingly present greater environmental hazards to beautiful Moreton Bay, around which Brisbane is built.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The proponents of NuWater are in the final stages of their engineering and economic studies. In fact, they have been a recipient of some of our Regional Partnerships money to do those economic, feasibility and engineering studies. This project is going to cost something like $500 million. The farmers, the bankers who are backing the farmers, and the industries in the Darling Downs and in the Lockyer Valley around Gatton are backing this. The amount that the banks are prepared to lend them is something like $1,000 per megalitre of water. This is not just an ask on government; these people see the need for this project and are prepared to invest heavily themselves. They have the financial backing of their bankers, and I am hopeful that, as next year progresses and as they complete the engineering and feasibility studies, they will be successful in their application for some of the $2 billion Water Fund moneys that the government announced during the federal election.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The other thing that I think is terribly important about this project is that it is a win-win situation. It is an environmental win for Moreton Bay; it is also an environmental win for the Lockyer Valley and for the sustainability of the communities that depend on agriculture in the Lockyer Valley. Also, the 85,000 megalitres that they propose to pump over the Dividing Range and into the Darling Downs will replace water that is currently drawn from the Condamine-Balonne river system on the Darling Downs. So it will release water that otherwise would have been pumped and used for farming and industry in that part of Queensland. So it will be an environmental benefit to the Condamine-Balonne, which is at the headwaters in Queensland of the great Murray-Darling Basin. There are huge environmental wins for the coastal areas, for the Lockyer Valley and west of the Dividing Range into the Condamine-Balonne river system, where the water would enter just below Toowoomba.</para>

<para>—Absolutely. This is a project that I, the member for Groom, the member for Blair, who is the chamber at the moment, and state members have been working on with NuWater for the last eight to 10 years. We hope that they will be successful in their application for some financial assistance under the Australian water fund. We also hope that we can get the Brisbane City Council to see the merit of this great project, because it is their water and they have to do something with it in the interests of the environment. We can see a great use for it, where the environment wins, regional Queensland wins and, of course, the Murray-Darling Basin wins.</para>

<para pgwide="yes">In conclusion, piping water great distances is nothing new in this nation. There was a similar project in Western Australia over 100 years ago. I am sure the member for Hasluck, who has just joined us here, will remind us all of that great project, which took water from Perth over 300 miles—I will be corrected when the member for Hasluck speaks—to Kalgoorlie. This project is similar in many ways, bringing water from a coastal region into the Lockyer Valley over the Dividing Range. So it is nothing new. The engineering has been around for more than 100 years. We now have to see whether it will stack up environmentally and economically and whether the proposition is ultimately able to get the support of bankers and, more importantly for me, the member for Maranoa, the member for Blair and, I am sure, member for Groom, whether it will get the support of the Commonwealth government through the Australian water fund. We want to see what is a dream for so many of us become a reality in the next 12 months because of the reasons I have outlined in my contribution today.</para>

<para>—I come to this debate not claiming any great degree of expertise. I was very interested in the comments made by the member for Maranoa when he said, I think quite rightly, that we have grown accustomed to not placing value on water. To that I plead guilty, but I think it is a healthy sign in our community that we are becoming much more conscious of the need to conserve our natural resources. I see the <inline ref="R2225">Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Bill 2004</inline> as part of an ongoing education campaign to assist the community in taking actions that, at an individual level, can contribute to the conservation of one of our most precious natural resources.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">I think the bill is a good start but, as our amendment indicates, it does not go as far as we would like. However, it is a good start in that it will establish a national scheme which will progressively apply water efficiency labelling requirements and minimum water efficiency standards to certain water use and water saving products. The initial emphasis will be on the labelling of those products, and I think we can take heart from the success that we have seen with the similar energy rating program. That in itself is to be welcomed. We are a little disappointed that the efficiency standards are at this stage only applied to toilets. We believe that there could have been scope for a broader application of performance standards.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">One hopes that through the actions proposed in this legislation we can play our part in urging the community to take up water efficient products and appliances, for household use as well as commercial use. Through the scheme we will be able to provide information for purchases of water use products and in so doing promote the adoption of efficient and effective water use technology.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I want to pause at that point to say that what I find very interesting in what has hitherto been rather a polarised debate about issues to do with employment and environmental outcomes is that in areas like this we can actually see the potential for the creation of a whole host of new employment opportunities in the community. In time, the information we will be providing and the take-up of these more efficient water use products will help promote new ideas, new technologies, new innovation and new ways of working, and hopefully there will be a spin-off in new jobs being created to help in the environmental outcomes we are all committed to.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It is good to see the scheme is proposed to be implemented cooperatively by all levels of government. You cannot do this one-out. At the end of the day it appears from the outcomes that we are looking at that it might help to substantially reduce the usage of water and to conserve our scarce supplies. What is interesting is that the issue of water conservation is not just affecting our nation but that, as with the issue of greenhouse gas emissions and the debate we had in the House yesterday, this problem is a global one. It is very worrying for those communities that are struggling to advance their own living standards and economic development that they will be really hard hit. According to United Nations estimates, water scarcity will affect two out of every three people by 2025. Alarmingly, one hears people say that, if there were to be a war—God forbid—then it would more likely be a war about water. That is how serious the situation is becoming.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">All these things are interrelated. Global warming, as everybody appreciates, could significantly harm water availability. A warmer atmosphere could lead to higher rates of evaporation, causing droughts and more severe weather. Faster run-off rates and slower infiltration of groundwater could follow. Warmer water may also promote detrimental algal blooms, which may lead to more waterborne illnesses. Ironically, as the climate heats up people will want to use more water for drinking, bathing and watering. So the interconnections are very important, and people have to have confidence that every small step that they take is a step that adds to the totality of our consciousness about the need to preserve our precious natural resources.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It is interesting that in terms of greenhouse emissions we lead the world on a per capita basis. With water it is the same: Australians are among the highest per capita consumers of water in the world. That is something that we need to be cognisant of. To the extent that this bill provides some scope for raising these issues in the public domain it is to be supported. I was alarmed in reading the background brief to this bill to see that each household uses around 350 litres a day. To that I plead guilty as well. As the member for Maranoa was saying, the lack of attributing value to water means that on many occasions we are less conscious than we ought to be about the necessity to preserve this resource. Domestic households now account for around 16 per cent of the consumption of mains supplied water in Australia. In context, it is the second largest share of mains water use after the agriculture, forestry and mining sectors. Within the home the main indoor use is showering, followed by toilet flushing and washing machines.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">So at every level within the home we can act to conserve water. We need to act to conserve it because, with population growth, the demand for water is increasing by around 3.4 per cent each year. This was driven home very forcefully in my state by the worrying signals we had about the water supplies in our dams and reservoirs being at an all-time low, and there was debate in the local community about whether or not it was time to seriously think about the introduction of desalinisation plants. I think everybody out there in the community is much more mindful of this precious commodity and the fact that we need to play our part in reducing consumption and looking after this natural resource. I do commend the government for bringing this bill to the parliament. I think it is a good step. It is not the total solution to these issues, but every step contributes to the broader picture.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I want to end by saying that, in trying to raise awareness and consciousness of these issues and saying that every little step we take matters, in my own electorate Sydney Water has piloted the Shellharbour Residential Retrofit Program. It involved the installation of water-efficient devices in homes to try to introduce measures which would save water in the flushing of toilets. I was surprised that even a simple measure like this resulted in a significant decrease in water use for the households that participated in the Shellharbour Residential Retrofit Program. It was very surprising too that, even in the homes that were not retrofitted, there was a marked decrease in water use in participant households who received educational materials alone on the issue of water efficiency—although, naturally, higher savings were achieved by households that had all the available equipment installed.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I note that in recent figures released by Sydney Water there has been an average reduction of about 29 per cent through all the local government areas that draw on Sydney Water. That is heartening in itself—that the issue is being taken up at the local government level, that local government with the instrumentalities are promoting community specific programs that are having an impact.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Water, like greenhouse gas emissions, is a very substantial challenge for our nation. It is a substantial challenge also for our environment and for the principle of intergenerational equity. We have to get our water use right, not just in urban areas but also in rural areas. We need to take action on the issue of ocean outfalls, which the member for Maranoa referred to; I think that is a growing and important issue. We need to lift our water reuse and recycling levels, and reduce our demand so that we have sustainable practices in both city and country areas. Against that background, I am happy to support the legislation that is before us in this bill. As indicated in our amendment, while supporting it we do believe that the situation is getting very critical and we would have been happy to see more of a broad-brush approach in the details of the bill.</para>

</talker>
<para>—I am very pleased to have this opportunity to speak to the <inline ref="R2225">Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Bill 2004</inline>, as I think it is one that will provide fantastic support for our community in addressing issues of water conservation and water efficiency. It will also provide support for the leadership role that I believe plumbers and the plumbing industry generally have taken across Australia in educating our community and promoting water efficiency through a number of programs, such as the Waterwise plumbing program in Western Australia, where plumbers are trained to carry out audits, to develop knowledge on the range of products that are available for water efficiency and to promote those to their customers. Who better to be educating our communities than those who are out there servicing our communities dealing with and addressing water issues every day? I certainly compliment that industry for their efforts. I have had almost 20 years in the plumbing industry, so I can speak with some appreciation and some understanding of those issues and the challenges. This bill will reinforce those initiatives and those efforts.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">One of the speakers on the other side mentioned the GreenPlumbers program, which is run by the Master Plumbers and Mechanical Services Association of Australia. That is certainly a program to be commended. I guess it arose out of some of the other programs that were initiated earlier in Queensland and Western Australia which adopted the Waterwise logo and promoted water efficiency. As I mentioned, I have been involved in the industry for some lengthy period of time at a local, national and international level.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This bill is one that makes Australia a leader in addressing issues of water efficiency at a community level. This bill’s introduction is very timely because 2004, as I understand it, is the Year of the Built Environment. The issue is one that the plumbing industry and plumbers generally have made a significant contribution to over a long period of time. In fact, if I might just briefly reflect on that, 100 years or so ago in Perth we had a population of about 5,000 people living on 3,000 acres. At that particular time, 40 per cent of that population suffered from waterborne diseases like typhoid, dysentery and cholera. Doctors approached the government and said, ‘We need to do something about this. We cannot continue this way.’ Fresh water supplies were severely contaminated by human waste, which led to the serious disease situation. Those doctors made a recommendation that plumbers be trained and registered to ensure that they had the skills and the competency to carry out the work. Plumbers were first registered and licensed in 1910 in Western Australia.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It is interesting to note that 100 years on we have buildings such as Parliament House and buildings in Perth and other parts of Western Australia that probably house 5,000 people—people who are supplied with fresh water and appropriate sanitation without that disease impost and without those potential challenges to human society. Yet we all too often take it for granted. For example, a number of developing countries do not enjoy the level of amenity that we do, including the delivery of fresh water and the sanitary services provided by plumbers. They do not have high-rise cities to provide the level of comfort and amenity that we enjoy here. They still have considerable outbreaks of diseases such as cholera, typhoid, dysentery et cetera. That is a great demonstration of the effect that plumbing has had. This bill is another step forward in increasing the sophistication of the range of beneficial services that we provide to our communities in Australia.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Water efficiency, as other speakers have mentioned, is an issue that is very important in Australia. The member for Maranoa mentioned that Australia is one of the driest countries in the world and there is no doubt that we have significant issues with water and we need to do everything we possibly can to conserve water. Not only that: we need to ensure that we educate our communities about the benefits of water efficiency and conserving water and about the advantageous environmental impact that will have. It is very important that we ensure that our communities appreciate the value of fresh water. Indeed, in Perth and Western Australia we have had water restrictions for a number of years. As a result of this—and the significant education programs that have been conducted—most of our constituents and most of the communities in Perth and Western Australia are very much aware of the need to conserve water.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Indeed, the Water Corporation and others have been working with schools on a range of projects to ensure that our young people appreciate that. They have been involved in retrofit programs where they have installed water-efficient products, dual flush systems and a range of other products, such as those referred to in this bill, to reduce water consumption in those schools. Those projects have been very successful and have provided a great educational base. We need to educate not only our young people but also everybody else about the use of water and how we need to manage that process.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">For Perth the circumstances, I understand from the Water Corporation records, are that over the last 20 years our rainfall has been only about 50 per cent of the 100-year average. It demonstrates again how seriously we have been impacted by what may well be part of a cyclical process but which has reduced our water reserves quite considerably, to the extent that at the moment—as we move into a dry summer—we only have about 30 per cent of that capacity.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I mentioned earlier that plumbers have shown a leadership role with respect to water efficiency. In 1994, I was involved with the master plumbers association in Western Australia and we developed a water efficiency strategy for the plumbing industry for 2000; in fact, it was called Directions 2000. But it was interesting because as part of that strategic review we looked at some of these usage situations and the way water was valued. There were some areas of concern and questions were asked: will our society continue to allow 10 per cent of existing consumers to consume 25 to 30 per cent of the existing water supply; will society allow 25 per cent of existing consumers to continue to use over 50 per cent of the existing water supply; will society allow new and further capital expenditure when half of this expenditure will service only 25 per cent of new consumers if we maintain our current water practices; or will the community expect us to adopt the best management practices and use our existing resources more efficiently? I think they are important questions for us as governments at all levels in Australia about how we address the issue of water supply and the demand for water and how we manage it in our societies.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The member for Maranoa mentioned the issue of charges for and costs of water. One of the critical and strategic ways of addressing that is by ensuring that people understand that the products they are using are water efficient. The labelling system that is proposed in this bill will go a long way towards achieving that outcome.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This bill is also timely, because it does need the support—and I understand it does have the support—of state governments across the country. That is going to be a very important aspect of getting the full benefit of this particular bill across the Australian community. It happens to coincide with some other national initiatives that have been introduced and developed by the National Plumbing Regulators Forum, which is made up of all the state and territory bodies involved in the regulation of plumbing in Australia. That organisation has been meeting this week and has agreed nationally to introduce, accept and take into regulation the Plumbing Code of Australia, which has a plumbing product approval system. I note the Water Efficient Labelling and Standards Bill 2004 does appoint a regulator from the appropriate Commonwealth department, and that person will be responsible for the regulation and the policing of this process in terms of accreditation for a product and making sure that it is used in the appropriate way.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It seems to me that there could well be some sort of duplication between that particular authority and regulator and the National Plumbing Regulators Forum. It may well be that that responsibility could be delegated to that body looking after plumbing across Australia. For all intents and purposes, the majority of the products that are going to be involved in this water efficiency rating program are plumbing products which will be installed by plumbers in various buildings and properties across Australia.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This is the first time that the Plumbing Code of Australia has been adopted, and it will go a long way to addressing a number of issues with respect to water efficiency, energy efficiency and environmental efficiency where there is practical application to plumbing installations. There will also be an element of third party certification, which is very important in verifying manufacturers’ claims of compliance, thus ensuring protection of the consumer.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I will take some time to look at the objectives of this scheme, which is very much parallel to what this bill intends to achieve. The objective of the new scheme is to establish an efficient product approval process for plumbing and drainage products in Australia. As I mentioned, a number of products listed to be covered by this labelling process with respect to water efficiency are plumbing products. State and territory governments have responsibility for regulating plumbing and drainage installations in order to protect public health and safety of the environment and consumers. As I said, there are a number of parallels between this bill and these initiatives.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Australia has had plumbing product approval since about 1920, so it seems to me appropriate for those people who are associated with those sorts of programs to be involved with the water efficiency labelling process. In the past, three separate marks have been applied to plumbing products: a standards mark, a water mark and a type test mark. Now those have been consolidated into one mark, which will be the water mark. It is also proposed, under this new process through the National Plumbing Regulators Forum, that products coming from overseas will also be certified and accredited for use in Australian markets. As I understand it, there is also a memorandum of understanding between the National Plumbing Regulators Forum and Australian Standards—who are responsible for the standards that apply to plumbing products—that third party certification will apply. The notes to the bill refer to the water mark being applied in those sorts of arrangements.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I think this bill is very timely. It will provide an opportunity for further education of our community about the value of water efficiency. I think that water efficiency and water management in Australia are something that we are significantly challenged by, and there are a number of new initiatives that we ought to be looking at, such as harvesting stormwater in our cities. In Chicago, I understand that there is a system of tunnelling that has the capacity to store stormwater at about the same capacity as Sydney Harbour. That is fairly significant and something which could perhaps be considered here. Obviously there would be considerable cost, but I think we really need to be innovative and look at initiatives well beyond what might be the norm in terms of ensuring that we have got sufficient water to supply our communities.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There has also been talk about grey water reuse. I think grey water reuse is going to become an increasingly important aspect of water use in Australia, and we need to ensure that we have got people committed to developing initiatives and innovations to provide the best possible outcome in the safest possible way. I am a great proponent of grey water reuse and I think there are opportunities for it to be done on a community basis. For example, the Water Corporation in Western Australia has a grey water recycling process in Kwinana where grey water is being recycled for industrial use. I compliment them on that; however, I think it is also important to look at the number of people in our community—for example, in the electorate of Hasluck—who would like the opportunity of using a grey water recycling process for their gardens and lawns. I think it is a great way of using water. They have already paid the cost of having water to be delivered to the house, and it is simply a matter of installing a grey water recirculation system that would allow them to do that at no expense beyond the cost of installation of the system. The benefit of grey water recycling is that it has the potential to create as much as 22 gigalitres of additional water resources in Perth and Western Australia.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We also need to look at improvements in irrigation techniques and infrastructure, moving away from canals and open channels to piping arrangements to reduce the significant evaporation that occurs. In Western Australia the state government has already moved to build a desalination plant, yet there has been concern raised by many people who have considerable experience and expertise in this area about the environmental impact. I am concerned about the environmental impact and the location of the desalination plant in terms of Cockburn Sound, where there is significant potential for a detrimental effect on the marine life and the marine ecosystem in Cockburn Sound as a result of the hypersalination by-product produced by desalination.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Another aspect that needs to be seriously considered by water utilities is the distribution network itself. I am sure that there is considerable leakage across Australia through those systems, and it needs to be addressed to improve the amount and the volume of water available for use by our communities. I know full well that our systems are much more efficient than those in some other places. In my various capacities I have had the opportunity to look at places such as Samoa, where I understand they lose as much as 54 per cent of their water through the distribution systems, and Hyderabad, India, where water supply losses are as much as 38 per cent. As I said, I am sure it is much less here in Australia, but I am sure we could improve our efficiencies in terms of those distribution networks.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I am a great supporter of this bill. I think it is going to achieve a lot of very positive outcomes by educating our community about the principles of water efficiency and enabling them to select products where there is no loss of amenity. They can enjoy the benefits of a water efficient shower rose and a dual flush toilet in their house and make a significant contribution to our society.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In conclusion, in terms of the water audits plumbers are doing, it might be something that we could look at in Parliament House. I have had a quick look around, and we could certainly use water efficient showers and toilets here to help conserve water. Whilst the bill does exempt installations that have been installed prior to the bill, it might be of some value to demonstrate a leadership role. I commend the bill to the House.</para>

</talker>
<para>—Water is one of the key critical environmental challenges for Australia, and there have been some clear manifestations of this in recent times. The member for Hasluck referred to the fact that over in Perth they are now examining a desalination plant which would cost an estimated $350 million. They are looking at that in Perth simply because there are no alternative local sources of water to meet that city’s needs.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">The member for Hasluck referred to the fact that Perth’s water reserves are down to around 30 per cent. He referred to this as being a cyclical process. It sounded suspiciously as if he is just one more of those coalition members who is in denial over the cause of our water problems. The situation of reduced water in Perth over the course of the last 25 years is climate change, pure and simple. You have a different climate from the climate you used to have. Unfortunately, there are too many coalition members who simply do not get it and are in denial over the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on the world’s climate. I encourage the member for Hasluck to follow the example of the Western Australian Farmers Federation, who do get it and who have written to the Prime Minister urging him to ratify the Kyoto protocol on climate change and get serious about cooperative international efforts to tackle this problem.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In Adelaide a great deal of work is being done on salt interception schemes around the Murray River aimed at preventing the deterioration of Adelaide’s drinking water, which, if nothing is done, by the year 2020 will not meet the World Health Organisation guidelines for two days out of five. In Melbourne, my home city, we are now on stage 2 water restrictions, and in Sydney and many other cities there are very serious water issues as well.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The question of water use and water efficiency that is before us in the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Bill 2004 is a very serious challenge facing this country. The purpose of the bill is to provide for the establishment and operation of a scheme to apply national water efficiency labelling and minimum performance standards to certain water use products. The aim of water efficiency labelling is to encourage the uptake of water-efficient products and appliances in domestic and commercial areas. The bill’s objects are to conserve water supplies by reducing water consumption, provide information for purchasers of water use products and promote the adoption of efficient and effective water use technology. It provides for the establishment of a national water efficiency labelling and standards scheme to be implemented cooperatively by Commonwealth, state and territory governments; for penalties to be put in place for those who fail to comply with the registration, labelling and minimum efficiency and performance requirements; and for an enforcement regime.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It is estimated that the bill would reduce consumption of water in households and non-residential buildings by five per cent by 2021. That is an objective which the opposition supports and I am sure all Australians would support, but I rather think it is inadequate. We really need to use water better and reduce our consumption of water in households and non-residential buildings by five per cent in a much shorter time frame. We need to reduce water consumption more rapidly by 2021. It is also expected that there would be some greenhouse gas reductions through reducing water heating associated with these measures.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This bill is being funded from savings identified in the Measures for a Better Environment package, and it picks up on recommendation 4 of the Senate inquiry into urban water use. It is my understanding that those who have been consulted, including the product suppliers and retailers, have actively supported the introduction of this scheme and that it has not been opposed. It addresses the mandatory labelling of most water use products, but in relation to mandatory performance standards it only applies to toilets. It is the view of the opposition that the legislation is weaker than it might have been, that environmental benefits will not be fully realised and that there is a case for standards to apply more broadly. It is our belief that water efficiency performance standards ought to apply to more water use products, and on that basis I support the second reading amendment moved by my colleague the member for Grayndler.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Labor have developed a framework for national water policy, which seeks to get better water management in urban Australia. We note that Australia is one of the highest per capita consumers of water in the world. In Australian households each person uses around 350 litres per day, yet our national reuse of effluent is at just 14 per cent. If we could do more to reclaim and reuse storm water, treated sewage effluent, treated industrial discharge and grey household waste water, we would be in a much better position to deal with shortages and it would boost our environment and our economy. I heard the member for Hasluck indicating his support for a greater emphasis on harvesting storm water and grey water reuse. I would support that. I hope he has more success than some of his colleagues, because so far the federal government has been doing precious little in this area.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">An integrated approach which considers all sources of water available to urban areas is needed to achieve significant improvement in water use efficiency in urban areas. Clearly, reclaimed water can be used for a whole range of purposes—irrigation of city parks and sports ovals, industrial purposes and cooling water. Surplus floodwater can be used to recharge natural aquifers, and safe treated urban effluent can be used on crops. There are many other uses besides. We think the Commonwealth government should be working with the states and territories to improve water quality and the environmental outcomes of urban water management. We think the government should be investigating incentives for promoting stormwater and waste water reuse and the integration of these issues in strategic planning of urban areas.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I want to make a passing reference to the problem of ocean outfalls. Large and growing human populations on the coastal fringe place pressures on coastal ecosystems, particularly through the disposal of sewage waste in coastal waters. There are over 140 sewage outfalls discharging into the ocean and estuaries within the vicinity of beaches in Australia. We should be working with the state and local water authorities to dramatically reduce the amount of water being discharged via ocean outfalls, and we also want to reduce urban water demand. Increasing the reuse will reduce the need to build costly water storages, which have been shown to have a serious impact on the ecology of Australian rivers.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Another area I want to mention in relation to urban water use is the research effort. The Commonwealth research effort in this crucial area has largely dried up. We need to renew the role of the Commonwealth in research and development in irrigation, water reuse and innovation. Promoting water reuse research will yield many dividends, including better design and value from environmental projects and monitoring, covering gaps, integrating project results, ensuring quality control and disseminating information effectively to those who need it. An urban water research program would support innovation in the reuse of stormwater, the reuse of effluent, water conservation, water-sensitive urban design and urban water planning, and management practices. We really need to establish a national program of research and coordinate the work presently being done to promote sustainable water use in Australia, with a particular focus on water reuse.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There is a very significant challenge facing Australia in relation to domestic water use. Domestic households account for around 16 per cent of the consumption of mains-supplied water in Australia, and we do need to do better. We have the capacity to do better. Back in December 2002, a Senate committee completed an inquiry into Australia’s management of urban water. It commented extensively on the issue of urban demand management, saying:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">There is considerable scope to reduce water use and achieve efficiencies. Water efficient appliances such as dual flush toilets, low flow shower heads, washing machines and dishwashers can dramatically reduce water use in homes. This can be coupled to water efficient gardens, using native plants, minimal lawns and efficient watering systems.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The committee made a series of recommendations and was very anxious to see us implement successful demand management programs and change behaviour away from habits such as hosing down driveways and gutters, watering lawns during the heat of the day, having long showers and the like. The committee recommended that we have a national water policy, with standards including national water efficiency standards and rating schemes for appliances and building systems. That is something which the opposition strongly endorses.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">According to the modelling undertaken in developing the regulatory impact statement, the impact of the labelling system provided for in the bill will be to reduce total household water use by about five per cent by 2021 compared with the business-as-usual approach. No modelling has been done for the introduction of efficiency standards across all of the six products that were considered—washing machines, dishwashers, toilets, showerheads, taps and urinals. The regulatory impact statement suggests that, for water users, the cost of water-efficient products will most likely be higher, but consumers would benefit from a net saving because their total water bills would be lower.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The regulatory impact statement also considered the impact on manufacturers and importers. It is its view that giving them 12 months after the regulations under this bill are finalised will be enough to ensure that products are labelled correctly, and it is to be expected that water efficiency labelling will have an impact on consumer preference. Our view is that that is not a bad thing. We want to encourage people to purchase the products which have high water efficiency rather than low water efficiency.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In conclusion, water is a very substantial challenge for Australia. It is a substantial challenge for our environment. It is a substantial challenge to get our water use right in rural areas and to maintain healthy river systems. It is a substantial challenge to get our water use right in the urban areas, to take action concerning ocean outfalls, to lift our water reuse and recycling and to reduce our water demand so that we do get sustainable water practices in our cities and in the country.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Against that background, we support the legislation, but we do not think it goes far enough. We think the government ought to be acting with a greater sense of urgency, and in our second reading amendment we indicate that the government ought to be delivering water efficiency standards for a range of indoor water use products and that it ought to be taking up what is a significant opportunity to reduce household water consumption.</para>

</talker>
<para>—I would like to start by saying I welcome the <inline ref="R2225">Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Bill 2004</inline> today because it will provide consumers with the information they need to be able to make informed purchasing decisions about water-efficient products. Introducing minimum water efficiency standards for all toilets is an excellent step, but we could do more.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">This legislation is expected to save about five per cent of national domestic water use by 2021. That is 87,000 million litres or, to draw a South Australian comparison, the equivalent of more than two South Para reservoirs or almost eight Happy Valley reservoirs. In South Australia we have already had dual flush toilets in all new developments or renovations since the early eighties. But there is more to a water-efficient toilet than simply being dual flush, so I certainly welcome the introduction of a minimum standard.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Our toilet water use as a percentage of total household water use is around 11 per cent. Baths and showers use about 20 per cent and our gardens use about 40 per cent. So it is clear that, while the minimum water efficiency standards for toilets are a step in the right direction, we also need standards applied to all shower heads, taps and washing machines. If we are really serious about water conservation, these standards have to be extended to garden watering systems, hose nozzles and all other watering devices.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">One does not have to look very far to see that water conservation is a massive issue for us in this country, certainly in South Australia. Just outside, there are empty garden beds surrounding Parliament House this summer because of water restrictions that are in place in the ACT. So why impose minimum water efficiency standards for toilets but stop short of that for other high water use products?</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In South Australia alone, it is estimated that households could save up to 33,000 megalitres by 2025 through the uptake of water-efficient products and the recent introduction of permanent water conservation measures on outdoor water use, which for example includes a ban on hosing down paved areas. This legislation is an opportunity to tighten efficiency requirements on other household water-using products, but for some reason the government is not taking that opportunity. Given everything we know about Australia’s water resources, the decision is staggering. If the argument is that more evidence is required to justify the inclusion of these other products with regard to minimum efficiency standards then why not collect more evidence? Given all of the work that has already been done around the country on these issues, that ought to be a fairly straightforward process, and I do not believe it would take very long at all.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Nationally, showers account for about 29 per cent of indoor household water use; toilets and washing machines, each about 26 per cent; and taps, around 18 per cent. So why are there minimum water efficiency standards on toilets but not on shower heads and washing machines? I can only assume that, during the industry consultation, industry said that they could cop standards on toilets but not on anything else. Given this country’s circumstances, industry objections to standards—if there are any—are not a good enough reason to back away from implementing measures which would help save our water resources.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Australians are more than ready to accept the necessity for this change. In South Australia last year, restrictions, followed by the introduction of permanent water conservation measures, led to a fall in water consumption of 14 per cent. So although it can be a hassle to have to water the garden early in the morning or late at night or to set your watering system so it does not water every day, people do understand how important it is. As consumers, they would accept that the products available need to be ones that will help reduce water consumption.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">South Australians tend to be more acutely aware that there is no time to waste when it comes to water conservation. My colleague the shadow minister for regional development, Kelvin Thomson, has previously pointed out that if nothing is done to stop the decline of the Murray the drinking water in Adelaide will not meet the World Health Organisation guidelines for two days out of five by the year 2020. That is just 16 years away and it will come round sooner than the estimated five per cent water saving from this legislation will. Unfortunately, that estimate cannot factor in the unknown consequences of climate change on our water supplies and there are some in the scientific community who are concerned that climate change is happening far more rapidly than we had previously anticipated. Literally, as we debate this bill the health of the river continues to decline. The economic fallout if we allow that to continue is unfathomable.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Our other water resources in South Australia are also in trouble. In the Adelaide Hills, flows to the reservoirs have been reduced because of increasing competition between agricultural, domestic and industrial users. Furthermore, development in the catchment area has led to an increased level in pollution, which threatens the quality of water and the biodiversity of our creeks and rivers. Our ground water is already fully allocated, leaving no way to expand agricultural businesses. Ironically, in the electorate of Hindmarsh urban consolidation has contributed to an increase of incidences of flooding. There are times when people in parts of the electorate find themselves knee deep in water. In the driest state in the driest country it is hard to understand how this can happen. We need to capture it before it fills up our streets on its way to the sea. Stormwater run-off sends nutrients and other pollutants pouring into the Gulf St Vincent.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The Waterproofing Adelaide report, <inline font-style="italic">A thirst for change</inline>, says that about 160,000 megalitres of stormwater and surface water flow into the gulf each year. So while reducing our water use is essential, finding ways to harness other water sources will also make an enormous difference. <inline font-style="italic">A thirst for change</inline> estimates that improvements in our capacity to use stormwater and rainwater over the next 20 years will mean that we will be able to use about 20,000 megalitres a year. Currently, we capture between just 3,000 and 5,000 megalitres a year. That actually makes South Australia a leader in stormwater reuse.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Morphettville racecourse, which is in the electorate of Hindmarsh, captures stormwater and then uses it for irrigation. More of our open parkland areas will need to be able to do this if we are to become a truly water wise country. Another opportunity lies in reusing waste water. The nutrients in treated waste water make it very effective for irrigation. Currently, waste water reuse in South Australia is around 14,000 megalitres but <inline font-style="italic">A thirst for change</inline> estimates that figure could grow to 30,000 megalitres over the next two decades, which again would decrease water flow into the Gulf St Vincent.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It is quite clear that there is not enough water to go around and yet this legislation does not as an urgent priority place minimum water efficiency standards on any product other than toilets. Even though we support the legislation, is a great shame that this government is not trying to achieve more significant water savings than five per cent and far sooner than 2021.</para>

</talker>
<para>—In rising to sum up on the <inline ref="R2225">Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Bill 2004</inline> let me say that this is a bill that it is a point of personal pride to be associated with. I believe it is credit not just to this side of the House but also to the other side that there is a bipartisan approach to water efficiency within Australia, although there are some points of disagreement. This is something about which the Prime Minister; the Deputy Prime Minister; the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Ian Campbell; I and so many of the members of the government have not just an interest but a deep commitment and passion. For those reasons, I am delighted to be able to lead the summation of the bill.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">The challenge we face in Australia is twofold. The first challenge is controlling our domestic consumption, what we consume within our houses, the efficiency and reuse of the water within the domestic cycle. This bill specifically addresses that part of the equation. The second challenge is the infrastructure efficiency within our cities and our outfalls and the systemic approach to the reuse of the large mass of water which flows from the Australian urban environment. That is a problem which over the last three years, along with other members of the government, I have argued needs to be addressed not just at the state level but also at the national level. There has been a failure of state governments to address the core infrastructure needs which are within their areas of responsibility in relation to stormwater, water recycling and grey water. In this day and age the states in Australia are behind the international curve, and we need to take greater steps.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">That brings me directly to the comments made by our honourable friends on the opposite side of the chamber. Two principal criticisms were advanced. The first was a notion that we need additional minimum standards, other than those provided within the bill. The answer is that the bill provides for exactly that. I would recommend that the opposition read and understand what is in the bill. The express provision which includes water from toilets as a minimum standard is simply the first of a series of measures. It is coupled with an approach which adds in labelling as a means to achieving these outcomes and then migrating other products to specific minimum standards. But first we have to establish a buying pattern; otherwise, we are going to be outlawing up to 80 per cent of domestic washing machines immediately. Make no mistake, this bill has a clear direction and an absolute mechanism. There are savings which will come from this bill alone. I say to our friends who are visiting the chamber that by the year 2020 we are looking at over 610 billion litres of water being saved, with up to 60 billion litres of water being saved per year. For a country that is poor in water resources, this is a critical saving. That was the first point made by our friends in the opposition.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The second point is rather curious. It is the notion that this government has been concerned about water reuse, despite the fact that water reuse is a responsibility of the states. Last evening the House of Representatives passed the final suggestions from the Senate and brought into being the National Water Commission Bill. That bill, which will now proceed to the Governor-General for formal approval, sets in place a $2 billion national initiative under the Australian water fund. That $2 billion initiative comprises $1.6 billion for the water smart Australia program, for water infrastructure, both urban and rural, on a scale never seen before in dealing with urban water in Australia. The opposition also talk about the need for research. Last night the Parliament of Australia approved allocation of $200 million for national water standards under the national water standards program, which is a component of the Australian water fund. The third component is water wise communities, which has also been granted $200 million.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">When you take those three components together, you find the timing of today’s comment curious. Last night $2 billion of funding was allocated at the federal level for problems such as water recycling, grey water reuse, addressing the problems of rivers such as the Nepean River, and the many challenges around Australia. Three years ago I set the challenge for Australia to end ocean outfalls by 2025—the waste of water, the environmental impact and the health risks. That is a challenge to which I remain more committed than ever before. The passage of the National Water Commission Bill last night makes it more realistic and more viable. But I welcome the opposition’s interest and make no criticism of the fact that they wish to achieve this. I simply highlight to the House and to our friends in the opposition that all of the arguments which they were advancing were in fact achieved less than 24 hours ago.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I also want to pay particular tribute to the contributions by the member for Maranoa, Bruce Scott, and the member for Hasluck, Mr Henry. The member for Maranoa set out before the chamber a very simple proposition. He is arguing for a major urban recycling program in Brisbane which will take that 85 gigalitres of waste water per year from the Brisbane system and use it in the Lockyer Valley. That is a proposal he wishes to advance before the National Water Commission as a national priority. I commend his endeavour and I ask him to put forward a considered and thorough program and to argue the case, because it is exactly the type of scheme which the National Water Commission is looking to implement.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In addition to that, the member for Hasluck set out the fact that he has had over 20 years in a national leadership role within the plumbing industry. Water reuse was a matter which he raised in his first speech before the House. As he set out, we must be looking not just at outfalls but also at harvesting stormwater. Those two things together are critical. I commend the member for Maranoa and the member for Hasluck for their contributions.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In summarising the debate and the position of the Australian government, I must say that that government’s position is quite clear. The Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Bill 2004 is the first national scheme of its kind anywhere in the world. It means that Australia is leading the world in domestic water conservation. The new system of labels on shower heads, washing machines, toilets, dishwashers, urinals and some types of taps will help consumers choose appliances which use the least water. In that way, individuals can make a difference in their own homes. But, as I have said—and this is a point on which there is cross-partisan agreement—there also has to be major infrastructure work, which the states must carry out but which we are willing to assist with.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Moving on from that, we see that there will be water use standards for all toilets sold in Australia—clear standards which set in place a new basis and a new set of restrictions. Further, we go forward to the fact that water efficient appliances save hot water as well as cold, which reduces both electricity and water bills and also has an impact on greenhouse emissions. Simply by choosing more-efficient appliances, by 2021 the community stands to save more than $600 million in their water and electricity bills and, importantly, a collective total of 610 billion litres in domestic water use Australia wide and approximately 60 billion litres of water in each year approaching 2021. Those are the achievements of this bill.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The scheme has the support of governments around Australia. All states and territories will be introducing complementary legislation to ensure that water efficiency labelling and standards becomes a truly national scheme. I take this opportunity to commend the states and territories for their cooperation, to thank our friends on the other side of the House, to thank members on this side of the House for their contributions and to note that, ultimately, the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Bill 2004 is a quantum step forward in Australia in terms of water conservation. It has to be accompanied by the National Water Commission Bill 2004, and I urge the states to embrace the National Water Initiative and to put forward their National Water Initiative projects through the National Water Commission. Taken together, these two packages represent a critical step forward. I commend the bill to the Committee.</para>
