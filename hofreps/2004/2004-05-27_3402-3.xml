The truth is that our small business did employ an extra staff member and had no difficulty terminating the employment.

may damage that security.</para><para>At the same time, the government has an equally important obligation to enforce Australia's criminal laws, including the laws that protect our security.</para><para>We must ensure that those who break the law do not escape punishment.</para><para>A recent criminal trial demonstrated that a conflict between these obligations may arise during prosecutions in relation to Commonwealth security offences, such as terrorism and espionage.</para><para>In these cases, the Commonwealth may face the unpalatable decision of whether to risk disclosing sensitive information relating to national security or to protect this information by abandoning a prosecution, even where the alleged crimes could themselves have grave consequences for our national security.</para><para>The case of Lappas in 2001, which involved espionage charges, highlighted the inadequacy of the present arrangements.</para><para>During that case, the presiding judge stated that certain prosecution documents should be granted protection from disclosure under public interest immunity.</para><para>Having made this ruling, His Honour had no option but to stay the charge relating to the unlawful disclosure of those documents, given that he also found that the fair trial of the accused depended on their disclosure.</para><para>In that same case, defence counsel's refusal to undergo a security clearance posed a further problem for the protection of the documents.</para><para>Following the Lappas case, the government took immediate administrative action to protect national security information.</para><para>We amended the legal aid guidelines to require legal representatives in legal aid funded cases to obtain security clearances.</para><para>However, this only addresses a small part of the difficulty highlighted in the Lappas case.</para><para>This bill will alleviate the dilemmas that could arise in future prosecutions for Commonwealth security offences. </para><para>The legislation will strengthen the procedures for protecting national security information.</para><para>It will also protect an individual's right to a fair trial.</para><para>Most importantly, it will provide a court which has found that sensitive security related information should not be disclosed with an alternative to simply dismissing the charge.</para><para>It will enable a court to admit documents and information in a redacted form which protects national security but preserves the essence of the information. </para><para>This bill protects information which, if disclosed, may compromise Australia's national security.</para><para>This is information that relates to Australia's defence, security, international relations, law enforcement interests or national interests.</para><para>In developing this bill, we considered existing legislation in the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada.</para><para>Whilst these schemes go some way towards protecting information that may affect national security, none of them alone would provide sufficient protection in the Australian legal environment.</para><para>Consequently, we have adopted elements of each scheme to develop a regime that is suitable for us here in Australia.</para><para>The scheme applies to all stages of criminal proceedings and to all courts exercising federal jurisdiction for Commonwealth offences.</para><para>Under this bill, both the prosecution and defence have a duty to notify the Attorney-General and the court if they know or believe that they, or one of the witnesses they intend to call, will disclose during the proceeding information that may affect our national security.</para><para>The Attorney-General must review the relevant information to decide whether it may be fully disclosed, disclosed in a limited form that does not prejudice Australia's national security or not disclosed at all.</para><para>If the information cannot be disclosed or can only be disclosed in a redacted or summarised form, the Attorney-General must issue a certificate to that effect.</para><para>The certificate is conclusive of the facts contained in it in all pre-trial proceedings.</para><para>Once the trial begins or where a certificate is issued during a trial, the court must first rule on the admissibility of the information that is the subject of the certificate.</para><para>The court must then rule on whether the information would prejudice national security.</para><para>If the court rules the information both admissible and prejudicial, the court can rule that it only be disclosed in the form authorised in the certificate or in some other modified form.</para><para>The court must then determine whether such a ruling would have a substantial adverse effect on the defendant's right to receive a fair hearing.</para><para>Both the prosecution and defence can appeal the court's decision relating to disclosure.</para><para>If a proceeding involves information that is likely to prejudice our national security, the legal representatives must obtain a security clearance at an appropriate level before receiving national security information.</para><para>The bill also requires all persons to obey any court order or direction relating to the custody, handling and disclosure of information that may affect our national security.</para><para>This bill will significantly change the way in which information which may affect our national security is handled in federal criminal proceedings. </para><para>However, it will not jeopardise the very principles on which our legal system is based.</para><para>The government recognises the importance of maintaining an independent judiciary and an accused person's right to a fair trial.</para><para>This bill strikes a balance between these fundamental principles and the Commonwealth's duty to protect information that may affect our national security. For this reason, I commend this bill to the House and table the explanatory memorandum.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Swan</inline>)

1979.</para><para>These amendments address the practical implications of modern technology on access to communications by law enforcement and regulatory agencies. </para><para>The bill will exclude access to stored communications from the current prohibition against interception of communications.</para><para>In practical terms, the amendments will limit the existing prohibition against interception to real-time transit of communications.</para><para>Communications that have been stored on equipment will be excluded from the scope of the act.</para><para>These measures represent immediate and practical steps to address the operational issues faced by our law enforcement and regulatory agencies.</para><para>However, the amendments also recognise the need for a more comprehensive review of access to stored communications and the contemporary relevance of Australia's interception regime.</para><para>That is why the amendments will cease to have effect 12 months after their commencement.</para><para>The government recognises that a broader review of access to modern means of communication is required.</para><para>That is why I have asked my department to conduct a comprehensive review of the Telecommunications (Interception) Act and to report back to me before the expiration of these amendments.</para><para>The need for a more comprehensive review should not preclude the enactment of amendments to addressing the increasingly significant operational concerns created by the act's current application.</para><para>These amendments appropriately respond to the immediate difficulties posed by the breadth of the existing interception regime, while recognising the need to revisit this issue in greater detail.</para><para>The government has on two previous occasions, in 2002 and 2004, sought to legislate to clarify the application of the Interception Act to stored communications.</para><para>On both occasions, the government has found it necessary to withdraw the amendments.</para><para>Most recently, the government withdrew the amendments following a recommendation of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee.</para><para>The committee, after considering the proposed amendments in relation to stored communications, recommended that they be deferred pending resolution of differing interpretations of the current operation of the interception regime.</para><para>That resolution has now been achieved. Thus this bill adequately addresses the operational concerns raised by the Australian Federal Police in relation to access to stored communications.</para><para>As I have previously said, I have agreed that my department conduct a broader review of the telecommunications interception regime.</para><para>The review will likely focus on access to electronic communications.</para><para>In the meantime, it is important that any lack of clarity in applying the Interception Act to stored communications be resolved.</para><para>The measures in the bill are an urgent but temporary solution to the operational difficulties experienced by law enforcement agencies.</para><para>When the act was drafted almost 25 years ago, the Australian telecommunications systems consisted largely of land based services carrying live telephone conversations.</para><para>The act was therefore built around a core concept of communications passing over a telecommunications system. </para><para>While this concept is technologically neutral, its application has proven more difficult to modern communications servicesâwhich I am sure you are familiar with, Mr Speakerâsuch as voice mail, email and SMS messaging. I must say that I am familiar with it but not fully up on it.</para><para>These amendments do not, however, allow unregulated monitoring of telecommunications services such as email, voice mail and SMS which are in widespread use in the community.</para><para>Rather, the amendments recognise that such communications become stored and should fall outside the protections originally designed for more immediate voice telephony at some point.</para><para>Access to stored communications will continue to require an appropriate form of lawful access such as consent, a search warrant or a right of access to communications or storage equipment.</para><para>The amendments will allow law enforcement and regulatory agencies expeditious access to stored communications in the performance of their functions.</para><para>The amendments will also facilitate measures to preserve the security of information systems.</para><para>The amendments also ensure that new technologies that may involve storage, but which are in reality analogous to standard voice telephony, are protected in the same way as normal voice calls.</para><para>In particular, the amendments specifically exclude storage in the course of transmission by voice over Internet protocol and other highly transitory storage that is integral to the carriage of a communication.</para><para>This ensures that these communications, although technically stored for a fraction of a second, remain protected as live communications.</para><para>The government is committed to ensuring that the interception regime keeps pace with technological developments.</para><para>Modern means of technology are converging with more traditional data storage.</para><para>These amendments address the operational impacts of that convergence, while foreshadowing the need for further consideration of this issue.</para><para>I commend this bill to the House and table an explanatory memorandum.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âI thank the Attorney-General for his unfounded vote of confidence in my electronic communications skills.

The bill extends the program to 30 June 2008. </para><para>Passage of the bill will also give effect to a number of amendments that aim to improve the effectiveness and administration of the Farm Help program and ensure that it reaches low-income farmers most in need. There will be an increased emphasis on using strategic information, analysis and professional advice to support decision-making. The extension of the Farm Help program and its associated changes will not affect the ongoing exceptional circumstances relief program.</para><para>Farm Help has been operating since December 1997 to facilitate adjustment by providing a welfare safety net to people on farms in severe financial difficulty. It was a core component of the Australian government's flagship agricultural policy, the Agriculture Advancing Australia package announced in 1997.</para><para>The Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2004 will give effect to the government's 2004 budget commitment to extend the Farm Help program until 30 June 2008 as a key component of the ongoing Agriculture Advancing Australia package. In the 2004-05 federal budget the Triple-A package received a $238 million injection, of which $134.9 million over four years is allocated to the Farm Help program. The funding brings the total provision for the Agriculture Advancing Australia package since 1997 to over $1 billion.</para><para>Continued support for the Farm Help program demonstrates that the government is delivering on its commitment to people managing farms in rural and regional Australia and helping them build their capacity to manage risk, adopt new practices and improve strategic planning and decision making.</para><para>The direct target group of the Farm Help program to date has been low-income farm families in severe financial difficulty. These people are eligible if they meet means testing requirements, satisfy the eligibility requirements and can no longer borrow against their assets.</para><para>The assistance provided through Farm Help is flexible and can be tailored to meet the needs of each farm family. The program provides up to 12 months income support at the Newstart Allowance rate; a grant for professional advice and training such as financial, legal and business planning, to assist recipients to make decisions about their future in farming; and a re-establishment grant, currently up to $45,000, for people who decide to leave farming and sell the farm. Farm Help is due to conclude on 30 June 2004.</para><para>Farm Help has a long record of achievement. Since the program commenced on 1 December 1997 to 30 April 2004 over 8,600 farmers have received Farm Help income support and over 1,000 farmers have received re-establishment assistance.</para><para>A major aim of the Farm Help program is to support low-income farmers in their decision making to make changes to their situation. The Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2004 introduces a number of procedural and administrative changes to the Farm Help program and its associated instruments and will enable the program to operate more effectively and to better reach its target recipients. These changes will be reflected in the Farm Household Support Act 1992, in the act's disallowable instruments, the Farm Help Re-establishment Grant Scheme and the Farm Help Advice and Training Scheme and in regulations prescribed by the act.</para><para>The changes have emanated from the ongoing monitoring of the program's performance, a mid-term evaluation of Farm Help and the performance audit of key Agriculture Advancing Australia programs undertaken by the Australian National Audit Office in 2003. </para><para>New requirements for income support and re-establishment grants mean that a person will have to undertake financial advice and develop their activity plan prior to receiving income supportâexcept in cases of hardshipâand prior to receiving a re-establishment grant. Farmers will be encouraged to approach the program as an opportunity to gain information and skills that will support a better outcome for them and their families in the long term.</para><para>The object of the act has been amended to refer separately to the objectives of the exceptional circumstances relief payment and Farm Help income support. This is to ensure that there is no interpretation by the courts that the two schemes are intended to be the same. The exceptional circumstances relief payment focuses on welfare for farmers in declared exceptional circumstances situations. The Farm Help program no longer focuses on welfare, but on adjustment. It will, however, continue to provide short-term financial assistance to farmers who are experiencing difficulty in meeting living expenses and are unlikely to obtain a loan from a financial institution, while they take action to improve their long-term financial situation either on or off the farm.</para><para>The Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2004 proposes a program extension to 30 June 2008, with applications for income support and the re-establishment grant closing on 30 June 2007. Income support payments will conclude on 30 June 2008, professional advice and training grant expenditure must be finalised by 30 June 2008 and the sale of farm enterprises must be completed by 30 June 2008. Provision has been made in the 2004-05 budget for residual expenditure of $2 million in 2008-09 to finalise re-establishment grants, advice and training grants and Centrelink delivery costs.</para><para>Provision will be made for any further extensions of the Farm Help program beyond June 2009 to be made by regulation.</para><para>The re-establishment grant will be increased to $50,000âup from the current $45,000. This change will be made in the Farm Help Re-establishment Grant Scheme 1997.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Clarifying the process for a person applying for Farm Help income support</inline></para><para>Under the revised program, a person will apply for the advice and training grant, rather than income support, to enable them to obtain advice about their inability to obtain finance and develop an activity plan. These requirements will need to be undertaken prior to any claim for income support or a re-establishment grant.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Undertaking financial assessments</inline></para><para>Currently farmers who join the program are required to arrange a financial assessment of their farm business within three months. Under the enhanced program, farmers will be required to undertake the financial assessment of their farm business and develop an activity plan before their income support can commence. An adviser, prescribed by a regulation enabled by the act, will make an assessment of the farmer's likelihood of accessing further finance, removing the requirement for bank certification.</para><para>This amended process is intended to maximise recipients' opportunities to make decisions about their future and to implement change, while they receive income support under the program for up to 12 months.</para><para>The removal of the requirement for a certificate of inability to obtain finance addresses concerns by banks and their clients that obtaining the certificate might jeopardise a person's future borrowing arrangements. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Hardship provision</inline></para><para>A provision has been included to vary the process for people in severe financial hardship for Farm Help. To qualify for this provision, a person will be an eligible farmer for the purposes of the program. The liquid assets of a person and their partner at the time of application will be not greater than the total amount of Newstart allowance that would have been payable in the immediately preceding six weeks if the person were entitled to Newstart allowance and had no other income.</para><para>Hardship provision recipients will be provided with income support for a period of up to three months while they undertake their financial assessment and develop their activity plan. Income support will cease if they have not done this within the three-month period. This provision will not require people to sell farm assets. The recipient will then be assessed in order to qualify for the remainder of their income support. Income support which is paid under the hardship provision will not be an additional period to the twelve months available for income support.</para><para>Mutual obligation under the Farm Help program will be strengthened. It is intended that activity plans will be reviewed quarterly by Centrelink and recipients to ensure that program recipients are making effective use of program elements to support informed decision making and/or improvements in their farm business. In particular, Farm Help recipients will be encouraged to maximise their use of the opportunity to access the professional advice and training grant.</para><para>Amendments to the Farm Household Support Act will enable reviews to be conducted of re-establishment grant recipients to determine whether they are complying with their undertaking not to re-enter farming within five years of receiving the re-establishment grant. A proviso has been included which enables the Australian government to recover grants where a person has re-entered farming within five years of receiving the grant. This provision is being transferred from the re-establishment grant instrument.</para><para>Participants are no longer able to suspend their Farm Help income support to access the exceptional circumstances relief payment and then return to Farm Help income support. This is to encourage farmers to approach the program as an opportunity to gain information and skills that will support a better outcome for them and their families in the long term. This amended process is intended to maximise recipients' opportunities to make decisions about their future and then implement change while they receive income support under the program for up to 12 months.</para><para>A farmer is able to apply for the exceptional circumstances relief payment after their completion of the Farm Help program. There is provision to terminate Farm Help income support if a person or their partner is in receipt of an exceptional circumstances relief payment. This removes the possibility of a person or a couple receiving Farm Help income support and the exceptional circumstances relief payment at the same time.</para><para>The government remains committed to the development of self-reliant, competitive and sustainable rural industries. It also recognises that there are significant pressures on farmers to remain on the land and that some farmers, often for reasons beyond their control, are unable to keep up with the pace of change.</para><para>Passage of this bill will enable eligible low-income farmers coping with change in the farming industry to have the opportunity to make informed decisions about their future in farming while giving them financial security and access to advice to make their decision. </para><para>It also has a significant emphasis on mutual obligation for people receiving assistanceâin terms of making progress to implement decisions in relation to improving their farm business, seeking alternative sources of income, or leaving the industry. The extension of the Farm Help program and its associated changes will not affect the ongoing exceptional circumstances program. The amendments to create a more effective Farm Help program are designed to promote earlier decision making by recipients and emphasise a mutual obligation, with the objective of encouraging adjustment. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Swan</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>29316</page.no><id.no>R2064</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>29316</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hardgrave</inline>, and read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>29316</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>29316</page.no><name role="metadata">Hardgrave, Gary, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HARDGRAVE</name><name.id>CK6</name.id><electorate>Moreton</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>The purpose of the <inline ref="R2064">bill</inline> before the House is to make major changes to the Australian government's institutional structures in Indigenous affairs in order to improve the lives of Indigenous Australians.</para><para>The government, along with the majority of the Australian community, believes that Indigenous Australians should be able to enjoy the same opportunities as other Australians. We have consistently demonstrated our determination to achieve that end. In 2004-05, we will allocate a record $2.9 billionâ39 per cent more in real terms than in the last year of the Keating Labor government. The bulk of this funding goes to the practical areas of health, housing, education and employment.</para><para>While there have been real improvements as a result of this effort we believe that the rate of progress is not good enough. I am sure that most Indigenous Australians would say that they are not getting value for money. The Productivity Commission report <inline font-style="italic">Overcoming Indigenous Disadvantage</inline> reinforces the need for fundamental change. No-one can say that the current approach is working.</para><para>Going beyond the abolition of the ATSIC board, replacement of regional councils and consequential amendments in this bill, the government will be introducing radical and necessary changes to the way in which services are delivered to Indigenous Australians. The changes will build on what we have learnt from the whole of government approach adopted in the COAG Indigenous trials currently operating in each state and territory.</para><para>Over the last 30 years governments of both political persuasions have sought to implement measures to address the longstanding disadvantages experienced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. These measures have included a range of programs, legislation and representative structures.</para><para>In 1990, Labor established the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC). It soon became evident that no single body could seek both to represent Indigenous people and to make independent decisions about the allocation of funds. The commission found it difficult to effectively advocate on behalf of Indigenous people and to provide impartial advice to government.</para><para>Labor's ATSIC experiment failed on a number of fronts. Its focus was almost exclusively on Australian government programs and services. The fundamentally important role of state and territory governments was neglected. All too often the specialist Indigenous agency, ATSIC, provided an excuse for mainstream departments to avoid their responsibilities to Indigenous Australians. Moreover, only a very small proportion of eligible Indigenous Australians bothered to actually vote in ATSIC elections. </para><para>This is not to say that ATSIC has not been well served by a number of distinguished Indigenous leaders, including the inaugural chair, Ms Lowitja O'Donoghue, and the late Mr Djerrkura, whose passing, sadly, we are today mourning.</para><para>The Howard government took a major step to address problems in ATSIC last year with the establishment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Services (ATSIS). This separated the representative functions from decision making on funding. However, this was a transitional arrangement which did not represent a long-term solution to the issues facing ATSIC.</para><para>A review of ATSIC delivered to the government in November 2003 acknowledged a number of significant problems. These included a lack of leadership at the national level of ATSIC, insufficient connection between the national, regional and local levels of the organisation, and a lack of engagement between ATSIC and its constituents at the local level.</para><para>It is against this background that the government has taken the decision to abolish ATSIC and overhaul the way in which services for Indigenous Australians are delivered. I note that there is a general acknowledgment on both sides that change is necessary. I think we all recognise that the crisis in ATSIC is now so serious that it cannot continue. The real losers are the very people ATSIC was established to assist, the first nation people of Australia.</para><para>The aim of the new arrangements we are putting in place is to produce better outcomes for Indigenous people. The programs which ATSIC and ATSIS were responsible for will be allocated to mainstream government agencies. One of the advantages of mainstreaming will be to focus the specialist service delivery expertise of mainstream agencies on specific aspects of Indigenous disadvantage, to focus their minds on serving 100 per cent of Australians, 100 per cent of the time. It is important to point out that ATSIC was never responsible for all Australian government Indigenous specific programs. Indeed, in 1995 the previous government transferred responsibility for Indigenous health from ATSIC to the Department of Health and Ageing because of concerns about the performance of ATSIC. It is important to stress that no programs will cease as a result of the changes we are making and existing levels of funding will continue. </para><para>We acknowledge the need for better coordination and for strengthening accountability. Accordingly we will be implementing a series of new measures to enhance coordination and accountability.</para><para>A ministerial task force chaired by the minister responsible for Indigenous affairs will be established to provide whole of government leadership on Indigenous issues. It will coordinate the government's Indigenous policies and report to cabinet on directions and priorities in Indigenous policy. The ministerial task force will report annually to the Expenditure Review Committee of cabinet on the performance of Indigenous specific programs and the allocation of resources across agencies.</para><para>A secretaries group will support the ministerial task force. It will report annually on the outcomes of Indigenous specific services. Department secretaries will be directly accountable for successes and/or failures of specific programs and services. Performance in Indigenous programs and services will be included in their personal performance agreements. </para><para>We are establishing a National Indigenous Council to provide policy advice to the government at the national level. In particular, it will directly advise the ministerial task force on a range of Indigenous issues. The National Indigenous Council will be a non-statutory body comprised of Indigenous people with expertise and experience in key policy areas.</para><para>The new arrangements will be underpinned by regional agreements as well as shared responsibility agreements at the local level. While some regional councils work well, arrangements for engaging with Indigenous Australians at the regional and local level need to be improved.</para><para>We will be discussing the best way forward with the states and territories at the next meeting of the Council of Australian Governments. ATSIC's regional councils will have the opportunity for input and we recognise that different models are likely to emerge in different regions and jurisdictions.</para><para>A new Office of Indigenous Policy Coordination in the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs will provide policy advice to the minister, coordinate policy development and service delivery across government and oversee relations with state and territory governments. It will also monitor the performance of government programs and services including arrangements for independent scrutiny.</para><para>We will strengthen service delivery in the regions where a network of Indigenous coordination centres in rural and remote areas will replace ATSIC/ATSIS offices. These centres will operate as a multidisciplinary team offering a whole of government service to local communities.</para><para>The government will expand the role of the Office of Evaluation and Audit (OEA), currently located in ATSIC. This will be in addition to the role of the Australian National Audit Office and will provide a particular focus on the performance of those programs. OEA will also continue to investigate the performance of bodies that obtain funding from Indigenous specific programs.</para><para>The legislation provides for the transfer of the Regional Land Fund to the Indigenous Land Corporation (ILC) and ATSIC's Housing Fund and Business Development Program to Indigenous Business Australia (IBA). The bill also makes provision for the ILC to give funds to IBA to allow it to promote economic development on the land the ILC acquires for Indigenous people.</para><para>The Torres Strait Regional Authority (TSRA) which provides a range of Indigenous specific services to Torres Strait Islanders living in the Torres Strait will continue to perform its current role. The TSRA had some time ago separated its representative and funding functions and is working effectively in meeting the needs of Torres Strait Islanders in the Torres Strait. The Torres Strait Islander Advisory Board which provided advice to ATSIC about issues affecting Torres Strait Islanders on the mainland will cease to exist as a result of the abolition of ATSIC. Torres Strait Islanders living on the mainland will be represented on the National Indigenous Council.</para><para>The measures contained in this bill and the other initiatives I have outlined are long overdue and seek to address the failings of the recent past in providing equality in service provision and equality in opportunity to our first people, the Indigenous people of Australia.</para><para>The time for defending the status quo and protecting vested interests at the expense of Indigenous Australians has passed. </para><para>I present the explanatory memorandum.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Swan</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>EXTENSION OF CHARITABLE PURPOSE BILL 2004</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>29319</page.no><id.no>R2056</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>29319</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ross Cameron</inline>, and read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>29319</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>29319</page.no><name role="metadata">Cameron, Ross, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ROSS CAMERON</name><name.id>3K6</name.id><electorate>Parramatta</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>The <inline ref="R2056">bill</inline> provides a statutory extension to the common law meaning of charity. </para><para>This will allow certain organisations, which have difficulty satisfying the common law requirements, to be charities for the purposes of all Commonwealth legislation.</para><para>This includes certain child-care and self-help bodies, and closed or contemplative religious orders.</para><para>By extending the common law meaning of charity in this way, the concessions embodied in Commonwealth legislation that are available to charities will also become available to these organisations.

I wish today to talk about the <inline ref="R2030">Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Enrolment Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2004</inline>, which goes to the heart of our system of government. Quite simply, voter enrolment is the most basic transaction between the public and its government. The very foundations of our democracy are built upon the voter enrolment process. This bill goes a long way towards remedying some of the flaws and loopholes which currently exist in this area. But before we examine those flaws, let us look at the current criteria applied to Australians who are enrolled as voters. At present, in order for a person to be enrolled as a voter they must be over 18 years of age, be an Australian citizen, and have, or have had, a place of residence. That person must also have had their enrolment form witnessed by an enrolled voter or a person eligible for enrolment. Unfortunately, some sections of the political world have found these conditions relatively easy to manipulate or sidestep, to the point where the electoral roll is seen merely as a tool for the prostitution of votes.</para></talk.start><para>To safeguard the integrity of our system of government, the coalition has proposed a few simple measures to ensure that the electoral roll is cleaned up and its integrity safeguarded for the future. The new regulations were contained in the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Regulations 2001 and would have necessitated the presentation of identification at the time of enrolmentâa measure which would have gone a long way towards cleaning up the electoral roll. Unfortunately, and perhaps tellingly, these regulations were disallowed by the ALP and the Democrats in the Senate on 15 May 2002. I find it difficult to believe that any political party would not wholly support the protection of our electoral roll, and I was greatly disappointed that the amendment did not attract bipartisan support in the upper house. </para><para>So we come to the second piece of legislation, the <inline ref="R2029">Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Access to Electoral Roll and Other Measures) Bill 2004</inline>, which exists solely for the purpose of bolstering the rigour of our voter enrolment process for both elections and referendums. Central to these amendments is the question of voter residence and the tightening of existing legislation which has previously allowed wide scope for manipulating Australia's electoral processes. These amendments will provide that the entitlement to enrolment is based on residence for a period of one month at a particular address in a subdivision and will introduce a requirement to provide proof of identity when changing enrolment details or claiming a provisional vote.</para><para>I wholeheartedly endorse these particular aspects of the bill, as I have had personal experience in fighting an election where questionable voters appeared to be residing in vacant dwellings. I have done some research into the trends in Hinkler in elections and referendums stretching back to 1990, and some very interesting events have taken place. To start with, between the 1990 and 2001 federal elections there has been an 80 per cent increase in the number of provisional vote applications made but only a 63 per cent increase in valid provisional votes cast. More to the point, the gap between valid provisional votes and the applications made has doubled from 0.17 per cent to 0.35 per cent over the same period.</para><para>Interestingly, the largest single discrepancy occurred at the 1996 federal electionâthe election following Hinkler's shift to coalition representationâwhere a full 0.36 per cent of applications for provisional votes were disallowed. That translates into 288 applications being rejected at that election. While there will always be some discrepancy between valid and invalid provisional votes, there is simply no explanation for the sudden leap in this occurrence in Hinkler. At the 1990 election, 123 provisional applications were disallowed. In 1993, it had grown to 190 disallowed provisional votes. In 1996, it was up again to 288 disallowed provisional votes. In 1998, owing to new boundaries, the number of valid votes cast dropped by 5,623 and the disallowed provisional vote applications dropped, correspondingly, to 229. Clearly, it would have been easier if voters had been required to provide identification on election dayâin other words, if the measures contained in this bill were enacted we would not have encountered such problems. This measure is consistent with the proposal of identification at the time of enrolment. The opposition have argued that these measures are onerous for the old, the young andâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WF6</name.id><name role="metadata">Danby, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Danby</name></talker><para>âNo, your own committee has argued that actually, Paul.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>KV5</name.id><name role="metadata">Neville, Paul, MP</name><name role="display">Mr NEVILLE</name></talker><para>âI am interrupted by my colleague. The opposition have arguedâand I do not care whether or not the committee has argued itâthat these measures are onerous for the old, the young and the disadvantaged. If the honourable member will let me make my point, he might see where I am coming from. They claim that these people would be disenfranchised. That simply does not follow. I am yet to come across a single young person who, having turned 18 years of age, cannot produce some form of identification to get into a licensed disco or licensed premises, and I see many people present their seniors cards at railway stations, on buses, at theatres and the like. We all know that anyone who wants to be a member of a library has to have a library card and identify themselves. If you want to have video store membership, you have to identify yourself. If you want to open a bank account, you have to have a point score and identify yourself. Every time you go to an airport to pick up an electronic ticket you have to provide identification. Even the most disadvantaged seem to have little trouble in applying for Centrelink benefits. In short, this is not a difficult processâand it is no more difficult to do it at an AEC office when applying for enrolment than to do it if you are applying for a provisional vote on election day. Interestingly, the AEC's <inline font-style="italic">Electoral Backgrounder</inline> on electoral fraud and multiple voting, published on 24 October 2001, said in part: </para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>It has been concluded by every parliamentary and judicial inquiry into the conduct of federal elections, since the AEC was established as an independent statutory authority in 1984, that ... the level of fraudulent enrolment and voting is not sufficient to have overturned the result in any Division in Australia.</para></quote><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WF6</name.id><name role="metadata">Danby, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Danby</name></talker><para>âExactly.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>KV5</name.id><name role="metadata">Neville, Paul, MP</name><name role="display">Mr NEVILLE</name></talker><para>âMaybe not thenâ</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WF6</name.id><name role="metadata">Danby, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Danby</name></talker><para>âHa!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>KV5</name.id><name role="metadata">Neville, Paul, MP</name><name role="display">Mr NEVILLE</name></talker><para>âBut there is the matter of questionable provisional votes. If the honourable member will let me finish, I will point out exactly how it could have happened to me. In the 2001 federal election, less than a month after the release of this document, the disallowed provisional votes in Hinkler had climbed to 280. I won that seat by a margin of 64 votes. In short, if I had not had excellent scrutineering assistance, I might not have won the seat. I wish to make it clear that nothing I am saying is a criticism of the AEC, its integrity or its professionalism. I have found their staff to be courteous and focussed, and the Hinkler divisional returning officer and the state office personnel have always been most helpful. My criticism is purely with the current legislative boundaries and regulations. The AEC cannot be expected to operate beyond it powers, and we as a parliament should make its role clear and easy to interpret. In fact, legislative and regulatory clarity will make the AEC's task much easier. What concerns me most is that, without this procedural clarity and rigorous checking of votes, the Australian public could be landedâin a close seat-for-seat contestâwith a government which it did not truly want. The AEC's report concludes with the statement:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>Fraudulent enrolment and voting is taken very seriously by the AEC, if only because any concentration of such activity in a single House of Representatives Division, sufficient to affect the result of the election, could well result in that election being voided by the Court of Disputed Returns, and could conceivably result in a change of government.</para></quote><para>I have given an instance where disallowed provisional vote applications could have affected a result, and the AEC has clearly acknowledged the outright danger of fraudulent voting activities. On that basis, I urge the opposition to support this legislation. We must tighten our electoral processes so that such an event cannot occur again. Sadly, it seems that the opposition is content to talk the talk on electoral reform but has feet of clay when it comes to walking the walk. It is quite telling that, when some of these new verification measures were put to each of the states, which are currently under the governance of the ALP, all argued that the regulations were onerous and would lead to voter disenfranchisement. According to ALP logic, it is unreasonable to ask enrollers to provide proof of identity to the AEC, whenâas I pointed out earlierâit is standard practice for the simplest of tasks, like gaining membership of your local video shop. Dr Carmen Lawrence, a former ALP minister who is a member of this House, once extolled the virtues of tightening our voter and membership enrolment process. In an address to the Sydney Institute on 17 August 2002, Dr Lawrence said: </para><quote><para>There are almost daily revelations of people being signed up to parties without their knowledge or wheeled out only when critical votes are taken (usually about selecting candidates) for election.</para></quote><para>	...	...	...</para><quote><para>One vote, one valueâthe prime condition for a democracyâis not observed in the party's rules.</para></quote><para>She was referring to the ALP's rules. Considering that the ALP itself recognises major problems in party membership and enrolment processes, it is not surprising that there has been an avalanche of criticism levelled at the opposition's stance. Apparently such silly mistakes are encouraged by those who sit on the opposition benches. Grant Musgrove, a Queensland Labor MP who was caught up in the Shepherdson inquiry, told the Hon. Tom Shepherdson QC that he had been taught to falsify enrolments during his formative years with the party. He said, `Certainly there was a culture in the party.' In the mid-1990s, an Australian Electoral Commission submission to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters stated that any measure which complicated the enrolment process in order to discourage fraudulent enrolment may also discourage legitimate enrolment.</para><para>What is being proposed in this bill is not complicated. We might reflect on the words of Thomas Jefferson, who said, `The will of the people is the only legitimate foundation of any government.' Safeguarding the will of the people can happen only if we eliminate fraudulent and factional activities from our voting system. Australia's voting processes are held up to other countries. We are involved in UN scrutiny and observer processes. Accordingly, our own processes should be above reproach. This simple notion is backed up by a wide cross-section of Australia's legal and political fraternities, who have demanded electoral reform by way of voter identification at the point of enrolment. These include a 1975 report on electoral matters by Judge Kay of Western Australia; a 1989 report by past and current New South Wales electoral commissioners Messrs Cundy and Dickson, whose report concluded that voter identification upon enrolment was essential; and, of course, current and previous coalition MPs. For the opposition to stymie and stall the reforms put by the coalition begs the question: is the ALP fair dinkum about cleaning up and supporting electoral reform?</para><para>Another aspect of this legislation which I find particularly pertinent is the prohibition of scrutineers actively participating in assisting voters during polling hours. Of course, I am aware of the situation which arises in many isolated polling booths, where there are a limited number of people available on election day to carry out the official duties of scrutineering, handing out how-to-vote cards, assisting poll clerks and so on. However, I am appalled by some of the anecdotes I have heard, and some the events I have witnessed myself, where those who have handed out how-to-vote cards during the day have been on hand as scrutineers and have entered the polling booth with a voter to help them fill in their ballot papers. One staff member of mine has relayed to me an incident where she witnessed, during a previous election, a person assisting voters in a polling booth. This particular person would indicate a certain point on the ballot paper and ask, `Do you want to vote No. 1 for this person?' It appeared that the box they pointed to was the box that got the No. 1. The scenario was played out at least half a dozen times that day. My staffer complained to the returning officer. When this person was subsequently challenged on their actionsâpractically directing votes towards one candidateâthe activity ceased.</para><para>If not for the vigilance of such representatives on election day, and scrutineers later in proceedings, any number of illegal activities could take place. It is a sad fact that these things take place at all, as underlined by Alan Jones's comments on Channel 9 earlier this month. In his 19 May broadcast, Mr Jones spoke of several issues surrounding the seat of Richmond in the 1990 federal election. It is an infamously marginal seatâand no wonder, when you hear of some of the shenanigans which went on during the 1990 election. The specific instances were that 1,028 names on the roll were untraceable; 432 voters enrolled in Richmond were also enrolled in other electorates; 42 dead people were still on the roll; 548 of a sample of 3,255 apparent nonvoters checked by AEC officials did not exist; 472 of 2,700 letters sent out by the AEC to nonvoters were returned to sender; hundreds of names were entered in the 1987 roll at the last minute at fictitious addresses, in the beds of creeks and along rural roads identified by roadside signs, purporting to be properties; 138 dual voters were confirmed by the AEC report into the election; and 222 votes which were cast could not be reconciled with the ballot papers. </para><para>I ask you: is this not cause for concern? Do instances such as this not warrant bipartisan support for reform of the enrolment process? The incidents which occurred in Richmond have no doubt occurred in some other form in other electorates over the years. The rush of enrolments must surely be justification for closing the rolls at 6 p.m. on the day the writ is issued and allowing people until 8 p.m. on the third working day to alter any necessary things on their enrolment papers. We all have a responsibility to be on the roll. We know roughly when elections are going to be held, as there is generally three to six months speculation in the media as a lead-up. There are hardly any grounds for complaint if someone misses out by not making the effort to be on, or to update their details on, the roll. We all know politics can be a dirty game, but the least we can expect from those who want to partake in democracy is honesty and legitimacy when they enrol to vote. I demand it, the electorate demands it and for the sake of our nation the opposition should also demand it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>29326</page.no><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SLIPPER</name><name.id>0V5</name.id><electorate>Fisher</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âin replyâAt the outset I would like on behalf of the government to thank all of those honourable members who have participated in this debate on the <inline ref="R2029">Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Access to Electoral Roll and Other Measures) Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2030">Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Enrolment Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2004</inline>, particularly those members on this side of the House. Nothing interests members of parliament more than the electoral system. The government seeks to have an electoral system with integrity because it is really important that when an election is held the government that is declared to be elected is in fact the government the people voted for.</para></talk.start><para>While there might be differences between the opposition and the government over what are the appropriate levels of integrity measures, I think that all of us ought to support the principle of an electoral system with integrity. I cannot understand why the opposition does not support the measures in this bill as fulsomely as the government would like. After all, the government is simply trying to make sure that we have an electoral system that is open, honest and accountable, that people are not disenfranchised and that as a nation we have an electoral system that is foremost in integrity amongst the electoral systems throughout the world.</para><para>I would like to thank the chairman and the members of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters for the very comprehensive reports of the committee on both the 1998 and 2001 federal elections. This committee certainly works quite well and has, at times, a level of unanimity. I understand that the chairman runs a very tight ship and that there are very many worthwhile contributions made by those members who are privileged to serve on the committee. </para><para>I want to assure the House that the government remains firmly committed to ensuring the integrity of the electoral system and reducing the potential for electoral fraud. That is one of the reasons why the government has introduced this legislation. As the government has stated previously, it agrees with the view of the committee, stated in its report on the 1996 federal election, that it is unacceptable that the most fundamental transaction between a citizen and the governmentâthe act of choosing the government at a democratic electionâis subject to a far lower level of security than such lesser transactions as opening a bank account, applying for a passport, applying for a drivers licence or registering for social security benefits, to name but a few. And you could also add to that list the matter of hiring a video.</para><para>The government considers that the measures in this legislationâparticularly on proof of identity for enrolment and re-enrolment, certain provisional votes and the early close of rollâwill go a long way towards strengthening our system. The government does not apologise for firmly believing that people who commit offences against society sufficient to warrant a prison term should not while they are serving that prison term be entitled to vote and elect the leaders of the society whose laws they have disregarded. I think that if you go out into the Australian community and speak to people they would certainly agree with the proposition of the government as contained in this legislation. Other measures, such as the inclusion of additional information on the certified list and enrolment based on address, support our commitment to the integrity of the electoral system.</para><para>If you listen to certain opposition members you could be forgiven for believing that the government is not encouraging all Australians to participate in our democratic process. Nothing could be further from the truth. The government is committed to encouraging all Australians to participate in our democratic process. But we also have an obligation to ensure that our electoral system is as robust as possible, and the aim of this legislation is to try to ensure that the right balance is indeed struck.</para><para>The legislation will also implement a number of measures that will improve clarity of who has access to the roll and what information can be provided to those entitled to the roll. Public access to the electoral roll will be improved and a copy of the most up-to-date version of the roll will be available for inspection at all offices of the Australian Electoral Commission. The measures will also enable the Australian Electoral Commission to keep pace with the latest technology andâthis is particularly importantâprovide access to the roll in new and more accessible forms, such as via the Internet.</para><para>Removal of the electoral role from sale will close a loophole and ensure that it is not used for unintended purposes, including commercial useâas was pointed out by the honourable member for Petrie in her contribution. The extension of end use restrictions to all forms of the roll should give the community confidence that the information on the roll can only be used for purposes permitted under the Commonwealth Electoral Act. The other measures in the legislation will enhance arrangements in the lead-up to and the operation of polling on election day. </para><para>When I sum up bills on behalf of the government, I endeavour to pay courtesy to those honourable members on both sides who have made contributions to the debate. When they raise questions or when they raise queries or when they seek to criticise the government's motives in including certain provisions in the bill, I believe that in a democratic system wherever possible the government ought to respond. While time is short and I will not be able to cover all matters, I would like to cover some of those matters which clearly some members of this place thought were to a certain extent a little controversial.</para><para>Early close of rolls was a matter that was raised by the member for Calare, the member for Gellibrand, the member for Blaxland, the member for Fraser, the member for Lingiari, the member for Melbourne Ports and also the member for Cunningham. Those members are entitled to be reassured that, notwithstanding concerns regarding potential disenfranchisement with an early close of rolls, the government is concerned about the potential for electoral fraud associated with the high levels of enrolment activity during the existing seven-day period. People do have an obligation to get on the electoral roll or to change their address on the electoral roll when their circumstances change.</para><para>The Electoral Act also has existing safeguards against disenfranchisement, particularly for young people, including requiring electors to update details on the electoral roll as they change and providing for the provisional enrolment of 17-year-old electors who will be able to vote once they turn 18. The concerns that have been expressed by some honourable members that those aged 18 will miss out simply are not valid concerns because we do have the provision for provisional enrolment of those aged 17 but not yet 18. Initiatives such as the Rock Enrol promotion run by the Australian Electoral Commission assist the government to increase awareness about enrolling and voting among eligible young Australians and encourage them to enrol.</para><para>The new arrangements will ensure that the Australian Electoral Commission has sufficient time to verify details provided by applicants for enrolment and thereby maintain the integrity of the roll. This is really the key. The idea is not to penalise people who have not actually got around to changing their enrolments. The important thing is the integrity of the roll. If in the period immediately prior to the closure of rolls there is an enormous flood of enrolmentsâas there is prior to every electionâthe Electoral Commission, with the best will in the world, does not have the manpower resources to be able to actually check and verify the details provided and the roll could well have less integrity.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WF6</name.id><name role="metadata">Danby, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Danby</name></talker><para>âDoes that mean the last three elections were invalid?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>0V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SLIPPER</name></talker><para>âIf someone actually changes an enrolment between elections that change or application can be subjected to great scrutiny. But when you get hundreds of thousands of last minute enrolments the Electoral Commission has little choice other than simply to put those names on the electoral roll. The member for Melbourne Portsâwho is a person I respect as an individual although I do not agree with him on this issueâought not to interject. What we are seeking to do is to have an electoral roll with integrity. Anyone who opposes the government's proposals with respect to this particular matter does not adequately support an electoral roll with integrity.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The members for Calare and Cunningham also referred to minimum disclosure provisions. I want to point out certain facts. The size of a disclosable donation has not changed for a number of years. There is a significant administrative cost to all parties and donors in having to maintain records for relatively small amounts of money. There is also significant cost to the Australian Electoral Commission in requiring donor returns from minor donors. The government considers this a reasonable recommendation, come to by the joint standing committee and accepted by the government in balancing all of the factors involved. It simply is not realistic to consider that amounts lower than $3,000 could raise issues about undue influence. </para><para>The member for Reid in his speech referred to the matter of scrutineers not being able to actively assist electors who have requested an assisted vote. Apart from scrutineers, this amendment will not limit in any way those who can assist an elector in the casting of his or her vote. The impartiality of the voting process is critical and the amendments will reinforce this by removing any unnecessary temptation for scrutineers to influence the voting by a person. The members for Fraser, Cunningham and Calare talked about proof of identity and address at enrolment and for provisional voting. The government remains committed to preserving and enhancing the integrity of the electoral roll and believes the introduction of new arrangements for proof of identity and address at enrolment will significantly enhance roll integrity and reduce electoral fraud.</para><para>The government recognises and welcomes the realisation by the opposition that identification for enrolment is a good policyâafter the opposition previously blocked in the parliament our attempts to strengthen the integrity of the electoral roll. However, the government believes that, whilst the unanimous joint standing committee recommendation was a good start, it does not go far enough, and the bill reflects that.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WF6</name.id><name role="metadata">Danby, Michael, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>0V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SLIPPER</name></talker><para>âThe member for Melbourne Ports ought not to laugh in jest, because we are serious about seeking to bring about integrity of the electoral roll.</para></talk.start></continue><para>A broad range of options will be available for electors to provide proof of their identity for the purposes of enrolment. This will address any concerns about potential disenfranchisement of electors, while assisting to enhance the integrity of the electoral roll. Alternative forms of acceptable identification documentation to be prescribed in the regulations could be provided by applicants who do not have a drivers licence. Where no identification documentation is available, only people in a prescribed class would be able to provide written references supporting an enrolment application. Developing the scheme in consultation with the states and territories will preserve facilitation of the joint roll arrangements and enable access to information databases. And it is important, of course, to try to preserve these joint roll arrangements. There will be plenty of forms of identification out there, so we do not know why the opposition is not as fulsome in its support for this measure as the government would like.</para><para>The member for Calare also referred to publisher and broadcaster returns on electoral expenditure. Very briefly, these provisions place an unnecessary administrative burden on publishing and broadcasting businesses. The Australian Electoral Commission, in its submission to the joint standing committee's 2000 inquiry into electoral funding and disclosure, recommended that broadcaster and publisher returns be abolished because they do not assist in the prevention of political corruption. Expenditure on electoral advertising is already disclosed by individuals and organisations that authorise the advertisements, as required under other sections of the Electoral Actâthat is, division 5. I note that the opposition has said that this particular proposal has some merit. </para><para>One other matter I would like to mention in passing is the matter of prisoners' voting rights. The members for Calare, Lingiari, Reid, Cunningham and I think Melbourne Ports raised this in their speeches. The government remains firmly of the view that people who commit offences against society sufficient to warrant a prison term should not, while they are serving that prison term, be entitled to vote and elect the leaders of a society whose laws they have disregarded. Only people who are serving a sentence of full-time detention will no longer be eligible to enrol and vote. People being detained on remand, those serving alternative sentences such as periodic or home detention, those serving a non-custodial sentence or people released on parole may still be eligible to enrol and vote. I think we ought to recognise and note that this measure will bring this nation into line with many other Western countries, including the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Belgium, as well as the majority of states in the United States of America.</para><para>This bill is a very positive bill. It is a very important bill. It is a bill which the government strongly supports to bring about integrity of the electoral system. We are hopeful that we will get the bill through the parliament, because the Australian people deserve an electoral system with integrity. While we do believe that our electoral system does have a high degree of integrity, it is always possible to improve that level of integrityâand that is exactly what this bill seeks to achieve in the measures currently before the chamber. I commend these two bills to the House and I would ask for the support of honourable members.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>29330</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Mr SLIPPER (FisherâParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration) (10.34 a.m.)âby leaveâI move:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a third time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>29330</page.no><name role="metadata">Danby, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DANBY</name><name.id>WF6</name.id><electorate>Melbourne Ports</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would like to decode for this parliament and the members of the Australian public listening to this on broadcast the speech that the parliamentary secretary just gave. The parliamentary secretary spoke respectfully of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, of which I am the deputy chair, and then went on to explain the government's measures on enrolment and witnessing. He spoke respectfully of the committee and then spoke about the government measures in two different ways. It should be clear to everybody that a committee chaired by the member for Kooyongâthe Liberal member for Kooyongâwith a majority of government members, including a member of the National Party, have had their recommendations totally repudiated by this government on the two matters of identification and enrolment.</para></talk.start><para>Let me set the general scene and explain to this House what the government have actually done and why. In the period 1990 to 2001 there have been five elections and one referendum. Twelve million Australian voters voted at each electionâsix lots of voting, 72 million votes. The Australian Electoral Commission has found that, in that period, there were 72 proven cases of electoral fraud. In other words, there was one proven case of electoral fraud per million votes in Australian electionsâone proven case. And, for this, the government are now going to close the roll for the federal election on the day the election is called. They have not done this in the three previous elections when they were elected. No-one suggested electoral fraud took place then. The implication of this early closure of the electoral roll we know very clearly. In 1983 former Prime Minister Fraser did precisely that, and 85,000 young people, in particular, were excluded from the electoral roll. </para><para>I would suggest to the parliament and the public that the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters knew this would happen. We sit on that committee and take expert submissions from everyone who wants to put submissions to us after the federal election. The committee is chaired by the Liberal member for Kooyongâwho, as the parliamentary secretary says, handles these matters with great aplombâyet the government ignored the committee and its unanimous recommendations because the government want to exclude these young people from their right to vote. Of course these existing standards are provisions under which people enrol now. Of course the Electoral Commission should have a program for including younger voters. But, in a compulsory voting system, Australians must measure the one fraud per million votes that took place in the last 12 years in the Australian electoral system against the inevitable exclusion of tens of thousands of people who must be included in a fair compulsory system.</para><para>The pressures by the government are an abrogation of our democratic responsibilities. I suspect the government is doing this deliberately. The government members on the committee act with great integrity, but I think this is being driven by the hard-headed Mark Textor elements in the government who want to repudiate the committee's findings and recommendations in order to seek some kind of electoral advantage for themselves by the exclusion of tens of thousands of young people. As I said in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline> today, young people use the last week after the election is called to enrol to vote. When you are 17 or 18, I am sure that filling out forms to enrol in an election is not at the front of your mind. A very democratic aspect of our system is that people are given the chance to put their names on the roll at the last minute so that as many people as possible who are eligible to vote in a compulsory voting system can vote. I suggest that our primary responsibility is ensuring the widest possible enfranchisement, not excluding as many people as possible, as these government measures will try and do.</para><para>The parliamentary secretary also spoke about the government's recommendations in the area of identification. He made the very interesting point that those who do not have drivers licences will only be able to use prescribed witnesses to enrol. This prescribed witness provision is a very important thing for the people listening to this broadcast and the people in the parliament to understand. The prescribed witness requirement means that people who are not enrolled to vote will have to find a barrister, a chemist or a policeman. People who do not have drivers licences might consider it hard to get two people like that together to witness their being an eligible person to enrol.</para><para>The committee recommended against this prescribed witness provision because precisely this class of person may not have access to these kinds of people and we would therefore be excluding thousands of people who need to be included in a democratic system, particularly where we have compulsory voting. Our aim should be to get as many people as possible on the roll and not to exclude them as the government is seeking to do. That means particularly the poorer classes of people who do not have drivers licences and would have to find barristers and policemen to witness their enrolment. Younger people who do not have filling out forms at the front of their mind and who choose to enrol in the last weekâperhaps they should not do that but they inevitably doâshould also not be excluded. We know that if the government measures pass this is going to exclude 85,000 people, and that is a scandalous idea. We have to balance these onerous conditions of enrolment and identification against the exclusion of vast numbers of voters whom we have a duty to see participating in a compulsory voting system. </para><para>I would like to emphasise that the existing Australian electoral system elected this government three times under the current system. It elected previous Labor governments under this enrolment and identification system as well, and there was no proof of major electoral fraud. There were 72 million votes cast in the period from 1990 to 2001, and the Australian Electoral Commission showed that there was one fraud per million votes. For this, we are going to jeopardise the votes of 85,000 young people and put an onerous condition on people who do not have drivers licences to find prescribed witnesses to identify them. This is not an exercise in democracy being undertaken by this government. I am sure that, when these measures go to the Senate, the formidable Senator Faulkner will round up a sufficient number of senators to see that both of these measures are defeated, as they should be.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>29332</page.no><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SLIPPER</name><name.id>0V5</name.id><electorate>Fisher</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMr Deputy Speakerâ</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5I4</name.id><name role="metadata">McMullan, Bob, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>0V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SLIPPER</name></talker><para>âMy friend opposite really ought to stick to his next bill. I will be quite brief because the matters raised by the member for Melbourne Ports in his speech were covered in my earlier contributions. The government welcomes the recommendations of the joint standing committee and congratulates the committee. We believe that the committee does a good job. We believe that the recommendations did not go far enough. That is not to repudiate the provisions of what the committee has said. With respect to the shutting out of voters, there is no intention to do that. While the list of prescribed witnesses has not yet been determined, so often in our society when people sign documents they need certain prescribed witnesses, and surely getting on the electoral roll is at least as important as carrying out some other spheres of human activity.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The suggestion by the member for Melbourne Ports that the government was in some way, shape or form trying to lock out younger voters is simply not accurate. We already have provisions for the provisional enrolment of 17-year-olds, and those provisions will of course encourage younger people to get on the electoral roll. In any event, why on earth would the government be wanting to knock out younger voters when all the opinion polls are showing that younger voters strongly support the policies of the government? The opinion polls I have seen indicate that the government enjoys very strong support from younger voters in our society, so why on earth would we be trying to lock them out? All we are trying to do is bring about an electoral roll with the maximum possible integrity.</para><para>The member for Melbourne Ports referred to the last several elections and suggested that only a small number of frauds had been discovered. In many cases, we would not know whether people fraudulently got on the electoral roll or not because, under the current system with the flood of enrolments just prior to the close of roll prior to an election, the Electoral Commission simply does not have the time or the resources to work out whether those people should go on the roll. In many cases, those people just go on the roll. We do not know if nom de plumes are going on the electoral roll. We do not know if nom de plumes vote. The abolition of subdivisional voting made it easier for people to go from polling booth to polling booth. </para><para>While only a certain number of examples of electoral fraud may have been identified, the idea is to cover the situation where electoral fraud is not identified. There are a whole lot of cases in which I believe there has been electoral fraud but it has not been identified. The whole reason for this legislation is to make sure that any such fraud, if it has happened in the past, does not happen again and to make sure that we have an electoral roll with the maximum possible level of integrity.

Two weeks ago the Treasurer delivered the most profligate budget ever. This may sound, on the face of it, like a big call, but the facts back it up. In this financial year and the next, this budget leads to an increase in spending of $23 billion. Another way of describing the extent of this unprecedented spending spree is the fact that the reconciliation tables in the budget papers show new spending of $52 billion in this budget for the next four years. There has never been anything like itânothing even comes close to it. The surplus generated for this year or next is not the result of any frugality, of any careful tending of public revenues; it is simply due to the fact that this is the highest taxing government in Australian history.</para></talk.start><para>Over this financial year and the next, Commonwealth receipts will increase by $18 billion, not counting the GST. After the initial euphoria that follows the spending of $52 billion, it is clear that broader issues are emerging which have wider implications for the future of fiscal policy in Australia. There has been much debate about how government will fund fiscal pressures arising from the ageing of the Australian population. Usually the debate focuses on issues arising from the spiralling costs of health care and aged care, which will be placed under increasing pressure as the Australian population, in average terms, becomes older. However, the key problem facing Australian policy makers is: how will we fund future spending to support an ageing population when less of the productive work force will be contributing to the tax base? All of the available options raise difficult issues.</para><para>We need better quality public debate about budget priorities and management, and I will have something to say in the near future about some initiatives to enhance that debate. But today I would like to focus on what I regard as the first item that we need to address, possibly the most crucial to the fiscal responsibilities of governmentâthe effectiveness of spending programs. This part of the task is best described by one of the most notable finance ministers of recent times, Peter Walsh. He saw his task as `opposing wasting taxpayers' money' on what he judged to be unworthy causes. Part of his job was `ruthlessly'âand I do not think anyone would doubt that he applied that phrase to himself and to his activitiesâ`pursuing savings in spending programs and transfer payments'.</para><para>As is currently the case, Labor in government employed an expenditure review committee, or ERC, not only to assume an important role in the allocation of resources and identification of priorities but also to oversee and conduct extensive spending cuts. In 1987 alone, under the leadership of Hawke, Keating and Walsh, Labor instituted cuts of $2.6 billion. Of course, the ERC then had a more permanent role than the current government's equivalent appears to have and was therefore able to perform a rolling function of tighter control on spending and ongoing review of programs to monitor waste and hence undertake ongoing savings processes. The role of the ERC during the Hawke government was not dissimilar to the role and function of the current ERC for Labor in opposition. Putting aside the policy and spending oversight functions which only arise in government, the current Labor ERC has focused its efforts on identifying savings so that Labor policies are fully costed and funded. </para><para>Let me outline my view of the savings task for a modern Labor finance shadow minister. It is important to recognise that savings are not an end in themselves; nor is the size of government an end in itself. They are means to a bigger end. In 2004, the purpose of a savings task is to make room for priority initiatives that an incoming Latham Labor government would wish to introduce over and above present government commitments. In some areas, identification of potential savings has been easy. It has just been a matter of cutting out bad policy.</para><para>The baby bonus is a classic example of bad policy. It was flawed from the beginning. Even if it had achieved its stated goals, which it clearly failed to do, it was an unfair and inefficient means of achieving them. Cutting that out was easy in principle. However, the figures surrounding public financesâand the budget in particularâare so opaque these days that identifying the net cost of the program was very difficult, but we did it. The irony is that the government attacked us for it: the Treasurer came into the House at question time and attacked the Labor Party for proposing to abolish the baby bonus. But, as we knew would happen, only months later, in a barefaced but unashamed case of double standards, the Treasurer announced in the budget precisely the measure he had attackedâhe abolished the baby bonus.</para><para>In addition to bad policy, there are areas of waste and mismanagement which are obvious and demand the attention of any finance minister or treasurer interested in doing their job. But the present incumbents have an eye for election management rather than budget management. The most obvious current example of shocking waste is the government's obscene advertising spending spree. Without having access to any undisclosed intentions of the government, we have been able to identify a saving of more than $100 million in current and planned advertising campaignsâand this does not include expensive but necessary advertising costs associated with issues like defence recruitment or other employment related advertising.</para><para>The breathtaking double standards reflected in this spending are exacerbated when you realise that the Prime Minister, as opposition leader in 1995, promised to introduce strict guidelines, enforced by the Auditor-General, to limit government advertising. Nine years later we are still waiting for any action. In a press release of 5 September 1995 about pre-election advertising, the Prime Minister, who was then Leader of the Opposition, said:</para><quote><para>This grubby tactic will backfire on the Government. Taxpayers will see through it. They don't want their money wasted on glossy advertising designed to make the Prime Minister feel good.</para></quote><para>I think in 2004 that statement is true. Secondly, he said:</para><quote><para>There is clearly a massive difference between necessary Government information for the community and blatant Government electoral propaganda.</para></quote><para>That statement of 1995 is certainly applicable to the $100 million the government is proposing to spend to get itself re-elected. Thirdly, he said:</para><quote><para>The problem for this Government is not communication. The problem is that it is tired, it has broken too many promises and it has hurt too many people.</para></quote><para>That is too true. Most tellingly of all in the 2004 context, the then Leader of the Opposition said:</para><quote><para>Families, welfare organisations, small businesses, the elderly and the youth of Australia can all see far better ways to spend $50 millionâ </para></quote><para>we could now say $100 millionâ</para><quote><para>than self-congratulatory mirage-making.</para></quote><para>That is even more true today. That is a very big savings option, which we will exercise and which we will outline the details of shortly. Since last year the opposition ERC has set out to ensure that Labor's spending programs do not place pressure on the budget and in turn on interest rates. Throughout this process Labor have been able to identify savings of more than $10 billion through a process of reprioritisation, reallocation and cutting wasteful, mismanaged and misdirected government policies.</para><para>Key examples of the government's misdirected spending have been in the areas of health and education. The Treasurer, in what I am sure he thought at the time was a withering attack, made this point very effectively for us in question time this week, and we thank him for it. What he made clear, and repeated yesterday, is that we, the opposition, have been able to substantially fund our major reforms in Medicare and higher education by reallocating funds from the government's failed policies in this area. I invite the Treasurer to launch the same attack again today, because it makes our frugality more evident to the Australian voters. The Treasurer was right: we have made those reallocations, and we will continue to do this in other policy areas as well.</para><para>A key example of wasteful spending that Labor has been able to abolish to fund key aspects of our policy platform lies in the area of industrial relations. In this area the government's blind ideological hatred of trade unions has led it to establish wasteful and unnecessary bureaucracy to duplicate functions better performed by the Industrial Relations Commission. We do not have to do that, and we will not. Therefore, those funds, another $183 million, will be available to fund other programs.</para><para>Labor's savings will ensure that ideology like that and `favours for mates' do not compromise the effectiveness of policy delivery and outcomes and that taxpayers' money is not frittered away. Labor have been proactive in assessing government spending, and we have to acknowledge that our identification of savings has met with some agreement from the government. On many occasions savings that we have outlined, for which we have been criticised by the government, have then been stolen by the government, reducing our net savingsâalthough not necessarily the funds available, because it has a bottom line effect on the budgetâand making the task of identifying savings and keeping a scorecard of commitments more like trying to take a fix on a moving target.</para><para>The 2004-05 budget confirmed that the government has pinched four of Labor's identified savings: the abolition of the baby bonus and the maternity allowance, the abolition of the National Office of the Information Economy and the merger of the Broadcasting Authority and the Communications Authority. Many of those policies, when we announced them, were attacked by the government. Some months later, they have adopted them all.</para><para>An important part of Labor's savings process is assessing government policy and tracking down expenditure over the forward estimates. This is not always a simple or straightforward task; however, we have persisted in applying our policy of fully costing and funding our policies so that our commitment to a budget surplus and low interest rates remains true. We will persist in the task to assess program spending and identify that which is wasteful, mismanaged or not addressing what should be the priorities of the government. </para><para>We will continue to analyse and assess programs and scrutinise reviews and assessments conducted by the government and the private sector so that not only do taxpayers get value for money but Australians, both now and in the future, can access those services that are crucial to ensuring quality of life. This will include scrutiny of our own programs and priorities, because not all savings come from bad policy or waste and mismanagement; sometimes, worthwhile policies or commitments have to make way for higher priorities. We will be applying that to our own announced priorities as well as those of the government.</para><para>I would like to talk about another aspect of the budget which has long-term implications for fiscal sustainability, not just in recurrent terms but also in balance sheet management. I am speaking, of course, of Telstra and the government's intention to sell off its remaining shares irrespective of the will of most Australians to keep Telstra in majority public ownership. Labor has consistently argued that the sale of Telstra will leave the budget worse off. That is to say, the stream of dividends from Telstra exceeds the benefit that the government gets from paying off debt and reducing its public debt interest payments.</para><para>Even today it is not exactly clear how the proceeds of any proposed Telstra sale will be used by the government. There appears to be increasing pressure for the government simply to spend some or all of the money to pork-barrel the proceeds to facilitate the passage of the legislation. Indeed, as recently as a fortnight ago, an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> confirmed that government ministers were reconsidering the packaging of the sale in order to push the legislation through the Senate. The article also confirmed that the Treasurer had signalled that he was open to the possibility of Telstra proceeds being used to finance a slush fund. But only a few days later the Treasurer indicated he would prefer to apply the proceeds to pay off the government's unfunded superannuation liability.</para><para>On the face of it, that is not inconsistent with some of the comments made by the Minister for Finance and Administration. But what is becoming clear is that the Treasurer's position on the use of proceeds is one opinion today and a different opinion tomorrow, and it gets muddier than ever. This has serious implications for the budget impact of a sale of Telstra. Analyses of consensus forecasts of Telstra's share price and dividends show quite clearly that the sale will cost the budget in the short and medium term. Placing proceeds in a term deposit would cost the budget as much as $1Â½ billion across the forward estimates. However, creating a slush fund of $2 billion per tranche of the sale and using only the remainder to pay off debt would cost the budget even more over the forward estimates period.</para><para>Yesterday's estimates hearings again confirmed that the government is still very coy about the budget impact of a sale of Telstra. It wants to cover it up because it has something to cover. However, the opposition have been able to establish by analysing the figures in the budget that the government has finally revised its Telstra dividend assumption from the ridiculous 23c per share across the forward estimates in the 2003-04 budget to the more realistic market based dividend-per-share forecast of 28c, which appears to be reflected in the 2004-05 budget. If this is true, it is a welcome improvement to the presentation of the budget estimates, but it confirms Labor's long-running contention that the sale of Telstra will cost the budget now and in the future.</para><para>Questioning during the estimates hearings yesterday sought to extract the underlying assumptions of a sale and what the net impact would be. The key elements which determine the budget impact of a sale of Telstra are pretty clear: the sale proceeds minus the sale costsâthat is, the net amount of money, the impact on that amount in terms of public debt interest savings when used to pay off debt, and the dividends forgone by no longer owning those shares and how they balance. </para><para>We can now get a pretty good fix on what all that data is. The sale proceeds, assumptions and costs are reflected in the budget and in second reading speeches. We can now assess the dividends forgone because we appear to have agreement on the appropriate estimate of future dividends, which should not be all that difficult to make, because such assessments are regularly published and there is an IBES survey which reflects the consensus of analysts that the dividend should be close to 28c. The public debt interest savings can easily be calculated because, in his second reading speech in October last year, Senator Minchin outlined that we should apply the long-term bond rate.</para><para>If we do those three things, we find that in the first tranche of sale the budget assumes a figure of $11,280 million, which if applied would generate public debt interest savings of $622 million in the first year. We would get dividends forgone in the first year of $601 millionâand rising, but let us just keep them constant for the momentâbut the problem is that the cost of selling Telstra is $218 million in that year, which on the basis of that analysis makes a net negative budget contribution of $197 million in 2007-08.</para><para>The Department of Finance and Administration has refused to answer basic questions about the composition of dividends in the budget for the extraordinary reason that, if it answered those questions, the Labor Party would be able to do the maths and work out what the Telstra dividend has been revised to. In other words, people might know what the government's plans are. The public might actually be able to work out what the financial implications of the government's decisions are, so we cannot afford to tell them. Telstra has been saying it is a matter for the department of finance and the department of finance say they cannot tell us because it is a matter for Telstra. They have both refused to come clean on the issue of budget dividend forecasts.</para><para>So I want to reiterate our previous challenge to the government to reveal all the data. What is the assumption about the sale priceâwe think we know; we think the government has made it public; the figure in the budget seems to tell us, but confirm that. Confirm the sale costsâthey seem to be on the record; we think we know. Confirm those. Confirm the public debt interest saving based on the figure that the Minister for Finance and Administration put out last year. And confirm the dividend estimateâthe market estimate is 28c a share. We want to know if those assumptions are correct. If they are, how can you deny the fact that that is going to have a net budget impact? There are slightly different ways it can be calculated, but they all drive a negative number.</para><para>The significance of the savings and other measures I have outlined is that they make it possible for Labor to meet our priority service spendings in key areas like health and education and yet meet our rigorous fiscal pledge of budget surpluses in each year of the next parliament, a reduction in Commonwealth expenditure as a percentage of GDP and a reduction in Commonwealth taxation as a percentage of GDP. We will need to be rigorous in continuing to find savings and funding options to meet that pledge and to meet our services commitments. The key to delivering on these commitments is the discipline to make tough decisions and set rigorous priorities. Only a new and fresh government will deliver this discipline and rigourâand I look forward to the opportunity of being part of that process. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>29339</page.no><name role="metadata">Worth, Trish, MP</name><name role="display">Ms WORTH</name><name.id>8V5</name.id><electorate>Adelaide</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt is now just over two weeks since the Treasurer stood in this chamber and delivered a budget that provides more for families, more for aged care, more tax cuts, more for carers and more for new parents. </para></talk.start><para>Two weeks later and the silence from the opposition on its own budget details is deafening. The opposition leader has responded in this chamber to the budget. He has addressed a National Press Club luncheon, gone on talkback radio and made reassuring noises on family values but, when it comes to the details, there is nothing. His `ladder of opportunity' may warm the hearts of motivational speakers and his reading books to children may further increase the wealth of J.K. Rowling but, when it comes to telling the Australian people how he intends to run the Australian economy if elected, he is silent. The opposition leader is not alone. His shadow Treasurer also has been developing the art of talking a lot but saying very little. His own party did not want him as their leader, but they now think that the Australian public will warm to his economic credentials. One wonders, from the ongoing confusion in Labor's ranks on economic policy, whether they have any plans at all.</para><para>I think that it is very important to highlight the stark contrast between the budget speech of the Treasurer and the reply by the Leader of the Opposition. The Treasurer outlined the clear vision of a government that had kept the economy growing and was able to reward the hard work of Australians, while offering more for families, further tax cuts and a better aged care system. In contrast, the opposition leader's response was high on rhetoric and very low on substance. My concern with the opposition leader is his ability to back up his promises with any plan of action. The <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline>, in its editorial following the opposition leader's budget-in-reply speech, said that the opposition leader was `long on promises and short on detail' and that the speech `does not show Mr Latham is anything more than a smooth talker'. Political commentator Glenn Milne wrote in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> newspaper:</para><quote><para>... Latham will have to get off the big shiny ideas and get down into the dirty business of detailed policyâ</para></quote><para>So far, that detail is very sadly lacking. </para><para>The 2004-05 budget should be recognised for providing security for families so they can plan for the future. The improvements in family tax benefits, tax cuts and maternity payments offer families more choices at a time when unemployment and interest rates are at record lows. Importantly, even with these significant measures, the budget remains in surplus. As the Treasurer indicated, the government will not spend money it does not have. In fact, the government has repaid $70 billion of Labor's $96 billion debt. At a time when countries much bigger than Australia have gone into recession, this is a very remarkable achievement.</para><para>What must also be recognised in this debate is the success of the taxation reforms in not only greatly improving our taxation system but also providing money to the states and territories. In 2004-05, after only four years since the introduction of the A New Tax System, every state and territory will be better off than they would have been had the tax reform not been implemented. This means that in 2004-05 every state and territory will receive more revenue from the GST than they would have done under a previous system of financial assistance grants and the state and territory taxes that were abolished with the new tax system. </para><para>My home state of South Australia will be $130.9 million better off this financial year as a result of that tax reform. This figure builds to an increased revenue of $236.1 million by 2007-08. Across the whole country, we are $1.6 billion better off in 2004-05 and will be $2.9 billion better off by 2007-08. This extraordinary achievement means that there will be no excuses for state and territory governments in not providing important health and education services through the additional money that they now receive from the Australian government. </para><para>I congratulate the Treasurer on the announcement of significant tax cuts for Australian workers. Middle income earners have until now been subject to tax rates that are higher than the top tax rates paid in other countries. Bracket creep is also a problem as people cross into higher tax brackets. These changes will make us more internationally competitive and reward effort. I have heard the predictable criticism from some people that the changes to the tax system disadvantage lower income earners but, if you actually look at the nature of our progressive taxation system, such criticism is unfair.</para><para>I was interested in the words of the Treasury secretary, Ken Henry, when he talked to a business economists' lunch about the extraordinary progressivity of that tax and social welfare system, in that many people pay proportionally higher rates of tax the more that they earned. Mr Henry gave a comparison of a family, with one child under five years of age, earning just $10,000 a year which had an effective, after tax and social security, benefit of $26,000. The same family with an income of $100,000 had an after-tax income of $67,613. In other words, a family with a tenfold increase in earnings only increased their disposable income by 2Â½ times. As Mr Henry said in his speech, by international standards, our higher marginal tax rates cut in at quite low levels of income, and our income support payments are subject to a much higher than normal extent of means testing.</para><para>The Treasurer pointed out earlier this week that 99.8 per cent of Australian families with children will benefit from either tax cuts or increased family benefits in this year's budget. As the Treasurer also pointed out, if you claim the family tax benefit under the tax system, the effect of the benefits means that a single income family with two children does not pay tax until the family income goes above $40,975.</para><para>Many of the budget measures announced this month will greatly benefit people in my electorate and South Australia as a whole. I would like to take this opportunity to highlight just a few of them. I was particularly pleased to see the wine equalisation tax rebates for South Australian winemakers. The government will rebate $290,000 of wine equalisation tax to every wine producer per annum. While the grapes may be grown in country South Australia, many people in my electorate are directly and indirectly involved in the wine industry and therefore will benefit from this important decision.</para><para>I also applaud the decisions to provide more aged care places. In South Australia an extra 1,675 aged care places will be created from now until 2006-07, with the bulk of those places being created in 2004-05. A further $438.6 million will be provided Australia wide over the next four years towards building, refurbishing and expanding aged care facilities. The one-off payment of $513.3 million, or $3,500 per resident, will provide for significant investment in improving building standards for aged care homes by 2008.</para><para>I also welcome the positive budget measure for veterans, with the government providing $157.7 million over four years to ensure that veterans and their dependants who have gold or white repatriation health care cards retain access to specialist medical services as private patients.  </para><para>I was delighted to see the government delivering on an earlier commitment to provide funding for local roads in my electorate. The government has announced an additional $26 million in local road funding for South Australian councils over the next three years. The funding is in addition to the $106 million in 2003-04 provided as financial assistance grants to local government in South Australia. In January this year funding for local roads under the Roads to Recovery program was increased by approximately $100 million over five years. </para><para>These significant announcements follow my own extensive lobbying and that of my coalition colleagues in South Australia for a more equitable share of local road funding. Under financial assistance grants, councils in South Australia had around 7.7 per cent of the national population and 11.7 per cent of the national roads but received only 5.5 per cent of the local road funding.</para><para>I met with the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads, Senator Ian Campbell, to lobby him on the shortfall in financial assistance grants and to urge him to increase South Australia's share of funding. I would like to place on the record my appreciation of his understanding the situation and fixing it. I understand that the increase in funding has also been welcomed by the Local Government Association and the RAA. Unfortunately, the South Australian government has made the situation far worse by taking away money from its regional road program grants and reducing funding from $2.2 million in 2001-02 to just $700,000 in 2003-04. I call on the South Australian Treasurer to follow the Australian government's very good example and reverse this mean decision.</para><para>The government has also delivered on its commitment to provide funding of more than $365 million over four years for a range of local initiatives to help families, children and communities at risk, through a new Stronger Families and Communities strategy. The Enfield Early Learning Service in my electorate have already benefited from this announcement. They are one of the first organisations to receive new funding to continue their excellent work to help children and families in the northern suburbs. I will certainly be encouraging other local community groups around Adelaide to have a close look at the comprehensive package of initiatives and to apply for funding if they believe their idea or project will make a real difference to their community.</para><para>Another positive project in the budget is the establishment of a $20 million national community crime prevention program, which will include a community grants scheme to support grassroots projects designed to prevent crimes such as graffiti and vandalism and to improve community safety and security. I can assure colleagues that the feedback from my electorate is that that initiative is very important indeed, as graffiti in inner-city areas can be quite a problem.</para><para>As strong as the Australian economy is, there are always significant challenges to be faced by the people of Adelaide. The latest one was the announcement last Friday by Mitsubishi Motors to close the Lonsdale engine plant. While the plant is outside my electorate, there are many people living in my electorate who are directly or indirectly affected by this decision. They work at Mitsubishi, work at factories that supply parts for Mitsubishi or provide other services for the company. If there were ever a case of a cloud having a silver lining, this is it. While the decision to shut down the Lonsdale plant was very disappointing, the decision to keep the Tonsley Park plant operating is very good news for all concerned. </para><para>I would like to take this opportunity to wholeheartedly support the actions of both the Australian government and the South Australian government in their efforts to keep Mitsubishi in South Australia and to offer assistance to workers affected by the Lonsdale plant closure. The Australian government is putting in place a $50 million package of assistance measures that involves a combination of labour market program assistance to help those workers as well as measures to attract new investment and create job opportunities in South Australia. Clearly this will help Mitsubishi staff and create valuable investment opportunities in Adelaide.</para><para>Apart from very local issues, there are always ongoing external challenges for the people of Adelaide, as there are in other parts of the world. I refer to our ongoing war on terrorism and, in particular, the war in Iraq. It is of concern that we need to keep reminding peopleâand, unfortunately, some who sit on the other side of this chamberâthat a key reason that Australia was part of the coalition of the willing was to stop a tyrannical government inflicting atrocities on its own people. Once again I defer to the words of Jose Ramos Horta, a Nobel Peace Prize winner and East Timor's senior minister for foreign affairs and cooperation. He wrote in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> on Friday, 14 May that cutting and running in Iraqâas some countries have already doneâonly gives comfort to terrorists and those who would seek to undermine democracy. He wrote: </para><quote><para>No matter how the retreating governments try to spin it, every time a country pulls out of Iraq it is al-Qa'ida and other extremists who win. They draw the conclusion that the coalition of the willing is weak and that the more terrorist outrages, the more countries will withdraw.</para></quote><para>He continues:</para><quote><para>As a Nobel Peace laureate, I, like most people, agonise over the use of force. But when it comes to rescuing an innocent people from tyranny or genocide, I've never questioned the justification for resorting to force.</para></quote><para>Jose Ramos-Horta points out that:</para><quote><para>Saddam's overthrow offers a chance to build a new Iraq that is peaceful, tolerant and prosperous. That's why the stakes are so high, and why extremists from across the Muslim world are fighting to prevent it.</para></quote><para>As Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing, I would like to mention a number of the positive initiatives in my areas of responsibility in recent months that will once again benefit from the budget. The Australian government has again shown a strong commitment to its Tough on Drugs strategy. Last month, the Prime Minister announced that $17 million will be provided in additional grants to help tackle Australia's illicit drug problem. This funding, made under stage 2 of the Non-Government Organisation Treatment Grants Program, will assist 62 organisations across the nation, including three in my own electorate, to provide a wide variety of new treatment projects. This is in addition to the funding of $47 million allocated to stage 1 of the same program, which was announced by the Prime Minister in August and October 2003.</para><para>The funding will provide new services for treating people struggling with illicit drug problems, with particular emphasis on addressing the emerging issues of increased psychostimulant use and the comorbidity that exists between mental health disorders and problematic drug use. These are issues we need to treat seriously and take action on. Last week, I launched a monograph that showed Australia is not immune to the global phenomenon of an increasing use of psychostimulants. The revised National Drug Strategy monograph <inline font-style="italic">Models of intervention and care for psychostimulant users</inline> shows there are clear signs that psychostimulant use is increasing in Australia. This increased use of psychostimulants, particularly methamphetamine use, poses significant challenges for law enforcement and treatment services. Subsequent violence, depression and psychosis have serious consequences for the individual, treatment providers and the wider community. This revised monograph and other recent surveys have highlighted the importance of developing a range of coordinated, complementary and innovative interventions focusing on psychostimulants and addressing prevention, treatment, harm reduction and supply reduction. </para><para>On the issue of comorbidity, last week I was fortunate to spend a whole day taking part in a forum that was jointly organised by the Australian government and the Mental Health Council of Australiaâand which was funded by the Australian governmentâto look at early intervention initiatives. The forum was attended by some of the top psychiatrists, clinicians, GPs and other medical specialists as well as drug and alcohol service providers. I congratulate everyone who took part in this event. I found it challenging and thought provoking, and there were clear messages about how the areas of mental health and drug and alcohol services need to work closer together to help our young people. I also would like to make special mention of the three young peopleâJenelle, Eric and Janeâwho not only recounted their own experiences of depression and drug use but provided wonderful input to the debate. The outcome of this forum will greatly inform the government as it moves forward in this important area. I also note that further funding for comorbidity was announced in the federal budget to continue this very valuable work.</para><para>Another critical issue for this government and for the health of many Australians is our measures to reduce the incidence of smoking. Tobacco smoking is the single largest preventable cause of death and disability in Australia. It kills more than 19,000 people, is responsible for about 80 per cent of drug related deaths and costs the Australian community around $21 billion in social costs per year. Central to this is our commitment to introduce graphic health warnings on tobacco products. Following extensive consultation with consumer groups, the tobacco industry and the wider community, the government will shortly introduce regulations into parliament which will lead to the introduction of these new warnings.</para><para>On another health issue of note, I would like to congratulate the Breast Cancer Network Australia on the launch of the <inline font-style="italic">My Journey </inline>kit, a resource developed by women for women newly diagnosed with breast cancer. I had the pleasure of launching this kit in Melbourne along with other prominent breast cancer survivors, including former Olympian Raelene Boyle and former federal minister Ros Kelly. The <inline font-style="italic">My Journey kit contains information on a range of topics</inline>, including emotional survival, physical wellbeing, help for partners and families, the importance of a multidisciplinary medical team, treatments, practical advice about what to take to hospital, returning home, going back to work and financial issues. Even with the advantage of my nursing and pathology background and my work in the health portfolio, I would have benefited greatly from the kit at the time of my own diagnosis. This kit has been written and prepared in easy to understand language by women who have been through the experience themselves. In addition, all the major medical colleges, including surgeons, general practitioners, radiologists, medical oncologists, nurses and pathologists, have endorsed this kit. I am very pleased to advise colleagues that the Australian government contributed $200,000 to this wonderful resource. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>29344</page.no><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Dr EMERSON</name><name.id>83V</name.id><electorate>Rankin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAn appropriate starting point for the debate on <inline ref="R2040">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2004-2005</inline> and the cognate bills is the identification of the challenge facing Australia in the coming years. That challenge is well articulated in paragraphs written by Treasury in Budget Paper No. 1. The challenge is of an ageing population and faltering productivity growth. This challenge has been recognised by Treasury since 2002, when it produced the <inline font-style="italic">Intergenerational Report</inline>. But Budget Paper No. 1, at page 1-6, says that over the next 40 years it is:</para></talk.start><quote><para>... projected that growth in the proportion of the population of workforce age will slow to almost zero ...</para></quote><para>This is a very chilling forecast. It is one clear indication of the ageing of the population. The other contributor to the challenge facing Australia is faltering productivity growth, as confirmed again in Budget Paper No. 1, at page 1-7, which says:</para><quote><para>... it is likely that real GDP per person will slow to around 1Â½ per cent per annum over the next 40 years, relative to around 2 per cent per year over the past 40 years. This is due largely to the negative contribution to growth of the projected decline in labour force participationâa direct result of the ageing of the populationâand a return to the long term growth rate of productivity of 1 per cent a year.</para></quote><para>This forecast decline in per capita GDP growth from the year 2010 onwards would constitute the slowest rate of growth in measured living standards since the decade of the Great Depression. Through the <inline font-style="italic">Intergenerational Report</inline> and the official budget papers, Treasury is forecasting our worst performance in per capita GDP growth from the year 2010 onwards since the decade of the Great Depression. You would think that, having been confronted with this challenge, the government would respond adequately to it in the budget, but it does not. The budget paper also says, at page 1-8:</para><quote><para>... in the Discussion Paper Australia's Demographic Challenges released by the Treasurer in February 2004. That paper highlights the need to take early action to increase productivity and labour force participation.</para></quote><para>What action is provided in this budget to increase labour productivity and work force participation, and combat the ageing of the population? This budget is a grave disappointment, in that the challenge has been identified and well articulated by Treasury but the response is sadly lacking.</para><para>In terms of the ageing of the population, the government has introduced some measures relating to superannuation, which, in effect, ensure that superannuation tax concessions flow to high-income earnersâin particular, to the spouses of high-income earners, through the co-contribution and the changed eligibility that is enunciated in the budget. That changed eligibility is such that only 10 per cent of a spouse's income needs to be earnedâmeaning that up to 90 per cent can be unearned income. That is a clear indicator of a preference to support superannuation for the spouses of well-off Australians. The other measure associated with superannuation is a reduction in the superannuation tax surcharge, which would go to something like one in 20 Australians, leaving 19 out of 20 Australians to get no benefit from that particular measure.</para><para>Why is the Howard government so intent on ensuring that superannuation again becomes the preserve of the relatively well off? The answer is: it is being consistent. It is being perfectly consistent, because when Labor understood the challenge of the ageing of the population way back in the 1980s, Labor successfully sought to spread superannuation to the working men and women of Australia; the then opposition, the coalition of the Liberal and National parties, hated it. They hated it and opposed it at every opportunity. Have a look at the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>. Have a look at the public statements. They hated the idea of working people getting access to superannuation. Yet, before the 1996 election, for purely expedient reasons, the Howard government made a promise in its official election documents to retain Labor's co-contribution scheme. In 1997, the Howard government broke the promise and scrapped Labor's co-contribution scheme that would have ensured a reasonable, decent retirement income for the working people of Australia. It broke a promise and scrapped the scheme, consistent with its long-held philosophical view that working people should not have superannuation. That philosophical view has been reinforced in this budget. There is this challenge of the ageing of the populationâand, therefore, an increased burden of providing adequate retirement incomesâand the government, through its ideological obsessions, has squibbed the challenge, restricting benefits overwhelmingly to the highest income earners in this country. </para><para>When the government scrapped Labor's co-contribution, it stole out of the pockets of working Australians the money that was to be directed into superannuation funds. It kept that money. Then, in the year 2000, it used some of that money for what the Treasurer described as a `streamlined new tax system for a new century' and `the biggest income tax cuts in Australia's history', but it did not even give back all the bracket creep that it had accumulated. It stole the money, gave these tax cuts and described them as the biggest tax cuts in Australia's history, but they were just GST compensationâcompensation for a GST that the government created and has been disowning ever since. It says the GST has nothing to do with it; it is not a Commonwealth taxâyou will find in the budget papers that the government denies that the GST is a Commonwealth tax, even though it was put through this parliament, even though the Auditor-General has indicated and ruled that it is a Commonwealth tax.</para><para>The only people in Australia who believe that the GST is not a Commonwealth tax are the members oppositeâthe members of the Howard government. You ask any one of them and they will look you in the face and say: `Oh, no, the GST is not a Commonwealth tax. We don't remember going into parliament and passing that legislation.' I think the Australian people are a bit smarter than thatâin fact, a lot smarter than that. In the year 2000, in the form of GST compensation, the government gave back some of the money that it stole from the Australian people in 1997. Then, in the year 2003, last year, it gave one further tax cutâa tax cut worth $4 a week. It was a $4-a-week tax cut that Senator Amanda Vanstone described as a sandwich and milkshake tax cut. She was right. It was barely enough to buy a sandwich and a milkshake.</para><para>This budget provides, for four out of five Australians, no reductionânot one centâin income tax. These are the forgotten people. Four out of five Australian families and single people get not one cent of reduction in income tax in this budgetâand right through the forward estimates period to mid-2008. The Treasurer was asked about this. He was asked on the <inline font-style="italic">7.30 Report</inline>: `What about the forgotten people?' He said: `You asked me about low-income earners. Last year we did it across the board. Low-income earners pay less tax.' He just dismissed the question about why four in five Australians get not one cent of income tax cut in the budget. He completely dismissed it. It means that these forgotten people, if the Australian people were ever to have the misfortune of the Howard government being re-elected, would get only one income tax cut in the entire period from 2001 to 2008âthat income tax cut being a $4 sandwich and milkshake income tax cut. </para><para>The government has forgotten most Australians in its tax policy. But who are the forgotten people? I have done some analysis of this. The forgotten people are hairdressers, farmhands, cleaners, shop assistants, receptionists, hospitality workers. I might just point out, using the government's own projections of inflation and earnings growth, how much extra the forgotten people will be paying in income tax by the middle of 2008 as a result of the fact that the government has given them no income tax relief in this budget or for any year up to the middle of 2008. A hairdresser will be paying almost $29 a week extra in income tax by the middle of 2008. A farmhand will be paying $31; a cleaner, $33; a shop assistant, $34; a receptionist, $34; a hospitality worker, $36; an office clerk, $36; a labourer, $36; a factory worker, $39; a motor mechanic, $39; an enrolled nurse, almost $41; a machine operator, more than $41; a social worker, more than $42; and an accounts clerk, almost $43 a week extra in tax. These are the forgotten people.</para><para>Back in 1942 the Prime Minister's hero, Bob Menzies, described the forgotten people in a radio interview. He said that they were the backbone of the country. These are the people who form the backbone of Australia, but this government has said that they deserve only, in a seven-year period, a sandwich and milkshake $4-a-week tax cut. I have also calculated that 62 per cent of those sums is bracket creep. So when the government says it is giving back bracket creep, it is completely untrue. These forgotten people will be subject to bracket creep as a result of their omission from the income tax cuts. It is also the case that three in five Australians will get not only no income tax cut but also no increase in family paymentsâthree in five families and single income earners.</para><para>The government would be doing very well in terms of income tax receipts over the next few years if it were to be re-elected. If it were to be re-elected, there would be an increase in income tax receipts, as projected in this budget, from $97 billion in 2003-04 toâwait for itâ$121.9 billion. That is an increase, in just a short period, of 25 per cent, or $24 billion. So the government is raking in income tax because it is too mean to give the forgotten people a tax cut. The government also neglects the GST, which is also growing.</para><para>It is worse in my state of Queensland. NATSEM has calculated that in Queenslandâand this is because incomes are, on average, lowerâ63 per cent of families and single income earners get nothing out of tax cuts or increased family payments. The day after the budget I did a calculation, and it came out at 67 per cent of families and single income earners who get nothing. This is now confirmed at 63 per cent, which is pretty close to the estimate that I provided to the parliament at that time.</para><para>If the Howard government were re-elected, it would have delivered just three tax cuts in 11 years. Labor delivered seven tax cuts in 13 years and returned to the Australian people every centâand even moreâof bracket creep. Is it any wonder that this government shows up as the highest-taxing, highest-spending government in Australia's history? Of course it is. The government has failed to respond to the challenges of the ageing of the population and faltering productivity growth. I will refer now to a paper by Saul Eslake, which says:</para><quote><para>The consensus emerging from numerous studies of the improvement in Australia's productivity performance attributes it largely to economic reforms. </para></quote><para>The footnote refers to a Productivity Commission report of 1999. The economic reforms to which the report refers are reforms introduced overwhelmingly by Labor. So Labor ensured that there was a big kick-up in productivity growth, which has created prosperity. But this government is so complacent and so tricky that, when it had an opportunity in this budget to do something to make that productivity growth continue and to ensure that the government's own forecasts do not become a reality, it squibbed the task. Instead of developing a plan for Australia, it developed a plan for an election.</para><para>The shadow minister for finance referred in his previous speech to reductions in spendingâsavingsâthat will be implemented by Labor, including in my own portfolio of workplace relations. We are committed to abolishing the Office of the Employment Advocate, because we believe that that is simply an ideological extension of the government's agenda. In respect of industrial relations matters, there have been so many claimsâmost particularly by the Minister for Small Business and Tourism, including one to the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> newspaper last nightâthat are out and out lies. I will start with the press release of 5 February where the minister for small business said of Labor's plans in relation to casual employment:</para><quote><para>Firstly, the Labor Party intends to force employers to provide additional benefits to casual employees, such as holiday and sick leave. This ignores the fact that many casual employees already receive loading to compensate for these benefits.</para><para>The ALP intends forcing its solution on the workplace, where many employees have chosen casual employment for the flexibility it offers.</para></quote><para>Time does not permit be to go through each of those points, other than to indicate that they are completely untrue. On 6 May this year the same minister said:</para><quote><para>The fact is that Labor's proposal would be compulsory.</para></quote><para>That is also untrue. He went on to talk about portable long service leave, saying that Labor will introduce a national portable long service leave scheme. He got that out of a private members' bill being considered for the ACT Legislative Assembly that did not even have the support of the ACT government. When told that by the ACT Treasurer at a breakfast, the minister came in and gave a press conference as if he had been told nothing, and so perpetrated a completely false statementâa lie. And so it goes on. The Minister for Small Business and Tourism obviously has within his office or his department a `Ministry of Truth' where George Orwell's memory lingers on very strongly.</para><para>A letter has been prepared by the member for Dobell, Mr Ken Ticehurst, dated April 2004 and addressed to local businesses, which makes such statements as Labor will: `force employers to pay long service leave to employees who have accrued that entitlement in previous jobs under different employers', a lie; `coerce small businesses to convert their casual employees to part-time permanents with all the extra costs involved', a lie; `extend the power of union officials to enter businesses, including home based businesses'âthere is no proposal to allow union officials to enter home based businessesâanother lie; `allow unlimited strikes without secret ballots', another lie. A further lie was told by the minister for small business last night to the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> newspaper.

This is the Treasurer's ninth budget in succession, and I want to pay tribute to the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance and Administration for the hard work and planning which have gone into every budget since the Howard government took over in 1996. Discipline and consistency are key traits of this government's budget. Sticking to the plan and staying focused on the ideals expressed in the election campaign of 1996 have paid off.</para></talk.start><para>Our idea was to create an economic environment in which people could be relaxed and comfortable. It was mocked, it was ridiculed and it was the antithesis of then Prime Minister Paul Keating and his Labor team. In 1996, when I first campaigned for the seat of Paterson, the electorate was moody and ready for a little stability. In my local area, the Hunter region, in 1996 the unemployment rate was 8.1 per cent. Bear in mind that at the height of the `necessary' recessionânecessary according to Laborâin June 1993 unemployment in the Hunter was at 12.6 per cent and in Newcastle was much higher. Nationally unemployment was 8.2 per cent and Labor's average over the 13 years was 8.5 per cent. In 1996 mortgage interest rates were at 10.5 per cent and Labor's average was 12.75 per cent. In 1996 inflation was at 3.7 per cent and Labor's average was 5.2 per cent.</para><para>In 1994 the then Prime Minister of Australia told small business: `This is as good as it gets.' The electorate did not believe Labor then, and they should not believe them now. `Relaxed and comfortable' were the goals, and a good economic climate helps business to plan, grow and employ more people. Workers can have faith that their jobs will be there tomorrow. They can plan for the future of their families. Today, mortgage rates are at seven per cent, and our average over the past nine years is 7.14 per cent. Today's unemployment rate is 5.6 per cent, and our nine-year average is seven per cent. As I have said previously, unemployment in my area, despite the closure of the BHP steel plant five years ago, is lower today, at 7.7 per cent, than it was 11 years ago, at 12.3 per cent. Today inflation is at two per cent and our average is two per cent.</para><para>In 2004 the Prime Minister is telling business there is more to be done. Unfair dismissal laws are holding back small business and reducing employment opportunities. The state governments have to recognise that the unfair tax regimes they preside over need reform. I will come back to that later, but I would now like to talk on government debt. Call me a historian or call me an old harpy, but I will keep referring back to 1996 to compare the state of the government's finances under Labor. It is not ancient history; it is recent history. And it is relevant history because most of the old team are still over there on the other bench. </para><para>By 1996, Labor had racked up $96 billion in government debt. This debt had to be paid off and, as many people with credit card debts will know, if you do not pay off your debts you end up paying more interest. Paying interest means you do not have money for real purchasesâin our case, services. When you reduce the interest obligation you free up money for services, and that is exactly what this government has done. Government debt has been reduced from $96 billion to $25 billion. Reducing this debt has freed up $5.6 billion dollars annually to spend on services. This is money that is much needed in electorates like mine as states neglect roads over and over again for years and years.</para><para>I will talk now on road funding. Apart from a small section of the New England Highway at Weakleys Drive, I do not have one federal road in my electorate. And if my nearest neighbour, the member for Hunter, had his way, I would not have one federal dollar spent on any roads in my electorate. The member for Hunter was quoted in the <inline font-style="italic">Newcastle Herald</inline> on Saturday, 15 May as saying that the federal government should not fund the state roads or local roads. Rather, the money should be put into the New England Highway, which is part of the national highway.</para><para>When I think about the Pacific Highway, as I said in this House earlier, Greg and Cath Campbell come to mind. Cath and Greg Campbellâwho lost their two children, Jessica and Rebecca, and Greg's mother, Barbara, in an horrific road smash earlier this yearâcame to me and said, `Fix this road.' It is the only thing I can do. Even today, I still feel a deep sadness to the point of feeling physically ill when I think about Greg and Cath Campbell and what they have been through. That is why I am relievedânot pleased but relievedâthat the federal government will spend another $93.2 million on the Pacific Highway in New South Wales in the next financial year.</para><para>Work on the Pacific Highway in my electorate includes: the completion of the Karuah bypass; the start of construction of 11 kilometres of dual carriageway between Karuah and Bulahdelah in the Great Lakes region; and duplication of 9.7 kilometres of highway south of Taree, including the overpass at Nabiac. I understand that a further announcement of work under this government's land and transport plan, AusLink, will be made by the transport minister in June. But I put the transport minister on notice: I am now fighting for money for the F3 extension and I am fighting for money for our coal rail corridor to make sure that our region does go ahead.</para><para>I was also pleased to see that in the budget the Buckets Way has received funding for the second year in a row. Over the four years, $20 million will be spent by the Commonwealth on this state regional road. At the moment, road works under way or completed include: replacing the Cromarty Creek bridge and rebuilding the approaches to Cromarty Creek; roadwork at Davies Cutting; roadwork at Wards River up to Lamans Creek in Stroud, to Dog Trap Creek and to the roads north of Stroud Road. Those are the current road works.</para><para>From 1 July this year, $6.5 million will be spent on road works near Belbora and Bakers Hill; work north of Wellard's Lane to Jacks Road intersection; work south of Gloucester; work at Lemon Grove Road; work north and south of the Booral turnoff; work on the rehabilitation of road near Stroud Road, Alderly Creek and Wards Riverâ </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>7T4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crosio, Janice, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs Crosio</name></talker><para>âMr Deputy Speaker, I draw your attention to the state of the House.</para></talk.start><para><inline font-style="italic">The bells being rungâ</inline></para></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>IK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Lloyd, Jim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Lloyd</name></talker><para>âMr Deputy Speaker, I want to alert you that the bells have just started ringing now.

When the total $20 million work is finished, this road will be a testament to the good financial management of the Howard government, which has delivered better roads in my electorate.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This road has become a personal badge of honour. I believe this road should be rebuilt to provide a safe thoroughfare for motorists to towns like Stroud and Gloucester. As more grey nomads take to the roads on holidays in their retirement, they will use this road to go to Armidale. It will open these towns up more and more to tourism.</para><para>Personally, I think it is wrong that the Carr Labor government do not co-fund this road, a road which is their responsibility. It is wrong that the state Labor MPs in the area have not spoken out once for the people in the area to get this road funded by their state Labor government. That reflects the attitude of the old Keating regime: `If it isn't in Sydney, forget it.' Premier Carr can find another $20,000 a year to buy the vote of the Deputy Speaker in the New South Wales parliament but not one cent for the Buckets Way. Another road in my electorate that is being funded under the budget is the Weakleys Drive interchange: $1 million this year, $1.5 million in the next financial year for planning and then $22.5 million in the year after that.</para><para>Now I will address aged care. The old saying `we're not getting any younger' is truer now than it has ever been. We are getting oldâall of us areâand we need more aged care and we need to keep improving the standard of care our older Australians get. My electorate is largely coastalâand it is the great Australian dream to retire to the coast and go fishing or to walk along the beach. While people are active and able to live at home when they first retire, there comes a time when they are not able to live at home without help, or they have to go into aged care facilities.</para><para>The Treasurer announced an additional 27,900 aged care places to be allocated around Australia over the next three years, including 13,030 in 2004. Labor calls it pork barrellingâbut pork-barrel away, because I am happy to get some of these aged care beds in my electorate. If getting just one of these beds means a person receives quality aged care 10 minutes from their husband or wife, or their daughter or son, then pork-barrel me, please. The government will also provide a one-off payment of $513.3 million in 2003-04 to providers, or $3,500 per resident bed to help them improve aged care home standards.</para><para>Post budget, I have been asked by retirees over the past two weeks, `What's in it for me?' There is $2,772,000 for the 792 beds in my electorate to improve the facilities they provide. Great Lakes Nursing Home at Bulahdelah, with 51 places, will receive $178,500; Hillcrest Nursing Home and Kimbarra Lodge Hostel at Gloucester, with 45 beds, will receive $157,500; Lara Aged Care facility at Dungog, with 52 places, will receive $182,000; Stroud Community Lodge, with 25 beds, will receive $87,500; Myall Lodge Hostel at Hawkes Nest, with 10 beds, will receive $35,000; Raymond Terrace Gardens Nursing Centre, with 50 beds, will receive $175,000; Salamander Bay Aged Care Facility, with 60 beds, will receive $210,000; Bill King Aged Care Facility at Fingal, with 47 places, will receive $164,500; Harbourside Haven, with 146 beds, will receive $511,000; Tanilba Bay Hostel, with 41 beds, will receive $143,500; Kularoo Gardens Centre for Aged Care at Forster, with 134 beds, will receive $469,000; Forster Tuncurry Nursing Home, with 80 beds, will receive $280,000; and GLACIA at Tuncurry, with 51 beds, will receive $178,000. That is a great investment in my electorate. Aged care is an issue. Even though we have increased the beds by nearly 50 per cent since we came in in 1996, more needs to be done. </para><para>Other national budget aged care measures which impressed me included an extra $877.8 million over four years to increase wages for aged care nursesâwe have to pay the people who care for our loved ones a wage that recognises their worth and their contributionâextra funding of $101.4 million over four years to expand education and training places for aged care workers and nurses, because we need more aged care workers not fewer; the introduction of additional payments for dementia and palliative care residents who have higher care needs; and increasing the maximum daily rate of the concessional resident supplement from $13.49 to $16.25 a day and indexing this payment. The great thing about these aged care spendings that I have just spoken about is that they are not on the back of tax increases; they are on the back of tax rebates, and they are sustainable.</para><para>Another important area for my electorate is defence. I was lucky last week to meet one of our serving defence personnel who has just come back from Iraq. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline> It is painfully obvious that the Labor Party want to silence me and not hear about what we have delivered in the electorate of Paterson. The Labor Party simply do not care about the Hunter, and that is why they have lame-duck members in the Hunter Valley. They do not want to hear about the money we have invested in RAAF Williamtownâmoney for child-care places, money to bring in the Airborne Early Warning and Control Aircraft and the $50 million to upgrade the FA18s. The Labor Party care nothing about the people of the Hunter. That is reflected by their members and the lack of contribution they make. They are a Labor opposition that do not want to spend money on the defence of Australia or on providing infrastructure for our fine serving men and women. They are a disgrace in the way they have carried on. They are a disgrace in the way they have stopped me putting to the people the things we have done for Paterson. There is more. They will not silence me. I will continue on through other avenues to explain exactly what is in this budget for the people of Paterson. All I can say is: compare what we have done. Compare how we have brought down unemployment, inflation and interest rates to the increasing taxes of the state Labor government of Bob Carr, a mate of the member for Werriwa. This will be a sign of things to come in the electorate should Labor ever take power. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>29351</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MARTIN FERGUSON</name><name.id>LS4</name.id><electorate>Batman</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak in the debate on <inline ref="R2040">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2004-2005</inline> and cognate bills. In doing so, I indicate my support for the second reading amendment moved, on behalf of the opposition, by the shadow Treasurer and member for Hotham, Mr Crean. At the outset, I would like to express the sentiments of the second reading amendment, which are clearly aimed at condemning the government for what is a very cynical, election driven budget processâa spending spree which, in essence, is about trying to buy votes in the lead-up to the forthcoming election. </para></talk.start><para>We are talking about a record spending spree of $52 billion over the forward estimates. Despite that expenditureâand this is not just the view of the opposition; many in the community have come to this conclusionâthe budget fails to deliver on crucial services for Australians. I am talking about fundamental services which we do not think are adequately catered for in the budget before us today, such as access to bulk-billing, higher education, apprenticeships and a range of other measures that we believe are fundamental to any decent society. For that reason, I contend that the Howard government's ninth budget is a clear reflection of the treatment that has been dished out to the Australian community by the Howard government since its election in March 1996.</para><para>Without any doubt, this is a big spending budget. I have been in a range of budget lock-ups over the years. I have been at every budget lock-up since I was elected in March 1996 and at a range of budget lock-ups when I served as president of the ACTU prior to entering parliament. From my point of view, this is a big spending budget; it is unprecedented in Australia's political history. The government is spending $52 billion, yet we have major outstanding issues, including the fundamental delivery of services to people in the Australian community who are crying out for assistance because of the pressure and stress that exists due to the lack of access to services at this time.</para><para>More importantly, talking about big spending and budget responsibility, when I think back on all those budgets I have examined in years gone by, it is astonishing to think that, in a mere six weeksâthe next six weeksâthe government will spend $6 billion. It is almost as if the government has to spend it to create the impression that it has been doing something for families. Yet the truth is that the families you meet in shopping centresâas I do on a regular basis in my electorate of Batmanâhave quickly come to the conclusion that not only are they being short-changed but this government is taking them for fools by thinking that, with a few incentives, it can stop families from thinking about the damage being done to their local communities by the actions of the Howard government and will change the way they cast their vote at the next election. They have quickly come to the conclusion that the budget processes of the Howard governmentâits ninth budgetâare not driven by our nation's best interests but by polls and what the government thinks, in an election year, is in the best interests of the coalition and not of the Australian community.</para><para>Let us think about what is outstanding in that huge spend by the Howard government. There are clearly some good initiatives which the Labor opposition was arguing for in the lead-up to the budget. In some instances, we were making announcementsâ which had been properly costed and fundedâfor the purpose of telling the Australian community what any decent government ought to be doing in terms of the delivery of services. I acknowledge the good initiatives that are the result of community campaigns that confronted the government and the oppositionâfor example, special assistance for those with diabetes. I also compliment the opposition on the government taking our lead on the baby care payment. And then there is the money for aged care. Anyone who goes around to aged care facilities at the moment knows that aged care is a huge issue in the Australian community not only because of the ageing of the Australian community but because of the cost of providing those services. For people working in aged care services, it is not just a job: it is part and parcel of their life. They cannot go home and forget the services they provide to our elderly people. </para><para>There is some spending in the budget that needs to be supported, but there are also areas that deserve criticism. I clearly indicate that since 1996 this governmentâand this is where the budget is lackingâhas systematically dismantled Medicare; underfunded universities, forcing them to jack up their fees; and ignored a range of other issues, such as support for regional communities and urban development.</para><para>I also believe that we have got to do more on the apprenticeship front. As you go around Australia, you find there are major skills shortages, especially in regional communities. We have got to do what we can to create additional TAFE places and to encourage our young people to think not only about university but also about the wonderful career opportunities in the traditional trades, such as the building, metal, electrical and plumbing industries. We need skilled people if we are to go forward, and those skilling opportunities are not just through universities; they are also through the TAFE sectorâand the opposition are very much committed, if we are fortunate enough to win the next election, to creating additional places in the TAFE sector.</para><para>The end result of this budget is that the Howard government has placed Australian families under increasing financial pressure, and they will not be conned by the carrots which are going to be made available in the next six weeks and which were also announced in the budget a couple of weeks ago. I will tell you whyâbecause this budget does nothing to relieve the stress in the Australian community in a range of areas. The community now accepts that this is the highest taxing government in Australia's history; so there ought to be some money to spend because, after all, it has been ripped out of taxpayers' pockets on an ongoing basis.</para><para>Whilst this government is the highest taxing government in Australian history and continually has its hands in taxpayers' pockets, it is said in the streets, in the community meetings and in the schools that the cost of visiting a GP is on an ever-increasing spiral. In my electorate I am continually finding examples of doctors moving away from bulk-billing, and ordinary people are feeling very desperate about making ends meetâhaving to put their hands in their pocket and go into debt just to go and see a GP.</para><para>We have then got the erosion of funding for schools and universities, which is in essence putting the cost more than ever onto families to educate their children, not only in primary and secondary school but also in preschool, child care and post-secondary schooling in universities and TAFEs. For pensioners and others in the community who are doing it tough, the cost of telephones is increasing continually, with no commitmentâand this is a huge criticism of Telstra at the momentâto improve service delivery. Then there is the matter of housing. Housing costs are taking up a larger part of the household budget than ever through increased mortgage payments, household debt and lack of affordable rental accommodation. There are therefore some very serious issues that we have to come to terms with as a community.</para><para>The issue is then how the government has responded to these pressuresâby spending $35 billion on a tax and family package. That could be a good package if it were properly targeted and properly spent. But a close examination of the announcements shows that the tax and family package of the Howard government in its ninth budget ignores three out of five families and singles, and the $15 billion in tax cuts benefits only one in five taxpayers. It means that anyone earning less than $52,000 per year will not see one cent in tax cuts. </para><para>When you examine the detail, you start looking at your own electorate. I looked at the tax and family packageâespecially the tax package. I found that, in my electorate of Batman, 92 per cent of workers will miss out on a tax cut. In fact, over the life of the forward estimates, these people will effectively receive a tax increase, because the budget does not even address the issue of bracket creep. I will continue to stress this issue over the ensuing months.</para><para>But, more importantly for an electorate such as mine, under this budget the disincen-tive associated with tax continues to present a barrier to hard work and effort. That is what life is about, hard work and effort, and the Australian community is actually prepared to pull its weight; but it needs government to give assistance in the areas that deserve assistance. Ninety-two per cent of my electorate miss out on a tax cut. It is not a wealthy electorate; it has many very poor communities and families. What also irks and irritates them is the fact that not only are they not getting any financial benefit out of the budget but also there is no commitment to improve services to offset this tax cut for low- and middle-income earners.</para><para>The budget, for example, makes no commitment to restore bulk-billing. It makes it harder to keep one's children at school and to send them to university. There is also no fundamental commitment to improve basic services for everyday Australians. I suppose it is about priorities, and this is what the budget debate is really about: how you best spend the hard-earned taxpayer dollars that you have ripped out of the wallets and purses of the Australian community.</para><para>When the 92 per cent of my electorate, those struggling families, who will not get a tax cut look at the budget's detail and priorities, they get irritated by the fact that, whilst they get nothing, the Howard government has allocated a staggering $109 million for government advertising. That is what I say the budget is about. It is not about what is in the best interests of the Australian community but about what the government perceives to be in the best interests of its electoral prospects. It is also interesting to note that this $109 million in advertising does not even include the cost of creating the ads, printing brochures, mail-outs and research and public relations campaigns. It is also no coincidence that such a large advertising budget has been allocated in this, an election year.</para><para>There are serious issues at stake in this budget and its potential impact on families and the nature of Australian society. The highest taxing government in the history of Australia continues to rip people off, and I think it is fair that people get something back. Not only are they not getting anything back; the services that they expect the government to provide are continually being eroded. That is also, I might say, the situation with respect to my responsibilities as a shadow minister, which I want to touch on briefly today.</para><para>The government seeks to create the impression that it cares about regional Australia. The truth is that the government's announcementsâand I have read them in detailâtranslate to funding commitments through projects and programs that are largely in the seats of The Nationals, which are regarded as being electorally difficult, and in some instances in the seats of their coalition partner, the Liberal Party, around the country. Obviously there are a few targeted funding programs, such as Regional Partnerships and Sustainable Regions, that provide a boost to regional areas. But, if we are to make a real difference in the lives of regional Australians, we need to think more broadly. We have to have regard to the fact that people in regional Australia have to have access to doctors; bulk-billing; schools, universities and TAFE colleges; telephone and Internet services of the same level as those in the metropolitan areas; and transport infrastructure that meets the needs of regional communities. </para><para>In that regard, I am lucky that I have not held my breath waiting for the announcement over the last couple of years of the AusLink national land transport plan. It has been almost two years. We have yet another promise in the budget that it will be announced on 7 June, but only yesterday we had a suggestion from the minister for roads, Senator Ian Campbell, that we might not be able to meet that deadline. The budget includes a $450 million commitment to the interstate rail track this year, and I commend the government for that investment. However, I also believe that we have a huge infrastructure backlog in Australia, something that in roads alone amounts to about $10 billion.</para><para>I am very concerned about the unwillingness by the current government as part of that national land transport plan to commit to the ongoing Commonwealth responsibility for funding improvements and maintenance of the national highway. We need a national highway system in Australia and we need different levels of government to accept their respective responsibilities. We cannot have a land transport plan which is about cherry picking projects around Australia for electoral purposes, especially when we have a government which basically uses its road and infrastructure programs not in a strategic way but for the purposes of improving its electoral prospects.</para><para>There are major concerns with the budget, not just from the opposition, whose job is to draw the community's attention to those concerns so that they are more broadly understood by the community at large. In my own electorate, 92 per cent of workers miss out on a tax cut, and that is a pretty broad criticism of the budget. We are told that some might see a small benefit from the $600 per child payment to supplement the family tax benefit announced in the budget. My office received a significant number of phone calls after the budget of a couple of Tuesdays ago. People said to my staff, `What is the benefit of that $600 when the truth is that it is already going to be eaten up by existing family debt problems?' It does not solve the problems; it is just an endeavour to buy a short-term fix to get the government over the hurdle of the next election.</para><para>Do not try those cons on the Australian community. They are a very intelligent community; they are able to see through the finer details and work out the impact on their own households. They do not see the $600 carrot as fixing their problems. They see the requirement on an ongoing basis to pay more to go and see a doctor, to educate their kids and for basic things such as a telephone line and access to the Internetâwhich are so fundamental to education in the 21st centuryâas being costs they have to pick up, despite the fact that they then have to put their hands in their pockets because the Howard government continues to be the highest taxing government in the history of Australia.</para><para>The budget is the cornerstone of the Howard government's approach to re-election. But the truth is that the budget has failed to solve the huge number of problems that confront the Australian community today. It takes us back to that fundamental commitment given by the Prime Minister in the lead-up to the 1996 election. He went all around Australia basically giving a commitment to govern for all Australians. I simply say that this budget more than ever says very starkly that the Howard government no longer governs for all Australians but, more importantly, for a minority who it believes will suit its electoral prospects in the ensuing months. </para><para>The budget also says, without doubt, that it is a government that not only will not govern for the majority of Australians but also has run out of ideas and puff. It produces election budgets, not plans for the future of Australia in the 21st century. That is what this election ought to be aboutâwhere we go over the next couple of decades. It ought to be about a real debate on health and education, how we correct the problems of infrastructure provision in Australia, access to TAFE and apprenticeships, how to attract migrants to live in regional communities and a range of other matters.</para><para>The budget speaks for itself. It is a big spending budget aimed at suiting the Prime Minister's electoral prospects and guaranteeing that in the next term he stands down and hands over the reins to the Treasurer, Mr Costello, who is unliked and unloved by the Australian community. The Australian community have given their verdict. They are intelligent people and they expect not only decent tax cuts but also a return on their tax investment in the form of proper attention by government to fundamental services such as health, education and the provision of infrastructure around Australia.

The budget delivered by the Treasurer, Peter Costello, the member for Higgins, has enabled all Australians to enjoy the dividends that flow from careful and strong economic management. It is a budget that seeks to further protect, secure and build on Australia's future by providing more help for Australia's most important building blockâour familiesâby meeting the challenges of an ageing population, by further bolstering our national security and by investing more in schools, including the establishment of a national values framework for the benefit of the next generation. </para></talk.start><para>Fundamentally, this budget continues the strategy that has produced seven budget surpluses, repaid $70 billion of Labor's $96 billion debt and brought unemployment, inflation and interest rates down to their lowest levels in a generation. However, as I stressed earlier, it does give something back to decent, hardworking Australians, who underpin our strength not only in our social fabric but also in our economic security and the overall strength of our nation. For my constituents in the electorate of Moncrieff on Queensland's Gold Coast it is a budget that I know is particularly welcome. I recognise that different Australians face many varied lots in life. For those on the Gold CoastâAustralia's sixth largest and fastest growing cityâwe face a number of challenges that are unique to our city. These challenges include, for example, the pressures of a rapidly growing population and the consequences of that growth, including the fact that the number of available university places is certainly well below the national average per 1,000 people.</para><para>This is an issue that I have spoken on many times in the past, and I am pleased that this most recent budget put into place the appropriate framework and set the parameters so that this government can provide, through the education minister's higher education package, tens of thousands of new places for our universities. In addition, through the Howard government's careful economic management, we have been able to ensure that one of the Gold Coast's greatest needsâthe establishment of a new medical schoolâwas able to be met a short while ago. </para><para>They are but two examples. In addition, the Gold Coast is a city that is heavily reliant on the tourism industry, which contributes approximately 30 per cent to our local GDP. The important factor that we as a government have recognised is the contribution that tourism makes not only to Gold Coast City but to all of Australia. Employing over 550,000 Australians, it accounts for somewhere between $17 billion and $20 billion of export earnings every year. Again, as a consequence of the Howard government's careful, strategic economic management, we have been able to pay a dividend back to the tourism industry.</para><para>Most directly, under the plans of the recently released tourism white paper, over $600 million will be ploughed into the tourism industry over the next 4Â½ years. A significant proportion of that is the $235 million of new money that will go towards the marketing of Australia abroad. Incidentally, I was very pleased to attend in Parliament House last evening the relaunch of Brand Australia. The new slogan `See Australia in a different light' will focus not only on showing to the international inbound tourist the warm, friendly people that we are but also on encouraging Australians to holiday around this nation. This is another way in which the careful economic management by the Howard government has paid dividends at a very local level to my constituents on the Gold Coast. </para><para>They are some of the specifics. In broad terms, despite the fact that we face some unique challenges in our city, we also face challenges that all Australians across this wide brown land experience. That is part of the reason I was very pleased to see such strong support for families in this budget. </para><para>As I mentioned earlier, this budget builds on the fact that we have now repaid $70 billion of Labor's $96 billion of public debt. That, in turn, has seen a reduction in interest rates, inflation and unemployment. In this particular instance, I would underscore the fact that this reduction in interest rates is perhaps one of the most profound, yet often unrecognised, points of benefit to Australians as a consequence of a strong economy. The Gold Coast, like many parts of Australia, has experienced a significant property boom in recent years. Many Gold Coasters have made their first purchase of a new home, holiday unit or unit by the beach, and these people would most certainly feel the pinch of an increase in interest rates. I know for a fact that these people would be very concerned at the election of a Labor government, which left Australia with the legacy of a 10.5 per cent general interest rate when we inherited office in 1996. But let us not forget 17 per cent interest rates, when the Labor Party so badly mismanaged the economy and all Australians paid the price. As I have said, this is an often unrecognised but very important facet. </para><para>In a very direct way, this budget has substantially increased family assistance and provided measures to help achieve the balance between work and family. There can be no doubt that there is a greater need to achieve balance in this day and age. There are so many families across Australiaâincluding on the Gold Coastâthat will benefit from the increase of $600 a year in the maximum and base rates of family tax benefit A for each dependent child. Each family receiving family tax benefit A in 2003-04 will also receive a lump sum payment of $600 per child before 30 June 2004.</para><para>Those opposite can claim that to give something back is in some way a bribe to the Australian people, but I completely disagree with that. The fundamentally important factor is the connection between the expenditure and the revenue sides of government. Most importantly, we as a government could not spend a cent if we did not raise it through taxes first. So when the opposition talks about bribes, whilst in the same sentence talking about how they would like to put record amounts of money into expenditure, I have to ask: why is it a bribe? Isn't it simply a case of returning, to the families that need it most, the kind of support that is required? Is it not simply the case that, instead of only ever taking from Australian families, we as a government are able to give something back?</para><para>The reality is that there are many other families that also benefit as a consequence of this budgetâthose on the family tax benefit B, who will benefit from a reduction in the income test withdrawal rate. Women who return to work part time will be among the biggest winners. To provide additional help to families at a crucial time, around the birth of a new child, a new maternity payment of $3,000 will be introduced from July 2004 and increased to $4,000 from July 2006 and $5,000 in July 2008. This new initiative will be nonmeans tested and paid for every newborn child. It is an important new initiative that addresses, at its core, the reality that we as a nation face an ageing population. If there can be some government assistance, some return of taxpayers' dollars to assist young families who may be having their first or second child, then that is a very positive and well-conceivedâno pun intendedâinitiative that needs to be supported. </para><para>Another measure in this budget to further help families juggling work and family responsibilities is the provision of 40,000 more outside school hours places and 4,000 more family day care places. I have had the great privilege of going to a large number of outside school hours care centres and family day care centres in my electorate of Moncrieff. I am delighted with the good work they do but I will name just one: the PCYC on the Gold Coast. It runs an excellent outside of school hours program as well as a holiday care program for young Gold Coast children. It not only teaches and instils in children the correct values but also takes some of the pressure off parents who need to continue to work outside of school hours and when their children are on school holidays. It is an important program. Again, I am pleased that this government has been able to achieve those returns to the Australian people as a consequence of solid economic growth and management.</para><para>One of the key platforms of this budget has been the substantial tax relief that has been appliedâin particular, the increase in the income tax threshold for the 42 per cent tax rate that is being raised from $52,001 to $58,001 in July 2004 and subsequently to $63,001 in July 2005. The income threshold for the 47 per cent tax rate will be raised from $62,501 to $70,001 in July 2004 and subsequently to $80,001 in July 2005. Many Australians will benefit directly as a consequence of the increases in those marginal tax rate thresholds. Many Australians have suffered from very significant personal income tax rates. I am very pleased to be part of a government that acknowledges that we should try to reduce the income tax burden on Australian families. </para><para>The Labor Party will say that if you earn more than $52,000 a year you are rich and that people who earn more than $52,000 a year do not deserve to have the increases that this government is pushing through as part of this budget. But I completely reject that notion. Australian families who have an income of $52,000 a year or more are not super wealthy. They are middle Australia. I know that on the Gold Coast, in particular in my electorate, literally thousands of families are struggling to make do on incomes like that. They are not wealthy. They may or may not send their children to private schools and they may or may not have private medical insurance, but one thing is certain: families and individuals will enjoy the benefits of good economic management through an increase in the marginal tax thresholds. I warn all families and individuals that if the Labor Party is elected they will face the risk of having those increases eroded. The Labor Party has not ruled out that it might like to get its hands on that second tranche of increased thresholds for the marginal tax rates. The Labor Party has committed itself to increasing the number ofâ <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline></para><para>I must have been getting close to the truth, because the Labor Party decided to call a quorum just when I was highlighting that the Labor Party is putting at risk the increase in the threshold rates for marginal tax. There can be no doubt that the opposition, which claims that it is about reducing the overall level of taxation while increasing expenditure but at the same time ensuring that there are bigger surpluses, really cannot provide the kind of economic framework that it suggests it canâit is just not possible. I can only assume that the Labor Party's calling a quorum during my speech in some way reinforces that point.</para><para>In the few minutes remaining, I would like to touch on one or two additional matters that have been addressed in this budget that directly affect my electorate of Moncrieff and the city of the Gold Coast. Principal among them is the significant challenge that our city faces with regard to transport needs. The reality is that the Gold Coast's significant population presents a great problem for transport infrastructureâprincipally roads. The road system on the Gold Coast is congested, clogged and suffering as a consequence of the rapid rate of growth. What this government, in particular the transport minister and the minister for roads, have done through the AusLink proposal is provide a record amount of funding to try to ease some of these problems. </para><para>I am pleased to be part of a government that is pumping $3.1 billion into road and rail infrastructure over the next four or five years. I am pleased that this Howard gov-ernment was able to provide $120 million, as well finding a path for the stubborn New South Wales and Queensland state Labor premiers, when it came to the Tugun bypass. Most importantly, I am pleased that the Howard government is providing $1.2 billion of additional expenditure to local councils across Australiaâa large proportion of which is flowing to the Gold Coast City Council to help with our very real and great needs with regard to in some way alleviating some of the congestion on our major roads throughout the city of the Gold Coast.</para><para>The final point that I would like to touch on, which is an area that I know is of great concern to many of residents in Moncrieff and those people on the Gold Coast, is the support that this government has provided to older Australians and carers. The government has committed an extra $2.2 billion over five years to expand the number of aged care places and improve the quality of care and facilities. This issue is of great concern to Gold Coasters, and I am pleased that this Howard government's careful economic management means not only more aged care places but more nurses and better aged care facilities. In addition, the government is providing $255 million for a one-off carer bonus to be paid to eligible carers in June 2004 in recognition of their role of caring for a person with a disability.</para><para>In summary, the incentives and dividends that all Australians are enjoying in this budget are a consequence of the careful economic management and strong economic growth Australia has enjoyed. It has enjoyed this because of the careful economic management of the Treasurer, and I am very pleased that the Howard government has delivered this to all Australians. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>29361</page.no><name role="metadata">Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP</name><name role="display">Mr FITZGIBBON</name><name.id>8K6</name.id><electorate>Hunter</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt should not be surprising that government members, given they have so few positive things to tell their electorates about in response to this budget, should waste so much of their time misrepresenting the Labor Party's position on taxation. I do not really see the point, because the fact is that the Australian people will know well and truly in advance of the next federal election exactly what the Labor Party's position is on these issues. So it is an interesting experience following the member for Moncrieff. It is always an even more interesting experience following the member for Paterson, who in here today in response to this budget did exactly as he does in his own electorate, which was to spend all of his time talking about state issues rather than holding himself to account for the impact on his electorate of a range of Howard government decisions over the course of the last eight years and the total lack of vision in the budget. I will return to the member for Paterson a little later if I get time.</para></talk.start><para>Most speakers making a contribution on <inline ref="R2040">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2004-2005</inline> and the cognate bills in their response to the budget have focused their comments on the income tax and family benefits arrangements announced in John Howard's ninth budget. I want to focus on two other important aspectsâor, more to the point, two aspects that were again missing in this year's budget. Those aspects are leadership and vision. But, before I turn to those points, I want to associate myself with the comments of those members of this House who have expressed their outrage that so many Australian families and individuals were denied any tax relief in this year's budget. I also want to say how thoroughly unsurprised I am that the so-called goodies in the budget were directed to the demographic where the government is likely to get maximum political dividend. However, scratching their heads are all those residents in my electorate who get no tax relief or additional family benefits in the budget. </para><para>Residents in my electorate are disappointed about many things. They are disappointed by the government's restructuring of Medicareâthe government's determination to transform it from a universal system to a two-tiered system. They are disappointed that no hope was given to those who are desperate to have their teeth fixed but cannot get assistance. They are disappointed that, slowly but surely, our education system is going back to the dark old days when quality and higher education were reserved for those with the ability to pay. They are wondering when the Howard government will finally wake up to the fact that long-term and high levels of youth unemployment will be with us until the government faces up to and deals with the structural issues which drive it. Those issues include structural adjustment in regional areas, skills shortages and skills gaps. They are very prominent issues in my electorate, but they are areas in which the Howard government is unprepared to act.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>0K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Kerry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Bartlett</name></talker><para>âWhat about unfair dismissal laws?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP</name><name role="display">Mr FITZGIBBON</name></talker><para>âI am happy to take the interjection on unfair dismissal laws. Whenever the government is in trouble it rolls out the old unfair dismissal laws for small business. Those of us who have worked in small business instead of, for example, spending our careers in the teaching profession know that this is a 10th order issue for small business. Forget about the numbers that the government makes up from time to time. It is a 10th order issue. Once a society, through its legislature, comes to a conclusion about what represents a fair and unfair dismissal, surely it should apply those principles equally to people, whether they have 18 work colleagues or, say, 30 work colleagues. This is a red herring. It is something that the government rolls out every time the polls are going badly for it.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Also amongst the disappointments for my constituents in the budget were road funding issues. I heard the member for Paterson talking about them. He picked up on the point that I think I made on local radio: once again the national highway project, in particular, the New England Highway in my electorate, has been dudded because the Howard government continues to skim off money for the very road network it does have responsibility forâthat is, the national highwayâto fund other projects which are state responsibilities, because that is where it believes it gets the best bang for its buck. The Pacific Highway is just one example.</para><para>I do not begrudge the Pacific Highway additional fundingânot by any meansâbut I do believe that the Commonwealth government should be focusing most on the area over which it has direct responsibility, and that is the national highway. These RONIs, as they are calledâRoads of National Importanceâare just a political stunt: a means of redirecting money into projects where the government gets the best bang for its buck. For example, in my electorate, the so-called Kurri Kurri Corridorâthe all-important economic road link between the F3 freeway and the New England Highway north of Branxton, which is a $320 million projectâgot just $4 million in this year's budget and in the out years received nil. This is a project that has now been in the pipeline for more than 10 years, and not a sod of soil has been turned to commence the project. </para><para>The Muswellbrook bypass is another critical part of the national highway networkâand I remind you again, Mr Deputy Speaker Hawker, that these RONIs are not part of the national highway network. The Muswellbrook bypass, a critical part of the national highway network and a project critical to the safety and amenity of Muswellbrook residents, received $0 in this year's budget. It is a $50 million project. How many years will the residents of Muswellbrook have to wait, at the rate at which that project is receiving funding?</para><para>The member for Paterson mentioned Weakleys Drive, another very important project on the national highway. I went there with Laurie Brereton when he was roads minister in 1995 and he announced that projectâI think it was then some $33 million. There is still not a sod of soil turned. Why? Because the Howard government was elected in 1996. They cut the funding to the national highway project. They have since been skimming money off to Roads of National Importance projects, and there is still not a sod of soil turned on the Weakleys Drive intersectionâthe point at which Weakleys Drive meets the New England Highway. Yet the member for Paterson is in here asking constituents in that local area to be thankful that in this year's budget we got not $30 million but $1.5 million, and thankfully next year we get another $20 million. In other words, after all of this time, the project will hopefully reach completion in the foreseeable future. But all those residents who commute every day from Maitland and beyond, further up the Upper Hunter to Newcastle, will be waiting at those traffic lights in queues kilometres long for at least two years and probably longer, depending on the period of the construction phase.</para><para>The other big infrastructure project in the electorate that is so importantâand some people see it as a sporting facilityâis Energy Australia Stadium in Newcastle, the home of the champion Newcastle Knights. It is not just a sporting field; it is a driver of the local economy. A couple of years ago, the Carr Labor government acknowledged and recognised this. In doing so, they looked at a University of Newcastle report which demonstrated that the stadium is far more than a sporting facility; it is an engine for economic growth in the Hunter. In recognising that, they gave a significant amount of moneyâabout $23 million initially and I think a little bit more later. Since then, the Newcastle Knights and all those who have a vision for using Energy Australia Stadium for other sportsâfor example, rugby union; we had the opportunity to have a rugby game in Newcastle during the Rugby World Cup, but of course the stadium was not up to standardâare begging the Commonwealth to match or at least make a contribution to Bob Carr's commitment to Energy Australia Stadium. But alas, they were disappointed again in this year's budget.</para><para>Returning to the subject of roads, having identified all those points upon the national highway network, along the New England Highway, for which the Commonwealth has responsibility, I should say that we do hold out some hope. Hope springs eternal, and we are hoping that, as a crucial part of the national highway network, the New England Highway will receive some funding on 7 June when John Anderson, the Deputy Prime Minister, announces his AusLink project. Not only are we hopeful, we expect it, because how can you have a commitment to a national transport vision without finishing the national highway project? You cannot possibly claim that the national highway project is complete while ever you have big bottlenecks and dangerous sections, as we do right throughout the New England Highway, throughout the Upper Hunter. You cannot claim the vision and the completion of that project unless you address these matters. So we look forward to that being done within the AusLink project in the not too distant future. </para><para>I want to return to my original pointâthat is, the lack of leadership and vision. These are the things we do not see in Commonwealth budgets anymore. We got the <inline font-style="italic">Intergenerational Report</inline>, which told us what we already knew, but we had no real action taken in response. We never hear the government talking about nation building, the very things that will address structural unemployment, for example. We never see any leadership amongst the states. We see bickering between the Commonwealth and the states these days, because there is no leadership at the Commonwealth level.</para><para>It surprises me that the government has not been prepared to pick up the ball where the Keating government left it and to run with it. No-one can deny the success of the reforms of the Hawke and Keating years. I am very pleased to have finally heard even the Prime Minister, in a more candid moment, acknowledging that fact. But one of the things that does surprise me is that the Howard government just seems to have dropped the vision and leadership ball. There is no other area in which that is more apparent than in my own area of responsibility, in particular in mining.</para><para>This is the Prime Minister's approach to energy in this country: committee after committee, task force after task force, which result in nothing, and the occasional announcement of a big contract somewhereâthe late arrival of the Prime Minister to announce a big gas project, for example. I saw on the front page of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> yesterday that he is going to meet Arnold Schwarzenegger. Obviously he has worked out that photo opportunities with George W. Bush at this point in the political cycle, with the deterioration in the situation in Iraq, are going to provide very little political dividend if indeed they do not produce negative responses for him.</para><para>The Prime Minister is going to go to California on his trip and he is going to have his photo taken with Arnold Schwarzenegger. This is going to be the photo shoot of the trip. But why is he going to California? He says he is going there to deliver another big gas contract for Australia into the west coast of the United Statesâone of the biggest markets in the world. My advice to the Prime Minister is to first of all stay out of it, because the last time the Prime Minister got himself involved in negotiations for the export of LNG to another country all he did was drive the price down. All he did was undermine Australia's export opportunities. The fact is that the quality of our resource, our geographic location and our lack of sovereign risk made Australia odds-on to secure an LNG contract into China. We did not need the Prime Minister in Beijing talking the price down, and we do not need the Prime Minister backing winners on what would inevitably be a monopolistic receival terminal in California. The market will sort it out.</para><para>But the big thing the Prime Minister has not shared with us is this: where is the gas coming from? He says he is going to see Arnold Schwarzenegger to convince him to back BHP's plansâhe is picking winners again, which is the thing he does worstâand build a receival terminal. Then he is going to come back to Australia and say, `I have done it again. The man of steel has done it againâI have secured a $20 billion LNG contract with the United States of America.' I call upon the Prime Minister to give us a little bit more detail on that and to tell us where the gas is coming from. We know it is not coming from the North West Shelf venture, because most of the gas in that project is committed. We know it is not coming from the Timor Sea. So do we assume it is coming from the Gorgon field? Or is it coming from the Scarborough field? It is the Scarborough field in which BHP has some equity. It does not have any equity in the Gorgon project. </para><para>So where is the gas coming from? These are the questions the Prime Minister needs to answer. Scarborough is a long way offâno-one is even talking about developing Scarborough. If he is talking about taking gas from the Gorgon field, I want to know whether this is partly about giving BHP leverage to get equity into the Gorgon fieldânot that there is necessarily anything wrong with that, but we want to see the cards on the table. We do not just want the Prime Minister going to the west coast of the United States, standing next to Arnold Schwarzenegger and duping the Australian electorate into believing that because he is there talking about a monopoly facility and picking a winner off the west coast of Australia that is automatically going to deliver a big gas contract for Australia. Of course, it is not, and these things need to be explained. We want more than a front pager in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian </inline>announcing that yet another big deal is imminent.</para><para>We had one of those announcements with respect to the Gorgon field and China late last year but, of course, nothing is concreteânot even close to it. I suggest to the Prime Minister that he stay out of international negotiationâan area in which he has got only very poor formâand start talking instead about his plan for a domestic national energy policy. Let us hear the Prime Minister talk about our own medium- to long-term needs. Instead of him just talking about exports, let us hear the Prime Minister start asking questions about our own medium- to long-term needs so that when we are assessing what is in the Australian interests in terms of exports and the price at which we might be selling those goods we know what is in Australia's long-term interests in terms of our own domestic needs.</para><para>What will inevitably happen is that the companies will come back to the Australian community in 10 years time when we are really ready to talk seriously about weaning ourselves off imported oilâand we are seeing the consequences of that at the momentâand talk about shifting to gas in particular. The companies will be telling us, `That is fine, but you are going to have to pay a heavy price because all the easier to win, lower extraction cost gas is gone and the Australian consumer is going to have to pay the consequences.' That is fineâlet us talk about these export contracts. They are a good thing for Australia and we all support them, but let us have more from the Prime Minister in terms of energy policy than a photo shoot with Arnold Schwarzenegger. If he wants to talk about a $20 billion contract into the west coast of the United States, we want to know now how he intends to deliver it. We want to know how he is going to transform that into a real benefit for all Australians.</para><para>This is just one facet of energy policy. What about our local electricity and gas networks? The reforms of the Keating era, as I suggested, are overwhelmingly supported. All the gains from those reforms, particularly in the utilities sector, where we had publicly owned vertically integrated monopolies, are well recorded and well recognised. But what about ongoing reform? It is a process that has stalled since March 1996. There is so much unfinished business there and in a sense the government have now acknowledged that by commissioning the Parer report, which has identified a whole range of deficiencies in our energy marketsâin the electricity and gas markets, which are marked most by over-regulation and duplication of regulation. They have acknowledged it by commissioning a report which has given us a whole range of recommendations in relation to both electricity and gas, but there has been no response. There has not been one page of a response to the Parer report. When will the government get serious about picking up the reform ball again? </para><para>On another energy matterâpetrol pricesâwhen will it get serious and take more than a spectator's approach to the changing dynamic in our retail petrol market? With oil prices going through $US40 a barrel, it becomes even more critical, firstly, in terms of weaning us off oil-based fuels and, secondly, in terms of reigning in the market power of the major oil companies which dominate the retail market. There is a range of things which can be done which become particularly important in the face of the emerging duopoly in the retail market. The two key things that can be done are: strengthening section 46 of the Trade Practices Act, specifically outlawing predatory pricing; and opening up the terminals to independent players to enhance competition in the market. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>29366</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Kerry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BARTLETT</name><name.id>0K6</name.id><electorate>Macquarie</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAny budget involves finding the right balance between meeting the expenditure needs in a range of essential services, supporting those in need, minimising the pressure on taxpayers and exercising responsible fiscal management. Clearly this budget does all those things and continues this government's proven record of achieving that balance. In the limited time available I would like to briefly expand on each of those areas. The budget addresses a number of priority areas of need, allocating increased or new funding to a number of areas. Time prevents an exhaustive or detailed discussion, but a summary of the main areas might be helpful.</para></talk.start><para>Firstly, this budget allocates $41 billion to health over the next year, including $2.85 billion for the government's program to strengthen and protect Medicare, and introduces a new safety netâan extra level of protection that was never there under Labor. Funding of $41 billion for health next year doubles the amount provided under Labor in 1996. The fact is that this government is delivering record spending on medical services, medical research and immunisation. Record levels of immunisation were reached. There is funding for a whole range of new programs. The federal government is providing record assistance to the state governments to help them with their public hospitals, which, I have to say, they cannot seem to manage in New South Wales anyway. Overall there has been a doubling of health spending. We hear the rhetoric from the other side, but this government is delivering double the spending on health that the last Labor government managed to spend.</para><para>Secondly, the budget provides $17 billion on education for next yearâup by 5.4 per cent from this year. For schools there is $7.6 billion, supporting both government and non-government schools, as we need to. The point worth making is that we hear a lot about the controversy of funding for state schools. This budget brings the increase in direct funding by this government for state public schools up to 68.7 per cent over the last eight years. That is, this government has directly increased funding for state public schools by almost 69 per cent since it has been in officeâfar faster than the commitment of state governments, which have prime responsibility for state schools. </para><para>Another feature of this budget in the area of education is the commitment of $18 million for a medical school for the University of Western Sydneyâan announcement greeted very positively by my community and which will bring strong education benefits and strong health benefits to the people of Western Sydney, the Hawkesbury and the Blue Mountains. I am delighted that the government has responded to this need in our part of Sydney.</para><para>Thirdly, there is strongly increased spending by this government in the area of aged care. In fact, there is an extra $2.2 billion in funding over the next four years, including extra capital funding. Some of that is an immediate injection: $513 million extra before the end of this financial year. That is an immediate injection which, for nursing homes and hostels in my electorate, in the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury, will mean an extra $3.8 million within the next six weeks. In addition to that there will be another $438.6 million in capital funding over the next five years, extra recurrent funding, and an extra 27,900 residential and community aged care places over the next three years.</para><para>It is worth pointing out that since the coalition has been in government we have increased the number of aged care places by 55,600, substantially making up the terrible shortfall left by Labor's neglect when they left office. Another 27,900 places will be provided over the next three years. In all, by next year spending on aged care will have doubled from $3 billion in 1996âit is already $6 billion this yearâto $6.7 billion next year. So we are already spending double the amount that Labor was spending on aged care when they were in office. As well as that, we have put in extra effort to improve accreditation and standards for aged care facilities right across this country.</para><para>There is increased funding for veterans. The provision of an extra $604 million over the next four years was announced in this budget, bringing total expenditure for veterans to $10.6 billion by next yearâup from $6.5 billion under Labor. Specifically, we have more than doubled spending on veterans health care, from $1.8 billion in 1996 to $4.4 billion under this budget. There is a raft of other new initiatives, programs and services for our veteran community that Labor never even thought of spending and could not deliver.</para><para>There has been further spending in other areas, including enhancement of Australia's defence and security. There is an extra $755 million for security and intelligence capability, which is so necessary in this very fragile, volatile and insecure world. There is an extra $1.5 billion for defence over the next five years, bringing the total increase in defence spending under this government to $39.7 billion. The prime responsibility of any government is to do whatever it can to ensure the security of its people. That is a responsibility that this coalition government has taken very seriously and it has committed the funding to deliver on that.</para><para>I could talk about many other areas in this budget. There is a commitment of $5.3 billion for science and innovation and an extra $1.1 billion for Australian land transport under AusLink, in addition to the $2 billion announced earlier this year. There will be an extra $461 million over the next four years for carers of people with disabilities, including an immediate bonus of $1,000 for carer payment recipients and $600 for carer allowance recipients.</para><para>There will be an extra 44,000 child-care places, particularly for the much-needed out-of-school-hours service for school-age children. There will be an extra $400 million for the environment, bringing the amount to a record $2.4 billion next yearâwell above, far above, what we ever saw under Labor. We get the empty rhetoric from the other side again about the environment, but this government has been delivering, and continues to deliver, record levels of funding for the environment. I could go on and on about the increased spending measures in the budget. </para><para>The second area that I want to mention is the measures aimed at reducing the financial pressure on taxpayers and families. The budget delivers these in two ways: firstly, through reduced income taxes and, secondly, through increased family payments. With income tax cuts, we see a third stage in the reduction of income tax levels delivered by this government. You will remember, Mr Deputy Speaker Hawker, that in the year 2000, as part of the new tax system, we delivered massive income tax cuts. We cut income taxes by $12 billion. Then, in last year's budget, we reduced income taxes again by another $2.4 billion. And in this budget, over the next four years there will be a further reduction in income taxes of $14.7 billion. We hear the criticism from the other side, we see the crocodile tears, but we have delivered far better income tax cuts than the opposition has ever been able to.</para><para>These income tax cuts significantly and importantly will reduce the disincentives faced by middle-income earnersâthose who are just about to go into the 42 per cent tax bracket. For instance, someone who is currently on average weekly earnings and who does a bit of extra overtime or gets a pay rise would be pushed into the 42 per cent tax bracket. These tax cuts are aimed at reducing those disincentives at that middle-income level, so it will involve raising the threshold at which the 42 per cent cuts in: from the current level to $58,000 from 1 July and then to $63,000 next year. For the higher tax level of 47 per cent, the threshold will be raised from the current level to $70,000 from 1 July and then to $80,000 next year.</para><para>These changes in the thresholds will ensure that, even with predicted income and pay rises next year, 80 per cent of taxpayers will remain in the 30 per cent tax bracket or less. It is worth pointing out again that these are part of this government's ongoing tax reform, part of this government's ongoing efforts to reduce income taxes. If you look back over the last four years and include this package, low-income earnersâthose on $20,000 or lessâwill have had a 23 per cent reduction in income tax. Income earners on $50,000 will have had a 21 per cent reduction in their income tax levels and higher income earners a reduction of 18 per cent.</para><para>These tax cuts are under threat under Labor. Remember that, in the year 2000, Labor opposed measures to bring tax relief to middle-income earners. Labor has already ignored the challenge of guaranteeing that the second tranche of these income tax cuts will be delivered. In fact, they have refused to guarantee that those income tax cuts will be delivered. The point is that Labor's record and Labor's refusal to give an unequivocal guarantee make it quite clear that the second tranche of these tax cuts will be seriously under threat, and will probably be jeopardised the same way that the promised l-a-w tax cuts were, should we have a Labor government.</para><para>The other area of relief for families is the massive increase in family tax benefits announced in this budgetâbenefits totalling $19.2 billion over the next five years. It is worth noting that these family tax benefit improvements come on top of increases in previous years by the coalition aimed at improving the financial position for our families. They are measures that have helped families to juggle the joint responsibilities of work and parenting. They are measures that have significantly improved living standards for families around Australia. The two parts to this packageâfamily tax benefit part A and family tax benefit part Bâwill deliver in total an extra $600 each year for many families. The more relaxed withdrawal rates will mean that the effective marginal tax rates for those parents working part-time and re-entering the workforce will be reduced to take the pressure off these families. So the combined effect of the tax cuts and increased family tax benefit means that almost all families will be substantially better off. </para><para>I will give you two simple examples. A single income family earning $45,000 with two young childrenâone under fiveâwill be $48.55 a week better off just through the tax cuts and family benefit. If they take up the option of the superannuation co-contribution they will be better off by even more than thatâby $61.05 a week. Another example is a dual-income family with a total income of $65,000, split 67 per cent to 33 per centâa two to one split. With three childrenâone under fiveâthat family would be $39.84 a week better off. If they took the offer of the government's superannuation co-contribution they would be $53.73 a week better off.</para><para>Many families around this country will be $30, $40 or $50 a week better off because of this budget. And what do we have the opposition doing? They are scratching around trying to find some sort of negativeâtrying to put a negative spin on itâinstead of supporting and praising these measures that will improve life for our families. Families across Australiaâfamilies in my electorate of Macquarie, the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesburyâare delighted with these improvements. But, again, these improvements cannot be guaranteed under Labor. The shadow finance spokesman refused to guarantee the family tax benefits and the tax cuts beyond 2004-05. These benefitsâthese tax cuts and increased family paymentsâare under serious threat under Labor.</para><para>This budget has provided massive increases in funding for essential services and infrastructure. It has increased funding and reduced taxes dramatically to take the financial pressure off families. The third thing it has done is continue this government's record of sound and responsible fiscal management. It is to this that I want to turn in the remaining five minutes of my speech.</para><para>This budget delivers another surplus, the seventh in a row under this governmentâa surplus of $2.4 billion, which will again go to reducing the legacy of debt left under Labor. That debt, which in 1996 when Labor left office was $96 billionâor 19 per cent of GDPâhas been reduced, by this government's careful responsible approach, to $25 billion, which is only three per cent of GDP. We have repaid over $70 billion of Labor's debt. Compare the fact that we have delivered surpluses for seven years in a row with the deficit after deficit that Labor delivered in their last five years. And these were not small deficits; they were deficits which, in five years, totalled $68 billion. These deficits averaged almost $14 billion a year for their last five years.</para><para>And that is on top of all the asset sales that we had. Just remember that, in those last five years of Labor, they not only ran up those massive deficits but sold almost everything that was not nailed down: Qantas, the Commonwealth Bank, the Commonwealth Serum Laboratoriesâa long list. Yet, in spite of selling all those assets, they still ran up deficits averaging almost $14 billion a year. This matters because it means that, as we have repaid roughly three-quarters of that, we have reduced substantially the annual interest servicing costsâthat is, instead of $8 billion a year of taxpayers' money merely going down the drain to service Labor's debt, as it was in 1996, now less than $3 billion is required to service government debt. This means over $5 billion extra a year going into health, education, essential services, infrastructure and reducing tax pressures. Responsible, sound economic management delivers benefits to all Australians. </para><para>There are many other dividendsâmany other benefitsâfrom this sound, responsible approach to management. The strong economic growth that we have had, despite trouble all around the world, has enabled the country to generate some 1.3 million jobs and reduce unemployment from the average of 8.5 per cent that we saw during Labor's 13 years to 5.6 per cent. Inflation, which averaged 5.2 per cent under Labor, is now down to two per cent. Home loan interest rates averaged 12.75 per cent for 13 years of Labor. It was not just one year of high interest rates; they averaged 12.75 per cent for 13 long, miserable years. Yet interest rates now, because of this government's responsible management, are down to just over seven per cent. </para><para>Home owners in my electorate are delighted by the reduction in their interest payments. They are terribly afraid of what will happen to interest rates if Labor is returned to office. In my electorate, someone paying off a mortgage on a loan of $200,000 is saving $575 a month, tax free, on what they would have been paying when Labor left office in 1996, when interest rates were 10.5 per cent. The important point is that these results are not an accident; they are not just a fluke. They happened because of careful, sound, responsible economic management.</para><para>These things are under jeopardy if Labor are returned. Look at their record. Basically every Labor government in memory has been an economic vandal. Look at the legendary financial incompetence of the Whitlam government. Look at the $97 billion debt left by the last Labor government. Look at the recession they said we had to have. Look at the massive 17Â½ per cent interest rates they gave us. Look at the sheer incompetence of the New South Wales state Labor government that cannot deliver adequate services in hospitals, schools, infrastructure or law and order.</para><para>Look at the unfunded promises we are already hearing from the Labor Party. Look at their refusal to rule out tax rises. Look at their commitment already to a new national payroll tax across the country. Look at their commitment to slug mining companies an extra $500 million a year. There is a real threat if Labor are elected. The economic security of this country and the wellbeing of Australians have been enhanced through the sound fiscal management of this government and would be seriously jeopardised under the economic vandalism of Labor. This budget has delivered, and continues to deliver, on extra services, tax cuts, support for families and responsible fiscal management in each of these areas. It stands in clear contrast to Labor's record.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>29370</page.no><name role="metadata">Danby, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DANBY</name><name.id>WF6</name.id><electorate>Melbourne Ports</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak on <inline ref="R2040">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2004-2005</inline>, the ninth and last budget of the Howard-Costello government. This budget is, as the Leader of the Opposition said in his speech in response to the budget, a political patch-up job, a short-term fix for the next election. As such, it will serve as a suitable epitaph for a cynical and destructive government which has done much to damage Australia's social fabric. This government has no plan for Australia's future beyond polling day. It hopes to repeat the trick it pulled at the 2001 election, throwing massive bribes at sections of the electorate thought to be in danger of defecting to the opposition. In 2001, it was self-funded retirees and people in regional areas. This time it is young families with children, servicing high mortgages, particularly in the western suburbs of Sydney. </para></talk.start><para>As I said in an article in the <inline font-style="italic">New Observer </inline>magazine predicting that Mr Howard would do this, the Prime Minister obviously keeps a picture of Jeff Kennett on his desk to remind him of correct election strategy as far as spending public money is concerned. But, as the Leader of the Opposition also said, the government always spends up big before elections. Then, as certain as night follows day, it claws money back in the years that follow through higher taxes and family debts, higher Telstra line charges and user-pays in education and health. </para><para>In considering the political strategy behind this budget, I am reminded of a comment by the Prime Minister's friend the President of the United States, George W. Bush. Paraphrasing Abraham Lincoln, he said at a dinner: `You can fool some of the people all of the timeâand those are the ones you have to concentrate on.' I think President Bush was joking, but the Prime Minister and the Treasurer seem actually to have taken him literally. They seem to think that they can once again bribe and bluster through an election campaign with the usual rhetoric about how only the coalition can be trusted with Australia's financesâas we heard from the last speakerâregardless of the fact that it was the Hawke-Keating governments that integrated us with the international economy. Perhaps the current government have forgotten how Abraham Lincoln's famous line ends: `You can't fool all of the people all of the time.'</para><para>The Prime Minister and the Treasurer bribed, bluffed and bullied their way back into office in 2001, but they will find it a much harder trick to pull off again. The Australian people have seen over the past three years the truth of the Leader of the Opposition's words that, with the Howard government:</para><quote><para>It gives and then it takes, but it never lasts. It never lasts with the Howard government.</para></quote><para>Yesterday I listened to the excellent budget debate speech given by the honourable member for Braddon, who represents a regional seat with large numbers of low- to middle-income families with childrenâexactly the kinds of families that the Treasurer claims will benefit from his budget. The member for Braddon showed clearly how hollow that claim was, and it is one of the reasons I am sure he will be re-elected.</para><para>Melbourne Ports is a different electorate. In terms of weekly family income it is the 10th wealthiest electorate in Australia. It is the second wealthiest electorate represented by a Labor member. On this side of the House only the honourable member for Sydney's constituents have a higher per capita income. Both the honourable member for Sydney and I represent large numbers of people who work in growth industries such as the media, arts, tourism, medical and scientific research, information technology and higher education. These overall statistics conceal a great deal of social reality in my electorate. As I said in my first speech to this House, Melbourne Ports is an area where some people are looking for their next million while others are looking for their next meal. It has many high-income people. It also has many people with very difficult economic circumstances, many people who depend on government support, many lone parents struggling to bring up children, many elderly people living on their own and a distressingly large number of people who are homeless, who have drug and alcohol problems or who suffer from mental illness.</para><para>Just around the corner from my electoral office in Fitzroy Street, St Kilda, are the facilities of the Salvation Army and the Sacred Heart Mission, who provide services for so many of these people, mostly on a voluntary basis. They have been put under increasing pressure year by year by this government ignoring these kinds of problems. Every day they provide meals for hundreds of people. My electorate staff do their best to help many of the people with these social and economic problems. One of the major problems facing people in Melbourne Ports is that they have to deal with the administration of Centrelink. The staff at the South Melbourne and Windsor Centrelink offices do their best but are overworked and underpaid. The system is deliberately structured to make it as difficult as possible for people to gain access to the benefits they are entitled to. The system also leads to people running up huge debts through no fault of their own, and without any warning, which they are then often required to repay. The welfare agencies and my office have to pick up the pieces afterwards. </para><para>When I look at the budget to see what relief the large number of struggling people in my electorate can hope to obtain from this government, I am disappointed, though not surprised, to find that it is very little. There is nothing to encourage bulk-bulling by doctors and thus relieve the pressure on low-income families to meet out-of-pocket medical expenses. There are no commitments to undo this government's disgraceful decision in 1996 to abolish the Keating government's dental scheme. As the honourable member for Lalor has repeatedly pointed out, there is no funding for vaccinating children against deadly pneumococcal disease.</para><para>Medicare is one of the great achievements of the Hawke Labor government. We all know the current Prime Minister opposed Medicare as a matter of principle from the moment of its birth, just as he opposed its predecessor, the Whitlam government's Medibank. He was Treasurer in the Fraser government, which dismantled Medibank. But now that Medicare is so widely supported by the Australian community, the Prime Minister knows he dare not move against it openly. Instead, the government has a policy of strangling Medicare by stealth. People in my electorate, no matter what their income level, support Medicare and oppose this government's insidious campaign to undermine it. There is nothing in this budget to change their minds on this matter.</para><para>Instead of taking steps to restore bulk-billing and Labor's dental health scheme, this government is wasting $20 million on another dishonest television campaign to persuade voters that it is doing something to fix up Medicare. As the honourable member for Lalor has pointed out, that money could have paid for 800,000 bulk-billed consultations. Does the government seriously think people in my electorate will be fooled by this publicity stunt? No amount of advertising can cover up the fact that, under the Howard government, Medicare is bleeding to death.</para><para>One of the distinctive features of my electorate is the very high number of tertiary students. More than 10 per cent of the residents of Melbourne Ports are students. I have two fine campuses in my electorate: the Caulfield campus of Monash University and the Victorian College of the Arts, where I recently attended a very splendid arts graduation. Many students at other universitiesâMelbourne, Monash and RMITâlive in my electorate. Every week I get letters and emails from tertiary students and their families about the increased burden of debt that they are being forced to take on as a result of the sharp increases in HECS fees. As we know, HECS fees will rise again at most universities next yearâin most cases by the full 25 per cent which the Minister for Education, Science and Training is now permitting. This means that from next year students will be paying as much as $15,000 for an arts degree, $20,000 for a science degree and $40,000 for a law degree. They will be graduating with huge levels of debt, making it much harder to buy a home or start a family. If the government is concerned about the reasons for Australia's declining birthrate, it might start by looking at the consequences of some of its own policies. </para><para>Even worse is the fact that this budget does nothing about the crisis facing the families of the many well-qualified studentsâincluding graduates of the government, Catholic and Jewish schools in my electorateâwho cannot get a place in an Australian university. This year 20,000 qualified applicants missed out on a place. Those places are going instead to students who are not necessarily as well qualified as those who are currently missing out but who can afford to pay full feesâfees as high as $150,000. Qualified Australian students deserve a fully funded HECS place at university. Labor's policy is to abolish this government's regressive policy, to make an additional 20,000 places available and to reverse the 25 per cent hike in HECS. This is a policy that many students and parents in my electorate will certainly welcome.</para><para>The coalition intends campaigning again as the only party which can be trusted with Australia's defences. The budget allocates a total of more than $18 billion for defence for the 2004-05 year, yet everyone connected with the ADF knows how overstretched and underresourced the ADF is as a result of the commitments in Iraq, East Timor and the Solomons. It would seem an elementary proposition that if the government commits defence forces to military operations it must fund them appropriately. The government owes a duty not only to the taxpayer but also to the personnel of the ADF for putting their lives on the line, usually at the cost of great disruption to their families.</para><para>Last week we learned from a new report from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute that the government is funding the ADF on the cheap, depriving our defence forces of necessary new equipment so that the funds originally earmarked for that can be diverted to paying for current operationsâmost notably last year's commitment of forces to Iraq. This may be because the government wants to conceal from the Australian people the real cost of that commitment and the extent to which it was diverting defence resources from other parts of the defence budget.</para><para>We learned that the Howard government has delayed over $2.2 billion worth of defence capital projects since the defence white paper of 2000. These projects have been deferred until 2008-09 at the earliest. The funds have been diverted to meet increased ADF personnel costs, which have risen by nearly $740 million over the last year. Everyone understands why those costs have risen. It is because the ADF is heavily committed to overseas operations. Governments can make these commitments but, once they are undertaken, they have to make sufficient outlays to pay for the extra personnel costs. What the government is doing is shifting funds from capital purchases to personnel costs.</para><para>As the shadow minister for defence, Senator Evans, pointed out last week, none of the top 20 defence projects that were in the planning stage at the time the Howard government came to office have yet been delivered. Four have been cancelled and the rest have been pushed back into the indefinite future. Defence technology is extremely expensive and also has long lead times between when it is ordered and when it becomes available for operations, so delays currently being imposed by the Howard government on meeting the ADF's capital equipment needs mean the ability of our defence forces to respond to crises in our own region will be set back for years ahead. As important capital assets such as the F111s head for retirement, the ADF's operational capacity may be seriously jeopardised by the Howard government's short-sighted cost shifting. </para><para>I would like to comment on another element of this budget, and that is the foreign aid budget. On this aspect of the budget, one well-informed commentator said: </para><quote><para>Despite having economic growth in excess of 3.5% and a very healthy economy, our aid as a proportion of GNP still languishes around 0.26%, well below the internationally agreed benchmark of 0.7%.</para></quote><para>	...	...	...</para><quote><para>The US have increased foreign aid by one third in the last two years.</para></quote><para>And I might say that that increase is largely in the area of assistance with opposing the AIDS pandemic in Africaâa move of the Bush government that is little noticed but would have much wider support than their commitment in Iraq. The person who made that comment continued:</para><quote><para>The least we could have done in such economic prosperity is match that commitment.</para></quote><para>That comment was made by that other Costello, Tim Costello, the Treasurer's brother. As we sit here, a new humanitarian crisis is unfolding. It is one which will place demands on our foreign aid budget. In the Darfur province of Sudan, Arab militias backed by an Islamist military regime are engaging in a campaign of ethnic cleansing against the African population of that country. Aid agencies accuse the Sudanese government of launching aerial attacks against defenceless villagers and committing serious human rights violations, including mass killing, looting and rape. Already hundreds of thousands of people have fled from their homes and tens of thousands have been killed. According to the UN, the refugees are being systematically starved in what amounts to a campaign of ethnic cleansing. Up to 300,000 people are in immediate danger of death.</para><para>So far, I have not heard a word from the Minister for Foreign Affairs about what is going on in Sudan or what this government intends to do about it. I am pleased to hear from the honourable member for Hindmarsh that the government has now committed $5 million to emergency relief in Sudan. I cannot help but think of the $109 million which, as Senator Faulkner was able to discover at Senate estimates this week, the government intends to spend on bogus advertising campaigns to secure its re-election. As that other Costello identified, some of that money would at least make a contribution to helping those people who are facing genocide in Sudan. When we remember events like Rwanda, as we did in a private member's motion earlier this week, we have a direct obligation to try and prevent events such as the impending genocide in Sudan. It is amazing what areas of international affairs get greatly reported on. I think it is particularly odious for those who support the United Nations that the representative of Sudanâa country that has embarked on genocide at the momentâis chairman of the UN Human Rights Commission.</para><para>I now turn to one area of particular interest to me as Deputy Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, and that is the government's proposed changes to electoral legislation and the appropriation costs of that over the next five years. According to the government's own figures, it will cost $15.1 million over five years to implement these roll integrity measures. In my view, the government is spending $15.1 million to disenfranchise people. It is spending $15.1 million to propagandise while reducing the quality of Australian democracy. Talk about money being badly spent!</para><para>As I have previously explained, in the 11 years from 1990-2001, there were five elections and one referendum, amounting to six mass votes by the Australian people. Each time, 12 million Australians voted. Six times 12 million is 72 million, which is the number of times the Australian people voted during that period. The number of proven cases of electoral fraud by the Electoral Commission in that entire period was 72. That is one case of electoral fraud per million votes in that period. That is a great testament to the integrity of the electoral roll. The fact that the government is going to spend $15.1 million to restrict participation in electoral democracy when we had only 72 cases in 11 years, during which 72 million people have voted, works out at about $200,000 per case of electoral fraud. </para><para>Let me outline what the government are planning to do. They are planning to close the electoral roll on the day the election is announced. Those people who are listening to this broadcast should be quite clear about what this means. The Fraser government did this in 1983. They closed the roll on the day the election was announced, and it disenfranchised nearly 90,000 young people. It is those people who use the period between the announcement of the election and the five days grace that they are given to enrol to vote.</para><para>Whatever side of politics we are on in this House, we have a responsibility as democrats to see that in a compulsory voting system as many people as possible have their entitlement to vote and participate looked after. In fact, the government have acted against the recommendations of the Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Mattersâthe member for Kooyong, who sits on the other side of the chamber; a member of the government; a person who actually knows something about electoral integrity. Against his recommendations, against the unanimous recommendations of his committee, they plan to close the electoral roll on the day of the vote.</para><para>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Public Administration argued in the House that this was necessary to improve the electoral roll. On three previous occasions when this government was elected, the system allowed 17- and 18-year-olds to enrol to vote. Is he suggesting that the Howard government was elected in an invalid way? That can be the only conclusion from the government's deliberate decision to spend $15 million on fraudulent advertising to tell us about the election roll when there are only 72 proven cases. This action is against the specific recommendations of the government's own chair of the committee, the member for Kooyong. The effect will be to disenfranchise 85,000 young people. What a wonderful expenditure of public moneyâto actually reduce democracy rather than increase it!</para><para>Many members of the government are very uncomfortable about this because they know that there are members of the National and Liberal parties who sit on the joint committee who unanimously accepted the report recommendations that we should leave the system exactly as it is. The government claims that it is concerned about electoral fraud, yet for years it has ignored the Australian Electoral Commission begging for more money to address their concerns about not having enough money to carry out their basic functions. According to Mark Davis in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline>, the Department of Finance and Administration supports the AEC's view that the government has been underfunding them for a decade and that they have been suffering a funding shortfall.</para><para>The government says it plans to spend between $50,000 and $250,000 on advertising to ensure 17- and 18-year-olds are on the roll to vote. While this is important, the government is planning to spend $109 million on various advertising campaigns to help it get re-elected. If it spent no money at all on advertising to tell us about the integrity of the electoral roll and just left things as they are, more people would have the right to vote. This is a farcical situation and the government is appropriating public money to be spent on a fraudulent election campaign to try to limit the number of people who can vote. If it left the system as it is, 17- and 18-year-olds, who have as much right as anyone else to vote, would be allowed to enrol in the usual period of five days grace that they are given. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>29376</page.no><name role="metadata">Hull, Kay, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs HULL</name><name.id>83O</name.id><electorate>Riverina</electorate><party>NATS</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt is a pity that my speaking time is going to be cut short by question time today because I would have liked to be able to expand at length on what little understanding the Labor Party has of rural and regional Australia.

I can inform the House that, as outlined to the House by the Prime Minister on previous occasions, the government is in discussion with the company, Wyeth, about how quickly we can get access to this vaccine and about what price it will be. I can say this: we do want, if we can, to provide this vaccine, and we do want to provide it, if we can, as quickly as possible. What we will not be doing is paying for it by ripping away the MedicarePlus safety net. If you look at the Labor Party's policy, it is proposing to fund a universal pneumococcal program by scrapping the MedicarePlus arrangements that were made in the Senate, including the MedicarePlus safety net.

I know he is one of the members on this side of the House who understands the importance of the American alliance. While the government does not agree with the American administration on everythingâon the comprehensive test ban treaty, on the International Criminal Court, on some other private issues or on American agricultural trading policiesâthere is no doubt that we have a profoundly strong view that the alliance with the United States is fundamental to our security. During the war against terrorism, particularly in relation to the challenges we face in South-East Asia with Jemaah Islamiah and like organisations, the assistance that the United States is able to provide in that war against those terroristsâparticularly the intelligence assistance, the defence technology, the tremendous dynamism that they are able to bring to regional diplomacy to encourage countries in the region to address those terrorists organisationsâis fundamentally important to our national interests. It is not surprising that over the last eight years the government has unashamedly strengthened the alliance with the United States. We have fought together in the war against terrorism. We of course cooperate in Iraq. We have negotiated a free trade agreement with the United States. We have worked very closely together on the issue of counter-proliferation of weapons of mass destructionâa very good example of that being our support for the Proliferation Security Initiativeâand we are working with the Americans on the issue of missile defence. </para></talk.start><para>Are there any alternative policies? Well, the interesting thing about the opposition on this issue is that their positions are constantly changing and there are great divisions within the opposition. I do not think we should underestimate the depth of division there is in the opposition on the issue of the American alliance. As the House knows, the Leader of the Opposition has a history of making vicious and often rather foul-mouthed attacks on the United States, the alliance and the President of the United States, and I do not think we want to revisit that. But when the member for Werriwa became the Leader of the Opposition, he started, at the beginning of that time, to tell a different story, as though within a matter of a few days his whole personality had completely changed. Everything he had stood for had been abandoned when he went into the Labor Party caucus room and almost literally draped himself in the American flagâquite incomprehensible, reallyâand said, `I am a very strong supporter of the American alliance.'</para><para>What is interesting is that he has not been able to hold to that 4 December position for very long. Every sign is beginning to re-emerge of the Leader of the Opposition's anti-Americanism. The Leader of the Opposition opposes the free trade agreement with the United States, which offers us $6 billion a year. He is against missile defence cooperation. He is against the Proliferation Security Initiative. He wants to cut and run from Iraq and abandon our allies. There is not any sign that that curious event of 4 December was anything but yet another one of the Leader of the Opposition's publicity stuntsâsomething at which he is a master. The fact is the Leader of the Opposition's anti-Americanism was illustrated by his decision to cancel his visit to the United States next month. He invented the excuse that there would be an early election, despite the fact that he is not only allowing his frontbenchers to go to America butâas the Treasurer pointed out yesterdayâallowing the member for Hotham, for some reason, to go to Kenya.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>CK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hardgrave, Gary, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Hardgrave</name></talker><para>âAsk Laurie.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4G4</name.id><name role="display">Mr DOWNER</name></talker><para>âWhat is interesting, though, about the Labor Party is the depth of the divisions on this issue. The member for Brand and Senator Ray, for example, who are unequivocal supporters of the American alliance, are finding their experience and advice is being ignored for that of Dangerman, the member for Kingsford Smith apparently; Paul Keating, who is a great source of advice; and even Gough Whitlam.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I thought it was very revealing that in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> of 18 May an informed source, talking in a very favourable article about the Leader of the Opposition, said, `Latham's private views about the Australian-American alliance are said to be extreme.' I think there is every sign that this is true. I think there is every sign that he rejects the Hawke legacy, he rejects the Beazley-Ray legacy, and that on these issues he adopts, apparently, the foreign policy of Dangerman. There is a curious juxtaposition here in the way the Leader of the Opposition seems so totally obsessed with the state of the union addresses of Bill Clinton and the writings of the glib Dick Morris. Other than that, it has to be said that there is a kind of visceral anti-Americanism coming through which I do not think, in the end, at a very difficult and dangerous time in global history, is for a moment going to be in the interests of Australia or the Australian people. I think it is about time the Leader of the Oppositionâinstead of playing games and thinking he can get away with saying absolutely nothing of any substance to the Australian publicâcame clean and started telling people a bit more about what he really believes in. </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Iraq: Treatment of Prisoners</title><page.no>29379</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>29379</page.no><name role="metadata">Rudd, Kevin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDD</name><name.id>83T</name.id><electorate>Griffith</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is to the Prime Minister.

I will take a moment to answer this question, because I assume it is accepted as an important matter, and I therefore intend to deal with it in a detailed fashion. I will return to the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> article, which says:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>... Major O'Kane's role suggests that assurances by the Defence Minister, Robert Hill, that Australian military personnel were in âno way associated with these abusesâ may be misleading.</para></quote><para>I just want to say that that is a pretty contemptible and pathetic attempt by the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> to imply some kind of guilt by association. That is what that story is into, and can I say that some of the member for Griffith's questions go dangerously close to doing the same thing. Can I specifically go to the substance of this issue: that I am advised that a report by the International Committee of the Red Cross in October of last year covered general concerns about detainee conditions and treatment. Major O'Kane, as part of his work in the coalition headquarters in Iraq, prepared a draft response to that report. A separate report by the Red Cross, in February of this yearâand once again this answer is based on the current advice of the defence departmentâraised allegations of ill treatment of detainees. </para><para>It would appear at this stage that the article in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> has either inadvertently or deliberately conflated those two reportsâthe one in October and the one in Februaryâand has blurred the two of them and, in the process, could well have done a serious injustice to Major O'Kane. To suggest that, because Major O'Kane drafted a response to the October report, he or the Australian government were in some way aware of the more serious allegations to follow in a separate report some months later is quite nonsensical.</para><para>I am in fact advised that Major O'Kane witnessed no interrogations or mistreatment of detainees and has previously reported to the defence department that he believed internees were being treated with humanity and in accordance with the Geneva convention. I repeat that: I am advised by the defence department that Major O'Kane witnessed no interrogations or mistreatment of detainees and has previously reported to Defence that he believed internees were being treated with humanity and in accordance with the Geneva convention.</para><para>We are now all aware of the photos of incidents of serious abuse which have been displayed in the media. Our government have made it very clear how concerned and appalled we are by these incidents, and we very warmly welcome the strong and decisive action that has been taken by the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom to investigate these incidents and to bring those responsible for them to justice.</para><para>Let me repeat that, as I indicated earlier, the first time I became aware of the scale of the alleged abuses was at the time most other Australians did, sometime in April when the photographs emerged. There was a CNN report in January. I may or may not have seen that at the timeâI cannot specifically recall that. It has already been indicatedâand I would have to check the record to get the precise language used by the defence minister, the foreign minister and perhaps meâthat various reports were sent back by our people on the ground in Baghdad during the early months of this year. But I would have to recall the record to attest precisely to what those details were.</para><para>Let me finish by stating again that there has been no Australian involvement in these incidents. No Australian personnel have been involved. All of this is about trying to imply some guilt by association, because that is the stock in trade of the Australian Labor Party. They do not like to be reminded of it, but it is the stock in trade of the Australian Labor Party. Just as the overwhelming majority of the 139,000 Americans who are serving bravely and in very difficult circumstances in Iraq cannot be held responsible for the appalling abuses of a few, so it is the case that the 850 Australian defence personnel serving in and around Iraq should not in any way be associated with those abuses. There has been no Australian involvement. Australia was not an occupying power. Australia did not detain or accept prisoners in Iraq. Up until the circumstances which brought this matter to international prominence broke, Australia had not been given any reports from the ICRC, although not formally but informally I understand a report or some reports have subsequently come into the hands of the Australian government.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Defence Force: Deployment</title><page.no>29381</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>29381</page.no><name role="metadata">Moylan, Judi, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs MOYLAN</name><name.id>4V5</name.id><electorate>Pearce</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.

She travelled with me to Baghdad during the course of last year and met with Australian soldiers there, amongst other people, and I know what support she has given to them. The ADF deployment in Iraq is vital to advancing our national interests in Iraq. It provides security for the Australian representative office which is absolutely essential for the tasks that it undertakesârepresentations, lobbying for Australian companies, assistance with humanitarian programs and so on. As I pointed out to the House yesterday, without those 86 soldiers our mission would close. That is the advice of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and that is the advice we would take.</para></talk.start><para>The House would be aware that HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Stuart</inline> and two P3C surveillance aircraft are defending Iraq, from further afield, from terrorists and that HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Stuart</inline> notably foiled an attack by terrorists on an oil terminal on 24 April. What more is the ADF doing? It is training the Iraqi army and navy so they are able to take over the security of Iraq. So I would have thought what the Australian troops were doing in Iraq made perfect sense. Anybody who had been briefed on this issueâand the Leader of the Opposition still has not sought a briefing on this questionâwould understand the importance of having those people there. It seems to me that it is absolutely commonsense. The day after the bomb went off about 100 metres from the Australian mission the Leader of the Opposition was reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline> as saying that his position was to bring the troops back home, and he said on 27 April:</para><quote><para>We haven't got a huge military and we've got other choices and priorities to make in terms of the defence of Australia.</para></quote><para>The member for Brand, the former Leader of the Opposition, made a speech last night. I read it this morning. It is a long read, but it is a very interesting speech, to be fair. It is not always flattering about the government or me, but that is the nature of party politics. It is a thoughtful speech made by somebody who knows something about these issues. The former Leader of the Opposition, the member for Brand, makes the point that it is well within Australia's capacity to provide at least the force now being provided by Italy, Poland, Ukraine and the Netherlandsâwhich is four times the size of ours. He went on to say that we have plenty of troops available. I am not saying the member for Brand is arguing that we should be sending many more troops to Iraq, because he is not. But I am saying that the member for Brand, who knows something about defence policy, is clearly contradicting the off the top of the head remarks made by the Leader of the Opposition.</para><para>What is interesting is that the member for Griffith supports both views. The member for Griffith did an interview with a German newspaperâa Berlin newspaperâ<inline font-style="italic">Die Tageszeitung</inline>. There used to be, by the wayâhonourable members will remember this; those who have been here for a little whileâa convention in Australia that you did not go overseas and bag your government or bag your policies. Do you remember that? I think we remember that. The member for Griffith may beâas you, Mr Speaker, have saidâa rather new member, but he might like to be reminded that going and speaking to <inline font-style="italic">Die Tageszeitung</inline> and bagging the Australian government for the benefit, no doubt, of the Berliners who are reading the newspaper is not really in very good taste. You are not on the side of Australia if you are going out and bagging us to the Berliners. Let us just make that point. You might think that the German Social Democratic Party approved. But in the end do you know whose side we on this side of the House are on? We are on Australia's side. That is the side we are on. </para><para>In this curious interview the member for Griffith says, `Policy changes in Australia would include an early withdrawal of Australian troops from Iraq.' That was the position he articulated. Does that surprise anybody? Yes, it does surprise me, because less than 24 hours after the bombing by the Australian embassy in Baghdad, on the question of whether our 86 troops should stay there, the member for Griffith was not for withdrawing the troops. He was saying, `We're looking for advice.' He says one thing to the Berliners and he says another thing to Australians.</para><para>I have to sayâand the Treasurer made this point yesterdayâthat the Leader of the Opposition needs to be scrutinised by the media and he needs to be scrutinised by the parliament and he needs to be scrutinised by the Australian people. There is nothing but policy confusion on the side of the Labor Party. There is no clarity in what the Labor Party would do. Somebody should ask the Leader of the Opposition a simple question; somebody should ask this: do you want to close down our office in Baghdad or will you leave 86 troops there to protect them? What is the answer to that question? The Leader of the Opposition, having read in Dick Morris's book that you do this, will sit there and say nothing because Dick says to say as little as you can to the public.

I can inform him that the capital expenditure survey for the March quarter was released today. Measured by chain volumes, it showed that capital expenditure fell 2.5 per cent in the March quarter but it remains 3.9 per cent higher over the year. The volume of capital expenditure remains at historically high levels following six per cent growth in the last six months and 14.8 per cent growth in 2002-03. The decrease in the March quarter appears to have been caused by a decline in the importation of civil aircraft, and abstracting from those aircraft it appears that underlying capital expenditure was broadly unchanged for the quarter. </para></talk.start><para>For the current financial year, 2003-04, businesses are expecting to reduce capital expenditure by 1.7 per cent. But this would convert to solid growth in volume terms when you take into account the recent appreciation in the exchange rate and the significant falls in the price of imported machinery and equipment as a result of that. Business investment will make a solid contribution to economic growth in 2003-04. Looking at the expectations for the next financial year, 2004-05, businesses are expecting to increase the value of their capital expenditure by between three per cent and six per cent. Again, the fall in the price of imported equipment will contribute to very solid growth in volume terms. This is showing that business investment will be a big part of our growth in 2004-05.</para><para>Can I just give a comparative figure the member for Flinders would be interested in? In the last eight years of the Labor government business investment grew 3.6 per cent per annum. Over the term of this government, private business investment has grown 8.2 per cent per annum. That is more than double the rate of growth under the last eight years of the Labor Party. Why? Interest rates are low. I was asked about people in Flinders. I know that home buyers in Flinders and small businesses in Flinders will appreciate the fact that interest rates are low.</para><para>Profitability of business is very high. The profit share to GDP is as high as it has ever been in Australian history. We have taken taxes off Australia's exports. We have cut capital gains tax; we have cut company taxes; we are cutting income taxes. We have locked in low inflation. None of this is an accident. It is not something that happens by fluke. It is not something that failed mayors with their nostrums of various economic theories could produce by accident if they were put into positions of trust in the Australian economy.

The unemployment rate is at 5.6 per centâas low as it has been in 23 years.

So it is our view that everything that can be done should be done to help job creation in this countryâand that is not just the view of this government.

Let me say that the current price of crude oil is influenced by a lot of factors. It is influenced by the increased demand for crude oil, particularly from China. It is influenced by the onset of the summer season in the United States and by the depletion of the strategic oil reserve in the United States. It is also influenced by the unsettled conditions in the Middle East. </para></talk.start><para>While we are into predictions, I think that, if the coalition were collectively to cut and run from Iraq, that country would be plunged into great bloodshed and chaos, and the impact of that on the price of crude oil would be absolutely disastrous.

If you want crude at $50 a barrel, support the Latham policy on cutting and running from Iraq. That is what you ought to do.</para><para>As for the review of the Trade Practices Act, with very great respect to the member for Hunter, the idea that some kind of review of the Trade Practices Act is going to have any direct or real effectâor even an indirect or delayed effectâon the price of crude oil is quite fanciful. The price of crude oil is set by a combination of international circumstances. The member for Hunter knows that.</para><para>Just before concluding, I say that the price of petrol at the bowser is now 5c to 6c lower than it would otherwise have been had it not been for the excise changes that this government introduced three years ago.

Given that Australian households are under record financial stress, why won't the Prime Minister adopt Labor's plan to direct the ACCC to monitor bank fees and charges, to impose some discipline on the banks and to provide some relief for Australian families?</para></talk.start></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>29390</page.no><name role="metadata">Costello, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr COSTELLO</name><name.id>CT4</name.id><electorate>Higgins</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI thank the honourable member for his question.

It is the coalition government that is insisting that that revenue be used in part to reduce taxesânot the Labor states and not the Labor opposition; it is the coalition government that is doing it.

I say to the Leader of the Opposition: if the Leader of the Opposition has any influence in the Labor Party, could he please implore Mr Beattie to implore Paul Lennon in Tasmania, Mr Rann in South Australia and, in particular, Bob Carr in New South Wales to get the results of the national reading benchmark test for 2003 out of the vault and to parents in the next month, and then this government will deliver to those parents a learning tuition coupon, worth $700, which can be redeemed at the school so that the children can get some one-to-one tuition with teachers or a private tutor to bring them up to speed with their reading. In other words, the government is about driving national standards and putting power into the hands of parents.

Would you pass on my appreciationâand the appreciation, I am sure, of other members who have been associated with them in the pastâto the security personnel who were at the front of the building this morning. At seven o'clock this morning there was a small memorial event conducted by one of my constituents, Mr Kayani, in memory of his brother, who tragically committed suicide there, as you will remember, two years ago. It was a little unorthodox for it to be held there and the security staff were very discreet and very helpful. On a couple of occasions, workers, not knowing that this event was going on, were using noisy equipment. They were discreetly handled by the security personnel so that the event could be conducted with due dignity. I thank them for that; it was beyond the requirements of their duties.

You might recall that last night in this House I raised the issue of the need for more privacy laws related to the use or misuse of mobile phones, particularly mobile phone cameras, and the incorporation of an audible signal when a photo is being taken. I wonder if you could clarify your guidelines in relation to the use of mobile phones and mobile phone cameras in this House. The reason I ask that is that yesterday during a division a senior government minister took a picture of this side of the House. They certainly did not deny it when confronted with that and continued to use the phoneâI suspect to transmit the picture. There was probably no ill intention in this, but surely this is contrary to acceptable House practice, contrary to the privacy of members of this House and disrespectful of members of this House. </para></talk.start></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>2</page.no><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate>PO</electorate><party>N/A</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âLet me indicate to the member for Braddon that I am unaware of the instance to which he refers.

I am including in that mobile phones. As far as I recall, there was an issue like this 12 months ago over SMS messages. It was generally agreed that, while computers are allowed on the floor of the chamber, the use of SMS messages should, at best, be very discreet in order not to distract anyone else. I see messaging, as everyone else would, as quite separate from telephone calls or the use of phones as a camera.

The member for Bruce thinks that there has been enough discussion on the unfair dismissal laws and the burden that small business has suffered, but until the Labor Party in the Senate, after 40 times refusing to pass reforms to let small business get on with the job, support the government's reforms to unfair dismissal laws there will never be enough discussion in this House.</para></talk.start><para>From one end of my electorate of Indi to the other, small business owners and operators have pleaded with me for the government to do something about unfair dismissal. Unfortunately I have to say to them, `We've tried.' Since 1996 we have tried 40 times, but in our parliamentary system there is a thing called the Senate and the legislation has been stymied in the Senate. But let us not blame the institution of the Senate. Forget the Greens, the Democrats and other non-government senators; as I was reminded by some of my coalition Senate colleagues this morning, it is the Labor Party in the Senate that has refused to support the government and pass these important reforms. Let us not forget that. The Labor Party has the power to ensure that these reforms get through but chooses to do nothing.</para><para>The Liberal Party's commitment to small business is undoubted. I am proud to stand here not only as a member of the Liberal Party and part of this government but as a product of a small business. I had the great pleasure and privilege, from the age of 12 until well into my late 20s, of working in the family milk bar. My parents could not employ additional workers, because of the fear of the additional costs that would be incurred. I learned a lotâin fact, I learned enough to forge me for my current responsibilities. </para><para>In the lead-up to the 1996 election, what were small businesses telling the Liberal and National parties? Small businesses were saying, `Please fix the economy; get it right. We just want to be able to get on with the job of growing our businesses and creating jobs for Australians.' Now we have the trifecta of unemployment at 5.6 per centâand in my electorate, proudly, it is at 3.8 per cent, the lowest in rural and regional Australiaâhousing interest rates of 6.55 per cent (unlike the 17 per cent interest rates under the last Labor government) and inflation of two per cent. So we have got the economy right. The one thing remaining to be done to help small businesses is that holy grail: reform to Labor's unfair dismissal laws. Why won't the opposition support these commonsense reforms? Quite simply, the Labor Party just do not care about small businesses. They do not believe that small businesses are their constituency, so they will just ignore them.</para><para>The government are committed to small business because we understand the daily sacrifices that owners and operators of many small businesses make not just in their personal lives and the economic risks they take but in their lifestyles, the manner in which they raise their families and the time commitments they need to put in to get their business up and running. We understand that small business is the engine room of the Australian economy and the best thing that we can do to let people get on with running their small business and creating jobs is to remove debilitating legislation. That is why it is so critical that the Labor Party see the light and, if they can find it in their hearts to empathise with these people who often do it tough on a day-to-day basis seven days a week, help pass reforms to unfair dismissal laws.</para><para>How else have we suffered so far? Studies have shown that the unfair dismissal laws have cost 50,000 jobs which could have been created. The Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research has found that the cost to small and medium sized businesses of complying with unfair dismissal laws has been at least $1.3 billion and has contributed to the loss of 77,000 jobs. Why do Labor disregard these statistics? Why do they disregard the difficulties and fail to recognise the importance of small business? Perhaps some light was shed on this matter by the former Leader of the Opposition, the member for Brand, when he said, `We've never pretended to be the party for small business.' His honesty is refreshing indeed. And, perhaps in an unguarded moment, even the member for Hunter was compelled to be honest in 1998 when he said, `Well, my wife constantly tells me she could afford to put on one person or would like to put on one person but is fearful of unfair dismissals.'</para><para>And what about the member for Jagajaga? The member for Jagajaga forgets the disgrace of the last Labor government; forgets the fact that her party when last in office forced one million people onto the dole queues. She was asked on Channel 10 on <inline font-style="italic">Meet the Press</inline> by Paul Bongiorno:</para><quote><para>But, Jenny Macklin, isn't it a fact that a casual job is better than no job?</para></quote><para>The response was:</para><quote><para>Well, I don't think that's the case, especially if you've got a family to feed. </para></quote><para>So here we have the Labor Party saying, `We don't want to create extra jobs; we don't care that 77,000 jobs have been lost and that an extra 55,000 jobs couldn't have been created. In fact, let's go even further: let's just cut out all casual jobs altogether.' It is old style Labor. They have a preference for putting people on welfare instead of freeing up the economy and letting people find employment and have some sort of life.</para><para>But why is there such hostility to small business and to these reforms? We have the Labor Party on record often enough. Perhaps it lies in their reliance on their lifeline, their umbilical cord to the trade union movement. Even some of them have been a little brave at times and have been honest about the union movement. I am indebted to Michelle Grattan of the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline>. In an article on 9 May 2004 she said:</para><quote><para>In 2002, ACTU president Sharan Burrow suggested Latham `must have lost the plot' when he proposed helping workers buy shares. The Australian Manufacturing Workers Union's Doug Cameron said Latham was `a professional politician all his life ... who, because he lives in Campbelltown, is able to pull a cloak of working-class respectability around himself for the ...</para><para>BSâ</para><para>he goes on with.</para></quote><para>Furthermore, we are also indebted to Michelle Grattan for reminding us of certain statements that the Leader of the Opposition made. In the article, he admitted:</para><quote><para>... `modern trade unionism (has) become too big, centralised and bureaucratic'; the previous year he warned that the union movement `runs the risk of becoming yet another dinosaur'.</para></quote><para>Such bravery from the Leader of the Opposition. We can only hope that he finds the personality of old and actually tries to engage in the reforms that the previous leader, Simon Crean, tried unsuccessfully to embark on with the union movement.</para><para>But the real gem is the admissions that have been made by a very prominent, high-profile member of the opposition frontbench. These admissions relate to the unfair dismissal laws introduced by the last Labor government and their impact on small business and the ability of small business to employ people and create more jobs. As we are well aware, it has been reported that the member for Rankin admitted to small businesses on Tuesday night that when he ran a small business he did not employ extra staff because he was apprehensive and fearful about unfair dismissal laws. Did he think that such an admission would not get out? Did he think he was the only person in that room who would be able to verify what he said? I hope the member for Rankin's admission was not a slip but part of a new era; a new era in which the Labor Party may perhaps empathise with small business.</para><para>The problem with the personal explanation made by the member for Rankin today is that it highlighted something about the new Latham Labor Party, and that is they think they can get away with saying one thing to one group and then saying another thing to another group. They think that just because they can wipe something off the Internet it disappears off the face of the earth. It does not. They cannot be in this day and age and in this current political eraâand nor should any political party want to beâa chameleon and change their colours depending on which room they are in and depending on which group they speak to.</para><para>I plead with the member for Rankin: come clean. What do you really believe? Are the unfair dismissal laws disadvantageous? Do they prevent small businesses taking on extra employees? Did they affect your decisions? This has been put on the record by the member for Rankin and he has a responsibility to add to the growing chorus in the Labor Party that are uncomfortable with the lack of commonsense that is adding to the burdens that small business have. </para><para>We know the member for Rankin and the Labor Party should not pick and choose, but they do. They choose the union movement. When the member for Rankin was an employer perhaps he had some empathy for small businesses. But perhaps if he is not genuine in his empathy for small business anymore it is quite understandable. He is fortunate and privileged enough to have a job with a monthly salary guaranteed, unlike small businesses, which have to do it tough every day.</para><para>But maybe the member for Rankin and the rest of the Labor Party do not care about small businesses because there is a bit of money involved. You just have to look at their masters; their union thug bosses, who have bought the Labor Party lock, stock and barrel with $40 million donated to the Labor Party since 1996.

What can we do about it?' I said, `Perhaps we could get someone to ring Mr Shanahan'âand so they did. The man who in fact rang Mr Shanahan was Rob Mallett. Rob Mallett rang Mr Shanahan to say, `The statements that are attributed to Craig Emerson are untrueâwere never made.' Mr Shanahan, the journalist, said to me, `I have now been rung by Rob Mallett, who has advised me of the contents of his conversation with you.' I said to Mr Shanahan, `He has advised that the statement attributed to your source is untrue.' Mr Shanahan said, `Thanks for the emails. I have spoken to Rob Mallett and will include his denial.'

We believe that every working Australian, whether employed in a bigger business or a smaller business, has a right to protection against being dismissed unfairly. In the form of a private member's bill, we have put forward a proposal to streamline the processes. But we will continue. When are you going to get the message? You say it is 40 or 41 times.

That is why we will not support it. We expect that every Australian has a right to be protected against unfair dismissal, whether they are in a big business or a small business. In any event, if the government were to get the legislation through, it would not be better for small business; it would be worse. It would be much worse for small business.

The parliament has voted the legislation down only because of the opposition of the Labor Party, the Democrats and the Greens in the Senate. Yet, if there is a smidgin of evidence that the man who leads the charge for the Labor Party in opposing our changes to the unfair dismissal laws recognises that it is having some impact on employmentâand it did have an impact on employment in his own caseâthen it says everything about the Labor Party's hypocrisy.

All we have heard from the minister today is an attempt to undermine the credibility of the member for Rankin and assert things that are clearly not the case, as confirmed by independent witnesses. He fails to instead turn his mind to the important matters that go to small business and work and family policies that Labor wish to put in place if elected to government. If the minister and the member for Indi had any concerns about public policy and important issues then they would have addressed those matters that would have gone to the unfair dismissal laws. But clearly even now they find it very difficult to cogently argue in favour of their position.</para></talk.start><para>There are not many opportunities for a backbencher, and certainly for a government backbencher, to raise a matter of public importance. You would have thought that, if the member for Indi had one opportunity in this parliamentary term, she may have looked to address the outrageously low bulk-billing rate in Indi. The electorate of Indi has one of the lowest rates, if not the lowest rate, for bulk-billing of any electorate in Australia. She had the opportunity this afternoon to raise that issue in this place on behalf of all constituents of Wodonga, Yarrawonga and many other cities and towns in that electorate and to look after those people that are finding it very difficult to find doctors that bulk bill. That electorate has one of the lowest bulk-billing ratesâand yet she has brought nothing about that to the attention of this House and clearly instead wants to involve herself in a simple, pathetic stunt to waste the parliament's time.</para><para>Labor believe that we can find an efficient way to deal with matters that go to unfair dismissal. We believe that working people deserve recourse if they have been unfairly dismissed, but we believe there are ways in which we can make things more efficient and expedite matters before a court or tribunal. We do not believe that you should be able to convert an effectively permanent employee into a casual employee purely because they are employed by a business with fewer than 20 employees. We do not consider it fair for an employee not to have any right of redress if they are unfairly terminated. It is unfair for the government to say otherwise.</para><para>One of the reasons this bill comes up again and again is because this government will go down as fitting small business up for GSTâthis government will go down as converting all small business proprietors into tax collectors. That is what this government has left as a legacy for small business. To distract the attention of the public away from the fact that it has imposed such a difficult constraint upon small business, it continually argues that Australian workers who work in a small business have no rights of recourse, no right of redress, if they have been unfairly dealt with. </para><para>This MPI has been a stunt. The member for Indi should have been focusing on bulk-billing rates in her electorateâthe lowest bulk-billing rates in the country. The minister, if he was concerned about these matters, would have been providing his solutions to the issue of the balance of work and family. He would have been talking about how we can make sure that we have prosperous companies but at the same time ensure that there are decent and fair employment rights for all employees of this country.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>29412</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âOrder!

I have spoken before on this issue but this time we have had some real progress thanks to the assistance of the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Dr David Kemp. Kurnell is a place of great importance to residents of the Sutherland Shire. It is also of great historical and cultural significance to all Australians as the place where Australia became a European settlement upon the landing of Cook in 1770 and the subsequent settlement some 18 years later.</para></talk.start><para>Last Tuesday Dr Kemp visited the Kurnell Peninsula, and during his visit I presented to him a nomination for the inclusion of the Kurnell Peninsula on the national heritage register. The event took place at a community gathering at Commemoration Flat in the Botany Bay National Park, which is just metres from Cook's landing place. Along with the minister and a significant number of Kurnell residents the presentation was attended by Mr Michael Richardson, New South Wales shadow minister for the environment; Mr Malcolm Kerr, state member for Cronulla; Kevin Schreiber, Mayor of Sutherland Shire; Mr Merv Ryan representing traditional owners; Mike Patrick and Christine Hopkins of the National Parks and Wildlife Service; and Mr Bob Walsh OAM, who in particular has shown a lifelong commitment to the protection of the Kurnell area.</para><para>This register, which was created under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, seeks to protect places that have outstanding natural, Indigenous or historical heritage value to the nation. The nomination, which was accepted by the minister, includes the entirety of the peninsula with the exception of residents' homes in the Kurnell village and the oil refinery which is located adjacent to the village. I have nominated the peninsula on all three grounds under the actâthat it has outstanding natural, Indigenous and historical value to the nation.</para><para>The Kurnell Peninsula's natural heritage value is beyond question. As the House would recall, it has over 95 per cent of remaining salt marsh communities and more than 50 per cent of remaining mangrove communities in the Sydney basin. The Kurnell Peninsula also provides vital wading habitat for migratory birds which travel from as far away as Siberia and Japan. It was for this reason that the Towra Point wetlands were designated in the early eighties as an official Ramsar site.</para><para>The Kurnell Peninsula's Indigenous values are beyond comparison in Australia. It was at this site that the first momentous meeting of Indigenous and European cultures occurred on Cook's landing in 1770, and again when the First Fleet under Captain Arthur Phillip arrived in 1788. There is a range of Indigenous sites that were important to Aboriginal life in the Sydney basin prior to the arrival of Europeans. These sites include carvings, ceremonial sites, middens, stone tools and burial sites. It is fortunate that parts of the dune system and the Botany Bay National Park have helped to preserve many of these sites. </para><para>I was particularly pleased that Mr Merv Ryan was present at the nomination. Merv Ryan is the representative of the Gwyeagal people, who are a clan of the Dharawal nation, the traditional owners of the land. It was Mr Ryan's ancestors who met Captain Cook on his landing and were again present when the First Fleet landed some 18 years later. Merv was instrumental in helping me to prepare the nomination and he and the elders of the Gwyeagal have supported the efforts to protect Kurnell wholeheartedly.</para><para>As for the historical values of the peninsula, I have already mentioned the landing of Cook and the important studies by Banks and Solander and the landing of the First Fleet some 18 years later. Kurnell also has a collection of memorials commemorating the historic events, the earliest of which was erected in 1822, while the later obelisk dates from 1870. Assessment of the Kurnell nomination against the stringent national heritage criteria will be undertaken by the independent Heritage Council over the next 12 months. The council will then advise the minister whether the peninsula has national heritage value.</para><para>Once the site is listed, it will mean that the environmental, Indigenous and cultural values of the site will be protected under federal statute. It will mean that, without the approval of the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, a person cannot undertake any action that has, will have or is likely to have a significant impact on the national heritage values of Kurnell, and this will be backed up by criminal sanctions for anyone not complying with the act. I now hope that the birthplace of our nation will finally be fully protected under law against the pressures of an expanding city, sandmining and continued development.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Indigenous Affairs: Reconciliation</title><page.no>29413</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>29413</page.no><name role="metadata">Grierson, Sharon, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GRIERSON</name><name.id>00AMP</name.id><electorate>Newcastle</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âToday I rise to register my continuing support for Indigenous Australians and pay my respects to them as the original owners and carers of this land we share.

And more importantly, there is no apology to Indigenous people that, on every indicator of quality of life and socioeconomic status measure for Indigenous people, this government over eight years through the departments it administers has failed to achieve significant progress of any kind. What a blight on the human rights and social justice history of this place. But, of course, this `blame everyone else' government would have us all believe that that failure is someone else's faultâobviously, it would think, the fault of Indigenous people themselves and, perhaps it would also purport, the fault of the peak body for Indigenous people, ATSIC. </para><para>It does not take too much conscience or knowledge to know that that is not trueâjust another white lie. The figures are shameful. I quote from the <inline font-style="italic">Social Justice Report 2003</inline>, and in doing so I pay tribute to Bill Jonas, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commissioner of HREOCâa Worrimi man from my regionâwho presented this report. Let us look at some of those indicators. For Indigenous household income there was minimal increase. The increase in individual income was much less than the increase for non-Indigenous people. The employment participation rate was 54 per cent against 73 per cent for non-Indigenous people. The unemployment rate for Indigenous Australians is three times higher. In education, 69 per cent of Indigenous people are progressing to year 11 against 90 per cent of non-Indigenous people. Home ownership for Indigenous people is at 13 per cent as opposed to 40 per cent for non-Indigenous people.</para><para>Indigenous people make up 20 per cent of the total prison population. If you are an Indigenous Australian, you have 16 times the chance of imprisonment than non-Indigenous people. Since 1997 Indigenous juveniles have made up 42 per cent of all incarcerated juvenilesâand that rate has been consistent. Life expectancy for Indigenous females is 62.8 years. The life expectancy for Indigenous males, 56.3 years, shows a slight improvement, but I do not think the government will have to worry about aged care costs for Indigenous males. Indigenous babies have twice the chance of having a low birth weight, and the infant death rate is 2Â½ times greater than for non-Indigenous children.</para><para>It is sad to continue because, whilst for many people they might be just statistics, for Indigenous people they are the everyday, real life struggles and personal tragedies that they experience. It is their sons and daughters that those figures representâit is their babies, their frustrated youth and their family members and leaders who are struck down in their prime. </para><para>So I would like to share some of the Indigenous success stories, particularly from the region of Newcastle and the Hunter, that have grown out of the efforts of Indigenous people. This week a rally was held on the forecourt lawns of Parliament House to celebrate the CDEP schemeâthe employment schemes run by Aboriginal people for Aboriginal people. In Newcastle Youloe-Ta, our local registered CDEP, is funded at present for 266 participants. It grew from Yarnteen, which was set up in 1993, and has continued to have outstanding outcomes. </para><para>One in particular was the success of Yarnteen, granted $100,000 from Microsoft USAânot from the Australian governmentâto network all CDEPs across New South Wales. It is an outstanding program. In our region it also has a registered training organisation at Yamalong, which is also a bush tucker tourist site of great renown and an education and conference centre. I always enjoy visiting Yamalong. When I do visit, I watch young people grow from lacking in confidence with their heads down to glowing with pride, especially when their families come along just to watch them. It is an outstanding achievement and I pay tribute to the Aboriginal people of the Hunter Region for their commitment, dedication and absolute determination to provide leadership and ongoing success for Indigenous Australians.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Dobell Electorate: Tumbi Creek</title><page.no>29415</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>29415</page.no><name role="metadata">Ticehurst, Kenneth, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TICEHURST</name><name.id>00ANF</name.id><electorate>Dobell</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise today to convey to the House the results of last week's Tumbi Creek summit held in my electorate of Dobell. For months I have been calling for an urgent bipartisan meeting with the state member for The Entrance, the New South Wales Minister for Gaming and Racing, Mr Grant McBride, and Wyong Shire Council, to discuss the dire need for the New South Wales government to provide matching funding for the Tumbi Creek dredging and offsite landfill disposal. </para></talk.start><para>I can gladly say that last Friday this multilevel, bipartisan summit meeting came to fruition at Wyong Shire Council. The summit involved Wyong Mayor Brenton Pavier, Deputy Mayor Neil Rose, state member for The Entrance, Grant McBride, and me. Before I discuss the summit, I must say that my approach has been straightforward from day one. For the future of the Central Coast, we must do the proper job and not allow truck loads of sludge to be removed from the mouth of Tumbi Creek and dumped into what is already a shallow estuarine lake.</para><para>The summit discussed options to dredge and remove sludge from a heavily silted Tumbi Creek without dumping it into Tuggerah Lakes. It looked at the dredging of about 5,000 cubic metres of spoil, which could last about five years, and it discussed dredging an alternative, wider channel, removing about 15,000 cubic metres of spoil, which could last for 10 years or more before further dredging would be required. </para><para>This discussion of options to remove the silt from Tumbi Creek without dispersing it onto the lake bed came after Wyong Shire Council debated and unanimously passed a rescission motion in March this year to stop the dumping of 15,000 cubic metres of silt. Dumping the silt was the financially viable but environmentally disastrous plan of the New South Wales government, rather than see the land fill carted away.</para><para>The proposal to dump silt into Tuggerah Lakes was neither approved nor disapproved by the federal government's environmental department, contrary to the state member for The Entrance's comments in the<inline font-style="italic"> Central Coast Express Advocate</inline> of 24 May. The federal department, having no jurisdiction over this matter, simply stated that it could not dictate either way. Despite the federal government having no responsibility over the Tuggerah Lakes system, but given my strong lobbying on this issue, I was successful in gaining the federal government's support for the expenditure of $340,000 in Regional Flood Mitigation Program funding. The Regional Flood Mitigation Program agreement requires that both the federal and state governments agree to the expenditure of funds. Should this amount not be sufficient to fund a third of the final costs of disposing of the silt, I have always said that I am willing to lobby my government for additional funding to do the job properly, as the people of Dobell demand.</para><para>It has been very disappointing up to this point that the New South Wales government has failed to acknowledge its responsibilities to the lake that they ownâour environment is worth much more than that. However, I am hopeful that, as a result of this summit, the New South Wales government and Grant McBride will join with Wyong Shire Council and the federal government to do this important work at Tumbi Creek in the manner demanded by the Central Coast community.</para><para>The state member for The Entrance, while not expressing his support for the project outright, has agreed to accept a proposal from council outlining the manner of the dredge works that will be undertaken once this has been finalised and the amount of funding the council is seeking from the New South Wales government to undertake the project. This issue is too important for cheap politics and game playing. We are talking about an issue that affects residents of the Central Coast, our tourism industry and future generations. While it is disappointing that no firm decision could be taken, as I would have liked, I am hopeful that we are all thinking the same and are committed to ensuring an outcome which benefits the local community as well as the environment. I am hopeful that a positive resolution will be made be made by Wyong Shire Council at its meeting on 9 June. I stand ready to support the work of Wyong Council and the state member for The Entrance, Grant McBride, to ensure that sludge is not dumped into our precious lake system. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Human Rights: Israel</title><page.no>29416</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>29416</page.no><name role="metadata">Irwin, Julia, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs IRWIN</name><name.id>83Z</name.id><electorate>Fowler</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThis week Amnesty International released its annual report, which documents the human rights situation in 155 countries during the year ended December 2003.

As the House is aware, Australia is currently undergoing a very technical and fundamental change in the way in which our airspace is managed. In late November, a major part of the new National Airspace System became operational throughout Australia: stage 2(b) of the National Airspace System. This stage changed the status of airspace around many of Australia's airports and en route airspace and is based on the US national airspace system. It should be noted that, whilst it is solely based on the US system, it has a number of fundamental differences from the US system, just as the physical infrastructure for Australian aviation is fundamentally different from that for the US.</para></talk.start><para>At a board meeting of Airservices Australia in Perth last Friday a number of key decisions about the way forward for airspace management in Australia were taken. The Airservices Australia board considered a number of options to modify the National Airspace System stage 2(b) changes to reduce risks for people in the aviation industry and, importantly and fundamentally, for the travelling public. The decisions of the board meeting were: </para><quote><para>The en route class E airspace, that was Class C airspace prior to the NAS stage 2(b) reforms, will not be reclassified to Class C in the enroute section of the airspace at this time; </para><para>A minimum requirement to address risk in NAS 2(b) is the expansion of Class C steps over Class C terminal airspace; and</para><para>Progress Option 3 and the Industry Option through the Safety Management System.</para></quote><para>Option 3 retains class E en route, except between Sydney and Melbourne, with class C airspace around C and D aerodromes and minor mitigators. The industry option retains class E en route, with class C around C aerodromes and a modified class E above D aerodromes up to class A airspace and minor mitigators.</para><para>I have chosen to raise this very serious issue this evening to clarify for the Australian public these latest developments in Australia's airspace management system because, unfortunately and surprisingly, there has not been a word about these significant developments from the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, Mr Anderson. This is an issue very much in the public domain at the moment, as evidenced by the <inline font-style="italic">7.30 Report </inline>last evening, which did a very exhaustive report on the difficulties relating to the implementation of the NAS. What worries me is that I believe that there is not enough ministerial attention being given to what are very technical issuesâissues that are seriously concerning not only the aviation industry but also the travelling public. I contend that it is the responsibility of the ministerâand I note that he is also the Deputy Prime Minister of Australiaâto inform the travelling public and the aviation community of what is going on. But I am sadly reporting this evening that I believe that the minister is neglecting his responsibilities, because he has chosen not to make any detailed statement about the changes that have been pursued by Airservices Australia since 17 February this year. </para><para>The minister has not said a word in this chamber about our airspace management system since a question without notice, a dorothy dixer, on 17 Februaryâmore than three months ago. That dorothy dixer should have been followed up by a very detailed statement by the minister, because on the evening of 17 February 2004 Airservices Australia effectively said that there were major problems with the NAS. Since that timeâand the record shows itâthere have been considerable changes to the airspace management system, but the minister has not had the courage or decency to come in here and explain what is happening. Perhaps he is too scared of the political influence of the Prime Minister's mate Dick Smith and of what he thinks of changes to the NASâa system that Dick Smith is clearly infatuated with. It is about time we said to the Australian community that the technical experts are running NAS and that enthusiastic amateurs such as Dick Smith are out of the ring. The minister should be prepared to accept his responsibilities and explain what is occurring. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âBefore I recognise the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, I note that normally members of the executive only get the call in the adjournment in order to extend the debate.

Some weeks ago, an independent body assessed the bids by our cooperative research centres for consideration either for extension of funding or to be included within the CRC process. This assessment panel is very independent of government, and it needs to be that way. It works through specific criteria. As a result of that assessment, of the 52 centres that were assessed, 19 were unsuccessful in getting through the first round. Understandably, there was an outcry about the fact that two of those that were unsuccessfulâthe reef CRC and the rainforests CRCâhad not got past the first stage. It provided very fertile opportunities for the opposition to somehow suggest that this government was in no way committed to environmental outcomes and that it was more focused on commercialisation than the public good. It gave the opposition a great opportunity to run headlines attacking the government over the process.</para></talk.start><para>I had grave concerns about the outcome and the future of both of these organisations, as did my colleague the member for Herbert, Peter Lindsay. I made contact with the CRCs, and I discovered that in both cases their funding applications were, you could suggest, ambitious. Of a $200 million pool, between the pair of them they were applying for $130 million. In the case of the rainforests CRC, Professor Nigel Stork conceded to me that he was aware that his application did not fit the criteria, but he had been hoping that maybe it would stumble over into the next round and he would have an opportunity to get further private support. In the case of the reef CRC, it was conceded by Professor Russell Reichelt that they had misread the process, it was far too generous and they were looking at another way of doing it.  </para><para>I have got together with my colleague the member for Herbert. We are working with universities, industry and the CRCs to find a way in which the long-term future of both of these organisations can be guaranteed. We have been working very hard over the last couple of weeks. I have put in a primary draft, which has gone to the relevant ministers: Minister Nelson, Minister McGauran and other ministers who have an interest in this.</para><para>I was disappointed to see today in a press release from Senator Carr, who had gleaned something in estimates, the suggestion that absolutely nothing had been done and that there was absolutely no consideration whatsoever being given to finding a way through this problem with the CRCs. It concerns me that people like Senator Carr are maybe wishing that these things are going to fail. This also bothers those people who work within the CRCs, because they start to get a bit concerned about their own future. It is important to be able to confirm that there has been a lot of work going on with the CRCs, the universities and industry, working towards a process where we can not only guarantee the long-term future of both of these invaluable institutions but also strengthen them further. To put out press releases of this sort of nonsense is highly inappropriate and grossly inaccurate.

I bring to the House just two examples of the many people who are affected by the failure of this Howard government to assist those people in our community who are hearing impaired. World War II veteran Gordon Ohl of Keppel Sands has had to wait six months for replacement hearing aids through the federal government public health system. This has had a terrible effect on the quality of life of this 83-year-old. He can no longer enjoy watching television, has difficulty following conversations and talking on the telephone and feels endangered every time he crosses the road. Mr Ohl first contacted Australian Hearing Services in January this year but did not get a hearing test until 5 May. He was then told that he would not get a hearing aid until the end of June. Since my intervention, that has been brought forward to 4 June, but that still represents a six-month wait for Mr Ohl. I understand from my inquiries that Australian Hearing Services in our region is understaffed at present, but surely that is a problem for the government to fix. It should not be people like Mr Ohl who pay the price for this government's neglect of essential health services.</para></talk.start><para>Clearly, this situation is unacceptable, but the situation facing another of my constituents is even worse. Gregory McDougall was diagnosed with hearing loss at the age of four. He was supplied with hearing aids through the National Acoustics Laboratory until he turned 21. Gregory is now 33 and his position is that, while he has hearing aids, he is able to study. However, without aids he is unable to either study or find employment. The hearing aids he received just before he turned 21 are now beyond repair. Centrelink has informed him that there are no provisions for anyone on Newstart to be given hearing aids. However, as a recipient of Newstart the cost of purchasing hearing aids is well beyond his capacity. Does this mean that he will have to try to survive without hearing aids until he reaches 65? Will he still be expected to try to study or find employment without the assistance of hearing aids? It would seem that, whatever way he goes, there is no provision under the present guidelines for assistance to people like Gregory with hearing disabilities.</para><para>Surely we must do whatever we can to support young people like Gregory to actively study or seek employment. For this to occur, Gregory should be provided with hearing aids, while remaining on the Newstart allowance. I am asking the Minister for Health and Ageing to personally review Gregory's case, as it is obviously one where the system is failing and real assistance is needed to ensure that this man is given every opportunity to lead a fulfilled and worthwhile life in our society and does not spend the next 30 years waiting for a pension at 65 so that he can finally receive the hearing aids he needs to take his place in our society.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Gilmore Electorate: Illaroo Road Public School</title><page.no>29420</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>29420</page.no><name role="metadata">Gash, Joanna, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs GASH</name><name.id>AK6</name.id><electorate>Gilmore</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âA couple of weeks ago I was privileged to visit the Illaroo Road Public School in my electorate of Gilmore. Not only is Illaroo Road Public School a school of some 540 students but it is a school with excellent teachers, students who really care about each other and parents who are proud of both the children and the staff at their school. Having said that, the reason I speak about them in the House today is that, at the invitation of Dr Rosie Wade, I spoke with the year 6 classes of 6J, 6W, 6F and 5-6Kâabout 103 students in all. Their topic was state and federal governments. </para></talk.start><para>It is not often as a polly that I am lost for words, but these young students blew me away with their questions and knowledge of the role of government, both state and federal. There were many questions. What is a term in government? How do you as a member of a party get a vote or a say in parliament? How do you become a member of a political party? And for 1Â½ hours the questions came, and all required very personal and honest answers. I am often asked why I chose to become a polly. The visit to Illaroo Road Public School is one such answer. What makes it even more rewarding is that at least 10 per cent of the students wanted to become politicians of the future. Illaroo Road Public School will be visiting Parliament House in the near future. Hopefully, parliament will be sitting so that year 6 will have an opportunity to personally meet some of us on both sides of the House.</para><para>On a different note, it was of interest to see just how these students work. Dr Wade's class operates on a system of contractual homeworkâthat is, over a six- to 10-week period, set works are given with various choices, allowing the students to do independent studies with an ability to control their own time management and to explore in-depth their own set pieces of homework. They also make up board games and word games, based on such games as Parliament Unwrapped and Government Galore. Not only is Illaroo Road Public School a school to be proud of but it also happens to be in the street where I live, so you can see that I, too, am very proud of its reputation and, in particular, the students of years 5 and 6. It was a real eye-opener for me to see first-hand how these students work but, what is more, they are actually enjoying the work in politics.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Family Services: Child Care</title><page.no>29421</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>29421</page.no><name role="metadata">Danby, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DANBY</name><name.id>WF6</name.id><electorate>Melbourne Ports</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âToday I would like to again raise the issue of private child-care centres, specifically ABC child-care centres. ABC, the chair of which is former Liberal candidate Sallyanne Atkinson, has around 300 centres in Australia, including one in south Melbourne, in my electorate. Last week the <inline font-style="italic">BRW</inline> showed that the owner of ABC child-care centres, Mr Eddie Groves, is now worth $175 million, up $70 million from last year.</para></talk.start><para>In the last sitting week I gave a speech on ABC child care. One of Eddie Groves's employees wrote to me, thanking me for raising the issue. She wrote:</para><quote><para>I am ... currently studying my Certificate 3 and earning $12.08 [per hour] on traineeship ... I love my job, the children give me great pleasure and I always give that little bit extra but really I just don't think I can afford to stay in the industry much longer ... At ABC [we] do all the cleaning in the centre and are expected to tidy the outside areas as well. I believe that if a job includes several roles ie cleaning and childcare then maybe the award wage should reflect this. If ABC had to pay cleaners in each of its centres, it would cost them hundreds of dollars, instead the childcare workers have to perform the role of cleaners to save Eddie more money. Staff are also required to play music at certain times of the day, which is not supplied by ABC and only gets played if staff bring in their own music.</para></quote><para>I am sure the standard of care at ABC, especially given the devoted work of child-care workers, is generally good, but I would like to congratulate Mr Groves for moving up to 131 on the <inline font-style="italic">BRW</inline> rich list. ABC centres refuse to hire sufficient cleaners, refuse to pay staff a decent wage and require staff to bring in their own music to play to children. I would suggest that child-care workers who would like to improve the situation should contact the child-care section of the LHMU. Mr Groves donated $10,000 to the Queensland Liberal Party in 2002-03. Last week the Treasurer visited one of his centres in Queensland. Did the Treasurer know that the owner was a significant contributor to the Liberal Party when he decided to visit the centre? Was this the reason he chose this particular centre? </para><para>In my electorate, in Glen Eira, parents have expressed concern that the Liberal controlled council is considering withdrawing from child-care services and allowing private operators to move in. Fees have increased significantly in Glen Eira this year, from $48 to $53 a day, and in July they will increase to around $62 a day. The withdrawal of councils like Glen Eira from child care is a total disgrace and an abrogation of their responsibility to serve the residents of my area. It is only since the recent council elections that the Glen Eira council has been thinking of withdrawing from child care. The fact that parents and their children have to go on Channel 10 and make protests to keep the Glen Eira child-care centre open is a total disgrace. I urge the councillors of the City of Glen Eira to focus on their main concerns and serve the people of Glen Eira. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Casey Electorate: Mountain District Christian School</title><page.no>29422</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>29422</page.no><name role="metadata">Smith, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANTHONY SMITH</name><name.id>00APG</name.id><electorate>Casey</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âLast Saturday I had the privilege and honour of attending the official opening of the Primary Learning Centre at Monbulk's Mountain District Christian School in the heart of the Yarra Valley and Dandenong Ranges in my electorate. The new centre has been completed and is being used by prep and year 1 and 2 students. The opening was a great occasion to celebrate the school and the local school community's significant efforts in bringing about the construction of this building.</para></talk.start><para>The morning involved the new principal, Mr Jo Harder; the vice-principal, Mr Chris Prior; many of the school's board members, including Mr Garry Gannon, a former principal; many members of the local community; parents; and, of course, most importantly, all of the young students who will use this new facility. Two of the prep students, Riley Allan and Connor Harlow, along with the principal, had the privilege of cutting the ribbon to officially open the new centre which they and their fellow students will use. </para><para>I wish to pay tribute to the school community. These facilities, costing half a million dollars, are a magnificent achievement for the school. They were able to build this new centre without a state or federal grant. Not surprisingly, that has involved many years of planning and a great sacrifice by many of the parents who were involved, not just financially but in terms of the time they volunteered to bring the project about.</para><para>The construction began just last August and proceeded at a rapid pace to ensure that it was ready for opening last Saturday. The closeness and the commitment of the school community at Mountain District was illustrated by the fact that the builder who constructed the facility was himself a former student of the school who returned from travelling around Australia with his family specifically to build the new classrooms. He lives in Monbulk with his wife, and his young child attends the school. Similarly, the electrician who worked on the project, Mick Dillema from Wandin Electrics, put in many hours above and beyond the call of duty to ensure that the project was completed on time. Janet Nyhouse also had a lot to do with the project. These volunteers were acknowledged and thanked by all on the day. The prep students themselves confidently shook their hands and presented them with gifts to acknowledge the work that they had done. As the parents recognise, by sending their kids to an independent school like Mountain District they make a financial sacrifice. They are to be commended for exercising their choice about the sort of education they want for their kids. It was another example of the rich diversity of our education system. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Private Forest Reserve Program</title><page.no>29423</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>29423</page.no><name role="metadata">Sidebottom, Sid, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SIDEBOTTOM</name><name.id>849</name.id><electorate>Braddon</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe recent claim made by Senator Eric Abetz in the <inline font-style="italic">Advocate</inline> newspaper on 18 May 2004 that the Tasmanian government had spent 60 per cent of funds for the Private Forest Reserve Program on administration was incorrect. The senator's comments show a lack of understanding of this important environmental program. He might learn more about it if he were to consult the speech I made in this parliament on 13 May 2004 to explain it. The last annual report of the programâand I know my colleague the member for Franklin will be interested in thisâshowed that 60 per cent of all program costs since 1997 had been paid directly to landowners. Only 23 per cent of expenses were for salaries and office costs. The other program costs included 17 per cent spent on legal, valuation, survey and negotiation feesâsomething that you would expect when you are dealing with the Private Forest Reserve Program.</para></talk.start><para>The program provides financial incentives to landowners to protect important areas of native forest on private land in perpetuity, mainly by registering a perpetual conservation covenant on a land title. These protected areas on private land are part of Australia's Comprehensive, Adequate and Representative Reserve System. The PFRP has now established 149 forest reserves and 21 other reserves covering an area of 27,781 hectares. I know that they have in their sights 62,000 hectares or more for preservation. The cost effectiveness of the program has set a benchmark for conservation programs not just here but worldwide in securing areas of very high conservation value in perpetuity. The once-only cost of securing protection of these important forests on private land in perpetuity is $506 per hectare. That takes into account all program costs.</para><para>Perhaps Senator Abetz could indicate a conservation program anywhere that secures perpetual conservation of such important areas on private land more cost effectively than the Private Forest Reserve Program in Tasmania. Once again, Senator Abetz has got it wrong. I urge him and his Liberal colleagues to back my call for an extension to this program beyond June 2004âan extension not yet officially agreed to by Minister Kemp, contrary to assurances by his unnamed spokesperson that the program will continue.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Chelsea Flower Show</title><page.no>29423</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>29423</page.no><name role="metadata">Smith, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANTHONY SMITH</name><name.id>00APG</name.id><electorate>Casey</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âYesterday the Australian public received some great news from the world-famous Chelsea Flower Show in London. A landscaped garden known as Fleming's Nurseries <inline font-style="italic">Australian Inspiration</inline> won a silver gilt prize after competing against 24 other landscaped gardens from around the world. This is a great achievement and all of those involved should be congratulated. The achievement of a second prize is even more significant given the fact that this is the first occasion that an Australian garden exhibition has been entered in the show. The garden is a collaboration between Fleming's Nurseries, landscape designer Jim Fogarty and Semken Landscaping.</para></talk.start><para>Fleming's Nurseries is a fourth generation family business based in Monbulk in the horticultural heart of the Casey electorate. With 120 employees and more than 200 hectares in production, Fleming's is Australia's leading supplier of deciduous fruit and ornamental trees. Fleming's produce, along with the produce of many other horticultural businesses in the Yarra Valley and the Dandenong Ranges, is sold all over Victoria and Australia. Fleming's Nurseries is a family business run by Don and Dawn Fleming, their two sons Wes and Graham and other members of the family. </para><para>Don, Dawn and Wes are currently in London along with the team from Semken Landscaping, which is based in Melbourne's outer east, and Jim Fogarty, who is also from Melbourne. I wish to mention some of the other people involved who are currently in London: Martin Semken, Mark Bence, Paul Stammers, Mark Stammers, Brad Peters, David Brown, Anne Semken, Mandy Bence, Brian Sparling, Jay Watson and Glen McGrath. I assume that is not Glen McGrath from the Australian Cricket Team. Since the beginning of May they have been working on this landscape garden and all of their efforts have borne fruit.</para><para>As Wes Fleming said, taking part in the Chelsea Flower Show will lift the profile of landscaping and horticulture in Australia and communicate the skill, vision and quality of Australian industry to the rest of the world. Just being asked to participate in the Chelsea Flower Show is an achievement in itself, but to win a second prize really puts Australia on the map in an important industry not just in the Yarra Valley but across many of the other outer suburban and rural electorates of Australia.

The Export Market Development Grants Scheme came into operation in 1974. Obviously, it was an initiative of the Whitlam Labor government. The purpose of the scheme is to bring benefits to Australia by encouraging the creation, development and expansion of foreign markets for Australian goods, services, intellectual property and know-how. The EMDG Scheme has played an integral role in encouraging Australian companies to broaden their horizons and expand their customer base overseas via the development of new export markets.</para></talk.start><para>The pursuit of new export markets and engagement in international trade has been central to Australia's economic development. Sustainable growth in exports means more and quite often higher paying jobs for Australians, and it enables Australia to pay for imported products demanded by Australian industry and consumers. Unfortunately, the government has allowed the EMDG Scheme to run down markedly since 1996-97, when a funding cap of $150 million was imposed on the scheme until 2005-06. According to the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the real value of the program has now fallen by nearly 20 per cent since the cap was imposed and it is likely to fall by around 27 per cent by 2005-06.</para><para>This decline in the real value of the EMDG Scheme creates considerable uncertainty for exporters as it impacts on the amount that they are able to access from the scheme at the end of each financial year. Last year 25 per cent of Australian exporters who had provisional grant entitlements above $60,000 received only 32.84c in the dollar for their second tranche entitlement. Many exporters would have undertaken major marketing exercises and extensive travel to potential new markets overseas on the basis of receiving a larger payout in the second tranche. Last year's payout of 33c in the dollar for the second tranche short-changed many exporters and may well have a detrimental impact on their plans to continue to pursue new markets overseas. </para><para>The government's rundown of the EMDG Scheme completely cuts across another arm of its trade policy to double the number of exporters. The government has set an ambitious target to double the number of exporters by 2006-07. Using a base figure of 25,000 exporters in 2000-01, the government has set itself the task of achieving 50,000 exporters by 2006-07. So far things are not looking so good. According to ABS statistics, the number of exporters increased from 25,000 in 2001-02 to 31,450 in 2001-02âa big jump of over 6,000 exporters. But this was largely attributable to a reclassification exercise. The number of exporters has since fallen to 31,174 in 2002-03. So the government has quite a bit of ground to make up if it is to double the number of exporters by 2006. This is not going to be helped by the continuing decline in the real value of the EMDG Scheme.</para><para>The amendments put forward in this bill are to introduce a not fit and proper person test to be applied by Austrade when assessing entitlement to payment of an EMDG grant. This bill responds to very valid community concerns about the payment of an EMDG grant of $90,000 to a company associated with a former codirector of the collapsed Pyramid Building Society in Victoria. It is completely inappropriate that a former director of the Pyramid Building Society was able to access taxpayers' funds from this government for his continuing business activities, particularly when Victorian taxpayers have already paid a petrol levy to bail out deposit holders in Pyramid. It is incumbent upon the government to ensure that EMDG funds are allocated only to recipients who are deemed appropriate and worthy by community standards. This does not include former directors of bankrupt financial institutions.</para><para>It is in Australia's interests and the interests of taxpayers that EMDG recipients meet the high standards required to represent Australia professionally overseas and to conduct their international business on a sound basis. Notwithstanding Labor's concerns about the government's negligence in allowing the EMDG Scheme to run down and the uncertainty this creates for exporters, Labor supports the amendments in this bill. These amendments are necessary to assure the community that EMDG funds are being used to good effect and that the recipients of such funding are fit and proper persons in accordance with community standards.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>29425</page.no><name role="metadata">Gash, Joanna, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs GASH</name><name.id>AK6</name.id><electorate>Gilmore</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe <inline ref="R2034">Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2004</inline> amends the Export Market Development Grants Act 1997, and introduces a not fit and proper person test to be applied by Austrade in accordance with ministerial guidelines when assessing entitlement to payment of an EMDG grant. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>29425</page.no><name role="metadata">Johnson, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JOHNSON</name><name.id>00AMX</name.id><electorate>Ryan</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am pleased to speak on the <inline ref="R2034">Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2004</inline>. I support this bill very strongly because it is a bill that is in the interests of my constituency of Ryan and it is also in the interests of small business men and women throughout the country. Therefore, it follows that it is in the interests of this country's national economic prosperity. The first point I want to make is that it is interesting to note the speakers who will be making presentations on this bill. We seem to have a majority on our sideâonly one member of the opposition will speak on this bill. I just wonder if that signals to the electorate the respective support of the government and opposition for (1) this bill, (2) small business and (3) the valuable contribution that small business men and women make to the country, particularly in employing people. It is no secret that this government has been very proactive in making great inroads into the unemployment rates that were left by Labor during their time in office, and we now have record levels of employment in the country.  </para></talk.start><para>I think one of the very strong reasons why this is the case is the success of businesses in Australia that export to the world. I have quite a few businesses in my electorate of Ryan that export to the world. One of the reasons they are able do this is because they have, at the head of those businesses, individuals who are creative, entrepreneurial and very much in favour of business making a contribution to the overall prosperity of our country. </para><para>The EMDG Scheme is the government's principal financial assistance program for small and medium sized exporters. It will continue to make a big difference to our small and medium sized businesses who wish to export our fantastic services, skills and products to the world. It provides grants that reimburse up to 50 per cent of the money spent by eligible exporters during the financial year on specified export promotion activitiesâless, of course, the first $15,000. The scheme has a budget of more than $150 million per annum and it provided some 3,800 grants last year alone. The EMDG Scheme enjoys very strong support in the small business community and, as I have alluded to, in my electorate of Ryan in particular it is a very popular scheme. It is very widely utilised. I know it will continue to have the strong support of small and medium sized businesses in the Ryan electorate. Surveys continue to reflect this, and my interaction with the business community in the Ryan electorate reflects this as well. The scheme has been regularly reviewed and is recognised as a benchmark for effectiveness in government industry support programs in the generation of additional exports.</para><para>The Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2004 contains one measure only, which is designed to ensure that EMDGs do not go to applicants or their associates who are deemed by Austrade as not fit and proper to receive such grants according to ministerial guidelines. Currently, a grant to which an applicant is otherwise entitled is not payable if certain provisions of the EMDG Act apply. For instance, grants are not payable for: export marketing expenses for illegal activities; marketing expenses incurred in the promotion of certain publications, films or computer games that have been classified by the classification board, prohibited or potentially prohibited Internet content, or telephone sex services; and if the applicant is not a resident of Australia, does not have an Australian Business Number, has outstanding disqualifying convictions or is under insolvency administration. The legislation does, however, allow for grants to be paid even though the applicant or an associate of the applicant may be viewed as an inappropriate person to represent or promote the public interest of Australia in relation to trade outside of Australia, or for other reasons to receive, directly or indirectly, the benefits and recognition of a government grant. This bill is good for this country. </para><para>This bill has the wide support of the Ryan electorate and I want to take this opportunity in the parliament to pay tribute to a number of small and medium sized businesses which have profited substantially from the government's support of their initiative and entrepreneurial skills. They are creating employment opportunities in the Ryan electorate, throughout Brisbane and throughout Queensland as well. I want to pay particular tribute to the following companies. Firstly, there is Blue Ribbon Seed and Pulse Exporters, who are based in Pullenvale in the Ryan electorate. They are in the business of cereal grain wholesaling. They are very successful indeed, and they are making great strides there. I also want to acknowledge Double Brown and Associates, who are in the business of book and magazine wholesaling. They are in Bellbowrie, which is also in the Ryan electorate. They are very creative at targeting a niche market and showing what can be done with entrepreneurial flair and by having a go. </para><para>Also in the business of computer software manufacturing is a company called Epitropos Pty Ltd, in Toowong. They are also at the cutting edge of computer software manufacturingâanother good example of a local business in the Ryan electorate that is taking advantage of this scheme. The sum of $5,000 that they received is just a small illustration of how a small amount of money, in their case, can have a large impact on their business and its success in terms of potential employment and potential export dollars for our country.</para><para>In Kenmore, Greenisle Investments Pty Ltd are a consulting engineering services company. They received grants in 2001, 2002 and 2003 of around $40,000. That is a firm that is also doing very well and making the most of this government's support for small business and for cutting edge skills and technology.</para><para>I want to also acknowledge a Mr Peter Howes, who is the principal at HRM Consulting Pty Ltd, based in Taringa. I have had the opportunity of visiting their business and seeing the fantastic work that they do. They are also involved in the computer and high-tech industry. They provide consultancy services to the world, which is remarkable for a smallish business. They started off very small, in the Ryan electorate, and they have now created a reputation for excellence and reliability in the broader international market. They have received EMDG support as well, and I know that they will continue to employ people in the Ryan electorate, as they are looking to expand their services.</para><para>A very interesting business is My Travel Network Pty Ltd, which is engaged in the travel agency business. They are in Toowong. They have received over $100,000. They are another example in my Ryan electorate, of which I am very proud, where there are people who are doing fantastic stuff to employ people and to make a contribution to the Brisbane economy.</para><para>Another very interesting business is Tina Jeffrey Design Pty Ltd, at Fig Tree Pocket. They have only received around $14,000 to $15,000 over two years, yet they have been able to make every use of the dollars provided by the federal government to create a niche market. I have had the pleasure of meeting Alan and Tina Jeffrey at my Ryan small business networking breakfasts. They are in jewellery and silverware manufacturing, and they continue to make the most of the scheme. Only recently, I bumped into Tina at the airport, and she was saying to me that their business is expanding and they are looking to try and employ more young people, in particular, and give them the opportunity of learning their craft, which is the manufacture of jewellery and silverware. That is just another fantastic example of a husband-and-wife team living in Fig Tree Pocket in Ryan, where they are getting off their backsides and actually making a difference to our community. They are employing people and thinking constantly about how they can value add to their businesses. They are receiving the support of the Howard government through this very successful EMDG Scheme, where they are able to promote the Australian brand name.</para><para>I just want to conclude by saying that, in the Ryan electorate, small business and medium sized businesses play a very strong part in the community. They are at the forefront of community work. They are at the forefront of supporting local charities, and they are able to do this because they are flourishing and employing people. They are continuing to make a difference in the local economy, and this gives them the opportunity of also being good business citizens, as it were. I think this has been largely possible because of the climate of good governance and the good policies that the Howard government has been able to implement in its three terms in office. </para><para>I know that local businesses in my electorate will be very supportive of this scheme, and I have every intention of letting them know that only one member of the opposition spoke on this bill in the parliament today. I just hope that that Labor member is not reflective of the opposition's views about small business and the important role that it plays in the Australian economy. I am very pleased to say to the people of Ryan that I will continue to lobby very strongly for EMDG support for them. I know that a number of businesses in the Ryan electorate have come to me for support and assistance in how to make the applications to the government to receive the support. I want to reassure them that I will be working very hard to make sure that the EMDG dollars also come our way.</para><para>In conclusion, I make a comment about the Ryan Small Business and Employment Advisory Committee in my electorate of Ryan. I thank all those who contributed to that, particularly the previous head of Queensland Austrade, who came to address the gathering of Ryan small businesses last year. He talked about the scheme, about the valuable place of exports in the Australian economy, about the importance of Austrade and what it can do for small businesses and about the assistance that Austrade's international offices can provide to small and medium sized businesses who want to venture out of their local community and expand into the big, wide world because of the richness of opportunities that other markets provide for us. His presence at that networking breakfast resulted in one of the biggest attendances that I have had over the two years that I have organised the Ryan small business networking breakfast. I thank him again and look forward to the pleasure of working with his successor, who is new to the job of running Austrade in Queensland, and inviting him to address the Ryan small business community.</para><para>I would like to convey to the Ryan small business community that if there is anything that I am able to do to assist them as their federal number, they have only to pick up the telephone or pop into the office at 31 Station Road and they will have my full support as the federal number for Ryan to assist them. The EMDG Scheme is a fantastic initiative of the federal government. This bill is very good. It provides appropriate support to those who require it and also ensures that it is not a system that is abused and exploited by those who wish to take advantage of the taxpayers of Australia, who are continuing to make small business very important in this country.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>29428</page.no><name role="metadata">Baird, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BAIRD</name><name.id>MP6</name.id><electorate>Cook</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am very pleased to speak on the <inline ref="R2034">Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2004.</inline> I follow up the comments by the member for Ryan and say that it is very interesting to note the dearth of opposition members speaking on issues relating to the economy, taxation, trade and tourism. We have had one speaker from the opposition on this matter and he was out the door faster than Speed Gordon. He hardly spoke. It shows a lack of real focus on the economy and the way in which this economy is built. If you look at Leader of the Opposition's response to the budget, you will see that economic management did not come into it. All of the soft options like reading books to your children were there, but where were the hard yards with regard to building the economy? </para></talk.start><para>Without trade, this nation is in big trouble. Without incentives to get the Australian manufacturers and small business people out there in the marketplace, we also have significant problems. The Export Market Development Grants Scheme has been operating under both sides of the parliament. When the other side were previously in government, they had the scheme. Of course, it has been reformed since we have been in government, and the success is there to be seen. The Howard government have had a very strong and effective record in relation to trade and, since we have been in government, trade has increased by over 40 per cent and now reaches $140 billion, which is a great achievement.</para><para>The areas in which we have been particularly strong include elaborately transformed manufactures, which have gone up by 11 per cent, and processed primary produce, which has gone up by eight per cent. Service sector growth has also been very considerable. Despite the downturns we have seen because of SARS and September 11 and October 12, this year we have seen the benefits of the increased expenditure by the government and a further $235 million being allocated for tourism promotion. It has been well received by the industry. It is this government that expanded the EMDG Scheme to the tourism sector. The education sector has also increased sevenfold since we came to government, which is an amazing achievement. </para><para>The EMDG Scheme has been in operation for some years. The coalition, in coming to government in 1996, changed its operation to maximise the number of companies that would gain benefits, particularly aiming at smaller companies and medium sized enterprises. Following the continuing success of the scheme, a further round of legislation was introduced in 2001 to ensure the ongoing nature of the program, at a cost of $150 million. Last year alone, the scheme contributed to over 3,700 businesses. Those businesses generated $5.5 billion in export revenue and employed over 122,000 people. The overall development of the scheme has been very impressive. Since we changed the scheme in 2001 the number of grant recipients has increased by over 25 per cent. Last year the scheme provided over $800,000 in grants to 20 organisations in my electorate.</para><para>Not only is the government providing real incentives in these areas of activity, it is also working on the free trade agreement, which does not get support from the other side of parliament. Benefits of $4Â½ billion are expected from that agreement. That is a tremendous achievement. We are waiting for the Senate report on the free trade agreement. I think the agreement will be one of the great pluses of the time that this government has been in power. The Australia-Singapore Free Trade Agreement and the Australia-Thai Free Trade Agreement are already in place. </para><para>This bill seeks to add a `fit and proper' test to the selection criteria for potential recipients of the EMDG Scheme. The test will allow the administrators of the scheme to exercise a degree of discretion over the selection of grant recipients to ensure they meet the fit and proper test. Currently a number of guidelines, including criminal convictions and previous insolvency, are assessed. This test adds a further criterion. The test will be subject to further review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The bill also provides secondary power to Austrade to request and obtain information relevant to the assessment of the fit and proper test. </para><para>This bill should be well received by both sides of the House. It is enthusiastically supported by this side of the House. The EMDG Scheme is integral to the overall success of the Australian export industry. Australia's exports continue to grow and expand, having gone up by over 40 per cent since this government has been in power. They are the strength and backbone of this economy. The free trade agreements will add to the vibrancy of our export program. All members of the House should support these changes. This is a technical bill related to the fit and proper criteria. It is part of the ongoing refinement of the EMDG Scheme, which has worked extremely well to assist small and medium sized companies into the marketplace. I commend the bill to the House.  </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>29430</page.no><name role="metadata">Prosser, Geoff, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PROSSER</name><name.id>RI4</name.id><electorate>Forrest</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to support the <inline ref="R2034">Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2004</inline> following my colleagues the members for Cook and for Ryan.

It provides grants that reimburse up to 50 per cent of the money spent by eligible exporters during the financial year on specific export promotion activities, minus the first $15,000. The scheme has a budget of $150.4 million per annum and provides around 4,000 grants each year. Currently, a grant to which an applicant is otherwise entitled is not payable if certain provisions of the EMDG Act apply. These include checks for outstanding disqualifying convictions and insolvency administration. The legislation does, however, allow for grants to be paid, even though the applicant or an associate of the applicant may be viewed as an inappropriate person to represent or promote the public interest of Australia in relation to trade outside Australia, or for other reasons to receive directly or indirectly the benefits and recognition of a government grant. It is considered that paying grants in such cases may lead to the mistaken perception that the government condones disreputable behaviour and supports the individual that engages in it. </para><para>The changes proposed in the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2004 will ensure that Austrade, in accordance with ministerial guidelines, can determine whether the applicant or associate of the applicant is or is not fit and proper to receive a grant. The proposed changes are to take effect for the EMDG claims from the 2003-04 grant year onwards. This means applications received and grants paid from 1 July 2004 onwards. The proposed changes will ensure that the export market development grant funding remains focused on cultivating new exporters and is available to those applicants who are most deserving of assistance from this government. </para><para>I am sure you will agree with me, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, and I am sure the Australian public will also agree with the federal government, that we do not condone disreputable behaviour and we will not support individuals or companies that engage in it. The scheme is consistently hailed as a benchmark of effectiveness in terms of government industry support programs. In recent years it has become increasingly popular with the export community. Last year some 3,700 small and medium sized businesses received grants under the scheme. These businesses generated $5.5 billion in exports and reportedly employed 122,000 Australians. </para><para>The government has a continuing focus on assisting small- and medium-sized Australian businesses. This is evidenced nowhere better than through the EMDG Scheme. Last year, 65 per cent of EMDG recipients were employing 20 people or fewer. Equally importantly, some 860, or 23 per cent, of the grants were paid to businesses in rural and regional Australia. In fact, in my electorate of Forrest in the south west of Western Australia, in the year ending 2003 over 29 companiesâcomprising small and medium enterprises producing export products such as mining, construction machinery, toys and sporting goods, furniture and wood products, meat processing, vegetable exports and of course wine manufactures, for which the south west of Western Australia is famous with its fantastic Margaret River regionâhave been rewarded by this government for their export promotion activities and have received more than $740,000 in grants as reimbursement for their 2001-02 export operations.  These businesses are the quiet, solid achievers and are most deserving of these grants. They are longstanding, well-established businesses operating within my regional electorate. They are the most appropriate businesses to receive benefits and recognition from this government for their continued trade efforts in cultivating export markets.  </para><para>Currently, under the EMDG Act 1997, even if an applicant may otherwise have been eligible for the grant, there are no provisions to determine the circumstances in which a grant will not be paid, such as if the applicant is not a resident of Australia, does not have an Australian business number, has an outstanding disqualifying conviction or is under insolvency administration. The legislation does not presently allow for the non-payment of a grant to an applicant who may be viewed by the Australian community as an inappropriate person to represent and promote the public interest of Australia in relation to trade overseas, whether by reference to his or her trading history or otherwise. </para><para>This government does not condone behaviour considered by the Australian electorate to be inconsistent with acceptable community standards of commercial and personal propriety. We have a duty to taxpayers to ensure that grants paid via government schemes are not paid to recipients other than those who meet these standards. The proposed changes are to take effect for EMDG claims from the 2003-04 EMDG grant year. In other words, this provision will apply to applications received and grants paid from 1 July 2004 on. I commend the bill to the Committee.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>29431</page.no><name role="metadata">Vaile, Mark, MP</name><name role="display">Mr VAILE</name><name.id>SU5</name.id><electorate>Lyne</electorate><party>NATS</party><role>Minister for Trade</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI will wrap up the debate on the <inline ref="R2034">Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2004</inline> in the Main Committee. I would like to thank members from both sides for their contributions. It goes without saying that the EMDG Scheme has been a very successful scheme and continues to be so. It is certainly supported wholeheartedly by the government. We always should be vigilant in looking for new and improved ways of delivering assistance, particularly to new entrants into the export marketing regime. Each year, the federal government commits $150.4 million to help several thousand small and medium sized businesses develop sustainable export markets, through the assistance given under the Export Market Development Grants Scheme. The EMDG Scheme is extremely popular within the exporter community and is consistently hailed as a benchmark of effectiveness in terms of government industry support programs.</para></talk.start><para>The coalition government do not believe that EMDG funds should be paid to persons whose behaviour is inconsistent with accepted community standards of commercial and personal propriety. We have a duty to the taxpayers who fund the EMDG Scheme to ensure that grants are not paid to persons who do not meet these standards. The Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2004 ensures that we fulfil this obligation by providing that grants are not payable where the applicant or the applicant's associates are deemed by Austrade to be not fit and proper persons to receive a grant. Austrade's power to apply this provision will of course be exercised within an appropriate framework. Austrade will only be able to make these decisions with reference to ministerial guidelines, and affected applicants will have the right to appeal Austrade's decision. The consent of an applicant or his or her associates will be required prior to Austrade undertaking criminal or other relevant checks. Austrade will only be able to apply this new provision to applications received from 1 July 2004 onwards. </para><para>The bill contains important amendments to the EMDG Act 1997. It will ensure that the export market development grants funding is not provided to individuals or businesses that do not merit government recognition or taxpayer support and that it remains focused on cultivating small and emerging exportersâthat is, those businesses most deserving of taxpayer-funded support. In conclusion, this is a refinement to the act and we believe it is worth while supporting it to make sure we properly target the assistance that is being funded by taxpayers. I commend the bill to the House.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a second time. </para><para>Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without

The <inline ref="S406">Australian Federal Police and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2004</inline> has two aims: firstly, to achieve the legislative integration of the Australian Protective Service and the Australian Federal Police and, secondly, as the minister outlined, to enable the AFP to investigate state offences that have a federal aspect. The opposition has indicated support for this legislation, both from the point of view of general criminal law enforcement and significantlyâand unfortunately in this day and ageâin respect of potential terrorist offences.</para></talk.start><para>Firstly, we note that the process of the integration of the APS into the AFP began in 2002 when the APS became an operational division of the AFP, as outlined by the minister, and the AFP commissioner replaced the Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department as the head of that agency. The bill will complete the integration process by bringing Protective Service officers under the Australian Federal Police Act and repealing the Australian Protective Service Act. The integration of the AFP and the APS has long had Labor's support. Indeed, it was part of our commitment prior to the 2001 election. The bill amends the AFP Act to create a new agency of AFP employee protective service officer and to confer the existing functions, powers and duties of the APS on those officers.</para><para>The Public Service Commissioner will make a determination under section 72 of the Public Service Act that APS officers cease to be Public Service employees and become employees of the AFP. Under that section the transferred employees will be entitled to remuneration and employment conditions no less favourable than they enjoyed before the transfer. We again note, as the minister noted, the valuable work of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. With respect to this matter and a number of other quite controversial and complex pieces of legislation, that committee, in particular in recent years, has done a truly outstanding job on behalf of the parliament overall and ultimately the Australian people.</para><para>I note that to give effect to the requirement the AFP Commissioner will make determinations under section 24 of the Public Service Act and section 27 of the Australian Federal Police Act 1979, preserving the remuneration and employment conditions currently in force under the section 170MX award as currently applying to the APS, as the minister outlined.</para><para>In terms of the Senate committee inquiry to which I have referred, the bill raises fairly complex issues of industrial law. The committee was assisted by evidence from the CPSU, representing APS officers; the Australian Federal Police Association; the Australian Government Solicitor; the Australian Federal Police; and the Attorney-General's Department. The committee welcomed the fact that employee representatives appear to have been consulted more extensively on the development of this bill than they have been in the past. I think it is fair to say that all sides approached the amalgamation, if you like, of the two bodies from a position of good faith and with a view to preserve continuity of employment conditions.</para><para>The Senate committee inquiry presented an opportunity for any outstanding concerns to be raised. I will not discuss all of those but will focus on the key issue before the committee, which was the impact of the bill on the employment, understandably, of those transferring APS officers. As I mentioned, the bill uses the machinery in the Public Service Act and the AFP Act to effect a transfer of the employment conditions currently in force under the section 170MX award under the provisions of the Workplace Relations Act. The committee recognised the desirability of all AFP staff being employed under an integrated employment framework to provide operational cohesion to the newly integrated agency, and that has to have merit. However, the committee was troubled by the uncertainty faced by APS transferees in the transitional period until a new certified agreement is negotiated to cover the integrated work force. </para><para>It emerged from evidence given by the CPSU, representing transferring APS officers, that there is still concern on the part of these officers about their capacity to maintain their safety net of remuneration and conditions and to access independent review of AFP decisions that affect employment arrangements during this transition period. There was a strong concern that the AFP would be given a free hand to make unilateral decisions altering the remuneration and conditions and that those affected would not be able to seek review of those decisions by the relevant independent authority, which in the AFP is a board of reference constituted under the Workplace Relations Act. It is not fair to the APS transferees to face such an uncertainty and it is plainly against the national interest for people tasked with such a critical protective security role to experience such a fundamental insecurity in their employment arrangements.</para><para>On these issues the committee made two relevant recommendations: firstly, that the government clarify that there are no legal obstacles to the conferral of jurisdiction on the board of reference to settle disputes over the remuneration and conditions of APS transferees and, secondly, that in light of these concerns about the employment of APS transferees the AFP report back to the committee within 12 months on the progress of the integration. In response, the Minister for Justice and Customs in the Senate, on the issue of whether there would be any legal obstacle to the conferral of jurisdiction on the board of reference, noted:</para><quote><para>Upon examination of this issue it became clear that, given the AFP board of reference was provided for under the current AFP certified agreement, it would have no application to APS transferees at the time of transfer. However, advice received by the AFP following consultation before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission made it clear that the disputes procedures set out in the Workplace Relations Act will apply in their entirety to APS transferees.</para></quote><para>I note that, shortly before I rose to speak, the Minister for Trade made a similar point in his speech. We take thisâboth the quote that I have read out and the minister's statement in the Main Committee todayâto mean that, in the transitional period, APS transferees will retain full access to the Industrial Relations Commission for the full range of disputes that could otherwise be brought before the board of reference if the AFP certified agreement applied to those transferees. I would, however, ask the minister or his representative to clarify in the closing remarks that this is a correct analysis of the situation. I should note that concerns continue to be expressed to us on behalf of APS transferees about the uncertainty of their arrangements in the transitional period. I again make the point that not only is it unfair to these employees to leave them in a state of some anxiety about their future but such a situation inevitably has potential security implications, given the vital counter-terrorism role that Australian Protective Service officers fulfil. They are entitled at the very least to be assured and reassured that the employment security and conditions to which they were previously entitled will continue under the new arrangements.</para><para>Before concluding, I will again record Labor's support for the second aspect of this bill, which is to enable the AFP to investigate state offences that have a federal aspect. This refers to the situation where either the subject matter of the offence is a subject on which the Commonwealth has the constitutional power to legislate or the investigation of the state offence is incidental to the investigation of a federal or territory offence. This measure gives effect to a resolution of the April 2002 Leaders Summit on Terrorism and Multijurisdictional Crime, as was noted by the minister. It remedies the potential duplication of police resources that presently arises where the AFP and state police services need to investigate different aspects of the same criminal conduct, and it has Labor's full support. Again, through our support for this legislation in the Main Committee, we will endeavour to expedite its passage. </para><para>At this point, I will address a point made by the minister in his remarks regarding the government's acceptance of recommendations suggested by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, supporting amendments that implement those recommendations. I will address the government's rejection of a minor party amendment affirming the right of the Australian Federal Police Commissioner to express an honestly held view. We do so by expressing our disappointment that the government is moving an amendment that will negate or remove that minor party amendment. In so expressing our disappointment, we do, however, recognise that the legislation is otherwise important legislation, and we will not be opposing its passage simply as a result of the government moving its amendment to negate that provision going to the ability of the Australian Federal Police Commissioner to express his honestly held view. </para><para>I will comment on that matter given that it was raised by the minister. I note that Australians will not forget the way in which Commissioner Keelty was harangued and slanderedâand I think there are no other words that are appropriate for thatâby Howard government ministers simply for expressing an honestly held view about the possible connection between the unfortunate Madrid bombings and the Iraq conflict. The commissioner was certainly entitled to raise in public discussions questions as to what may be a motivation for criminal conduct and indeed to canvass what may be a motivation for terrorist conduct. The public know that the government's bullyingâand again it is not an understatement to use that wordâhad a devastating effect and led the commissioner to consider his resignation. In circumstances where Commissioner Keelty has truly been a champion on behalf of the Australian public, not only in the fight against organised crime but in particular in the fight against terrorism, that resignation, had it eventuated, would as an outcome have been a major setback for Australia in the fight against terrorism.</para><para>In seeking to remove the provision that was introduced by an amendment from the Democrats, the government has raised a few eyebrows by expressing concern, as the minister indicated, that the provision might afford protection to racially discriminatory opinions. After all, less than 18 months ago one of the government's own number, Senator Lightfoot, was found by the Federal Court to have made statements about Indigenous Australians which breached the Racial Discrimination Act. For those wanting to ascertain the facts about that case, I would refer the Main Committee to the judgment of Justice Carr in McGlade v. Lightfoot, which was a decision of the Federal Court issued on 26 November 2002 and which was not appealed.</para><para>At the time, neither the Prime Minister nor the Attorney-General, the Minister for Justice and Customs and the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs showed the slightest concern for Senator Lightfoot's conduct, which was found to be unlawful. But given the reasons now advanced by the government for opposing these provisions giving freedom of speech, if you like, to the police commissionerâgiven the minister's comments that any such racially discriminatory comments by the police commissioner, whomever that may be, would be justification for removal from officeâI look forward to Senator Lightfoot's swift disendorsement by the Liberal Party for his comments. </para><para>Of course, if the government were genuinely concerned about the Democrat amendment for the reason that they have claimed, it would be a simple matter for them to move a further amendment clarifying that the freedom of speech did not go so far as to endorse or make acceptable comments that were otherwise unlawful. The fact that the government have not done so indicates that they are really only concerned to avoid the embarrassment of having to confront what was unquestionably disgraceful treatment of Commissioner Keelty every time that the parliament is required to consider amendments to the Australian Federal Police Act. We believe the government are wrong to be foreshadowing moving this amendment but again, as I have indicated, in view of the importance of completing the APS-AFP integration and giving the AFP appropriate powers of cross-jurisdictional investigation, we will not be opposing the passage of the bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>29438</page.no><name role="metadata">Somlyay, Alex, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SOMLYAY</name><name.id>ZT4</name.id><electorate>Fairfax</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI will not speak on the amendments because they have been adequately covered by the Minister for Trade. The <inline ref="S406">Australian Federal Police and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2004</inline> is part of the government's concerted and coordinated campaign against the threat of terrorism and multijurisdictional crime. The bill has two purposes. Firstly, it completes the integration of the Australian Protective Service into the Australian Federal Police by amending a number of acts and repealing the Australian Protective Service Act 1987. Secondly, it enables the Australian Federal Police to investigate state offences with a federal aspect. The Australian Federal Police, the AFP and the Australian Protective Serviceâthe APSâplay key roles in keeping Australia safe. They are integral to our ability to fight terrorism, transnational crime and organised crime. Their work in peacekeeping missions in places like the Solomon Islands, East Timor and Cyprus contributes significantly to our regional security. I also acknowledge their work in our external territories.</para></talk.start><para>I would like to take this opportunity to publicly recognise and express appreciation for not just the work done by these men and women but also the courtesy and professionalism with which they do it. I believe that, as members of federal parliament, we should be more conscious than most of the efforts of these officers, particularly in our work and travel environments. Although their duties often converge, the AFP and the APS fulfil very different roles. We talk about integrating the two agencies under the one act, but it is important to understand both the different and convergent roles.</para><para>The APS was established under the Attorney General's Department by the Australian Protective Service Act 1987 to provide such protective and custodial service for or on behalf of the Commonwealth as the minister directs. More specifically, it supplies protective security services at places like Parliament House, the offices and residences of the Prime Minister and the Governor-General, certain foreign embassies and sensitive Defence establishmentsâall of which are considered key targets for possible terrorist attacks. Very importantly, the APS also provides counter-terrorism first response at designated airports around Australia. However, its duties are to guard and protect, not to investigate crime and pursue criminals. </para><para>The AFP, on the other hand, enforces Commonwealth criminal law and protects our national interests from crime in Australia and overseas. Its priorities are set by ministerial direction and include enforcing laws relating to terrorism, organised and transnational crime, major fraud, illicit drug trafficking and e-crimeâelectronic crime. However, as well as this criminal work, it also provides some personal protective services. After the September 11 attack, the government reviewed Australia's security and counter-terrorism arrangements and determined that the APS should be transferred from the Attorney General's Department to become an operating division of the AFP. Although a distinction is still maintained between traditional policing and investigative functions, on the one hand, and protective services functions, on the other hand, the transfer allows the closest possible coordination between the two agencies.</para><para>This closer coordination must enhance the effectiveness in fulfilling their counter-terrorism responsibilities. The first stage of the transition occurred on 1 July 2002 when the APS Act was amended to transfer legal and financial responsibility for the APS from the Secretary of the Attorney General's Department to the AFP commissioner. However, although the legal and financial responsibilities were transferred by this legislation, the two agencies continued to operate under separate legislative and employment arrangements. The functions, powers and duties, as well as the terms and conditions of employment, continued to be set out by a different act for each agency.</para><para>This bill is the final stage of the transition, transferring the functions, powers, duties and employment terms for APS officers to the Australian Federal Police Act 1979. This move is in no way controversial; it has the support of the opposition. Over the last two years, parliament has already passed several pieces of legislation towards the same end, and the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee prepared a report on this bill last month recommending that it be agreed to. Schedule 1 of the bill contains clauses amending the AFP Act to insert references to the positions of protective service officer and special protective service officer where required and to incorporate into the act, from the APS Act, the existing functions, powers and duties of the protective service officers.</para><para>Some protective service powers and duties were amended a few months ago when the Australian Protective Service Amendment Act 2003 was passed. But this bill is not amending or extending powers. It is simply transferring them from one act to another. It is transferring existing powers previously individually discussed and passed by this parliament. Sometimes the language may be different, but the substance is not. This bill does, however, add some definitions to the AFP Act for clarity. Some definitions reflect terms or offences already defined under the APS Act. Others, such as the definitions of `frisk search' and `ordinary search', have the same meaning as definitions used in the Crimes Act 1914. This simply provides clarity and uniformity, not change.</para><para>While schedule 1 of the bill amends the AFP Act to incorporate APS officers, their functions and duties, schedule 2 repeals the APS Act and deals with consequential amendments to 11 other acts. Because Protective Service officers carry out functions under a range of other Commonwealth legislation, these amendments are necessary to ensure the continuation of those existing functions. The powers and duties remain the same, but, when this bill is passed, any reference in other legislation to `the APS Act' must be changed to `the AFP Act'.</para><para>The second purpose of this bill is encompassed in schedule 3, which proposes to amend both the AFP Act and the Crimes Act 1914 to enable the AFP to investigate state offences with a federal aspect. These amendments implement a recommendation by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General and the Australian Police Ministers Council joint working groupâthat is, they have been recommended by the states so there is no conflict of interest. They are already reflected in other Commonwealth legislation. The joint working group recommended:  </para><quote><para>The Australian Federal Police (AFP) can best be given the power to investigate state offences incidental to multi-jurisdictional crime by amending the Commonwealth legislation to allow the AFP to utilize Commonwealth investigative powers to investigate State offences with a federal aspect.</para></quote><para>These amendments will enable the AFP to investigate the totality of the criminal conduct where the state offences have a federal aspect. A federal aspect exists if the subject matter of the offence is a subject on which the Commonwealth has constitutional power to legislate or where the investigation of the state offence is incidental to an investigation of a Commonwealth or territory offence. According to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee's report, this proposal has the support of the AFP, state police and the Attorney-General's Department. The Senate committee also supported these amendments. </para><para>If the AFP have spent considerable time investigating a matterâmaybe monthsâand then find there is a state matter which needs to be dealt with, this amendment enables them to deal with it instead of having to bring in another police force, duplicating work already done in investigating different aspects of the same criminal conduct. It makes sense and allows better management of our law and enforcement resources.</para><para>This bill is about national security and good management. The fight against potential terrorism and multijurisdictional crime is unrelenting and expensive. We need to organise our resources as effectively as possible. We need coordination and cooperation. We do not need duplication. The amendments to this bill encourage cooperation and coordination, while at the same time discouraging duplication. For instance, bringing the APS under the umbrella of the AFP allows, and indeed encourages, far closer coordination and cooperation between the agencies. Having both agencies report to the same authority also diminishes the likelihood of duplication. Similarly, the schedule 3 amendments encourage cooperation between the AFP and state or territory police forces. Duplication is eliminated by allowing the AFP to deal with certain state matters that might arise during their investigations. This bill is about protecting Australia in the best way we can and about managing our protective resources as effectively as possible. I commend the bill to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>29440</page.no><name role="metadata">Grierson, Sharon, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GRIERSON</name><name.id>00AMP</name.id><electorate>Newcastle</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak on the <inline ref="S406">Australian Federal Police and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2004</inline>.

The purpose of this legislation is to enhance the powers of our federal law enforcement agencies to investigate multijurisdictional crime and to enable the Australian Federal Police to investigate state offences that have a federal aspect. The outcome of this legislation, if it is effective, will be better coordination of the activities of our federal law enforcement and protective agencies. That outcome is one we would all hope is achieved to keep our nation secure.</para></talk.start><para>The two agencies that are being integrated are the workplaces of approximately 5,000 people. The agencies have had different and overlapping roles and it is important to know that, when they are integrated, the roles will become more defined, better understood and perhaps complementary to each other. Perhaps that has been the case, but now we need further assurances. The Australian Protective Service have a major challenge in our new security environment and we expect a great deal more from the protective security services provided here at Parliament House, and for our senior representativesâour Prime Minister and Governor-Generalâas well as at airports used by ordinary Australians every day. There is a need to see a greater presence of protective security services in maritime areas and in ports around Australia as well. </para><para>In looking at the changed environment and the need to integrate these two agencies, the opposition has been very supportive of this legislation. We do live in a changed global security environment and we are particularly aware of that in Australia. That has occurred since the September 11 tragedy in the United States. Following that terrorist attack, the Commonwealth government reviewed Australia's security and counter-terrorism arrangements. As a result of that review, as we have heard, the government determined that the Australian Protective Service should transfer from the Attorney-General's Department and become an operating division of the Australian Federal Police. The stated reason for that should of course be the test for this legislation. That reason was that it would allow the closest possible coordination between two of Australia's key counter-terrorist agencies. Better coordination between the AFP and the APS, it was proposed, would strengthen both organisations and their ability to fulfil their counter-terrorism responsibilities. </para><para>There has been a staged process of integration, and many of the members who have spoken already in this debate have outlined that process. The most recent change was in February 2003, when the protection portfolio was established inside the AFP. That is now where we are going to see some major impact with the new involvement of the Protective Service personnel. Since July 2002, joint operations and joint deployments have taken place and they have been experiences that, I hope, have allowed the Australian Federal Police to test that coordination and integration need and therefore make sure the transition process is a meaningful and successful one. </para><para>The most well known of those was the APS's involvement as part of Operation Alliance in Bali. I think that is worth revisiting, because the response to the Bali bombings was one of the most significant operations ever undertaken by Australian law enforcement agencies. It was led by the Australian Federal Police. It was a multijurisdictional response by Commonwealth, state and territory law enforcement agencies and it was a multinational response as well, which included our agencies working with agencies from as many as 10 countries. So we have had that test. We have to make sure that that responseâwhich I think deserves great praise and acknowledgment as a job well doneâis carried on now, not as a response but as a proactive approach that hopefully can prevent such incidents from happening again.</para><para>There have been other joint operations, which we should remind each other and the public of because there are many unsung heroes in the APS and the Australian Federal Police. For the people of Canberra and the ACT the January 2003 bushfires were a very important example of where the APS and the AFP assisted. Also, the deployment of the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Protective Service to the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands is an ongoing joint operation. It is one that we would hope would reassert and reaffirm Australia's commitment to its neighbours, not in a paternalistic or custodial way but in a joint partnership. They are major challenges being taken up by all our federal agencies. The other major involvement was providing AFP and APS security for the visits of President Bush and President Hu in October last year. </para><para>The opposition do accept that there is a need to change and to better coordinate our security, protective services and policing. We also assert that getting the balance right between protectionism and freedoms and a Public Service or a Commonwealth sector that works without fear or favour is particularly important. I will visit some of those issues in this speech. But the opposition have supported the legislation although we have taken on several concerns that were reinforced by, and explored very well in, the Senate inquiry. For me, those concerns are training, competencies and the definition of roles. There are internal, administrative and ongoing challenges for management. As an observer I know the standout examples, the big ones that I have just mentioned, but I also know some of the minor areasâI will mention them later in my speechâthat I have concerns about. Getting the training, the competencies and the roles defined and making sure we get the best outcomes are concerns that I hold.</para><para>The other major area of concern has been the industrial area. The concerns of the CPSU were put forward at the Senate inquiry. They were concerned about workers in the Australian Protective Service achieving parity, having defined career paths, having some certainty about potential redundancies and having their entitlements and conditions protected. The APS officers will cease to be Public Service employees; they will become employees of the Australian Federal Police. They need to be assured that when they are transferred all entitlements, remunerations and employment conditions will be no less favourable to them. That has been explored at length by the Senate inquiry. I am sure that the AFP will be mindful of those concerns and the uncertainties that APS personnel face. I hope that they will be aware that those people have served well and need to be given some certainty to motivate them to give their best service to the AFP.</para><para>The committee noted that the AFP have no intention to make any officer redundant on transfer. Unfortunately, in the industrial environment we always experience that guarantee and it generally lasts for 12 months. We would want to make sure that we did not see change in that area. Very importantly, the committee also recommended that they review the progress of this integration within 12 months and reconvene to examine those concerns that have been raised. They recommended that the report to the committee should include an examination of the commercialisation of the Protective Service function. That has been a particular and major concern. Commercial tendering for services is an established practice by the Australian Protective Service. They have traditionally had a reliance on commercialisation for approximately 70 per cent of their budget. It is important that any tendering processes be separately accounted forâthat any commercial transactions and commercial tendering processes be audited in a transparent way and have some independent oversight. It is a concern that I know the Australian Federal Police are very much aware of. It is certainly one that needs to be revisited in a review process.</para><para>In applying this legislation I think it is important for backbenchers like me to make note of the real-life situations that we come across in our daily lives that affect us as members of parliament and affect the people we represent. Every day at regional airports we see the presence of the Protective Service. In Newcastle Airport I see exemplary and professional approaches every day.</para><para>In the area of maritime security in our ports, I have a particular concern. If we have a new coordinated approach, it has to be a proactive one, and that has to involve communities. It has to involve working with sectors that are affected and are at the front line of security. Port users particularly are one of those sectors, yet I see very little APS or AFP presence in the regional Port of Newcastle. As a matter of fact, in Newcastle we have one Australian Federal Police officer who sits in a Centrelink office looking for fraud, I am toldâperhaps by people cheating on their family tax benefitsâor overseeing people's social security entitlements are correct. I am very dissatisfied with that sort of involvement in my own region, a region of half a million people, a region that has a major port that is responsible for over 50 per cent of the economic wealth of the state of New South Walesâa port that also deals with explosives, grains and fertilisers. </para><para>I particularly think that coordination of a proactive approach is essential, and I would certainly like to see that. We do have a Protective Service presence, but it is limited. Yet we do have a Family Court, we do have 31 Centrelink workplaces in the Hunter region and we do have Customs, Quarantine and AMSA. We also obviously have drug enforcement activities, consideration of illegal fishing activities, Family Court judges, Family Court magistrates and members of parliament and their officers. And I would have to say, on the public record, that I do not think there is a proactive approach. I would like to see that improved.</para><para>I would also like to raise other experiences that happen in this House. In Parliament House, as a member of parliament, I am always treated by the Australian Protective Service personnel with professionalism and courtesy. But there have been incidents that have occurred in parliament, in the chamber, that I have some concerns about, so I am raising them to make sure that some response is forthcoming.</para><para>When we watch people during times of war, we always see division in our communities, and we have seen that. We have seen it in our public gallery. People do have concerns and people are anxious. People are distressed over the decisions sometimes taken by this parliament. We have seen the removal of citizens, and I cite the most recent incident, where a woman was removed from the public gallery. I have concerns that procedures are perhaps not well enough established to be followed instantaneously without unnecessary aggression or undue force. So a person who did rise to express her obvious distress about an issue was instantly removedâtouched, physically. I did not see any attempt to engage with that person to calm them, to speak with them, or perhaps to explain to them what the expectation is. The removal from the chamber was, I consider, less than gentle, so much so that personnel did come back to pick up teeth from the floor of the gallery. For the government members who perhaps look at me surprised, the incident was not in their view. It is distressing, and I would like to know that procedures are put into place in this House that mean that security is adhered to, but in a way that is perhaps a best practice model for anywhere in Australia.</para><para>The other instanceâand the member for Hunter, one of my colleagues, has raised this with the Speaker on several occasionsâwas the bringing into the gallery of a camera during the visit of President Bush. It does seem to us, sitting there, that we rely on the screening. We want the public to be in the galleries, we want them to express themselves, we want them to be part of the process hereâit is the public's house, the people's houseâbut we do not want them to ever bring in anything that can cause risk to the people we work with every day. A camera, being a metal object, should not have been allowed into that public gallery, and it does pose a risk. I think the members and the staff of this House need a very full explanation of how that was allowed to happen. </para><para>Finally, I also support the comments of the member for Barton that the amendment put forward in the Senateâby the Democratsâasserting that the freedom of the Australian Federal Police Commissioner to make public statements that are founded on the experience and knowledge of the police commissioner should not be fettered or restricted in any way. You would think that it normally would not be necessary to state that. But it was a very regrettable incident when Mick Keelty was publicly harangued and admonished by the Prime Minister. We would like to know that our senior public servants and senior representatives in our federal agencies, particularly in the area of security and policing, do their job without fear or favour, that they do it for the protection of the Australian people and in the best interests of the security of this nation. </para><para>In conclusion, the opposition does support this legislation. The coordination and integration of these two agencies is essential. It is a case of excellent initiatives being taken by two very different agencies. Without legislation they took the process into their own hands in many ways and moved it forward. The only concern we would have is that the process of integration should be reviewed, as recommended by the Senate inquiry, and that its effectiveness be guaranteed and assured for the Australian people by that review process. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>29444</page.no><name role="metadata">Dutton, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DUTTON</name><name.id>00AKI</name.id><electorate>Dickson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt is with a great deal of pleasure that I rise to support the <inline ref="S406">Australian Federal Police and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2004</inline>. It underlines the government's commitment to the ongoing upgrade of professionalism and the drive towards efficiency in relation to our law enforcement agencies. At the outset I take the opportunity to offer my congratulations to the Australian Federal Police Commissioner, Mr Mick Keelty, for his foresight and for the ability he has brought to the Australian Federal Police in driving reform such as that which is before the House today. </para></talk.start><para>The bill before the parliament today came about at least in part because of a review conducted after the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States and a general overview undertaken by the federal government in relation to the responses we provided through law enforcement agencies against the evils of terrorism. The bill provides the ability for the Australian Protective Service to enhance not just their skills but their professionalism, the access that they have to intelligence databases, the way in which they respond to any sort of terrorist incident or deal with people committing offences in relation to assets owned by the Commonwealth. </para><para>The government's commitment to stamping out terrorism and to providing as much certainty as possible for the Australian people over the coming decades is supported not just by the detail of this bill but by some of the projects that have been undertaken by the Australian Federal Police and law enforcement agencies across this country. I want to take this opportunity to speak about some of those initiatives and about the way in which this government has supported the initiatives of the Australian Federal Police to provide a credible, effective law enforcement response to criminals, to terrorism, to organised crime and to its overall aim of providing a safer community for all Australians to live in. </para><para>The first example I cite is the Australian Federal Police effort in a joint operation in the Philippines. In April this year we signed a protocol with Philippines law enforcement agencies to launch a $3.65 million project to help build the country's counter-terrorism capacity. The project was designed to build the capacity of Philippines law enforcement agencies in intelligence sharing, bomb investigation techniques, forensic capacity and other counter-terrorism areas at both strategic and operational levels. The project underlines the key strategy of the AFP's Law Enforcement Cooperation Program to strengthen collaboration between Australia's partners in the Asia-Pacific region and to help develop their counter-terrorism and transnational crime capabilities. This government remain committed to fighting terrorism. We remain committed to supporting the Australian Federal Police in their efforts to counter terrorism throughout the Asia-Pacific region. </para><para>If we are realistic in our understanding of the way in which terrorist cells operate, we will know that the countries which are our closest neighbours may well be the very places in which these cells decide to operate. It is important that the Australian Federal Police be supported in their ongoing push to try and have an understanding and develop relationships with our closest partners and help them stamp out the evils of terrorism and organised crime as they arise on their own soil. In February this year, the Australian Federal Police International Deployment Group was formed to strengthen Australia's ability to fight terrorism and transnational organised crime and contribute to regional peacekeeping missions. The IDG will enable the strategic deployment of personnel undertaking peacekeeping operations, restoration of law and order missions and the delivery of capacity-building initiatives in the region.</para><para>One of the most important aspects of the work of the Australian Federal Police and bodies like the APS and the ACC, and indeed the state law enforcement bodies and many other federal law enforcement bodies, is in relation to drugs and stamping out the evils of drugs as they present themselves in our community. In particular, a focus of this government has been working hard in areas like Dickson with state law enforcement agencies to stamp out drug dealers and people who would prosper from human misery by dealing drugs to children within our local communities. It is a great credit to the Australian Federal Police that in April of this year, following a major investigation, they recorded one of their largest seizures of LSD. Federal agents seized approximately 190 millilitres of suspected liquid LSD and over 212,000 tabs of paper allegedly being prepared for LSD distribution. That had the potential to make almost four million doses of LSD, which would have had a street value of approximately $45 million.</para><para>Federal agents and Queensland police drug squad detectives arrested five people on the Gold Coast in March after a cooperative investigation prevented what is believed to be the largest ever attempted illegal importation of pseudoephedrine into Australia. The investigation also involved the Australian Customs Service and the Philippines Drug Enforcement Agency and resulted in about 1.5 tonnes of pseudoephedrine being seized in the Philippines, which federal agents will allege was destined for this country. The operation highlights the commitment of the Australian Federal Police to taking the fight against drugs offshore and preventing them from arriving on our own soil. It demonstrates that our law enforcement agencies are working with their international counterparts through the AFP's overseas liaison officer network, and they are seriously disrupting criminal syndicates.</para><para>The Federal Police continue to work with Customs. Under the provisions of the Customs Act, the AFP recently arrested and charged two women with importing prohibited imports after 5Â½ kilos of capsules containing pseudoephedrine were detected in the lining of two suitcases at Cairns international airport. It is important for all Australians, and especially communities such as the people who live in my electorate of Dickson, to understand that pseudoephedrine, which is a drug which may not mean too much to them, is indeed a precursor to the manufacture of many drugs within this country. It is a precursor to the manufacture of drugs such as amphetamines, which are a major curse on young people within our environment. That and drugs such as heroin and LSDâwhich is an amphetamine based drugâcause no end of damage to young people in this country. As a government and a people we must continue to fight this scourge, which is one of the greatest problems that our youth of today face. </para><para>The budget that was delivered recently underscored this government's commitment to supporting the Australian Federal Police, the old APS and all of these law enforcement bodies in their fight against crime. I was very pleased to see in the government's budget this year that the Howard government delivered further on its strong response to terrorism by committing an additional $754 million over five years to national security initiatives to protect the Australian community. The budget this year also provided new funding with the commitment of an extra $2.3 billion on national security measures since the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the Bali bombings.</para><para>The Howard government's budget this year provided over $350 million of additional funding to agencies in the Attorney-General's portfolio to implement a range of strategic national security measures, which include $127 million to further strengthen the information management and intelligence capacities of ASIO and $36 million to enable the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre, AUSTRAC, to continue to collect, analyse and disseminate financial intelligence to Australia's law enforcement, revenue and national security agencies. It also included over $6 million to continue the operations of the national security hotline.</para><para>This year's budget enhanced regional counter-terrorism capabilities. The government will provide almost $37 million to enhance the offshore response and investigative capacity of the AFP, almost $30 million to establish the Jakarta Centre for Law Enforcement Cooperation, a touch over $21 million for the continued presence of the AFP in Melanesia and $10 million to enable AUSTRAC to provide counter-terrorism financing assistance and information technology mentoring to countries in South-East Asia. Importantly, out of this budget the government will provide funds to strengthen the security of our borders by providing $3 million in 2004-05 to allow the Australian Customs Service, which does tremendous work for this country, to extend the SmartGate trial to a second international airport, for holders of a prototype Australian biometric passport. The government will also provide almost $3 million to enable the Australian Customs Service to board up to 80 per cent of vessels at their first port of arrival in Australia, up from the current rate of 70 per cent. We will provide $3 million to strengthen existing border control measures, and we will provide almost $11 million over two years for the ACS to maintain current rates of container X-ray examination of sea cargo.</para><para>To further enhance protective security arrangements, the government will provide almost $30 million to the Attorney-General's Department to implement initiatives with other agencies so as to coordinate a national approach to critical infrastructure protection. The government will also provide almost $20 million for diplomatic guarding and the purchase of armoured vehicles. The government will provide an additional $15.7 million to enhance the air security officer program, and it will consult with the states and territories to establish a shared arrangement to enhance emergency management capabilities.</para><para>One of the most important measures announced in the budget this year by the Howard government was in relation to the National Community Crime Prevention Program. Today I renew my call to community groups not just within my electorate but right around the country to take note of the National Community Crime Prevention Program and to understand the benefits that it can provide to their local communitiesâhow the program could benefit, for argument's sake, elderly residents within Dickson by enhancing security in local areas where crime problems exist, and how we could help some of those elderly residents feel more secure within their own homes and within their own local communities and environments. If as a government we are able to provide security enhancements in that way, I think we have gone a long way towards achieving what it is that governments are about in this country. </para><para>Crime and the fear of crime consistently rate amongst the highest concerns of the Australian public. Crime is estimated to cost the Australian community around $32 billion per year. This budget is providing over $20 million under the National Community Crime Prevention Program, which will focus on how to increase the ability of Australian communities to recognise local crime problems and to pursue effective, locally organised crime prevention initiatives. The centrepiece of the NCCPP is a new community grants program which will provide support to grassroots projects that are designed to enhance community safety and crime prevention at the local level.</para><para>Under the program, grants will be national and application based, and projects will be classified under the following streams: firstly, a community safety stream, with grants of up to $150,000; secondly, an Indigenous community safety stream, with grants of up to $150,000; and, finally, a community partnership stream, with grants of up to $500,000 to support promising and innovative collaborative community safety and crime prevention demonstration projects in high-need areas. To encourage partnerships across sectors and shared responsibility, the community partnership stream will not fund 100 per cent of project costs, and financial and in-kind contributions would need to be made by other community and government agencies. Grant funding is non-recurrent and is available for projects of up to three years duration. The distribution of funding between these streams is flexible and will be determined during the assessment process, based on the merit of individual applications, eligible organisations and projects, not-for-profit incorporated community based local government organisations, associations or agencies.</para><para>In commending this bill to the House today, I say once again that this government have demonstrated over the last eight years that we remain committed to providing for a safer community for all Australian people to enjoy and that we, as a government, will continue over the course of the next term, after this year's election, to provide enhanced services and all sorts of continued and enhanced abilities for law enforcement and intelligence agencies to fight crime and terrorism wherever it is. I say to the people of Dickson today that I remain committed as their member of parliament, representing their interests, and that the government are committed to fighting crime in our local communities. We can do this through supporting good legislation, such as we have before the parliament today.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>29448</page.no><name role="metadata">Hunt, Gregory, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HUNT</name><name.id>00AMV</name.id><electorate>Flinders</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn rising to speak on the <inline ref="S406">Australian Federal Police and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2004</inline>, I want to make three principle points. The first is to talk about the role of the AFP, the second is to talk about the role of crime prevention within Australia more generally and the third is to examine the specific provisions within this bill which assist the AFP and members of the Australian Protective Service to go about their business in a more effective way. </para></talk.start><para>In looking at the Australian Federal Police, this country owes an extraordinary debt of gratitude to those men and women. They work in difficult circumstances, they do the difficult jobs, they place themselves at risk and they do so because of a belief in the need to address the threats in our society and the fact that there are external threats. In that situation it is very important to recognise their work. I want to recognise their work externally and internally. In terms of the external work and obligations of the Australian Federal Police we see, perhaps most cogently and potently within the Australian mind, their work following the tragedy in Bali on 12 October 2002. That act of mass murder has seen an amazing amount of successful police work and investigation.</para><para>It was by no means a given that the perpetrators would be found; it was by no means a given that, even if the perpetrators were found, they would be brought to justice quickly; and it was by no means a given that the results of the court cases would be such as they have been. On all those fronts the AFP established a cooperative arrangement with the Indonesian authorities. That is something which was unprecedented in its scope and reach, and which led to much more effective policing both within Australia's reach and within Indonesia itself. This was an extraordinary outcome in cooperation and a great response to what was a horrendous and vile act of mass murder. I only hope that any of those who are still at large will be brought to justice through this system.</para><para>In addition to that, looking at the external work of the AFP, we see in the work which they have been doing in the Solomon Islands an extraordinary role in effectively taking a lead on the ground from the Australian military in helping to bring peace, order and, ultimately, a stronger governance arrangement to the people of the Solomon Islands. It is a difficult task and, as you would see from other interventions around the world, it is often fraught with tragic consequences. But these are consequences which have not eventuated on the Solomon Islands. That is a tribute to the civilian personnel, the military personnel and, in particular, the Australian Federal Police and all those associated with the planning and conduct of Operation Helpem Fren. That is one example of the sort of peace and security work with which the Australian Federal Police have been involved.</para><para>If you turn to the internal work of the AFP, you find that the priorities of the Australian Federal Police are sixfoldâto deal with (1) organised crime, (2) transnational crime, (3) money laundering, (4) major fraud, (5) illicit drug trafficking and (6) electronic crime, an emerging area of crime which is effectively borderless. On all those fronts you see a body which is dealing with difficult and challenging tasks but which is making extraordinary steps forward. The work on drug trafficking has been carried out under the Australian government's Tough on Drugs strategy, and it has had an impact on the interception of and amount of heavy drugs being brought into the country. There is a significant amount more to doâmake no mistake about thatâbut the work of the AFP has been critical in having a major impact on the importers and distributors of the worst and most potent drugs in our community.</para><para>That brings me to the second part of this speech, which is about the actions this government is taking in relation to major crime within Australia. There is of course the Tough on Drugs strategy, as was mentioned by and is strongly supported by my friend and predecessor the member for Dickson. One thing that I particularly want to focus on is the National Community Crime Prevention Program. This is a program devised and produced by the Prime Minister's office, with the hand of the Prime Minister very strongly at the tiller. In essence, there are three elements. Firstly, there is the community safety program, which will include grants of up to $150,000. They will be available for community groups, under a competitive tendering system, who can pitch to try to have an impact within their own community on community safety and community security. In particular, I think of my own communities of Somerville and Hastings within the electorate of Flindersâtwo towns where there is a crime problem. I will be launching this program soon in these towns. I strongly urge local community representatives to participate in it and to seek to benefit from it for the building of community programs. Secondly, there is the Indigenous program and, thirdly, there are the large-scale community partnerships of up to half-a-million dollars. The National Community Crime Prevention Program is an important step forwards. It gives Australian communities the chance to work in cooperation with police and to work in cooperation with the broader community to have an impact on local security. </para><para>The third thing I wanted to do was to mention very briefly the essence of this bill. This bill contains amendments to the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 and the Crimes Act 1914. Essentially, it completes the integration of the Australian Protective Service into the Australian Federal Police. The men and women of the Australian Protective Service play an important role in ensuring that some of those who may be high-priority targets for criminals, terrorists or political activists are offered protection. Through my former life I have seen their work close up in action, and I know that the men and women of the Australian Protective Service put themselves at risk. They do so because of a set of beliefs about what we are as a country and beliefs about what is an ethical way to live. I commend them on their work and their efforts.</para><para>In that situation, the bill creates a new category of employee in the Australian Federal Policeâthat is, a protective services officer. It designates protective service functions as functions of the Australian Federal Police. It represents a part of the consolidation of the policing and security actions within the Australian federal system which is a corollary of the fact that policing and security are now inseparable and that some of the questions facing Australia in terms of its long-term security can only be dealt with by cooperative work between ASIO, ASIS and the AFPâthe greater the consolidation and the greater the cooperation, the better. In those circumstances, bringing the protective service functions under the AFP is a very important step forward. All up, I thank the men and women of the Australian Federal Police for their work in Bali, for their work in the Solomons, for their work overseas, particularly for their work within Australia in relation to major crime, and also now for their work in relation to protective services. I commend the bill to the House, and I urge its speedy passage.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>29449</page.no><name role="metadata">McArthur, Stewart, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McARTHUR</name><name.id>VH4</name.id><electorate>Corangamite</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI commend my colleague the member for Flinders and support his remarks about the Australian Federal Police. His knowledge of these matters is greater than mine. I do commend his remarks in terms of the activities of the Australian Federal Police in regard to the Bali bombings and their excellent cooperation with the Indonesians. As I understand it, that was a very successful cooperative venture between both those police forces. Likewise, I support his comments on the activities of the Australian Federal Police in the Solomon Islands and on the internal policing activities of the Australian Federal Police. Also, I commend the member for Dickson for his comments and obvious understanding of these matters, which is due to his professional background in this area. The <inline ref="S406">Australian Federal Police and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2004</inline> will provide greater security for the personnel of the AFP and the Australian Protective Service in their activities with regard to counter-terrorism and drug trafficking. The member for Dickson has a background in this area. I think he provides probably the best knowledge in this parliament, and his contribution was very worthwhile. </para></talk.start><para>My own interest in this bill is from my membership of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD. I have had an ongoing interest in matters of national security. Obviously, this bill and its policy thrust provide an arm for the government of the day to provide security, particularly at airportsâwhich most members of parliament fully understandâaround this parliamentary precinct and in the electorate at large.</para><para>I have a particular interest in national firearms legislation and its possibilities. We should develop a national program that identifies firearms, their location and the owners of those particular firearms. Whilst that is a debate for another day, this legislation is a forerunner of the government's general thrustâand, I think, of those members of the oppositionâthat the Commonwealth is now in a position to take the lead in this whole area of security and firearms legislation. The Howard government took the lead in the firearm buyback in 1996. In my judgment, further progress could be made to ensure that the legal owners of firearms are identified and that they fully understand the law. If we had national legislation, we would be in a better position to deal with those persons in the Australian community who have illegal firearms.</para><para>This legislation also brings to the fore the difficulty that the Australian Federal Police have in dealing with the state police and state jurisdictions. All of us in this parliament would be aware of the difficulty in the fact that state police forces are run and paid for by state governments and are under their control. In recent times we have seen, particularly in Victoria, some considerable debate about the effectiveness or otherwise of state police forces. That leads on to the difficulty that the Australian Federal Police have with cooperation in handling certain crime matters, and it leads to problems of national security.</para><para>We do have an interesting fundamental debate before us today. Although this legislation is of a somewhat technical nature, it does indicate that the government and the opposition, supporting this, are moving towards a situation where the Australian Federal Police become the key element in protecting national securityâthat they provide the wherewithal to investigate crimes including, as other speakers have talked about, drugs crimes which lead to the quite difficult issue of the development of organised crime; so that the Australian Federal Police have that role at the national level as they integrate with the state jurisdiction.</para><para>This bill, whilst it is of a technical nature, does incorporate the thrust that the Australian Federal Police have a role, the Australian Protective Service have a role and, if they could be combined as the bill is suggesting, the integration of these two services will strengthen the ability of both these groups to provide security in this new and modern age. This change in the security and counter-terrorism argument is now upon us. This parliament and the Australian people, although they are somewhat isolated from the rest of the world, are now in the 21st century of terrorism and counter-terrorism. The government needs to ensure that the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Protective Service are well equipped to provide a service activity that will protect Australians, buildings and airports.</para><para>In terms of the details of the bill, this is the final stage of integrating the Australian Protective Service with the Australian Federal Police. It unifies both organisations under the same employment framework, reduces doubling-up, streamlines both organisations for greater efficiency, forms an important part of the government's coordinated approach to reducing red tape in the public sector and strengthens our approach to tackling terrorism. The other significant component of the bill will bring about an important resolution of the April 2002 Leaders Summit on Terrorism and Multijurisdictional Crimeâthose matters that I have been referring to. It will enable the Federal Police including the Protective Service to tackle crimes in the states that have a federal aspect. Again, I mentioned that in my earlier remarks. It enables the Federal Police, when investigating a Commonwealth crime, where it becomes apparent that state offences have also been committed, to investigate the crime in its entirety. Many of us in this parliament have come across the difficulty that, because of the jurisdictional problem, there have sometimes been jealousies between the Federal Police and state police forces. </para><para>The background to this is that the Australian Protective Service was established by the Australian Protective Service Act 1987 and is the Commonwealth's most senior provider of protective security services. It covers security of persons and places where the Commonwealth has a security responsibility. The aviation industry is illustrative of an environment where we see the APS at work. As I mentioned, most members of the parliament see that activity at the airports around Australia. The Australian Protective Service provides first response security at airports, diplomatic and consular premises, Defence establishments and other Commonwealth buildings. While the Australian Protective Service has a primary responsibility for these activities, they also come within the jurisdiction of the Australian Federal Police. It is important to identify similarities between these two functions. The need to integrate the Australian Protective Service with the Australian Federal Police has come about in a government strategy to protect all Australians in light of the heightened terrorist activity in other parts of the world, such as the recent railway bomb blasts in Madrid and previous attacks on Australia's allied nations. All of us are aware of that attack in Madrid. Whilst the intelligence was reasonable, that attack showed what horrendous possibilities there are to bring about major carnage and damage on civilian installations.</para><para>In response to heightened threats to Australia's security, the bill completes the final stages of merging the Australian Protective Service and the Australian Federal Police. The bill will ultimately strengthen the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Protective Service as one unified outfit to deal with the war against terror. And I think we would all be very supportive of that. Following the Cornall review in 2001, the government determined that the Australian Protective Service should move from the Attorney-General's Department to the Australian Federal Police. In turn, this has implications for the employment framework of the Australian Protective Service and its needs, which are addressed by this bill.</para><para>The Australian Protective Service employees are part of the Public Service. The final stage of the integration with the AFP involves the creation of a new category of employee, which will be known as protective service officer. This will be included in the Australian Federal Police Act. The protective service functions of a protective service officer will fold into the functions of the Australian Federal Police. I have no doubt that there will be some difficulty on the ground but, hopefully, there will be an air of cooperation between those two groups.</para><para>The benefits of one employment framework will include a streamlined employment function containing greater efficiency for employees and the unified approach to the functions of the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Protective Services. Given that the Australian Protective Service will integrate into the Australian Federal Police and the powers under the Australian Federal Police Act, the Australian Protective Service Act will be repealed. The current remuneration and other employment conditions before transfer will continue to stand as they were under the previous legislation. </para><para>The bill also implements a resolution of the April 2002 leaders summit. The leaders agreed to develop key legislative steps towards administrative arrangements that would enable the Australian Federal Police to investigate state offences that contain a federal aspect. Again, I mentioned that in my earlier remarks and I think that is a very good step in the right direction. These matters would include a matter that is incidental to the investigation of a federal or territory offence, such as espionage, sabotage or threats to national security. Relevant in light of the heightened security to Australia is the fact that the important change and ongoing policing activity by this new group allows the Federal Police to investigate crimes in the states that have a federal aspect so that they may be investigated in their totality without having to brief or hand over to other authorities midway through a serious investigation.</para><para>Again, I think all members would be aware of the difficulties that have been faced by state and federal jurisdictions when the investigation of serious crimes has been held up because of this jurisdictional difficulty and because of the jealousies of certain police forces. Hopefully, there is a movement to greater philosophic understanding that we need to handle terrorism on a national level and that the parochialism of state police forces needs to be channelled into a national asset.</para><para>The amendments in the bill are replications of the provisions that stand in the Australian Protective Service Act and relate to the functions and powers of the APS and its officers. The thrust of these provisions remains as it was in the APS Act. Most of the other provisions in schedule 1amend the Australian Federal Police Act to further detail the definition and give practical effect to the merger of the APS and the AFP. I leave it at that and say that I think all speakers have agreed that the bill is not overly contentious. It brings into effect the government's initiative to respond to the heightened terrorist and sophisticated criminal activity in Australia by merging and consolidating the Australian Protective Service and the Australian Federal Police so that both groups will have the same conditions and so ensure that there is now a robust and more efficient outfit to handle the extent of this.</para><para>At the philosophic level, hopefully this merger will provide a national thrust and ensure that, when we come to handle terrorism and some of the newer threats that police forces and protective services have not encountered before, there will be a new approachâa newer philosophic viewâand, generally, a cooperative approach by both sides of this parliament, by the state and federal authorities and by those hard-working protective officers who have to do the hard work in maintaining surveillance of these installations hour by hour, day by day, month by month. I think this bill can be a reflection of this parliament that we support them, we understand the good work they do and we hope that they do not have to run into any major difficulty. But, given the evidence, it would be anticipated that some incident would happenâeither great or small. Of course, it would be our hope that no great incident would happen here in Australia, but this is a step in the right direction to minimise the damage and ensure that those persons who wish to indulge in terrorism will be brought to account by this new organisation. I commend the bill. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>29453</page.no><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SLIPPER</name><name.id>0V5</name.id><electorate>Fisher</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would initially like to thank the Minister for Trade, who introduced the <inline ref="S406">Australian Federal Police and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2004</inline> on my behalf, given the fact that I had legislative commitments in the main chamber a little earlier this morning. I would also like to thank all honourable members who have spoken in this debate for their support in principle of this legislation, which is very important legislation with respect to the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Protective Service. I commend the member for Corangamite, who, as always, delivered a very thought-provoking and erudite speech. </para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83X</name.id><name role="metadata">Gibbons, Steve, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Gibbons</name></talker><para>âAlways!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>0V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SLIPPER</name></talker><para>âHe always delivers a thought-provoking and erudite speech. I do not think anyone could ever accuse the member for Corangamite of being other than someone who researches very carefully every bill on which he speaks. I have to say that in the time he has been in the chamber, since about 1983âover 20 yearsâhe has performed outstanding service for the constituents of the electorate of Corangamite. Corangamite is situated in the Geelong area. The people residing in Corangamite have been singularly fortunate that over so many years they have had the opportunity of choosing the member for Corangamite to be their representative in this place. His speech on the Australian Federal Police and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 verifies the great wisdom of the constituents of Corangamite since 1983 in returning the member for Corangamite as their elected member in the House of Representatives. I would also like to commend the member for Barton, the member for Newcastle, the member for Fairfax, the member for Dickson and the member for Flinders on their contributions to this bill.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The amendments in the Australian Federal Police and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 represent the final step in a process that began after the terrorist attacks in 2001 when the whole world changedânothing will ever be the same againâthat is, the integration of the Australian Protective Service with the Australian Federal Police. As the member for Corangamite indicated in his speech, they also implement an important resolution of the April 2002 leaders summit to allow the Australian Federal Police to investigate state offences incidental to multijurisdictional crime. While many people believe that the federal system of government is the very best system we could have in Australia, I often think that there are incredible levels of duplication and overlapping. When the leaders summit is prepared to come to such a sensible proposal as is included in this bill, I think that tends to reaffirm one's belief in the way that our federation continues to work.</para><para>The integration of the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Protective Service is one part of a much broader government approach to maximising the effectiveness of Commonwealth counter-terrorism and transnational crime resources. The two-stage approach used to complete the integration of these very important organisations has allowed the Australian Protective Service to continue to deliver without disruption the range of services for which it is funded and contracted. It has also allowed for detailed consideration of relevant workplace relations, commercial, financial and organisational issues. Honourable members will be pleased to know that there has been full consultation and negotiation with the employees of both organisations about the integration. </para><para>The integration is a win-win for both organisations and the Australian public generally. It will allow the Australian Federal Police Commissioner to ensure the closest possible cooperation between Protective Service officers and police officers when conducting joint operations and providing protective security services. The amendments in the bill that implement the resolution of the April 2002 Leaders Summit on Terrorism and Multijurisdictional Crime will allow the Australian Federal Police to investigate state offences with a federal aspect, using the full range of powers in the Crimes Act.</para><para>Honourable members will be pleased to know that the government has moved swiftly to include these amendments in this bill. We will have a consideration in detail stage with respect to a government amendment, and I will speak on that amendment later. The non-government parties made one amendment to the bill in the Senate, and that amendment would permit the commissioner or a deputy commissioner to express an opinion, including a racist or prejudicial opinion, that they honestly held and believed was in the public interest but that was totally inappropriate. The government opposed that particular amendment, which of course will be of no real surprise to anyone.</para><para>In his speech the member for Barton expressed a concern about APS transferees' conditions of service and access to the board of reference in the transitional period. He also queried whether the APS officers will have access to the Industrial Relations Commission. I am very pleased to reassure the honourable member for Barton that the APS officers transferred to the AFP will have access to the dispute resolution provisions of the Workplace Relations Act and to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission where there are any concerns about their remuneration and conditions of service.</para><para>Members of parliament in this place often talk about issues relating to their own electorates. The member for Newcastle expressed her concern about the Australian Federal Police presence in Newcastle. She mentioned that there was only one officer, located in Centrelink. She also expressed some concerns in relation to the port. I am pleased to advise the member for Newcastle, who is no longer in the chamber, that the government has introduced new maritime security legislation which provides additional powers to a variety of agencies to secure Australian ports. Important work has been done to use these powers to improve security. The AFP, including Protective Service officers, will play an important role. The Australian Federal Police resources in Newcastle, as in other centres, are kept under constant review to ensure that threats and criminal activity are addressed. I am very pleased that the member for Newcastle will no doubt be greatly reassured by the remarks I have made in response to her contribution to this debate.</para><para>In summary, the <inline ref="S406">Australian Federal Police and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2004</inline> consolidates and enhances Australia's national security framework. It represents a milestone in the efforts of the government towards protecting all Australians from terrorist attacks and honouring our obligation under international law to protect foreign diplomatic and consular officials and their premises. On that basis, I commend the bill to the chamber.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration in Detail</title><page.no>29455</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Billâby leaveâtaken as a whole.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>29455</page.no><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SLIPPER</name><name.id>0V5</name.id><electorate>Fisher</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI present a supplementary explanatory memorandum to the <inline ref="S406">Australian Federal Police and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2004</inline> and move government amendment (1) as circulated:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Schedule 1, item 27A, page 24 (lines 12 to 19), omit the item.</para></quote><para>As I indicated in my summing up speech, the non-government parties made one amendment to the bill in the Senate. This amendment would insert a new subsection 22(1)(a) into the Australian Federal Police Act 1979. Section 22(1) of the AFP Act provides for the termination of appointment of the commissioner or a deputy commissioner for misbehaviour or physical or mental incapacity.</para><para>The amendment was inserted to clarify that an expression of an honestly held opinion by the commissioner or a deputy commissioner does not constitute misbehaviour for the purposes of section 22(1) if the commissioner or deputy commissioner believes that it is in the public interest to communicate that opinion, whether publicly or privately. However, the government does not support this amendment, because it would create a statutory exemption to the grounds for termination for misbehaviour based on the purely subjective belief of the person expressing the opinion. The government amendment will omit this item from the bill.</para><para>High standards are expected of people who hold public office. An exemption such as this could create potentially serious problems if the commissioner or a deputy commissioner expressed an opinion which he or she honestly held and believed was in the public interest but which was totally inappropriate. This could include, for example, expressing an honestly held belief that was racist or showed prejudice. The meaning of `misbehaviour' in provisions dealing with the termination of public officials should not be limited in this way. Indeed, other Commonwealth termination-of-appointment provisions do not define or qualify misbehaviour. Mere expression of an opinion would not amount to misbehaviour; it would require moreâfor example, the commission of an offence by making disclosures that are prohibited by law or the breach of binding standards of conduct. There is no point in permitting something that is not prohibited in the first place. On that basis, I commend the government amendment to the chamber.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill, as amended, agreed to.</para><para>Ordered that this bill be reported to the House with an amendment.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>29455</page.no></debateinfo><para>Ms GAMBARO (Petrie) (12.16 p.m.)âI move:</para><motion><para>That the Main Committee do now adjourn.</para></motion><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Roads: Calder Highway</title><page.no>29455</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>29455</page.no><name role="metadata">Gibbons, Steve, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GIBBONS</name><name.id>83X</name.id><electorate>Bendigo</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to demand that the Howard government, in its forthcoming AusLink statement, commit the full $193 million that it owes to pay its 50 per cent share to fully complete the upgrade of the Calder Highway. I demand also a definite completion date for the upgrade. Rapidly rising fuel prices and taxes are making central Victorian motorists even angrier with the federal government's stalling over funding the Calder Highway. </para></talk.start><para>In November 2001, when Treasurer Costello falsely promised Bendigo that it would match state funding for the Calder, Bendigo district motorists paid 84.9c a litre for petrol. They paid 45.82c of this in excise and GST. It cost them around $50.94 to fill a 60-litre tank. They paid $27.49 of this to the Commonwealth in taxes. At that time, they paid around $16.15 in taxes and CityLink tolls for a return trip to Melbourne.</para><para>In May 2004, central Victorian motorists are paying 105.9c a litre at many district outlets. Of this, they pay 47.64c to the federal government in taxes. Today they are paying $63.54 to fill up their tanksâ$12.60 more than when Treasurer Costello made his phoney promise. Of this they are paying $28.58 in taxesâ$1.09 more than in November 2001. They are now paying around $16.98 in taxes and tolls for a return trip on the same treacherously unfinished road to Melbourne. They have got nothing new on the Calder for their taxes since Mr Costello's pre-election con job of November 2001. The Bendigo electorate pays around $90 million a year in fuel taxes plus GST and, since the November 2001 election, has paid over $200 million in such taxes. This is more than the amount needed to finish the Calder. Where has it gone? The Howard government has stopped all new funding for the Calder, sabotaged the 2006 completion date promised by the Liberals in that election, and has added millions to the cost of the remaining work. The only work now being done on the Calder is by the Bracks government. </para><para>Bendigo remains the only major regional centre in Victoria where motorists are taxed on an unfinished road and pay a CityLink entry tax plus GST to get into Melbourne. The Calder is a road potholed with Liberal lies and coalition cop-outs. The Liberal Party promised in 1996 to duplicate the highway. Instead it has duplicated the taxes on the Calder. Treasurer Costello assured Bendigo in November 2001 that the Calder had a `much higher priority' with the government than the Scoresby Freeway, but a fortnight ago he openly listed Scoresby as their top priority. This is the forked tongue of Mr Costello that really infuriates Calder motorists. He said on 12 May:</para><quote><para>What the Commonwealth does is that it enters into agreements with State Governments for the most important roads in order of priority and ... the order of priority is the Scoresby Freeway and then after we do the Scoresby Freeway we move on to the next one.</para></quote><para>In reality, it had an agreement with the state from 1997âfour years before it signed up Scoresby in 2001 as a RONIâto fund the Calder. Since then Mr Costello has ratted on the Calder. The Scoresby is a `RONI-come-lately' compared to the Calder. There is every chance he will dud the Calder yet again in the 7 June AusLink statement by withholding the $193 million he owes us to finish it. He will leave it as a goat track from Bendigo to Kyneton.</para><para>The Treasurer is a master at pork-barrelling on the Scoresby and a master of pork pies on the Calder. The Treasurer took over six years to deliver his 1996 election promise to provide $2 million for the Bendigo arts facilities, and it is almost three years since he promised to match the state funding for the Calder. Is it any wonder that opinion polls are showing that the Treasurer is extremely unpopular with Australian voters?</para><para>I refer to yet another Calder pork pieânamely, a recent claim in Bendigo by Senator Ian Campbell that Treasurer Costello had commissioned him as the new roads minister to get `that bloody Calder' fixed. Senator Campbell was Mr Costello's parliamentary secretary for four years. He was the minute taker to the coalition ministers who deserted the Calder at Kyneton. On the day Senator Campbell was appointed Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roadsâ7 October last yearâMinister Anderson, the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, openly admitted Calder funding was completed. Then, just before Senator Campbell visited Bendigo, Mr Anderson mangled the coalition's Calder RONI pledge to duplicate all the road from Melbourne to Bendigo so that it only covered fixing up the worst sections. Why then won't he fix the Kyneton to Ravenswood section? Senator Campbell has not fixed Mr Costello's `bloody Calder'. The main problem with the `bloody Calder' is Mr Costello himself. He is only interested in stalling the Calder and playing smart alec games with the Scoresby. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Kokoda Track</title><page.no>29457</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>29457</page.no><name role="metadata">Gash, Joanna, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs GASH</name><name.id>AK6</name.id><electorate>Gilmore</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOnce again, Anzac Day has come and gone. To me, each Anzac Day has its own differing memories and brings many friendships and stories. It is a day that forms most of my focus as chair of the government defence and veterans affairs committee. The services held throughout Gilmoreâalways too numerous for me to attend them allâhelp to make clear the sacrifices and the debt we owe to those who preceded us. Such thoughts evoke memories of tales that inspire and motivate many, so much so that the experience undergoes an almost spiritual transformation and many are compelled to make the journey of the pilgrim. For Australians, it is either Gallipoli or the Kokoda Track. When they have made that journey, the pilgrim gains a greater sense of understanding of the legend of Anzac and a personal enlightenment.</para></talk.start><para>Recently I was privileged to share one such experience. Kevin Camm is a Vietnam veteran. He is also head of the Scout movement in the Shoalhaven. Kevin could be described as a patriot, and this is reflected in a diary on his Kokoda trek, which he left with me recently. Reading it, you can feel the spirit of Kokoda coursing through his veins. The diary was complemented by photographs, so I managed to get a bit of a feel of what it must have been like. I could not feel the intense humidity, the flies or the strain on the chest walking up those terrible slopes, but I could begin to understand what he was feeling. There was one photo with a caption that reads, `Absolutely exhausted near the top of Maguli Range', and the expression on his face told the storyâthere was no need for a caption, except to say where it was.</para><para>The photo of the camp site showed tents pitched on a slope in a cleared area surrounded by the gloom of the dark jungle. Later on, there is a photograph of three very old menânativesâsitting on the ground with their walking sticks, their hair grey, their faces wizened and their appearance frail. They were three of the original fuzzy wuzzy angels. Kevin wrote in his diary:</para><quote><para>Reg was talking to an elderly native resident. He turned out to be an original fuzzy wuzzy angel, Faure Bokoi by name. He took us back to the back of the village where he introduced two more fuzzy wuzzy angels, Guia Karea and Sori Io.

All we wanted to do was shake their hands and thank them for looking after our diggers during the War.</para><para>He did not realise this and then apologised. We talked on how we could help the angels. We paid 5 Kina (about $2.50 Australian) each to photograph them. At least that gave them some money. I promised that when I got back to Port Moresby or home I would do everything I could to get crutches and a wheelchair for Guia. </para></quote><para>That is what the spirit of Anzac is all about. It is about obligation and duty; it is about gratitude and paying our dues. Kevin Camm felt that and he is going to do something about it, and he would like us to do something about paying our dues as well. Over time, I know much has been written and said about these native bearers who helped so many of our diggers, and I am adding my name to the already long list. Although I have not personally trekked Kokoda, I do have a sense of what it must be like for those who do and what they feel.

My role as the area chairman for Pine Rivers was made all the easier because of Andrew's involvement. Andrew McKeown, in the work that he does with his army of officers and supporters at the Lawnton Salvation Army, really is a credit to them.

In the Arana Hills district, we raised $4,050.05, which was an increase from 2003. There was also an increase at Kallangur, which raised $7,001. At Strathpine, we raised $7,232.75, which is an incredible increase of 47 per cent from 2003. In the local shopping centres, we collected $6,408. I want to thank the managements of those local shopping centres, including at areas like Strathpine and Kallangur, who did a tremendous amount to support the local army officers who went there to collect money for such a great cause.</para><para>The local schoolchildren at Ferny Grove State School held a free-dress day for the first time this year, and they raised $600.

One of the aims for next year for the Pine Rivers area will be to have many more schools involved. It is the first year that we have had primary school involvement and a free-dress day, and the results are obviously incredible.</para><para>I want to give particular thanks to the 76 teams, which included over 267 collectors, made up of local people who wanted to support a good cause, local community groups like Apex, Lions, Rotary, Rotaract and other local community groups, as well as students from secondary schools, including a considerable number of students from Northside Christian College and Genesis Christian College who provided great support.</para><para>I also want to make mention in the parliament today of the zone chairmen. I acknowledge Councillor Mike Charlton from Albany Creek, who again provided tremendous support this year. I also want to acknowledge Andrew Patterson, who was very involved in the local community in Arana Hills. He is a person who puts a countless number of hours into community projects, and his involvement again this year is greatly appreciated in the Arana Hills zone. I also want to make mention of Councillor David Dwyer, who was responsible for the Kallangur area, and Councillor Brian Gelvin, who was responsible for Strathpine.

Finally, I acknowledge Councillor Graeme Ashworth for his support and, in particular, for his coordination of maps and whatnot on the day. It provided a very professional touch again this year to the Red Shield appeal in Pine Rivers, and the support that he provided by putting together and collating those maps was of great assistance to all of the collectors and to the committee overall.</para><para>I also wish to make particular mention today in the parliament of the directors: Barry and Pam Nancarrow from Albany Creek, Envoy Lindley Fabre from Arana Hills, Major Ken and Mrs Ella Beer from Kallangur, Major Terry Smith and Major Alan Peterson from Strathpine who did an incredible amount of work again this year. People like Ken Beer, Andrew McKeown and all of those that assisted in this year's Red Shield appeal need to be thanked 1,000 times over. I look forward to working with them and having their support next year, and I congratulate everybody involved in this year's process. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Lyons Electorate: Transit of Venus</title><page.no>29460</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>29460</page.no><name role="metadata">Adams, Dick, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ADAMS</name><name.id>BV5</name.id><electorate>Lyons</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn Tuesday, 8 June, the eyes of the world will be on a small town in the middle of Tasmania, in my electorate of Lyons, that is commemorating a special event. Campbell Town, Tasmania, was the host, more than 100 years ago, of an interesting historical astronomical event, when Venus crossed the face of the sun on 9 December 1874. It will doing it again on 8 June this year, and again in eight years time, and then not again for another 100 years. </para></talk.start><para>The story becomes interesting when one considers that it was a period of intense exploration and, at that time, the timing and position of Venus as it moved across the sun was linked to one of the great unsolved problems in the history of astronomyâthe accurate determination of the distance of the sun from the earth, and thus the scale of the solar system. Accurate time and position were well-known specialties of the American Naval Observatory, and, when in 1874 and 1882 many nations of the world dispatched expeditions to observe the transits of Venus, the Naval Observatory naturally became deeply involved in leading the observations in the name of American science.</para><para>Hobart was one of the suggested sites, along with eight or nine others in the southern oceans. Because there was extreme difficulty in landing a party at the Crozet Islands, which had originally been chosen, two teams from the United States arrived in Tasmania. The rest of the story is a typically Tasmanian one. One of the eminent doctors of the timeâwho happened to have a home and practice in Campbell Townâwas an amateur astronomer. Dr William Valentine happened to be in Hobart when the US teams arrived on their ship, and he convinced them to take the equipment from the aborted attempt on the Crozets and set it up in his backyard in Campbell Town, 100 miles further north.</para><para>According to the <inline font-style="italic">Australian </inline>today, for the next two months an early form of space station was built on the land next to Dr Valentine's property, the Grange, at Campbell Town. In fact, two of the observation site pillars are still being used as gateposts. Dr Valentine's house is still very much in existence and is being used as very upmarket tourist accommodation. What the <inline font-style="italic">Australian </inline>did not say is that the Americans had a great time for two months because the local people were thrilled to have such important visitors. I understand they went hunting, were fed banquets and were thoroughly entertained with all the resources that could be mustered in the town.</para><para>Now Campbell Town is going to do it again. The local people, led by a number of local historians including Geoff Duncombe, assisted by the Northern Midlands Council under the guidance of Mayor Kim Polley, have gone out hunting for relics from that sighting and have been setting up the site for the 8 June 2004 sighting. The last sighting commenced with a huge storm and there were many funny dialogues between some of the scientists trying to get a good look while others, such as Dr Valentine, were getting underfoot. However, the skies cleared and 125 images were captured for research. This time, it being almost midwinter, there may be similar problems, but Tasmania does have some amazingly clear winter days and nights, so we may be lucky in achieving the re-enactment.</para><para>This is the centrepiece, but there are lots of activities planned around the day, including historical walksâand we have just opened a `convict walk' there, which I did recentlyâtalks and viewing stations for the public to watch the transit of the planet from 3 p.m. to dusk. So, if you are planning a trip to Tasmania, you could be part of making history again. We are hoping many Americans will want to join us, as well as the many other nationals that are competing for sightings around the world. William Harkness said, in 1882: </para><quote><para>We are now on the eve of the second transit of a pair, after which there will be no other till the twenty-first century of our era has dawned upon the earth, and the June flowers are blooming in 2004. When the last transit season occurred the intellectual world was awakening from the slumber of ages, and that wondrous scientific activity which has led to our present advanced knowledge was just beginning. What will be the state of science when the next transit season arrives God only knows. Not even our children's children will live to take part in the astronomy of that day. As for ourselves, we have to do with the present ...</para></quote><para><inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Labor Party: Taxation Policies</title><page.no>29461</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>29461</page.no><name role="metadata">Cobb, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JOHN COBB</name><name.id>00AN1</name.id><electorate>Parkes</electorate><party>NATS</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt is more than a coincidence that within the federal electorate of Parkes, which also encompasses the state seat of Murray-Darling, the Labor Party seems to be finding it hard to relate events and figures as they occur rather than as Labor in the region wants to portray them. It is no coincidence that we have a federal election due and that, certainly in my region, Labor is back to its old tricks of misinformation and scaremongering. I do not know what the Labor Party is providing to its candidates or even its members by way of information, but it is not the facts if the antics of the Labor Party in my electorate are any guide. On ABC Far West radio on 17 May 2004 the Labor candidate for the seat of Parkes, when talking about a federal payroll tax, said:</para></talk.start><quote><para>... this is the first that I've heard of itâfirst that anybody down at our national secretariat's heard of it and it's not in our policy anywhere.</para></quote><para>We all know from Labor's own publicly released policy, A Better Way of Life for Working Families, that that statement is false. In Labor's policy it states that under Labor's approach there would be a national insurance system for employee entitlements. All employers would be expected to contribute 0.1 per cent of payroll. That is a payroll tax announced in Labor's own policy. Perhaps the Labor candidate in Parkes simply does not know his own party's platform, or perhaps he just does not care. Whatever the case, there again is a total misrepresentation of the factsâsaying one thing in private and another in public.</para><para>But it gets worse when we have a Labor member of state parliament doing the same within his own branch in Broken Hill. Peter Black, the well-knownâI might say infamousâmember for Murray-Darling, gave to his local branch in Broken Hill what was reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Barrier Daily Truth </inline>of 20 May 2004 as probably one of the most disgraceful performances of his chequered career. According to a report by the Labor Party printed in the local paper, Mr Black motivated his party for action by blaming all of New South Wales's problemsâcertainly those of the New South Wales governmentâon our federal government. He is entitled to his opinion, but as an elected member of parliament I would have thought he was also obliged to relate facts as they are and tell the truth.</para><para>The federal government have not cut $278 million a year from public hospitals, as Peter Black claims. We fund the state public hospitals through the health agreementâan agreement that is negotiated for five years. It is quite clearly impossible for us to cut funding under that sort of scheme. If there is a cut to hospital funding, perhaps he should question the New South Wales Premier, Bob Carr, and look at his state budget for answers.</para><para>A claim by the same Peter Black that the Australian government have cut $220 million each year from public schools, which he also distributed to his party members, I find disturbing. It is actually outrageous that Peter Black would make such a false claim, becauseâas you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker Causleyâfor the record, on education the federal government have increased funding to New South Wales for state government schools by a further six per cent in this year's budget to a total of $873.1 million on top of the 5.7 per cent increase made last year. Interestingly, the New South Wales government only increased their allocation to schools last year by 0.8 per cent. Overall, we have increased funding to New South Wales schools by 62Â½ per cent since we were elected to government in 1996. </para><para>It is little wonder that we see Labor candidates speaking the sort of rubbish that they do when it appears to be quite an acceptable practice for their elected members to behave in that way. This government has learnt from past experience not to accept one word from the Labor Party without checking the facts and demanding proof. It now appears that the media and Labor's own branch members will have to do the same. It proves that we cannot trust their word.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Cunningham Electorate: Community Services</title><page.no>29462</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>29462</page.no><name role="metadata">Organ, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ORGAN</name><name.id>BNL</name.id><electorate>Cunningham</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI take this opportunity to raise a number of issues concerning my electorate of Cunningham, for amidst talk of budgets and elections life goes on back home in Wollongong much as it always has. I took the opportunity during the April parliamentary break to visit a number of organisations and individuals in my electorate, all dealing on a daily basis with the community and looking to the federal government for assistance. I visited, for example, community child-care facilities run by Illawarra child-care services, and came away from those visits with a feeling of great appreciation for their work and of the significant role played by women. I also came away somewhat appalled by the low wages paidâaround $12.50 an hourâespecially in light of the difficult work conditions and the huge responsibilities of caring for young children and babies. I am also concerned about the future of such facilities as a result of the failure by governments to fund the upgrade of basic infrastructure. In my opinion, increasing privatisation of the sector will put under threat the quality services currently being delivered by community child care, where profits go back into the centres to provide additional staff and to trim the huge waiting lists. I visited child-care facilities at Bulli, Bellambi, Figtree and Wollongong, and I would like to thank the staff for their hospitality and openness and congratulate them on the work done.</para></talk.start><para>I also took the opportunity to visit a number of public schools in my electorate, in order to experience first hand some of the issues facing the sector. My impression was one of teachers working extremely hard, providing a high quality, values based educational experience with diminishing resources and decaying infrastructure. Indeed, a door collapsed at one primary school during my visitâluckily, no-one was injured. More financial support from the state and federal governments is urgently needed, with a priority on the public education sector.</para><para>I was shocked to find out that headmasters are given a budget each year out of which they are meant to account for unforeseen costs such as sick pay and long service leave for teaching staff. This can result in budget shortfalls, teaching resources being withdrawn or diverted and pressure being placed on teachers to limit their use of such entitlements. I was also rather concerned by the lack of site planning evident within many of the schools. School grounds looked like construction sites, with demountables located haphazardly around the place taking up precious space which is needed for things such as playgrounds for the children. Often demountables are in place for decades and little consideration is given by government to the construction of much-needed buildings. More money is needed for staff, for teaching resources, for buildings and for associated infrastructure. Schools should not have to rely on the hard work, goodwill and limited resources of parents to pay for these necessities. But that is the way things seem to be going. My visits to the schools, preschools and child-care centres reinforced my long-held view that government must put more money into education, for education is an investment in the future and a quality education is a right, not a privilege. </para><para>On another subject, I recently visited the Illawarra Retirement Trust aged care facility at Towradgi. Once again, the staff and management there are doing a wonderful job. However, they are faced with increasing costs associated with managing our ageing population, with increasing amounts of paperwork and with the failure of government to provide assistance with building and infrastructure maintenance and development. </para><para>I have covered preschools, primary schools and aged care, and I now turn to health care and our local crisis, which I alluded to in the House on Monday. Issues include concerns about the downgrading of the emergency department at Bulli Hospital and the uncertain future of that facility; concerns about the Illawarra rescue helicopter service; concerns about the imminent installation of an MRI machine at Wollongong Hospital but no Medicare licence or funding for its operation; concerns about a lack of beds at Wollongong Hospital, which recently saw eight ambulances queued up outside the emergency department unable to off-load patients because there was simply nowhere to put them, a situation exacerbated by the fact that ambulances have been directed not to take patients to Bulli Hospital; and concerns about staff morale in the Illawarra Area Health Service, budget blow-outs and problems with management. Amidst all this, staff continue to do a wonderful job on a daily basis under difficult circumstances.</para><para>Other local issues continue to be of concern. Like most members of this place, the divide between my parliamentary work here in Canberra and local issues and commitments can often grow large. In closing, I would like to make mention of the wonderful work done by Robyn Alderton and her team at the Bellambi community centre. Their preschool breakfast program, for example, serves some 30 to 50 local children every day and is funded by the local community. It is provided to children who would otherwise go to school without breakfast or a packed lunch. The fact that such a program is needed in a regional electorate such as Cunningham is indicative of the real social problems and the poverty crisis facing Australia at the moment. Robyn and her team do a magnificent job and are an inspiration. They deserve our support.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Main Committee adjourned at 12.46 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate></maincomm.xscript><answers.to.questions><debate><debateinfo><type>Answers to Questions in Writing</type><title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title><page.no>29464</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following answers to questions were circulated:</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Social Welfare: Health Care Card</title><page.no>29464</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2676)</subtitle><id.no>2676</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>29464</page.no><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Jenkins</name><name.id>HH4</name.id><electorate>Scullin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services, upon notice, on 3 November 2003:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	How many Health Care Card recipients reside in (a) Victoria, and (b) the postcode areas (i) 3074, (ii) 3075, (iii) 3076, (iv) 3082, (v) 3083, (vi) 3087, (vii) 3088, (viii) 3089, (ix) 3090, (x) 3091, and (xi) 3752.</para><para>(2)	How many Health Care Card holders not receiving a Centrelink payment, pension, benefit or equivalent payment, reside in (a) Victoria, and (b) the postcode areas (i) 3074, (ii) 3075, (iii) 3076, (iv) 3082, (v) 3083, (vi) 3087, (vii) 3088, (viii) 3089, (ix) 3090, (x) 3091, and (xi) 3752.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>29464</page.no><name role="metadata">Anthony, Larry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Anthony</name><name.id>XJ6</name.id><electorate>Richmond</electorate><party>NATS</party><role>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Minister for Family and Community Services has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Data provided is current as at October 2003.</para></quote><para>(1)	(a) 404 364 Health Care Card holders reside in Victoria.</para><para>(b) The number of Health Care Card holders in each specified postcode area is as follows:
