It also amends the National Health Act 1953 regarding deceased pharmacists and makes minor technical amendments to two other pieces of legislation within the health portfolio.</para><para>Amendments to the Health Insurance Act 1973 will enable private health insurance funds to pay accommodation and nursing costs from their hospital tables associated with foot surgery performed on admitted patients by accredited podiatric surgeons.</para><para>The aim of this amendment is to enhance the value of private health insurance and increase choice for consumers. Currently private patients can only receive rebates for foot surgery from health funds' hospital tables performed by medical practitioners. Only limited benefits are available from funds' ancillary tables for surgery performed by podiatric surgeons and members can incur considerable out-of-pocket costs.</para><para>While this bill enables funds to pay for hospital costs, it does not extend to enabling funds to pay benefits for the accredited podiatric surgeon's or associated anaesthetist's fees. There is no Medicare benefits schedule item for these fees and this bill will not change this situation.</para><para>The amendment will not change clinical practice in any way. It will permit funds to pay benefits for accommodation and nursing costs associated with foot surgery performed on admitted patients by accredited podiatric surgeons. This will alleviate some of the cost burden for privately insured consumers.</para><para>The bill also clarifies existing hospital casemix protocol data provision arrangements under the Health Insurance Act 1973.</para><para>Currently the Health Insurance Act 1973 requires private hospitals to supply patient de-identified data to a data bureau. The data bureau was disbanded in 2002 and the data is now collected and analysed from within the Department of Health and Ageing. The amendment reflects this change in arrangements.</para><para>While private hospitals have been required to provide hospital casemix protocol data to the Department of Health and Ageing and private health insurance funds under the Health Insurance Act 1973, an equivalent obligation has never been imposed on day hospital facilities. This creates a potential gap in the range of data that is supplied to health funds and the Department of Health and Ageing. An amendment to the National Health Act 1953 will correct this anomaly. </para><para>This bill also amends the National Health Act 1953 to ensure that the community will continue to have access to pharmaceutical benefits in the event of the death of a pharmacist who had been approved under this act to supply pharmaceutical benefits.</para><para>Currently, under the National Health Act 1953, pharmaceutical benefits can only be supplied by a pharmacist approved to supply such benefits. Once approved, a pharmacist is entitled to be paid by the Commonwealth for the supply of pharmaceutical benefits.</para><para>The National Health Act 1953 currently provides for legal personal representatives of deceased approved pharmacists to apply for approval to supply pharmaceutical benefits. However, this provision has been found to be deficient in a number of respects. In some cases, the time period involved in obtaining an approval to supply pharmaceutical benefits is lengthy. This is particularly so in situations where it is only viable for a legal personal representative to apply for approval after probate or letters of administration are granted.</para><para>In some instances, the legal personal representative requests an act of grace payment be made to the estate of the deceased approved pharmacist. This payment is for pharmaceutical benefits supplied during the period following the death of the pharmacist and before the grant of a new approval. In some cases the amount claimed is large, and the ongoing viability of a pharmacy has been jeopardised by having to carry this financial burden.</para><para>The amendments will enable a person who is, or is likely to become, an executor or administrator of a deceased approved pharmacist's estate to be granted permission to supply pharmaceutical benefits to the community, and to receive payment for that supply.</para><para>Finally, the bill makes minor amendments to the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act 1995 and the Health Insurance Amendment (Diagnostic Imaging, Radiation Oncology and Other Measures) Act 2003 to correct drafting errors. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Ms Gillard</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>27914</page.no></debateinfo><para>Mr ABBOTT (WarringahâLeader of the House) (9.07 a.m.)âI move:</para><motion><para>That the House, at its rising, adjourn until Tuesday, 11 May 2004, at 2.00 p.m., unless the Speaker or, in the event of the Speaker being unavailable, the Deputy Speaker fixes an alternative day or hour of meeting.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>LEAVE OF ABSENCE</title><type>Leave of Absence</type><page.no>27914</page.no></debateinfo><para>Mr ABBOTT (WarringahâLeader of the House) (9.07 a.m.)âI move:</para><motion><para>That leave of absence be given to every Member of the House of Representatives from the determination of this sitting of the House to the date of its next sitting.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>27914</page.no><id.no>R2031</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>27914</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ruddock</inline>, and read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>27914</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>27914</page.no><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name><name.id>0J4</name.id><electorate>Berowra</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Attorney-General</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>The <inline ref="R2031">Family Law Amendment Bill 2004</inline> is a part of the Howard government's continuing reform of the family law system.</para><para>In particular this bill addresses the interaction of bankruptcy law and family law, the enforcement of court orders and frivolous and/or vexatious proceedings. It includes a range of reforms to clarify the rule making power of the Family Court of Australia. The bill also contains technical amendments to the Family Law Act 1975 intended to improve the operation of the act, particularly amendments to modernise the terminology of the act. </para><para>Some of the provisions in this bill relate to matters raised by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs in its <inline font-style="italic">Every picture tells a story</inline> report. However, the government will be responding to that report separately.</para><para>This bill implements three recommendations of the joint task force <inline font-style="italic">Report on the use of bankruptcy and family law schemes to avoid payment of tax</inline>,<inline font-style="italic"></inline>which was provided to the former Attorney-General and the Assistant Treasurer in 2002.</para><para>The government intends to respond to the remaining recommendations in the report and announced, in December 2003, proposed amendments to the Bankruptcy Act and the Family Law Act to deal with those recommendations. Drafting of amendments to address the recommendations has raised complex issues and consultation is ongoing.</para><para>The aim of the amendments in this bill is to address the use of bankruptcy and family law schemes to avoid payment of tax. The amendments that address one of those recommendations do so by increasing certainty of standing for third party creditors to intervene in family law property proceedings and allow third party creditors to seek to have property orders set aside or overturned after they have been made. Third parties may also apply to the court for an order or injunction preventing the disposition of property pending an application to set aside or overturn a property order. The bill also includes a provision for notice to be provided to affected third parties in matters involving property orders.</para><para>Another amendment relating to bankruptcy and family law provides for a separation declaration for financial agreements generally, not only for superannuation agreements as currently is the case, to help ensure that financial agreements are not entered into by couples for the purposes of avoiding creditors.</para><para>The bill also contains amendments to address the issue of parenting orders not working in practice. A number of parenting orders, particularly those made by consent, are found not to work in practice. The bill contains amendments to provide a court with the power to vary, on its own motion, orders relating to children, at a hearing on a contravention application. The amendments also clarify the court's power to send parties in contravention proceedings to counselling and post-separation parenting programs.</para><para>Another amendment in the bill provides a right for persons who are determined not to be a parent of a child, through DNA testing or by other means, to recover any moneys paid for that child under maintenance orders.</para><para>The bill will strengthen the court's powers in relation to frivolous and vexatious proceedings. The amendments are intended to ensure the court has power to deal with both proceedings and litigants as comprehensively as possible.</para><para>A number of amendments in this bill clarify the Family Court's powers in a range of areas, including the court's rule making powers to support the new Family Law Rules 2004, which commenced operation on 29 March 2004, and in relation to change of venue of proceedings and the effect of offers of settlement.</para><para>In order to address noncompliance with the rules of court, the bill provides for cost consequences for breaches of those rules. Cost consequences will also apply where behaviour amounts to an unreasonable abuse of process. This will foster a culture of compliance with court orders. </para><para>The bill also clarifies a number of issues relating to the operation of appeals. One amendment removes the power of the full court to issue a certificate requiring the High Court to hear an appeal where `an important question of law of public interest is involved'. This amendment was made in response to a recommendation of the Australian Law Reform Commission which the High Court and the Family Court agreed with. The government accepted the recommendation as the High Court through the special leave to appeal process should be in control of what matters are dealt with by that court.</para><para>The bill provides for the transfer of family law proceedings from state courts of summary jurisdiction (magistrates and local courts) direct to the Federal Magistrates Court on the court's own initiative. Many proceedings instituted in state courts in relation to property with a value of over $20,000 or in relation to contested parenting orders will be appropriate for determination by the Federal Magistrates Court. Currently the Family Law Act provides for transfers in such matters from courts of summary jurisdiction on the court's own initiative to the Family Court but not to the Federal Magistrates Court. The Family Court then transfers appropriate matters on to the Federal Magistrates Court. This amendment will enable a matter to be transferred directly to the Federal Magistrates Court and reduce unnecessary delays and obvious duplication.</para><para>The bill widens the range of matters which can be the subject of private arbitration. Currently the matters that can be dealt with by a private arbitrator under the Family Law Act are limited to matters which relate to property, spousal maintenance and maintenance agreements. The bill expands the scope to include financial agreements and certain orders in relation to superannuation.</para><para>The bill modernises the terminology of the act to terms which are commonly used and widely recognised thereby increasing the public's understanding of the act and accessibility to family law. This should particularly aid self-represented litigants. It will no doubt surprise many that the term `divorce' does not appear in the act. The term `dissolution of marriage' is simply replaced with `divorce'.</para><para>There are a range of other minor amendments to the bill.</para><para>The government is committed to enhancing and making more accessible and efficient the family law system and this bill is part of the government's commitment to that goal.</para><para>Full details of the measures contained in this bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum to the bill. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Ms Roxon</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY (COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYMENT) AMENDMENT (PROMOTING SAFER WORKPLACES) BILL 2004</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>27916</page.no><id.no>R2014</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>27916</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Andrews</inline>, and read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>27916</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>27916</page.no><name role="metadata">Andrews, Kevin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDREWS</name><name.id>HK5</name.id><electorate>Menzies</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>The amendments in this <inline ref="R2014">bill</inline> will reinforce and underscore the Commonwealth's regulatory approach to workplace health and safety by ensuring there is an emphasis on prevention of workplace fatalities. The framework on which this approach is based highlights the importance of the prevention of workplace accidents and an effective enforcement and compliance regime. </para><para>On 1 March 2004, a new part 2A of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) Crimes Act 1900 came into operation. This part contains two new criminal offences of industrial manslaughter: one for employers and one for senior officers. The ACT law imposes a criminal liability on employers and senior officers after the death of a worker. This is inconsistent with the overall objective of an occupational health and safety legislative framework which is to prevent workplace deaths and injuries. It is also contrary to the unified and integrated OHS legislative system established under the internationally recognised Robens model which all Australian jurisdictions have adopted, including the ACT.</para><para>The bill removes the uncertainty facing some Commonwealth employers and employees that has arisen from the ACT legislation. The amendments contained in this bill will also provide certainty for Commonwealth employers and employees should other Australian jurisdictions enact similar industrial manslaughter legislation.</para><para>Workplace health and safety is an important issue for all Australians. The promotion of injury prevention and the best occupational health and safety practice is a key priority of the Australian government. The government has demonstrated this commitment by initiating the development of the national OHS strategy and encouraging its adoption by all Australian governments and peak employer and employee bodies. For the first time in Australia, this strategy establishes an integrated approach to strive for workplaces free from work related death, injury and disease.</para><para>The Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991 (the `act') is the legislative basis for the protection of the health and safety at work of Commonwealth employees in departments, statutory authorities and government business enterprises. The principles underpinning the act emphasise that workplace health and safety is a partnership between all parties in the workplace, with a particular focus on prevention.</para><para>The government's commitment to prevention of workplace injuries and deaths is demonstrated by the amendments proposed in the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Amendment (Employee Involvement and Compliance) Bill 2002 (the `Commonwealth bill'). The Commonwealth bill, which passed this House on 29 March 2004, ensures that the act is underpinned by a strong and effective compliance and enforcement regime.</para><para>The Commonwealth bill provides for a mix of preventative, remedial and punitive civil and criminal sanctions, including higher penalty levels, to ensure all parties meet their workplace health and safety obligations. This is the best way to eliminate accidents and injuries.</para><para>Industrial manslaughter laws, like the ACT laws, place employers and employees in an adversarial environment and create a culture of blame. This inhibits their ability to work together to eliminate workplace safety hazards and prevent the unwanted consequence of endangering workplace safety.</para><para>The ACT industrial manslaughter legislation also duplicates the existing offences already available under the ACT Crimes Act and ACT OHS legislation to deal with the involvement of employers and employees in workplace deaths or serious injuries. </para><para>The ACT legislation singles out employers for punishment after a death which neglects the involvement of a range of other parties such as another employee, manufacturers, and suppliers of plant and equipment. This creates inequities and gaps in attributing responsibility in the unacceptable event of a workplace fatality or serious injury, and wrongly presumes that employers are solely responsible for all workplace injuries and deaths.</para><para>The bill would amend the act to insert a new section 11A. This new section would provide that part 2A of the ACT Crimes Act and any other similar industrial manslaughter laws which might be enacted by a state or territory that are prescribed in the regulations will have no effect. These laws will have no effect to the extent to which they seek to impose criminal liability on an employer, employing authority or employee covered by the act in respect of a person's death that occurs during, or in relation to, the person's employment or provision of services to another person.</para><para>Without the criteria of prescribing other state and territory laws, the new section could catch general criminal offences, such as manslaughter, murder and culpable driving. This would include, for example, the offence of manslaughter in section 15 of the Crimes Act 1900 (ACT). However, it is not the Commonwealth's intention to exclude employers, employing authorities or employees from the application of these general criminal laws. Similarly, the Commonwealth does not intend to affect the concurrent operation of state or territory laws which promote occupational health and safety provided for in section 4 of the act.</para><para>The Commonwealth only objects to a specific type of state and territory laws which purport to impose criminal liability in respect of a person's death that occurs during, or in relation to, the person's employment or provision of services to another personâthat is, laws like part 2A of the Crimes Act 1900 (ACT). Only these particular types of laws would be prescribed under the new section 11A.</para><para>The bill will apply to any conduct of a Commonwealth employer, employing authority or employee occurring on or after today. This will ensure that Commonwealth employers and employees could not be prosecuted under the ACT industrial manslaughter laws after the bill commences on royal assent in relation to any conduct that occurred on or after the date of introduction.</para><para>This bill reflects the government's commitment to achieving safer workplaces and ensures the focus of occupational health and safety is on prevention of a workplace injury or fatality rather than punishment after the event.</para><para>I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Edwards</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>TOURISM AUSTRALIA BILL 2004</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>27918</page.no><id.no>R2024</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>27918</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hockey</inline>, and read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>27918</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>27918</page.no><name role="metadata">Hockey, Joe, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HOCKEY</name><name.id>DK6</name.id><electorate>North Sydney</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Small Business and Tourism</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para><inline font-weight="bold">Introduction</inline></para><para>The <inline ref="R2024">Tourism Australia Bill 2004</inline> implements a key element of the Australian government's medium- to long-term strategy for tourism, the tourism white paper. The development of a tourism strategy is an important 2001 election commitment of the coalition.  </para><para>Over the last decade, tourism has become a major global industry. In response, nations are recognising the potential economic contribution tourism offers, and are becoming increasingly competitive. Governments are restructuring their tourism agencies to maximise their investment in tourism. As international competition intensifies, it is important that Australia maintains and cements its competitive market position.</para><para>The benefits of tourism go beyond the generation of sustainable economic activity. International travel builds tolerance and understanding of different cultures, and is a significant contributor to peaceful international relations.</para><para>Travel by Australians within Australia strengthens our understanding of our history, our Indigenous heritage, our unique and diverse culture, and our outstanding natural environment. Travel binds us together as a nation. While these benefits are harder to measure than economic output, the Australian government believes that they are, at least, equally important reasons for government support of the tourism industry. </para><para>The tourism white paper is the result of an unprecedented partnership between government and the tourism industry. It provides a comprehensive framework to grow tourism in a sustainable manner. With an extra $235 million behind the white paper, the Australian government's total tourism spend over the next four years will exceed $600 million.</para><para>The white paper has two strategic elements. Firstly, we want to encourage more international visitors and Australians to go beyond the metropolitan areas and discover regional and rural Australia. Secondly, we want them to have the best experiences through the best products. The aim is to develop Australia as a `platinum plus' destination, one that is a market leader in quality and value. This is a key factor in maintaining and increasing our world share of tourism exports.</para><para>The tourism white paper provides the basis for structural reform of key tourism agencies. It will also provide a platform to maximise the Australian government's investment in tourism.</para><para>The purpose of this bill is the establishment of a new tourism body, to be known as Tourism Australia. This is a key plank of the government's reform agenda for tourism. Tourism Australia will encompass the functions of the Australian Tourist Commission, See Australia, the Tourism Forecasting Council and the Bureau of Tourism Research. It will also include a new unit, to be known as Tourism Events Australia. </para><para>Since its creation by the coalition government in 1967, the Australian Tourist Commission has been responsible for promoting Australia overseas. Through an effective partnership model with industry, it has been instrumental in doubling Australia's international visitors since the early 1990s. The successful elements of the Australian Tourist Commission Act 1987 have been incorporated into the Tourism Australia legislation.</para><para>See Australia is a private company which receives significant funding from the Australian government. Its main role is to encourage Australians to travel in Australia through generic tourism promotion, such as the `Go on. Get out there' campaign.</para><para>The Bureau of Tourism Research is the main source of tourism related statistical and research information in Australia. Its key publications are the international and national visitor surveys, which provide information about the characteristics and travel behaviour of international visitors and Australian residents. The Tourism Forecasting Council was established by the Australian government to provide consensus forecasts of Australian tourism activity. </para><para>This bill will bring together these vital mechanisms for delivery of the government's support for tourism into a coherent body which will give strong leadership for the growth and development of the tourism industry. Tourism Australia will have a broad range of responsibilities including support for international and domestic marketing and market development, events and business tourism, and the provision of key tourism research, statistics and analysis. </para><para>A key aspect of Tourism Australia's international and promotional activity will be the new branding of Australia. This is a unique opportunity to bring together all aspects of Australian life, from the arts and sport right through to agriculture and business exports. With this new branding we can promote Australia in a holistic sense.</para><para>A great example of this is the Australian wine industry. Australia sells more than 1,000 bottles of wine every minute outside of our country. Significant benefits for regional Australia will flow if we can turn each bottle of wine into a liquid postcard of Australia. In marketing terms, this presents an excellent leveraging opportunity. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Background</inline></para><para>Tourism makes a substantial contribution to the Australian economy. In 2001-02, tourism was directly responsible for 4.5 per cent of Australia's gross domestic product, 549,000 jobs or 5.9 per cent of all employed, and $17.1 billion in export earnings or 11.2 per cent of total exports.</para><para>Tourism contributes to the preservation of the environment and heritage by placing an economic value on them, and to significant job creation, especially in rural and remote communities. It is an excellent vehicle for advancing the government's economic, social and environmental objectives, particularly in regional Australia. </para><para>Over the past few years, the Australian tourism industry has endured the adverse impacts of a series of international events. These events challenged the capacity of the industry to maintain sustained tourism growth and respond quickly and effectively to major incidents. The tourism white paper contains a number of initiatives directed towards enhancing the tourism industry's capacity to be more flexible in responding to future shocks. The establishment of Tourism Australia is a key element in achieving this objective.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Major features</inline></para><para>Tourism Australia will be established as a statutory body subject to the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 (CAC Act). This recognises the commercial focus of the new body and the need for it to operate flexibly in a commercial environment.</para><para>An important consideration in establishing Tourism Australia as an independent body is to allow it to engage more actively on a commercial basis with industry. This includes actively seeking industry's contribution to marketing and promotional campaigns. In carrying out its functions, Tourism Australia will also work closely with state and territory tourism agencies, regional tourism organisations and other key stakeholders. Tourism Australia will also have additional resources to better forecast emerging trends in the global tourism market and therefore to maximise returns on government investment and Australia's growth potential.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">The functions of Tourism Australia</inline></para><para>The new organisation will help to foster a prosperous and sustainable tourism industry in Australia. Tourism Australia will harness the skills and knowledge of four key national tourism organisations under one umbrella. Amalgamation of these entities into one body will help improve coordination and effectiveness in achieving the Australian government's vision of a strong and vibrant Australian tourism industry. </para><para>The principal objects of Tourism Australia are to influence people to travel to and within Australia, including for events. This includes both international and domestic visitors. Tourism Australia will also help to foster a sustainable tourism industry in Australia, and will help to increase the economic benefits to Australia from tourism.</para><para>It is vital that Australia is highly competitive in tourism marketing and promotion to ensure potential tourists, both domestic and international, increasingly consider and choose Australia as their next holiday destination, or business or event location.</para><para>Tourism Australia will develop strategies to promote growth in the number of international and domestic visitors, and maximise yield, importantly, from those visitors. Tourism Australia will seek to achieve this through developing marketing and promotional strategies that position Australia as a market leader in quality and value, raising awareness of Australia's unique attributes, and strategically marketing Australia to key markets.</para><para>It is recognised that many regional areas of Australia have a growing reliance on tourism for generating business activity and jobs, especially in the small to medium sized business sector. Tourism Australia will encourage international and domestic visitors to travel throughout Australia, to ensure that tourism contributes strongly to the economic wellbeing of regional Australia.</para><para>Tourism Australia will help guide the development of tourism product in regional areas, helping to ensure that products and services correspond with visitor demand, and develop strategies to encourage the dispersal of international visitors throughout Australia. Tourism Australia will also promote the benefits of holidays to Australians, and of exploring their own country.</para><para>Significant economic benefits can be gained from the staging of events, not only for the tourism industry, but also for the businesses which indirectly benefit from tourism, and the broader community. Tourism Australia will establish a special events unit called Tourism Events Australia. This unit will work with state and territory governments to maximise the return on investment associated with attracting and staging international events in Australia.</para><para>Timely and accurate data and research is vital to the Australian tourism industry and government. It provides a foundation for informed decision making and underpins strategic business planning, including new product development, and also helps in public policy planning. Tourism Australia, through a business unit, Tourism Research Australia, will provide an enhanced research and statistical base, which will cater better for the needs of industry and government. Tourism Research Australia will work with state and territory tourism agencies to ensure better access to research for tourism businesses, particularly in regional areas.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Structure of the board and appointment of members</inline></para><para>The Tourism Australia Bill 2004 provides for the establishment of a board of directors of Tourism Australia, comprising a chair, a deputy chair, a government member, the managing director and four other members. Appointments to the board will be based on skills in one or more areas, including tourism and related industries, corporate governance, marketing and promotion, regional development, environmental management and financial and business management.</para><para>The board of Tourism Australia will provide direction and set policy for this new organisation. It will also determine the structure of Tourism Australia, incorporating industry and government views. </para><para>The board of Tourism Australia will also have the power to establish advisory panels. The panels will advise the board of Tourism Australia on key issues like international and domestic tourism, research and events. Panel members will be drawn from across tourism and broader industries, government and/or perhaps academia. These panels will play an important role in ensuring stakeholder involvement in maximising tourism's contribution to the economy and our society.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Corporate planning and accountability</inline></para><para>As with all Australian government bodies, Tourism Australia will be required to be accountable for its activities. This bill requires close and effective communication between Tourism Australia and its minister, particularly during the reporting and planning processes. This includes the requirement to provide the minister with a three-year corporate plan and an annual operational plan.</para><para>Tourism Australia will be required to produce an annual report consistent with its obligations under the CAC Act. The annual report will also include additional matters required under this bill, such as an assessment against performance indicators, the extent to which operations have achieved objectives in the operational plan, and any joint activities undertaken by Tourism Australia.</para><para>Tourism Australia will employ staff by virtue of a power in this enabling legislation. This allows maximum employment flexibility and efficiency in employment arrangements in line with the strong commercial role of Tourism Australia. Tourism Australia staff will be required to adopt a set of values and a code of conduct, ensuring responsible and ethical work practices. Details regarding the movement of staff into the new body will be covered in a transitional arrangements bill to be introduced in the winter sittings.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">The future</inline></para><para>This bill, the Tourism Australia Bill 2004, implements significant structural reform designed to enhance the future of Australian tourism. It represents the consolidation of four key tourism organisations into one body, which will maximise the impact of the Australian government's investment in our tourism industry.</para><para>The new body signals a more focused and mature approach, including a change from relying on strategies based on volume to strategies based on yield and profitability. Tourism Australia will provide the foundation to position Australia as the world leader in the provision of tourism goods and services.</para><para>The formation of Tourism Australia is one of a series of initiatives outlined in the tourism white paper, which was the culmination of an extensive consultation process and was extremely effective in bringing the tourism industry together, and focusing attention on strategies for the future.</para><para>I have consulted with the Industry Implementation Advisory Group, which is a body comprising industry and government representatives established to advise the government on the implementation of the tourism white paper initiatives, and the principles in the Tourism Australia Bill 2004 have met with their support. I have also received valuable advice from the Structural Reform Group, which I established to oversee the transition of the four existing bodies into Tourism Australia, on specific elements of this bill. I would like to thank both groups for their significant input into this bill.</para><para>Tourism Australia will build on the relationships formed with industry and state and territory governments, during the tourism white paper process. It will ensure that the Australian tourism industry meets its growth potential, and becomes an even more significant contributor to Australia's economic growth. </para><para>I commend the bill to the House and I present the explanatory memorandum.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Melham</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>NEW INTERNATIONAL TAX ARRANGEMENTS (PARTICIPATION EXEMPTION AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2004</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>27923</page.no><id.no>R2017</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>27923</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ross Cameron</inline>, and read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>27923</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>27923</page.no><name role="metadata">Cameron, Ross, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ROSS CAMERON</name><name.id>3K6</name.id><electorate>Parramatta</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>The <inline ref="R2017">bill </inline>I am introducing today contains three significant government reforms intended to modernise Australia's international tax regime following its review of those rules. It delivers the third instalment of international tax reforms, following closely the debate on a bill containing measures from that review targeted at the superannuation and funds management industries and the enactment of a new tax treaty with the United Kingdom.</para><para>This bill focuses on the offshore business operations of Australian companies, making those active business operations more competitive. It allows companies to disregard capital gains from the sale of shares in active foreign subsidiaries, extends the current exemption for foreign dividends and branch profits to all countries and gives companies more freedom on where to locate their intra-group service companies. The first two of these measures are commonly referred to as a participation exemption. </para><para>With these measures, Australian companies will be better able to compete for capital and will have more flexibility in using that capital. With over $160 billion invested in foreign operations by Australian companies, the productive use of that capital is of utmost importance to the wellbeing of all Australians.</para><para>Schedule 1 to the bill reduces the amount of the capital gain or capital loss that will be subject to Australia's capital gains tax rules where Australian companies (or Australian-controlled foreign companies) sell shares in a foreign company with an underlying active business. A calculation of the proportion of the foreign company's assets that are active assets will be required to determine by how much a capital gain or loss is reduced.</para><para>Reducing the taxable gain will also assist those companies to compete more effectively in offshore markets with foreign multinationals, particularly those companies based in countries providing similar capital gains tax relief. By reducing the tax implications from selling interests in foreign subsidiaries greater flexibility is provided for corporate restructuring decisions. </para><para>The measure also promotes tax neutrality by ensuring that similar tax consequences will result from the sale of substantial shareholdings in a foreign company as currently occur where the foreign company sells its active foreign business assets and distributes those profits as a dividend.</para><para>This measure will apply to disposals of shares in foreign companies occurring on or after today. Immediate commencement will ensure that taxpayer behaviour remains unaffected by the start date of the measure so that possible adverse revenue consequences are avoided.</para><para>Schedule 2 extends the current tax exemptions for foreign branch profits and non portfolio foreign dividends to all countries from 1 July 2004. The same amounts earned by Australian-controlled foreign companies, regardless of source, will no longer be taxable in Australia.  </para><para>These amendments reduce compliance costs by removing the need for Australian companies to keep track of the sources of their foreign profits as they can now be distributed free of Australian company tax regardless of their country of origin or level of foreign tax. The amendments simplify the length and complexity of the foreign source income rules. </para><para>The classification of countries as either listed countries (the current list of the seven most comparably taxing countries) or unlisted countries (the rest of the world) also simplifies the application of the foreign source income rules and reduces the costs of compliance.</para><para>While section 404 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 that deals with certain portfolio dividends has been retained, necessitating the retention of a second list of over 50 countries, the policy of continuing the operation of that provision will be further reviewed by government.</para><para>Schedule 3 reduces the scope of the `tainted services income' rules. These rules apply to the offshore subsidiaries and branches of an Australian parent company, with the result that the Australian parent can be taxed on income an offshore subsidiary or branch derives from providing services to Australian residents or non-resident associates. </para><para>The application of the attribution rules to services (for example, computing services) provided between offshore group companies has unnecessarily impeded the international competitiveness of Australian companies. This bill therefore generally excludes from the rules, services provided by an offshore subsidiary or branch to its non-resident associates, as from 1 July 2004. It also provides for a more consistent treatment of services provided to branches in Australia and offshore. </para><para>The measure will generally reduce compliance costs for Australian companies, and their offshore subsidiaries, joint-ventures and branches, where those offshore entities provide services to non-resident associates. It may completely remove a small number of offshore entities from the controlled foreign companies regime resulting in additional compliance cost savings.</para><para>The measures in this bill will directly assist Australian companies with foreign subsidiaries or branch operations by generally ensuring that they only pay one layer of (foreign) tax on the profits of those offshore operations as well as reducing compliance costs in many cases. As a general rule, profits from offshore active business operations will not be taxed in Australia. However, any passive or highly mobile income shifted to those offshore investments will continue to be taxed in Australia on an accruals basis.</para><para>In short, by boosting Australia's status as an attractive place from which to invest globally, this bill will make Australian companies internationally competitive, increasing employment both in Australia and overseas. The changes are not just relevant to big business with extensive offshore operations. They will also assist those emerging Australian businesses looking to expand offshore to take advantage of global opportunities.</para><para>Full details of the measures in this bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum.</para><para>I commend this bill and present the explanatory memorandum.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Edwards</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2004 MEASURES NO. 2) BILL 2004</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>27925</page.no><id.no>R2013</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>27925</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ross Cameron</inline>, and read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>27925</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>27925</page.no><name role="metadata">Cameron, Ross, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ROSS CAMERON</name><name.id>3K6</name.id><electorate>Parramatta</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>This <inline ref="R2013">bill</inline> makes amendments to the income tax law and other laws to give effect to several taxation measures.</para><para>Firstly, the amendments in schedule 1 improve the practical operation of the income tax law affecting life insurance companies and ensure that those provisions interact appropriately with other provisions in the income tax law.</para><para>Secondly, after listening to the concerns of business, the government is implementing, in schedule 2, further measures to give taxpayers greater flexibility and certainty as they move into the new consolidation regime.</para><para>As the new consolidation regime has changed the taxation landscape for many corporate groups, the government has continued its active consultation with business on its implementation.</para><para>To further assist business in managing the transition to consolidation, the government has provided its response to a number of issues raised by business and has provided further detail of how it intends to resolve these issues. A number of measures were announced by the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer on 4 December 2003.</para><para>The business community reacted positively to the minister's announcement, praising the government for providing greater flexibility to the consolidation regime and stated that the press release will provide certainty and greater guidance for groups going into consolidation.</para><para>The third measure includes amendments to ensure that limited partnerships with legal personality separate from their partners that are established under the venture capital regime are partnerships for income tax purposes, and able to access the venture capital tax concessions.</para><para>Schedule 4 allows for continuity of fringe benefits tax treatment for non-remote housing benefits where administration and payment of fringe benefits tax is devolved by state or territory governments to a departmental level, and there has been no material change in the provision of the benefit.</para><para>The fifth measure amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 so that capital gains tax event K6 is not inadvertently triggered by the disposal of new interests in demerged entities. This will ensure that the pre-capital gains tax status of membership interests is fully preserved following a demerger.</para><para>Schedule 6 to this bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to ensure that all individuals who make United Medical Protection Limited support payments will be entitled to an income tax deduction for the amount of their contributions in that income year.</para><para>Several technical amendments to the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 are made in schedule 7 to ensure that the GST insurance provisions apply as intended to transactions undertaken by operators of compulsory third party schemes.</para><para>Schedule 8 amends the fringe benefits tax law to provide public ambulance services with the same fringe benefits tax treatment as is provided to public hospitals. Public ambulance services will be able to access a fringe benefits tax exemption of up to $17,000 of grossed-up taxable value per employee. They will also be able to access the remote area housing fringe benefits tax exemption under the same criteria as apply to public hospitals. In addition, the income tax law will be amended to allow public ambulance services to be endorsed to receive tax deductible gifts. </para><para>The ninth measure includes amendments that give effect to the government's response to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation report on the <inline font-style="italic">Taxation of transfers from overseas superannuation funds</inline>.</para><para>The key change will enable a taxpayer who is transferring their overseas superannuation to an Australian complying superannuation fund to elect to have part of the transfer treated as a taxable contribution in the Australian superannuation fund. By doing so the fund, rather than the individual taxpayer, will pay relevant tax arising on the transfer and tax will be paid at the concessional superannuation fund rate rather than at the individual's marginal rate.</para><para>This change will overcome the difficulties currently experienced by individuals who are faced with a tax liability but do not have recourse to funds to pay the liability due to the benefits being preserved in the Australian fund until retirement. This change, combined with the fact that the tax will now be payable at the concessional superannuation fund rate, should encourage affected individuals to transfer their overseas superannuation into an Australian fund.</para><para>A number of related amendments are also made to improve the operation and clarity of the provisions dealing with payments of overseas superannuation.</para><para>Schedule 10 of this bill will amend, as part of the further implementation of the simplified imputation system, division 207 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 which deals with the tax effect of receiving a franked distribution. The amendments will complete the rules that deal with the receipt of a franked distribution indirectly through a partnership or trust. The amendments will also clarify aspects of the operation of division 207 and make consequential changes to division 207 and other parts of the simplified imputation system. In addition, amendments are made to the trans-Tasman imputation rules to implement a minor policy change and ensure consistency with division 207.</para><para>Schedule 11 to this bill makes a number of technical corrections to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936.</para><para>Lastly, schedule 12 will amend the alienation of personal services income provisions to clarify when the Commissioner of Taxation may provide a personal services business determination to taxpayers. Where the commissioner grants a personal services business determination, the alienation provisions do not apply to the taxpayer. The amendments will ensure that the original policy intent of the alienation provisions is maintained.</para><para>Full details of the measures in this bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum.</para><para>I commend this bill and present the explanatory memorandum.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Edwards</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT (FUELS) BILL 2004</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>27926</page.no><id.no>R2022</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>27926</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ross Cameron</inline>, and read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>27926</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>27926</page.no><name role="metadata">Cameron, Ross, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ROSS CAMERON</name><name.id>3K6</name.id><electorate>Parramatta</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>The <inline ref="R2022">Excise Tariff Amendment (Fuels) Bill 2004</inline> contains amendments to the Excise Tariff Act 1921 (Excise Tariff Act)<inline font-style="italic">.</inline></para><para>The amendments contained in the bill have been previously tabled as Excise Tariff Proposals Nos 1, 2, 3 and 4 of 2003. The proposals now require incorporation in the Excise Tariff Act. </para><para>This bill contains three government initiatives: the introduction of excise differentials between diesel with high sulphur content and ultra low sulphur diesel, an increase in excise duty rates for aviation fuels, and imposition of an excise duty on biodiesel.</para><para>The Prime Minister announced in Measures for a Better Environment on 31 May 1999 the government's commitment to apply an excise differential of an additional 1c per litre on high sulphur diesel from 1 January 2003 and a further 1c per litre differential from 1 January 2004. The first excise differential was deferred until 1 July 2003 because of the government's concern at the possibility of raising costs to diesel users at a time when the farming sector was facing serious drought conditions. The measure gives effect to the government's decision to encourage the early introduction of ultra low sulphur diesel which will be mandated by 1 January 2006 under the Fuel Quality Standards Act 2000. The bill amends the Excise Tariff Act to incorporate the excise differentials for high sulphur diesel and similar products with high sulphur content that may be used as diesel substitutes.</para><para>An increase in duty on aviation fuels was announced by the government in the 2003-04 federal budget to provide supplementary funding for the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) in the financial year 2003-04. Duties on aviation fuels provide a substantial proportion of funding for CASA, which is estimated to receive 11 per cent less than the forecasted revenue due to reduced worldwide demand for air travel, cessation of Ansett operations and the introduction of larger and more fuel-efficient aircraft. The increase in duties will ensure CASA is adequately resourced to continue its safety regulatory responsibilities and maintain Australia's enviable aviation safety record. Amendments in the bill increase the excise duty rate for aviation kerosene and aviation gasoline by 0.306c per litre. </para><para>The imposition of excise duty on biodiesel was announced by the government in the 2003-04 federal budget as part of the government's broader fuel tax reform arrangements that bring all currently untaxed fuels into the excise and customs duty systems. The reform establishes a broad sustainable taxation framework providing increased certainty for investors as well as establishing a fairer and more transparent fuel excise system with improved competitive neutrality between fuels. Amendments in the bill incorporate biodiesel into the excise tariff and apply an excise duty rate to biodiesel of 38.143c per litre, equivalent to ultra low sulphur diesel, from 18 September 2003.</para><para>The bill also makes a minor amendment to a formula for calculating excise duty on excisable blended petroleum products to allow deduction of previously paid duties for duty paid components of gasoline/fuel ethanol blends. </para><para>This bill is drafted with two schedules as the passage of the <inline ref="R1803">Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003</inline>, pending debate in parliament, impacts on the provisions of this bill in minor technical references.

Complementary changes are being made to the Excise Tariff Act 1921 through the <inline ref="R2022">Excise Tariff Amendment (Fuels) Bill 2004</inline>.</para><para>First, the bill provides new differential rates of customs duty for high sulphur diesel, and introduces ultra low sulphur diesel as a new tariff item.</para><para>As part of the Measures for a Better Environment package announced by the Prime Minister on 31 May 1999, the government made a commitment to apply to high sulphur diesel a customs duty of 1c per litre on top of the normal diesel rate of 38.143c per litre from 1 January 2003, and 2c per litre from 1 January 2004.

The report of the committee arose out of a request from the Special Minister of State, Senator the Hon. Eric Abetz, in May 2003. The government response to the report of the committee was tabled on 16 October 2003.</para><para>Further electoral reform measures are contained in the <inline ref="R2030">Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Enrolment Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2004</inline> which I am also introducing today. The amendments contained in this bill will improve the operation of the electoral system.</para><para>The amendments cover a number of broad areas including enrolment issues; access to the electoral roll and its use; the lead-up to election day including preparations undertaken by the Australian Electoral Commission (the AEC), political parties, candidates and others; the processes for voting; and the operation of polling booths on election day. The major amendments include:</para><para>	improving public access to the electoral roll;</para><para>	restructuring the provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 relating to entitlement to information contained in the roll to make them more easily understandable;</para><para>	extending end-use restrictions on roll information and related penalties to all forms of the roll;</para><para>	removing the roll from sale in any format;</para><para>	requiring the AEC to publish a statement of reasons for decisions not to register proposed party names;</para><para>	allowing scrutineers to be present at pre-poll voting centres;</para><para>	prohibiting broadcasting of political material that is audible within close proximity of polling places;</para><para>	allowing for the temporary suspension or adjournment of polling for physical and safety reasons; and</para><para>	clarifying procedures for the nomination of candidates for election to both houses of parliament.</para><para>Over time, access to the roll has been extended to include state and territory electoral authorities, Australian government agencies, health screening programs and medical researchers. The forms in which the roll is provided have also evolved to keep pace with technological change. Finally, measures regulating the uses to which roll information can be put have been steadily increased over time. All of these changes have created roll access provisions that are complex, out of date and, in some cases, contradictory.  </para><para>The bill will amend the roll access provisions to improve clarity, remove contradiction and improve privacy protections. Access to roll information will be set out in tabular form. The tables will include all information that is currently provided for in the Electoral Act. They list who is entitled to roll information, what information they are entitled to and how often they will receive it. Apart from the printed version of the roll, the amendments will remove all references to the form of the roll from the Electoral Act. This means that the Australian Electoral Commission will be able to keep pace with changes in technology and provide access to roll information in new and more accessible forms such as on the Internet. Improved access to the roll will enable people to check their enrolment details.</para><para>The amendments will extend the end-use restrictions to all roll information, regardless of form. This measure will close a loophole that has allowed roll information to be used for commercial and other unintended uses, such as direct marketing and debt collection. Finally, the roll will be removed from sale, closing off the means by which people obtain roll information for commercial and other unintended uses. Copies of the roll will be available for inspection at all AEC offices.</para><para>The bill introduces a new accountability mechanism for decisions about party names.</para><para>The AEC will be required to provide a written notice of reasons for its decision not to register a party name to the parties to an application for, or objection to, the registration of a party name. The reasons will be provided to all parties of an application for, or objection to, the registration of a party name.</para><para>There are a number of improvements to polling administration also in the bill. The first of these relates to scrutineers. Scrutineers are an essential part of the polling process, a defence against fraud and a guarantee of accountability. However, under the existing provisions of the Electoral Act scrutineers are not permitted to attend pre-poll voting centres. The implications of this are significant in light of the fact that, according to the JSCEM, nearly 600,000 pre-poll votes were cast at the 2001 federal election.</para><para>The bill will amend the Electoral Act and the referendum act to allow scrutineers to attend pre-poll voting offices to scrutineer pre-poll voting, improving accountability for all these pre-poll votes.</para><para>One of the characteristics of recent elections in Australia is the increasing sophistication candidates bring to canvassing outside polling booths. For example, one innovation examined by the committee is the use of broadcasting equipment to canvass for votes. While innovative, this form of canvassing may result in the political message being heard in the polling booth, which is against the spirit of the Electoral Act. The bill amends the Electoral Act and the referendum act to prevent the use of broadcasting equipment for canvassing that can be heard within six metres of the entrance to the polling booth, at the entrance to the polling booth, and inside the polling booth.</para><para>A further amendment to the Electoral Act and referendum act will allow a temporary suspension of voting where there is a threat to the safety of electors or a difficulty in the physical conduct of polling.

The government response to the JSCEM report was tabled on 16 October last year.  </para><para>Further measures arising from the government supported recommendations of this report will be implemented in the <inline ref="R2029">Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Access to Electoral Roll and Other Measures) Bill 2004</inline>. Several measures in this bill have been carried over from the <inline ref="R1501">Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Roll Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2002</inline>, which is currently before the parliament. That bill gave effect to the government's legislative response to the committee's report on the 1998 federal election. I propose that debate not proceed on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Roll Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2002.</para><para>The bill also includes the legislation for the government's response to the JSCEM's report on the integrity of the electoral roll titled <inline font-style="italic">User Friendly, Not Abuser Friendly</inline>.</para><para>The most significant amendments of this bill include those that will:</para><para>	outline the principles of new arrangements for proof of identity and address for applicants for enrolment or re-enrolment; applicants wishing to change their enrolled name or address; and applicants claiming a provisional vote because their names do not appear on the certified list on election day;</para><para>	include the sex and date of birth of electors on the certified list as a check on identity when voting; </para><para>	allow for the close of rolls for new electors to be 6 p.m. on the day on which the writ for an election is issued, and for the close of rolls for those amending their enrolment details to be 8 p.m. three working days after the issue of the writ; </para><para>	allow political parties and Independent members of parliament to be provided with certain information about where electors voted on election day;</para><para>	provide that prisoners serving a sentence of full-time detention are not allowed to vote;</para><para>	introduce enrolment based on address rather than subdivision;</para><para>	prevent scrutineers from actively assisting electors who have requested an assisted vote; and</para><para>	increase a number of the financial disclosure thresholds to $3,000.</para><para>The government remains committed to preserving and enhancing the integrity of the electoral roll and believes the introduction of new arrangements for proof of identity and address at the point of enrolment will significantly enhance roll integrity and reduce electoral fraud.  </para><para>The legislation provides for the broad principles of a proof of identity scheme, with regulations to prescribe the arrangements. The regulations will be developed in consultation with the state and territory governments. Privacy issues will be taken into account in the development of the regulations.</para><para>In its response to the committee's report on the 2001 federal election, the government indicated that it favoured the use of a drivers licence number to verify an applicant's identity and address when enrolling or changing enrolment details. The drivers licence number would be included on the enrolment form, with the AEC checking the details from records on state and territory databases or from details provided by the states and territories.</para><para>Alternate forms of acceptable identification documentation, to be prescribed in the regulations, could be provided by applicants who do not have a drivers licence. Where no identification documentation is available, only people in a prescribed class would be able to provide written references supporting an enrolment application.</para><para>Developing the scheme in consultation with the states and territories will facilitate preservation of the joint roll arrangements and enable access to information databases.  </para><para>Similar requirements for proof of identity and address will be introduced for provisional voters whose names do not appear on the certified list on polling day. Implementation of these measures will provide a further important check on identity fraud at the point of voting.  </para><para>The inclusion of electors' sex and date of birth on the certified lists used on polling day will provide another important check on identity fraud at the point of voting. The new arrangements will give the presiding officer in each polling booth the discretion to ask electors questions about their sex and date of birth in cases where the presiding officer has some doubt about the identity of the elector, based on the information on the certified list. As a measure to prevent any potential disenfranchisement of voters, where the presiding officer continues to have doubts about the elector's identity following the answers to the questions, the elector will be able to cast a provisional vote.</para><para>As a further measure to preserve the integrity of the electoral roll, amendments to allow for the close of rolls for new electors to be 6 p.m. on the day on which the writ is issued, and for the close of rolls for those amending their enrolment to be 8 p.m. three working days after the issue of the writ will ensure that the Australian Electoral Commission has sufficient time to verify details provided by applicants for enrolment. The government remains committed to the introduction of the early close of the roll.</para><para>The government considers that these, and other measures in the bill, are important and urgent reforms to the electoral process, which should be implemented as soon as possible.  </para><para>I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McClelland</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>PARLIAMENTARY SUPERANNUATION BILL 2004</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>27933</page.no><id.no>R2028</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>27933</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Slipper</inline>, and read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>27933</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>27933</page.no><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SLIPPER</name><name.id>0V5</name.id><electorate>Fisher</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>The <inline ref="R2028">Parliamentary Superannuation Bill 2004</inline> is part of a package of two bills.

We received over 3,000 submissions, then again asked for the veterans' feedback on the report's recommendations before we gave our government response. I am proud that the government's response to the Clarke review delivers even more for veterans and war widows across Australia.</para><para>The Clarke committee made 109 recommendations, more than half of which called for no change to current arrangements, and the government has accepted these.</para><para>This bill implements the changes announced on 2 March 2004, including addressing benefits for disability pension recipients; making an ex gratia payment to former prisoners of the Korean War; increasing assistance for war widows and widowers; and extending operational service to minesweeping personnel.</para><para>Importantly, the bill implements two significant measures to address key issues for veterans in receipt of the disability pension.</para><para>First, new indexation arrangements will mean that our most disabled veterans will have that portion of their disability pension paid above 100 per cent of the general rate indexed by the same proportion as the service pension and the war widows and widowers pensionâthat is, with reference to movements in the consumer price index and male total average weekly earnings.</para><para>Swift passage of these amendments will allow an early back payment of the increased indexation to 20 March 2004, benefiting more than 45,000 disability pensioners.</para><para>Second, from September 2004 the government will introduce the Defence Force Income Support Allowance (DFISA). This measure addresses a key issue of concern regarding the inclusion of the disability pension as income for pensions and benefits paid to recipients and their partners under social security law.</para><para>The amount of DFISA will be equal to the difference between the amount of income support a person receives under social security law, and the amount the person would receive if the disability pension was not counted as income in the assessment of their social security payment, and a disability pension income test for rent assistance was applicable.</para><para>The new allowance will be paid to eligible persons receiving a range of Centrelink payments including the age pension, disability support pension, carer payment, Newstart allowance and parenting payment.</para><para>As recommended by the Clarke committee, the government will make an ex gratia payment of $25,000 to former Australian prisoners of war held during the Korean War, or their surviving widows, who were alive on 1 July 2003.</para><para>The payment will be made in the same way as the payment to former prisoners of war held by Japan during World War II, in recognition of the extremely inhumane conditions endured by Australian POWs during the Korean War.</para><para>This is a beneficial measure which is aimed to ensure that the largest possible number of former prisoners of the Korean War, or their surviving spouse, will be able to receive the payment. </para><para>In relation to war widows and widowers, the government will pay rent assistance, in addition to the ceiling rate of the income support supplement, to some 11,000 war widows and widowers who are renting private accommodation. Currently rent assistance is paid within the ceiling rate of the income support supplement.</para><para>A small number of war widows who are also veterans in their own right, receiving the ceiling rate of service pension and renting privately, will also benefit from increased rent assistance under this measure.</para><para>This initiative reflects the finding of the Clarke report that war widows and widowers renting in the private market are in need of additional assistance. Rent assistance is not available to those renting government owned properties, as their rent is already subsidised. </para><para>War widows and widowers receiving their income support payment from Centrelink will continue to have their rent assistance counted towards the income support ceiling rate. However, they will be able to transfer to DVA for payment of their income support, thereby benefiting from this initiative, and I would encourage them to do so.</para><para>The increase in war widow and widower's rent assistance will require significant administrative changes by my department. However, I have directed that the changes be accelerated and the increases will take effect from 1 January 2005, several months earlier than originally thought possible, at an additional cost of $5 million.</para><para>In line with another recommendation of the Clarke report, the maximum funeral benefit will be increased from $572 to $1000. </para><para>The funeral benefit is intended to reduce the funeral expenses for eligible veterans and certain dependants, including former prisoners of war and recipients of the totally and permanently incapacitated pension and the extreme disablement adjustment rate. The increase in the maximum funeral benefit will take effect from 1 July 2004.</para><para>Finally, this bill will extend operational service to personnel involved in minesweeping and bomb clearance operations after World War II who have qualifying service. This addresses an anomaly where a small number of personnel received the medal necessary to be eligible for qualifying service, but are not veterans because their service fell outside the operational service periods specified in the Veterans' Entitlements Act.</para><para>The government's response to the Clarke committee delivers a generous and responsible package of measures to enhance the benefits and support available to veterans and war widows. </para><para>Again, I thank the members of the veteran community who participated in this important review process. I would also like to acknowledge our defence and veterans affairs committee, chaired ably by the member for Gilmore, and members of that committee, notably the members for Blair, McPherson, McEwen, Cowper, Deakin, Riverina, Hinkler and Herbert, who are all passionate advocates for veterans in their electorates.</para><para>The government's response to the Clarke report will deliver significant and enduring benefits to veterans and war widows across Australia. It is this government that has increased spending on veterans' issues by a massive $4 billion since 1996. This financial year we allocated over a massive $10 billion to the needs of war widows and veterans. This government has a strong track record and our response to Clarke and the new Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Bill 2003 continues that strong commitment to our veterans and war widows.

The Old Parliament House gardens reconstruction is a major project currently under development by the National Capital Authority. The total project comprises garden beds, paving, tennis courts, lighting, entrances, pergolas, arbours, kiosks, maintenance buildings and fencing. The project has the support of the former Australian Heritage Commission and the works have been approved by the authority and both houses of parliament. </para><para>The proposed site for this commemorative fountain is located at the entrance to the House of Representatives gardens on a concrete walkway linking Old Parliament House to Constitution Place. This site for a fountain was part of the former approved works. The approved construction drawings, CDD/O2 EO1 and EO6, show a circular future fountain in this location. This proposal is for a fountain in that location but of a design specifically to commemorate the centenary of women's suffrage. </para><para>The new design for the fountain comprises a rectangular water feature approximately 7 metres long by 2.5 metres wide by 0.4 metres high. The base of the water feature will be lined with a mosaic inspired by wisteria in the suffragette shades of green, white and purple. Visual interest will be provided by water jets within the fountain. The border of the water feature will be etched regarding the passage of the Commonwealth Franchise Act in 1902 and commemoration of the 1903 election in which women voted and stood for parliament for the first time. A time line will extend from the water feature along a wisteria covered pergola, with concrete paving towards Constitution Place. Along the time line will be recorded the names and achievements of significant women in Australian political life, generally as identified on the drawings as provided by the Office of the Status of Women. </para><para>The National Capital Authority has advised that it is prepared to grant works approval to the proposal pursuant to subsection 12(1)(b) of the Planning and Land Management Act 1988 of the Australian Capital Territory. The Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories was advised of the proposal on 10 March 2001. It is proposed that the works commence in mid-2004, to be completed by December 2004.

We have managed to get the bills through the parliament on what is scheduled as the last day of sitting, which will allow us implement the new measures from the beginning of the new financial yearâa very satisfying achievement. As I have said before, the importance of this legislation cannot be overstated. It will put in place a modern framework of best practice for a repatriation system which fulfils the nation's commitment to meet the needs of those who serve in the defence of Australia, indeed our future veterans.

The amendments also propose to specify detention conditions for any detained child. These amendments are unnecessary. The existing legislative scheme is sufficiently flexible to respond to the specific needs of individual detainees, including children.</para><para>The amendments also introduce complexity and uncertainty since they do not specify whether unaccompanied children will be granted visas and, if so, on what conditions upon their release. The Senate amendments are also at odds with the universal visa system contained in the Migration Act 1958. The amendments remove the discretion vested in the minister to ensure that the most appropriate arrangements are made for each individual unaccompanied child, and which arrangements may not necessarily be placements with a foster family or community based care arrangement, as required by the proposed Senate amendment. The proposed section 197E, relating to detention conditions of any detained child, is unworkable and creates a potential risk to the welfare of children. The proposed section requires detained children to be accommodated with their family members yet does not define `family members' and does not provide any protection for children at risk from abuse from family members. Accordingly, the government does not accept these amendments. </para><para>Further, proposed Senate amendment (3) seeks to partially implement a package of amendments to the Migration Regulations 1994 that was disallowed by the Senate in October 2003. The proposed amendments broaden the coverage of temporary protection visa arrangements to include all asylum seekers arriving in Australia, not only those arriving unlawfully. These Senate amendments also provide the ability to grant TPVs and temporary humanitarian visas for periods shorter than those currently specified in the Migration Regulations 1994.</para><para>Finally, the proposed amendments would remove the seven-day ruleâwhich prevents noncitizens who, while en route to Australia, spend seven or more days in a country where they could have obtained effective protection, from applying for a visa in Australiaâfor certain subclass 785 visa holders. The proposed amendments undermine the changes that were made by the parliament in September 2001 as part of a tiered, comprehensive, legislative approach to providing protection in Australia. In particular, the selective implementation of some of the amendments that were disallowed undermines the overall framework designed to remove incentives for those who have bypassed opportunities for protection elsewhere to obtain permanent residence at the expense of Australia's international resettlement program. The proposed abolition of the seven-day rule for certain subclass 785 visa holders would allow forum shopping by applicants who could have sought and obtained effective protection in a country through which they had passed to get to Australia. This would also encourage people smugglers to attempt to deliver these persons to Australia. Accordingly, the government does not accept these amendments.</para><para>Proposed amendment (4) has the effect of limiting the duration of TPVs to 24 months and preventing TPV holders from applying for another temporary visa. This proposed amendment would thus restrict refugee applicants to only one TPV, with a permanent visa to follow where the person remains in need of protection. The amendment appears to be intended to remove the seven-day rule; however, in order to give effect to this intention, it is necessary also to change the criteria for the permanent protection visa subclass, which the proposed amendment does not do. The proposed Senate amendment prevents noncitizens granted a TPV from obtaining a further protection visa of any sort for a period of six months. As with Senate amendment (3), these amendments undermine the comprehensive legislative approach to providing protection for Australia adopted by the parliament in 2001. Accordingly, the government does not accept these amendments.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>27946</page.no><name role="metadata">Smith, Stephen, MP</name><name role="display">Mr STEPHEN SMITH</name><name.id>5V5</name.id><electorate>Perth</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe House should agree to these amendments. They will benefit our migration system and be a considerable advance for children in detention and people on temporary protection visas. The minister has, I think, fairly and adequately outlined the substance of the amendments. I do not agree with some of his technical commentary on the amendments, but I will come to that in due course. Of course, the <inline ref="R1506">Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002</inline> arrived in the parliament in 2002. The bill contains provisions to make it easier, essentially, for the Commonwealth to prosecute people smugglers, so it is a matter of general regret that it has taken the government two years to get it here.</para></talk.start><para>So far as the children in detention issue is concerned, the Labor Party, as the minister would know, has had a policy for a considerable period of time that all children should be out of detention. When the bill first came to the House in 2002, we moved a comparable amendment. The amendment on that occasion referred to the residential style accommodation at Woomera, which was a trial conducted by the government. The amendment on this occasion refers to the residential style accommodation at Port Augustaâit is seven kilometres from Baxterâwhich is, in my view, the sort of residential accommodation we should be looking to. I have inspected the facility, as I assume some members and ministers have. The amendment refers to that. </para><para>It is absolutely essential, in our view, that children be removed from detention. There is more than one study which shows the severity of the adverse impact of detention on children. In her comments on the bill in committee in the Senate on 30 March, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Vanstone, said:</para><quote><para>... there are now 13 children in detention on the mainland in Australia. There are a further 15 on Christmas Island, which is still Australia.</para></quote><para>It is nice to get that acknowledgement. She continued:</para><quote><para>I say 13, but at the beginning of February there were 15. It is important to understand that, of those 15 children, 10 could have gone to a residential housing project had their parents or guardians agreed that they could do so.</para></quote><para>The amendment which the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs urges the House to reject would have the effect of making it easier for children and their families to be accommodated in the residential style accommodation. But, so far as the numbers are concerned, the minister always likes to downplay the number of children who are actually in detention. The situation report on numbers of detainees as at 24 March 2004âwhich is the most recent one I have available to me; I think the next one will be published tomorrowâsays, on the basis of the department's own statistics, as supplied to them by the private providers, that in Baxter we currently have seven children, in the Port Hedland immigration centre we have two, on Christmas Island there are 13 accompanied and three unaccompanied. That makes 25, but of course the minister always loves to exclude the 80-odd children who remain in Nauru. Although the minister says the Commonwealth, the government and the people of Australia are not responsible for them, it is clearly the case that we are. So if you take into account the children on Nauru, we continue to have over 100 children in immigration detention who have sought asylum or refugee status in Australia.</para><para>It is the caseâand I acknowledge itâthat, whatever the fine margins of the statistics, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs has been doing her level best to get as many children out of detention as possible. She has not been publicising that, but she has been doing it. That is clear from the rolling statistics that you find since she became the minister. That is a good thing; I do not criticise that. But she has essentially been doing that through the back door rather than doing it up front as a public policy mechanism.</para><para>What would drive the minister to do that? I acknowledge that she may well think it is actually a good thing to do, but certainly the government also has a worry and concern about this issue. The government, I expect, will shortly be on the receiving end of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission reportâthe HREOC reportâon children in detention. I have no special knowledge as to what might be in that report, but I suspect that it will not be a complimentary document about this area of public policy. </para><para>It is my understanding that there are more than one or two cases running before the courts which might actually raise the constitutional question as to whether the detention of children is constitutionally lawful. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> The Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs would remember that, when we considered the Migration Amendment (Duration of Detention) Bill 2004 in the House recently, the constitutionality of immigration detention as an administrative measure was raised. I remind the minister of what he had to say in that debate. On 19 February, in his second reading speech on the <inline ref="R1982">Migration Amendment (Duration of Detention) Bill 2004</inline>, the minister said:</para><quote><para>This shows the effect of the mandatory detention regime introduced by the previous Labor government as a deterrent for those who would put children, women and, indeed, themselves onto boats or use other means to try to enter Australia unlawfully. Simply put, fewer people are attempting to do so. This shows the success of the measure.</para></quote><para>I draw attention to that because, when one goes to the second reading speech in the Senate, which was presented on 4 March by Senator Ian Campbell, the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads, and the Minister representing the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, that paragraph is not there. It has mysteriously been removed. I wonder why the government did that? It is an interesting question. It may well be the case that, as the courts look at the constitutionality of the detention of children, they will look to, as they do under the Acts Interpretation Act, second reading contributions made by ministers. If they look at the second reading contributions made during the debate on the duration of detention legislation, they will find the minister in this House saying that the detention of children in Australia has operated as a deterrent, but they will not find that said in the Senate. It is an interesting question as to which second reading speech they might rely upon. I suspect the minister might subsequently be advised that that paragraph was pulled from the speech in the Senate because it might be used in argument to make the point that if you argue that the mandatory detention of children is a deterrent then you might be arguing that the detention of children is not constitutionally available to the Commonwealth. That is why, I suspect, that that paragraph of the minister's speech has been pulled.</para><para>Why are the government absolutely desperate to get as many children out of detention as possible, without essentially letting the community know? They know they are going to be on the receiving end of the HREOC report, they know there is a constitutional issue, and they are desperate to avoid the criticisms which will come from both those things. The minister should just be upfront and acknowledge the public policy failure. The minister should acknowledge that the amendment that we moved two years ago was good then and is good today. It does not suffer from the technical deficiency that the minister asserts.</para><para>Insofar as the temporary protection visa amendment is concerned, the government currently runs a rolling temporary protection visa period of three years. We know that at the moment we have about 9,000 people in the Australian community who are on temporary protection visas. They all came here as unauthorised arrivals on the Prime Minister's watch. He said they were refugees, and he said, `Here's a temporary protection visa. Go out and live in the community.' That is what they have been doing and, by the end of this year, up to 7,000 of them would have been in the community for between three and four years. At the moment, my memory of the figures is that over 4,000 of them have already been out in the community for four years. At the end of this year, of the 9,000 people on temporary protection visas, 7,000 of them will be out there in the community. </para><para>At the last round of Senate estimates, when inquiries were made as to the rate of progress of applications for further protection visas, government officials acknowledged that, essentially, about 600 matters had been finalised. On my calculation, that means, at that current rate of progress, the government would be processing people on temporary protection visas for the next 70 years, before the 9,000 were determined. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> The most insidious aspect of the government's temporary protection visa model is that it is essentially a rolling model. You can be on a temporary protection visa for three years and only have to look forward to another temporary protection visa for a further three years. In theory, you could be on a temporary protection visa in Australia forever.</para><para>The amendments reflect the fact that Labor's position is for a one-off two-year temporary protection visa period. The Labor Party's approach is that, if you do that, you can do it consistent with the provisions of the refugee convention, which the government's model is not. Under our approach, an unauthorised arrival who came to Australia who was accorded refugee status would be placed on a one-off temporary protection period of two years. At the end of that period, the Commonwealth would make an assessment as to whether the ongoing protection of the convention was required. If the ongoing protection of the convention was required, that person would be offered a pathway to permanency. If the ongoing protection of the convention was not required, the person would be returned to his or her country of origin. That actually satisfies the cessation clause of the refugee convention, which the government's model does not. It also gives people certainty. It enables us as a nation to say that we have carried out our obligations as a good international citizen to afford protection where protection is required, but after an appropriate period to make a judgment as to whether ongoing protection is still required. Not many people appreciate it, but the refugee convention always envisaged that the protection afforded by the international community or a nation state might not necessarily be permanent.</para><para>The government seeks to mount the argument that, by changing the temporary protection visa arrangements, this will somehow lessen deterrence for unauthorised arrivals coming to Australia. If the government's temporary protection visa system and model is so terrific, why do we have 9,000 people out there on temporary protection visas at the moment? If the government's temporary protection visa system is so terrific, why did we have over 200 boats arrive in the course of the government's term of office and why do we have up to 13,000 unauthorised arrivals claiming refugee status and 9,000 of them being granted refugee status?</para><para>So the government's fallacious argument on changing the model for temporary protection visas is simply a nonsense. That view is not held by just me. There has been more than one public statement by members opposite that the government's temporary protection visa approach needs to alter. To his credit, the member for Mallee, Mr Forrest, has made public statements urging that the government change its approach in this area. To his credit, the member for Kooyong, Mr Georgiouâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>9V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Pyne, Chris, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Pyne</name></talker><para>âA good member!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Smith, Stephen, MP</name><name role="display">Mr STEPHEN SMITH</name></talker><para>âThat is true. If my memory serves me correctlyâcertainly the member for Sturt would know; he would have been thereâthe member for Kooyong has made comparable comments in his own party room or joint party room meeting. The member for Barker, Mr Secker, has also made comments that the government's approach in this area needs to change, as has, to her credit, the member for Riverina, Mrs Hull. So there is not just one voice saying that the government needs to take stock and change its approach. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The government can do two things. It can take stock of the rolling nature of its TPV system, but it also needs to make a judgment about what it proposes to do with the backlog that it now has. There are 9,000 people out in the community on temporary protection visas. At the current rate of processing, it will take 70 years before their applications are processed. Members of the coalitionâthe members for Mallee, Kooyong, Barker and Riverinaâhave all urged the government to take stock of this situation and change its approach. That is what it should do and that is why the House should agree to these amendments.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>27950</page.no><name role="metadata">Hardgrave, Gary, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HARDGRAVE</name><name.id>CK6</name.id><electorate>Moreton</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want to add further to this discussion to take up some of the points made by the member for Perth. I remind him that he was part of a governmentâeither as an adviser or, indeed, as a member in this placeâthat introduced this process of mandatory detention for unlawful arrivals. In fact, at the time of this process coming into being almost 10 years ago, he would have been a member in this place.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Smith, Stephen, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Stephen Smith</name></talker><para>â1993.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>CK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hardgrave, Gary, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HARDGRAVE</name></talker><para>âNo, it was in 1994, so the member for Perth was a member of the parliament. In 1994, when mandatory detention was measured, there was something in the order of 300 or more children in detention. Today there is, by the member for Perth's numbers, something in the order of 25, although I would prefer to take the minister's word that it is 13. It is important to know that the member for Perth is attempting to create the ambiguity that suits his argument. The minister, Senator Vanstone, has clarified very strongly that there are 13 in detention in Australia. They are people who came on unauthorised boats. That is the same measure that you can apply to my claim that there were 30 times as many 10 years ago under the Australian Labor Party.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This government has put a lot of work into dealing with the important question of the welfare of children. In fact, the children in detention question is not measured by our authorities alone but also by welfare authorities in each of the states where there may happen to be an immigration reception and processing centre. The South Australian Department of Family and Youth Services are the people who go and measure the circumstances for the children. It is not worth going on too long about this, but it is worth noting that those centres have access to medical, dental and psychological services that would be the envy of just about every rural community around Australia. So the Australian government has put a lot of work and commitment into the business of looking after children.</para><para>Ideally, we want children out in an alternative arrangement. Under the Labor Party, there was no mention of alternative arrangements. What the member for Perth is really subscribing to today is a very strong message that is being sent yet again, with a sense of deja vu, that the Labor Party are ready to re-establish their weakness on border protection. He talked about the pathways to permanencyâadd that to the lexicon of our understanding; the lexicon that also shows `coast guides', which bring people into Australia and settle them permanently onshore as quickly as possible. The pathways to permanency are about sending a signal to people smugglers that, should the Labor Party be back in office, they are back in business. </para><para>That is what this is all about. This is why the government is voting down these amendments from the Senate. We want to maintain a strong message to those who want to ply the evil trade of putting children onto boats to try and create a wedge to permanency for those people who want to put children on boats. The point is that the Labor Party are sending this message: `Put children onto a boatâbring your child, put them to the test of the seas, run the risk, take a leaky boat, go to Australiaâand you will get a migration outcome.' What this government is saying instead is that we want to make sure that those who need protection first and foremost get that protection. It is not about proximity; it is about need.</para><para>There is an established system for refugees to gain access to this country. Senator Vanstone should be congratulated because she has recently announced an extension to this refugee commitment that Australia offers to the world. It is an expensive commitment because we provide torture/trauma counselling and settlement services, which I administer, that have no peer anywhere else in the world. We take on an obligation. We are not going to have our obligation and our execution of that obligation taken for granted. The Australian Labor Party should look inside their minds on this and understand that the government has, and very much so, a strength of message that we send to those who want to threaten our sovereignty and our decision-makingâthose who want to use children to drive some sort of wedge and to force an outcome in a migration sense. The Labor Party need to know that, by voting for these Senate amendments, they are sending a strong signal to people smugglers that they are back in business.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>27951</page.no><name role="metadata">Smith, Stephen, MP</name><name role="display">Mr STEPHEN SMITH</name><name.id>5V5</name.id><electorate>Perth</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI will start where the minister finishedâon people smugglers. The government introduced this legislation into the parliament over two years ago. It contained a provision to make it easier for the Commonwealth on evidential grounds to secure convictions against people smugglers. The government has only brought this matter on in the Senate after two years. In the House two years ago, we supported the bill, we supported the people-smuggling change and we moved amendments in respect of children in detention. The government has allowed this bill to languish in the Senate for two years. It says it is tough on people smugglers but, when it has before it a piece of legislation which makes it easier to convict evil people smugglers, it takes two years from introduction to bring the matter before the parliament.</para></talk.start><para>Secondly, on people smugglers, the minister has not told us about the amendments which the government rejected in the Senate with the support of the minor parties. They were amendments moved by the Labor Party which would have toughened up the penalty provisions against people smugglers and introduced new offences so that there would be a raft of penalties and offences, a raft of measures to ensure that there is zero tolerance for people smugglers. So there has been no word about the government rejecting in the Senate this week measures which would have added to the penalties and offences available to Australia to stamp out people-smuggling.</para><para>The next point is the minister's continuing assertion that somehow children in detention act as a deterrent to people smugglers. I have already chided the minister and said that he needs to be very careful about what he says for fear of the government lawyers telling him he is asserting that children in detention is a punitive measure and therefore not constitutional. I drew the minister's attention to the fact that in the Senate the paragraph in respect of children in detention being a deterrent was removed from the second reading speech in the Senate, probably on the advice of government lawyers. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>CK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hardgrave, Gary, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Hardgrave</name></talker><para>âNo, it wasn't.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Smith, Stephen, MP</name><name role="display">Mr STEPHEN SMITH</name></talker><para>âThe minister says it was not, so I am sure he will be able to advise the House on what basis that was done. If he knows, as he has just said to me across the table, that it was not done on the basis of legal advice then he would know on what basis it was done and he will be able to tell the House. I am sure he will happily advise the House.</para></talk.start></continue><para>So far as alternative arrangements are concerned, I strongly support the removal of children to residential housing projects like the one at Port Augusta. I have been there and it is a very good environment, such as all children should haveâthat is the point that is made by our amendments. In terms of the introduction of mandatory detention: I might be wrong, but my memory is that mandatory detention was introduced in 1992. I was not a member of the House at that time, but I did work as an officer of the government. In 1993, like the member for Sturt, I joined the parliament, and so I was a member of the House when the statistics that the minister referred to applied.</para><para>But I make this point, which is more important: I strongly support the system of mandatory detention. When people come here in an unauthorised way, as a nation-state we are entitled to, and we need to, detain those people for health, quarantine, identity and security checks. But once you have done those checks it is possible to have graduations of detention. The obvious graduation of detention is that there is no need, once health and quarantine checks have been done, to detain children in detention. So far as graduations of detention are concerned, you can sensibly have the graduation of the residential housing projects which we see at Port Augusta.</para><para>So, on the basis of the imperative to ensure that there are no children in detention and of needing to ensure that the government is brought to book on its failed TPV policy and accepts the urgings of the members for Mallee, Kooyong, Barker and Riverina that it needs to change tack on the temporary protection visa system, the House should support the amendments adopted by the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>27952</page.no><name role="metadata">Hardgrave, Gary, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HARDGRAVE</name><name.id>CK6</name.id><electorate>Moreton</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAgain, the member for Perth has dug deeply into his own foxhole. The Labor Party amendments in the Senate will do absolutely nothing to stop people-smugglingâthey will reignite people-smuggling. The member for Sturt made a very unparliamentary contribution while the member for Perth was speakingâand it is unlike the member for Sturt to interject! But he did offer an interjection, which I will record. He said that the Labor Party did all they could through the Senate process to delay consideration of this bill. The Labor Party threw many different amendments at this, which the government had to deal with.</para></talk.start><para>If some of the amendments of the member for Perth and the Labor Party had actually been passed by this place today we would have seen Qantas forfeiting 747-400s to the government, because the Labor Party, in their complete misunderstanding of how this all works, talked about something to do with `vessels' bringing unlawfuls being confiscated. Most people who arrive and end up in some form of problem with their visa have come on aircraft, not on boats. And so we could have seen a situation where Qantas might have been forfeiting 747s. We could have had a whole gaggle of them out at Canberra airport if the Labor Party's falsely thought-through amendments had actually seen the light of day. </para><para>The Labor Party's policy is to bring people onshore for processing. That will give the signal to the people smugglers that success can be guaranteedâthat people will get to Australia. It will put the people smugglers back into business. They want to give temporary protection visa holders a guarantee of permanent residency after two years of temporary residency. But all it does is simply drive Australia away from its real obligation, which is to meet the needs of those who are languishing in United Nations High Commission for Refugees camps in other parts of the world waiting for a chance to resettle somewhere else, like here in Australia. I went to the Kakuma refugee camp in northern Kenya 12 months ago, and I saw for myself 92Â½ thousand people languishing in that place, many of them hoping for resettlement in Australia. This year, there will be 9,000 people coming out of the African region to Australia through our settlement programs. It costs us money to do that, but we do that because we have an obligation that we fulfil as a nation.</para><para>The Labor Party's policy talks about increased penalties for people smugglers, but it is actually part of guiding them to Australia. Under this government, there is no product for people smugglers to sell. The goal of getting to Australia is not there, is not deliverable, and so in a marketing sense people smugglers have no way of delivering on the promises they make to the people they try to seek funds from. The Australian Labor Party is all about having a bob each wayâtrying to find a way of getting a message across that it is somehow or other worried about children, when there are about a dozen children currently in any form of detention.</para><para>This government has worked very hard at alternative detention models, which the member for Perth, during his time in the previous government, never raised once in the public policy debate. Never once did he exercise his concern about children when he had an opportunity to. And so now I think it is all about the smokescreen. It is all about policy on the run. It is all about digging themselves in deeper. It shows a sense of weaknessâa sense of weakness that the Australian people worked out a few years ago existed in the Australian Labor Party.</para><para>There were hundreds of children behind the razor wire, as some of those opposite talk about, in the early 1990s. Now, there are a little over a dozen. We are very much looking at the welfare of children. We are also looking to send strong signals that the business of people-smuggling must stop. It is a foul trade. It is a trade that, as a result of the strong measures of this government, has dried up as a means of income for those who were plying it.</para><para>We will not stand idly by and watch the Australian Labor Party water down our effort. We will not have the hands of time turned back to the bad days which existed because of Labor's weakness on this policy issue. No matter what the member for Perth has to say on this issue today, no matter how he tries to dissemble and to reassemble their track record on that side, and tries to find some strength on this issue, at the end of the day we know that this government's tough approach has worked and will continue to work. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>27953</page.no><name role="metadata">Smith, Stephen, MP</name><name role="display">Mr STEPHEN SMITH</name><name.id>5V5</name.id><electorate>Perth</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI will respond very quickly, in reverse order. First, regarding policy on the run: it is the same amendment we moved two years ago when you first introduced the bill. Secondly, we have made it crystal clear that onshore processing can and will occur at Christmas Island. The effect of that is exactly the same as the effect of processing at Nauru and Manus Island. Thirdly, regarding increased penalties: the minister has to bring in the `fly-by' distraction of a Qantas 747âit is a complete furphy and a complete nonsense. Finally, to allay the most outrageous, misleading claim, that the delay in bringing on this bill has been to do with opposition amendments: this bill, having taken two years to be considered by the Senate after it left the House in May 2002, has entirely been a matter for the programming of government business. The delay in this matter, which has delayed the people-smuggling offences, has been a matter entirely in the government's own control. </para></talk.start><para>Question put:</para><motion><para>That the motion (<inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hardgrave's</inline>) be agreed to.</para></motion></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>11:22:00</time.stamp><para>The House divided.</para></division.header><para>(The Deputy SpeakerâHon.

Family tax benefit is part of the tax system and administrative arrangements need to recognise that it is a payment available through the social security and tax systems. Current legislation allows family tax benefit overpayments to be waived in a range of circumstances. The government does not support the Democrat amendment which would change existing waiver provisions. The Democrat amendments would also make tax offsetting optional and change existing overpayment recovery options. The Democrat amendments would impose an additional administrative burden without achieving a better outcome for families. Information on tax offsetting has been included in the Family Assistance Office publications since July 2000. The Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Patterson, has indicated that she is looking at ways to more effectively communicate with family tax benefit families. The Democrat amendments would give customers less time to decide on their repayment method than under existing arrangements.</para><para>The government also opposes the opposition amendments, which would require consent before a family tax benefit reconciliation overpayment can be recovered from a tax refund. Family tax benefit is part of the tax system. Currently tax refunds are used to offset other Commonwealth debts beside family tax benefit overpayments without the consent of the taxpayer.

In this legislation we have sought to convince the government that they ought to change the system to ease the pressure on Australian families and to bring into place a system which is fair. For example, in our amendments we have drawn attention to the government's unfair approach to the stripping of tax returns. We have drawn attention to the fact that the government are refusing to extend the top-up legislation back one year and that there is a whole category of people who are therefore not receiving moneys to which they are entitled.</para></talk.start><para>We think the system needs to be changed root and branch, and we have sought to highlight that through our amendments. But it is not our intention to hold up this legislation any further, because at the next election people will deal with two proposals: they will be able to deal with the government's family payment system and they will be able to judge Labor's system, which will be fairer and better for Australian families. We will regretfully let this legislation pass so that those families that are owed catch-up payments can receive them. But we continue to highlight the fact that the government has been mean, even in this endeavour, by not taking the catch-up back one year further to include a number of people who are still being denied their catch-up payments. We think the place for this issue to be resolved is at the next federal election, where people will have a very clear choice between a fair system under Labor and an unfair system under the Howard government. </para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>27957</page.no><name role="metadata">Pyne, Chris, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PYNE</name><name.id>9V5</name.id><electorate>Sturt</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Family and Community Services</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI present the reasons for the House disagreeing to the Senate amendments and I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the reasons be adopted.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (AWARD SIMPLIFICATION) BILL 2002</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>27957</page.no><id.no>R1678</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>27957</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 31 March, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Abbott</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>27957</page.no><name role="metadata">Tuckey, Wilson, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TUCKEY</name><name.id>SJ4</name.id><electorate>O'Connor</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWhen I spoke on this issue previously I made considerable reference to the fact that modern technology and modern machinery are the alternatives to employment. I spoke about how that varies and is affected by low interest rate regimes and a variety of difficulties that employers must consider. It was of interest to me that the previous speaker on the <inline ref="R1678">Workplace Relations Amendment (Award Simplification) Bill 2002</inline>, the member for Corio, said during his presentation that part of Labor's policy was to strengthen the role of the Industrial Relations Commission. In Labor's mind, considering the job opportunities that flow to union members from that activity, that may of course be seen as a good thing. It is an interesting aspect that I communicated to the commission on one occasion. They have immense powers, most of which can be imposed on employers relative to the people they currently employ. They have no power to tell an employer to create a new job. They certainly have no power to prevent an employer from purchasing machinery or taking decisions to export their business overseas or buying technology that would allow the employment of people in other parts of the world and would then deliver services or goods back to Australia.</para></talk.start><para>It is quite interesting, consequently, that I picked up today's <inline font-style="italic">Australian </inline>to discover under the headline `To India for the Wall St news' this opening remark:</para><quote><para>Could the âBangalore bureauâ become the cheap new extension of newsrooms in Australia and other English-speaking countries?</para></quote><para>It points out that Reuters have now employed six Indian journalists:</para><quote><para>... under a scheme which will begin work in Bangalore this month, using email and internet connections to cover financial information released by 3000 medium-sized companies in New York.</para></quote><para>In other words, the <inline font-style="italic">Wall Street Journal</inline> is now employing people in India to do work previously undertaken, presumably, in New York or other parts of the US. It is a very interesting matter to contemplate, because it strikes me that were part of the Australian media to operate out of India it just might be that those people, not having the sort of bias associated with their own vote back here in Australia, would analyse the various aspects of different debates and report accordingly.</para><para>Members of the media approached me this morning with the suggestion that somehow or other the Prime Minister had inveigled certain public officials in debate before the House. I pointed out of course that they were dragged into this debate by the Leader of the Opposition after his discussion on the Carlton show. They seemed to have missed that point completely. I point out that even a journalist who thinks it is a good idea to put roadblocks in the way has commented on this. I note the comments made by Barry Fitzpatrick of the National Union of Journalists: </para><quote><para>... any category of journalism that can be done on a phone and a computer ... could be outsourced to anywhere in the world ...</para></quote><para>The point that I make is that, when we have debates in this place relevant to putting roadblocks in the way of employment within Australia, we should look at the options available consequently in other parts of the world.</para><para>In the final five minutes of my speech, I want to provide some examples of how browned off individual workers have always been by the intervention of trade unionists in their own arrangements with employers. Trade unionists live off the members fees of the workers in their award categories. When I went to Carnarvon in 1958 to run a hotel, I might add that women were paid exactly the same wages in Western Australia at that period of timeâand, in fact, for some time after thatâas men for working behind the bar. So there was no sex discrimination in the hotel industry even back then as far as workers in that category were concerned.</para><para>When we arrived in Carnarvon, the award was for a 42-hour week, six days a week. As still applies today, you had rotating shifts so that the days off applicable occurred on different days. It was interesting that that town was 600 miles from Perth, with the sealed roads ceasing 300 miles north of Perth, and it was not very attractive for union officials to come up there seeking membership. In fact, they never bothered. On the other hand, our own association, the Australian Hotels Association, kept sending us changes to the award. Those changes got more and more complex and my wife, who had to do the payroll, found more and more of her time being taken up by working out someone's wage each week, because every week it was different.</para><para>That generated all sorts of dissatisfaction in the work force. They would say, `You've underpaid me, Mrs Tuckey,' and she would say, `No, that's right.' They would say, `But I got more money last week,' and she would say, `Yes, you worked Saturday last week or you worked the night shift last week and they are now paid at differential rates, notwithstanding that they're within your 42 hours.' They would never be convinced, so in frustration I called them all together one Sunday morning, having added up every cent of entitlement that they had: their holiday pay, their sick leaveâeverything. I divided it by the number of hours they worked and arrived at a flat hourly rate. I explained all this to them and asked, `How would you like to work on that flat hourly rate?' It was quite illegal, of course, to make that sort of offer to your workers. They said, `That much! Can I have that much?' I said, `Remember, you get no holiday pay later and, when you leave, you do not get anything other than your pay for that week.' They said: `Yes, but we're going to get this much money in our hand. That will do us.'</para><para>Then we came to the issue of rostering. They asked whether they had to work 42 hours and I told them that they could work 10, or they could work 60. They asked when they had to work and whether I was going to write the roster. I told them to write the roster, so away they went and they came back. And do you know what the interesting point was? All the married women with children, remembering that they were now on a flat rate of pay, took the weekend work and the night work, for pretty obvious reasonsâtheir spouse was home to look after the kids and they wanted the daytime to do a bit of shopping. The single girls were all happy to take the day shift so they could go out on the town at night-time. I had an absolutely happy work force. And I had phone calls from the bar workers in other hotels asking: `When can I work for you? You pay more money.' I said, `No, I don't; I just pay it every week.' Of course, the bitumen crept up to Carnarvon and the rent seekers turned up to see if they could get a couple of members and wanted to look at our books. I had to cease that arrangement. We went back to all the complexity and all the dissatisfaction. </para><para>I mentioned to the House the other day that I owned a trucking business. If I was interviewing a new truck driver and he asked how much I paid and I said that I paid the awardâthat wonderful invention of the trade union movementâhe would say: `Thanks, Mr Tuckey, but I won't be working for you. I want trip money. I want a flat payment to drive your truck down to Perth and back again and, what's more, you'll win me if you can give me a bit of the share of any backloading I can pick up on your behalf.' These guys did not need the help of someone who had just come out of university and done a course in industrial relations. They are pretty smart. They knew what they wanted: to turn their truck around and get that trip money as quickly as possible. They could see that there was a bit of a benefit.</para><para>The trade union movement is an aberrationâthe people there are Neanderthal. Workers do not want to pay $500 to them for a service they do not even want. Of course, they are frequently forced into it. They would rather have the $500 for their kids' books so they could read to them at night, as the Leader of the Opposition suggests. They do not think they need the union movement, and under the Howard government they have had an ever-increasing disposable income every year we have been in government whilst their own trade union movement has boasted of driving their buying power or their real wages down. This bill is about removing the roadblocks. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>27959</page.no><name role="metadata">Roxon, Nicola, MP</name><name role="display">Ms ROXON</name><name.id>83K</name.id><electorate>Gellibrand</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would also like to speak on the <inline ref="R1678">Workplace Relations Amendment (Award Simplification) Bill 2002</inline>, although I have a somewhat different view from the previous speaker. It will be of particular interest to the member since I had the misfortune of having to sit through his speech. He might actually be interested in some of the reasons why I am particularly concerned about it, including the removal of skill based career paths. I am going to take most of my time speaking about that issue, because there are significant issues of concern that I am sure many members on the other side of the House would also be worried about if they looked closely at what the introduction of skill based career paths into awards has meant to many industriesâthe benefits it has brought not just to employees but also, significantly, to employers and industry as a whole.</para></talk.start><para>I want to talk about my objection to the government's proposal to take out an additional number of matters from award coverage. Skill based career paths is just one, but the bill also seeks to remove protection for workers who are required to undertake jury service. I would like to spend a bit of time on that with my shadow Attorney-General's hat on and examine the possible consequences that that has for us, not just as an industrial matter, which is the context of this bill, but also for the administration of justice. I think that we need to look seriously at that as well.</para><para>I am also concerned that the government is proposing in this bill that notice of termination be removed from the award. In the current working environment where people are increasingly insecure about their employment, I find extraordinary the provision that deals with the way that employees should be notified of changesâtold that the businesses that they work for are about to be sold or that their employment is about to finish. </para><para>Let me go first to the issue that I am most concerned aboutâthat is, the proposal to remove skills based career paths from awards. Many people in this House have had involvement in industries that were covered by awards, either as union officials, as employees themselves or as business owners. One of the things that anybody who was involved 10 years ago and further back will tell you is that many awards did not have classification structures. The trades awards had classification structures because they needed to be linked to the particular training that tradespeople did, but the sorts of awards that covered the manufacturing industry and the hospitality industry, particularly those industries in which many women worked, really did not have any sorts of skills based classification structures.</para><para>Gradually over time, when these provisions were inserted into awards, a career path was suddenly identifiable within particular industries. Most importantly, having these skills based career paths in awards meant that there was a possibility to recognise skills, not just within a state but across the country, that were portable across industries, between businesses and across state borders. It also meant that training that matched those different skill levels was articulated so that you couldâon the job, through a TAFE course or through other areasâundertake training and have that identified and recognised at an appropriate level in the award. You were able to go to your next employer and say, `This is the level that I worked at; this is what I have been accredited to.' If you moved interstate with your family for some reason, you were able to turn up at a new workplace and say: `These are my skill levels. This is where I should have some recognition in the workplace. You can have confidence that, having worked at skill level 5 in a warehouse, I will be able to undertake the duties that you want someone at skill level 5 to be able to undertake in your warehouse.'</para><para>This was a major change within industry, and I think it is extraordinary for a government that says, in its other areas, that it is interested in training and skilling people but would seek to remove from awards the very provisions that actually encourage people to undertake training to have their skills formally recognised and to be able to go that step further and have skills that will add value to industry. It is not true to say that these matters can and should adequately be dealt with either at an enterprise level or elsewhere. The effectiveness of federal awards and of having skills based training paths in those awards is that it not restricts what people do in different workplaces but recognises the comparable skills that might be needed at different levels across an industry, recognises that we need to be able to train people to certain levels and recognises that people, in this day and age, when job security is not something that people can rely on for a lifetime, are able to move to different workplacesâeither for their own benefit or, if not at their own doing, for an employer's benefitâwhere there will actually be a recognised structure.</para><para>I am particularly concerned about the impact of this on women. There are many industries that are still dominated by women where the only training and classification structure has come through the growth of skills based career paths in awards. They may not necessarily have been working in industries where formal qualifications were required, like of course the predominance of women in teaching and nursing, but where there was a formal training structure for a long time. Look at the change it has made particularly in the manufacturing industries where women were often grouped in jobs where the skills they were undertaking have been recognised. </para><para>I want to talk particularly about an experience I had when I worked at the National Union of Workers. One of my responsibilities as an organiser was to organise the Uncle Toby's site at Wahgunyah in Victoria, up on the Murray. It is a huge manufacturing site in the food industry with 700 or 800 people employed there. When I was working there some eight or nine years ago the workplace had just started to properly introduce the skills based career paths that had recently been put into the award. It was creating a major issue within the workplace and there was major interest in it. It was primarily the business, to start with, that was very committed to the introduction of the structure. I became involved when these structures were being implemented and staff needed to be placed within the different classifications. They were going through and working out how to recognise which skills people had obtained on the job and should be accredited for, and therefore fit into the classification structure, and which staff needed to undertake other training. Having done the first cut at that business to find where people would fall in the structure, to everybody's horror the large number of women employed on the site fell into the first two levels of the skills based pay structure and classification structure and all the men were in the highest levels, because the first cut was based purely on income and the rates that people were being paid.</para><para>The skills based classification system delivered to Uncle Toby's and to their staff a complete rethink about why it was that the skills of the men who worked in a warehouse were valued to a particular level and the skills of the women who worked in quality control were not. What it identified, because this was a nationally accepted classification structure, was that many of the skills that the women were using on production lines, in quality control, in mixing and in all sorts of other parts of the manufacturing system had not been recognised. I am using Uncle Toby's as an example, but this would have been reflected across many industries and businesses in the country. They had not properly recognised the level of skill that was being exercised by many of their employees and they had overpaid or overrecognised some of the skills of employees working in other areas. The historical reasons were to do with not just which jobs men were working in and which jobs women were working in but training, which industries they had been covered by and which awards they had been covered by. It was the tool of the skills based career path and classification system being placed in the award which allowed Uncle Toby's and their employees to work through a process which truly recognised the skills that different people had within their workplace and to pay them according to those skills.</para><para>That process was one of the most satisfying things I have been involved with. That process saw the proper valuing of the skills of particularly some of the women who had worked at Uncle Toby's for 10, 15 or 20 years, who had been doing highly skilled tasks for all that time and who had been paid at the lowest level because no-one had actually sat down and assessed what they were doing and the skills that were requiredâthe training that would be required if the minister or I were suddenly invited to go and do this job and what we would need to learn to be able to do that job. It was only through the introduction of this skills based classification system that that process was ever undertaken.</para><para>It is a serious backwards step for us to say that we do not want to keep these sorts of provisions in awards. It allows for all sorts of inconsistencies to come back into the system, it allows for all sorts of assumptions about the work that men or women do being of different value and it leaves us tied to all sorts of inappropriate practices from the past. It does not help us move forward to a system that says that articulated, portable and nationally recognised skills are very important to the future of this country and the future, in particular, of high-skilled manufacturing industries in Australia. I use manufacturing as the example because that is the area that I have worked in. These skills based career paths apply across other industries and other awards but are of most importance in areas where there is not some sort of training structure that has been in place for a long time, such as apprenticeships or other sorts of qualifications needed for nursing and teaching. </para><para>I have the strongest view that to take these provisions out will disadvantage people who are highly skilled or will prevent and slow the encouragement of people who do not have high skills but can see a way to work through a career path in their award structure. If these provisions are removed from the award, it will be a disincentive for people to do proper training, further their skills and become better employees for their businesses. That cannot possibly be good for this country.</para><para>Let me speak briefly about the jury service provisions in awards that this bill would remove by seeking to prevent jury service from being an allowable matter in an award. These provisions ordinarily allow or require an employer to pay any gap between what an individual employee is paid if they are on jury service through the court system and their ordinary wage. Everybody in this place knows that if you are called up for jury service it is part of your civic obligation to go. A jury system cannot function in this country if people are not required to turn up to court when they are asked to do jury service. The very basics of wanting a jury to be representative of the community are that people across all sections of the community should be able to go.</para><para>Removing jury service from awards will ensure that working-class people who rely on awards to set out their conditions will find it harder to participate as a juror without suffering financial disadvantage. That is not something that we as a parliament should be encouraging. It is very narrow-minded of the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations to see this as only a workplace relations issue and to say: `What are the extra things we can get out of awards? We don't need to have all these provisions that might be there for some other social purpose.' But that has been the main tool by which we have ensured that a large chunk of the working population in Australia has been able to participate on juries without suffering financial disadvantage.</para><para>Suggesting that we should rely on the goodwill of each employer to negotiate some sort of provision for this situation or that the individual employee themselves should bear the burden of the cost is not realistic. I can bet my bottom dollarâand the minister knows thisâthat anybody who is going to significantly lose money as a result of not being paid their normal wage to be on jury service will find a way to ensure that they cannot participate. There are exclusions that are allowed when you get sent your jury service notice. I can absolutely bet my bottom dollar that, if people are going to seriously lose out financially, more and more people will find ways not to undertake their jury service, and that has a serious consequence for us.</para><para>We do not want to be in a position where the vast working population of this country sees it as a major disadvantage if they happen to get a notice for jury service. We want people to say: `My turn has come up. This is my civic obligation. I know that it might be a pain for one reason or another, but I will try to fit in with it.' And the employer bears some of that inconvenience as well. Otherwise, we will have to hand away our jury system altogether, because we simply will not have people who are able or prepared to go and sit in the courts to undertake that important duty in the administration of justice. </para><para>They are the two issues that I have severe concerns about if this bill is introduced. Unfortunately, much of the debate so far has been a simple union-bashing, government-bashing session. The issues that are covered in this bill are far too important for us to look only at that. It will have serious consequences if we refuse to allow these matters to be dealt with by an industrial relations commission and to be put into an award. There are obvious important reasons that go beyond the operation of the Workplace Relations Act to our desire to train people in the community, to encourage and assist people to go onto jury service and to give them some sense of security that if their employment is terminated they might have decent notice provisions that will ensure that they get some notification ahead of time of what is about to happen. I condemn the government's decision to try to introduce these provisions again. I hope that the arguments that have been raised will persuade the minister to desist with this course of action and to leave those provisions as allowable award matters in the workplace relations legislation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>27963</page.no><name role="metadata">Hatton, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HATTON</name><name.id>LN6</name.id><electorate>Blaxland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn following the member for Gellibrand in this debate on the <inline ref="R1678">Workplace Relations Amendment (Award Simplification) Bill 2002</inline>, I am also following a number of Labor speakers who have pointed out that this bill is one of a series of bills that the government has put into place that have been knocked back time and time again because of the inadequacy of what the government is proposing and because of the compounding effects of what would be achieved not just in this bill but in all of the other 11 associated bills that are the childrenâor grandchildren now, I supposeâof the 1996 More Jobs, Better Pay bill. </para></talk.start><para>Mr Reith, who was then the member for Flinders and the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Small Business, got the point when the Senate knocked back the original 1996 bill, which was effectively an omnibus bill covering this and 11 other related bills. He was not going to get these matters through, but these were matters that were a core part of the agenda that the government hoped to achieve. So he decided to break them up and to feed these bills one by one into the House and the Senate. In introducing the <inline ref="R1104">Workplace Relations Amendment (Tallies and Picnic Days) Bill 2000</inline> he said, in part, that the government introduced the bill on the premise that the Senate, particularly the Australian Democrats, might more favourably consider revisions of More Jobs, Better Pay should its 18 schedules be reintroduced as separate bills and, as he put it at the time, in bite-sized chunks. I have to say that, although the chunks are more bite size, they are just as inedible now as they were in 2000 when that bill was first put and just as inedible as they were when the elements of this bill and others were first proposed by the government in 1996. </para><para>At the core of this amendment on award simplification is a reduction in the parameters for the Industrial Relations Commission, for unions and for employees in being able to access the time-honoured and well-used provision of the commission and the award system. When Labor was in government we moved from a totally award centred basis to enterprise bargaining, but we attempted to achieve a balance between the two. We wanted to protect what was good about the award system, not only to have it as a fundamental safety net but also to ensure that those things that had taken more than 100 years to achieve would not be stripped away by the process of enterprise bargaining and to ensure that if certain provisions were given up by employees, in consultation with unions and other employees, there would be a quid pro quo in that they would be able to either win greater pay or gain consideration in other areas and that the conditions of work would be modernised, given that the industry may well have changed. But we were saying that it should still be done within a framework of people being allowed to be represented in the workplace and, if they chose, to seek to get their matters addressed not in the enterprise bargaining rounds but by having them sorted out directly by the commission.  </para><para>With a series of bills the whole placement of the Industrial Relations Commission has been attackedâand no more directly attacked than through the provisions of this bill, laughingly subtitled the `Award simplification bill'. As I have noted previously, and as the shadow minister has noted, an Orwellian approach has been taken to all 12 of these bills. Although the bill is called the award simplification bill, we know that its intent is not what people would normally thinkâto tidy up and clarify what is happening, to make it easier to assess what is going on and to make it easier for people to see where they standâbut really about award stripping, not award simplification. </para><para>In the legislation the government were able to get through in the first wave of amendments in 1996, the number of matters that the Industrial Relations Commission and the parties to the commissionâthe unions acting on behalf of their members and employersâwere able to talk about in the commission was drastically reduced to 20 matters. This bill seeks to take the 20, compress it to at least 17, and then take most of the rest of the list and say, `Even though you can look at it, we are actually going to restrict what the commission and the parties to the commission are able to talk about, what they can come to an agreement about.' In part, what drove the original More Jobs, Better Pay bill and what drives each of its constituent elementsâthe children or grandchildren of that original billâis the move to fundamentally change the relationship between those people who are employed and those who employ them, to effectively give greater power to employers and to put employees in a position where they will have less access to award provisions than they previously had. </para><para>This bill is a move to try to force people away from the Industrial Relations Commission and the award system, to force them not just into enterprise bargaining but into the preferred mode of certified workplace agree-ments where it is just a one-on-one situation and where the whole of the work force is atomised and left without recourse to effective defence. The relationship between the power of an employer and the power of an employee is completely unequal. The government know that and they seek to increase the power of the employer at the expense of the employees. They know that employees are in a much more difficult situation now than they were previously. The whole work force has been so heavily casualised: more than 2.2 million people in this economy are casual workers. As a result of the Senate committee inquiry into poverty, we know that something like 3.6 million people are earning less than $400 a week. We know that there is an increased tenuousness in the link between those people and the work they would want to do to get permanency in the work force.</para><para>One of the provisions that previous speakers have alluded to is the whole question of people moving from casual employment to permanent employment. The Industrial Relations Commission has been adopting a process to put provisions into awardsâbecause the unions have argued for thisâto say that, where a person is a long-term casual employee of a company, there should be some skill path progression and provision to allow them to move from casual to permanent status. Most employers who have their heads screwed onâand that would be most employersâwould see the benefit of allowing that for people they have invested time and money in, who they have helped to train and who have become a vital part of their company, and they would see that that path should be there. If the employer does not want it to happen, it will not happen. This is a provision that the Industrial Relations Commission is putting into awards because there is an agreement between the employers and the unions who say that this would be of benefit to the company and the employees. </para><para>The very sort of thing that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission is so good at is being an interlocutor between two otherwise warring parties or two parties that otherwise could be at vast disagreement. It provides the ability for people to go to an independent umpire and referee to have the matters either conciliated or arbitrated. We have had more than 100 years of extremely effective use of the Industrial Relations Commissionâformerly the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. With this bill the government basically wants to strip it down, not just in terms of the number of allowable matters before it and not just with a restriction on the matters that it can look at, but if it could it would shatter the whole thing to pieces. So we would have not only a fragmented work force but an entirely fragmented Industrial Relations Commission, and it would do away with it altogether.</para><para>The government wants a simple relationship of master and servant; it wants a simple relationship for those who are already in a protected positionâthe employersâso that they would have their power increased. It would mean not having to bother with going through the Industrial Relations Commission but trying to do it one on one, and forcing certified agreements as the only way that people can really interact. With this bill, the government is seeking to cut out a whole range of possibilities that are there for people to access a common approach to matters that companies have before them.</para><para>The specific provisions that this bill would exclude are: skills based career pathsâto which I have alludedâthe question of bonuses, long service leave, notice of termination and jury service. This bill is saying: `We want to delete all those things. We don't want the Industrial Relations Commission to consider those at all. We don't want those to be written into awards or parts of awards. This is something that should be negotiated, face to face, between employer and employee, either through the bargaining process or wrapped up in certified agreements.'</para><para>The question of jury service is a pretty fundamental issue and it is a bit hard for the judicial systemâbeing entirely separate, as it is in our system, from the legislative and the executive servicesâto convince people to give up their daily work to come and sit in a court room for two or three days, or two or three months, or a year, in terms of long court cases, and demand that they exercise the duties and responsibilities that are imposed on them as Australian citizens, when they are not sure of what the impact of that is going to be.</para><para>We surely do not expect that from people who are forced to do jury serviceâand that is part of the way our system operates, because the jury system is fundamental to the Westminster system, the British way of law making and to our court system, derived as it is from the British systemâwhen people cannot be sure that their job will be there. They will have to make a deal with their employer that, if they are forced to go for three days, three weeks, three months or a year, they will have a job to go back to or that they will be adequately compensated whilst they are doing jury service. I think you would find that very few people would willingly stick their hands up to say that they should be out of their normal activity to do this. The lack of certainty that is introduced by this bill for everyone in the work force in a position to be affected by this is extremely great. </para><para>The first key question of skill based career paths, which I have only partly alluded to, is extremely important. Putting this up to the hazard of dealing with the particular provisions employers have from state to state or from company to company is at one with the problem that we have in terms of the skilling of our work force Australia wide. This government certainly takes a great deal of notice of the Productivity Commission, which has said, throughout the 1990sâand the latter part of the 1990s dominated four years of this governmentâthat there has been an effective deskilling of the Australian work force as casualisation of workers has increased, the skill levels of people have decreased, the provision for people to cross over from casual work to full-time employment has decreased and the provision for at work training has relatively decreased. As a direct result of that, productivity in Australia fell throughout the late nineties. If you take the whole period of the nineties, but particularly the latter part of the nineties, those skill levels have directly fallen.</para><para>I recognise that the government wants to drive towards ensuring that trend will increase. If you take the whole question out of issueâthat is, people being able to move on skill based career pathsâand do not allow skill based career paths to be dealt with by the AIRC and in award provisions, you are going to make sure that our training provision is desperately bad. Just the other day, I was speaking to one of the instructors from my electorate who works at Bankstown TAFE with kids who are at risk because they have left school early and got out of that training. He is running a very successful program to bring them into the work force, and a number of the people he has helped to train have in fact gone on to trades and very effective employment.</para><para>I was also speaking with a number of other people from the TAFE system. One of the core things that we were discussing was this very issue: Australia's declining skill base and the fact that the system has not properly allowed for the renewal of our tradespeople. If proper training is written into awards, if skilling is written into award agreements, if there is a provision for people to have time at work for training or to do job related training as part of their award, you can be fairly sure that you will get a better and more regulated system than you will by just throwing it out, willy-nilly, to what is thrown up in various enterprise agreements or certified workplace agreements.</para><para>What we face is very stark and very simple: this is a crisis in people's skill levels in the trades. The average age of people in trades in Australia is about 53. That is pretty close to what I amâand that is about the average age. These people see a dearth of people below them to take their places. The baby boomers are the dominant group within trades in Australia, but the people who have been trained are very few in number. They cannot replace those who are already there, and the effective deskilling that has taken place in Australia means that our immigration system has to draw on people from Korea, China and other countries where they still actually do trade trainingâwhere people have a series of skills that Australia lacks. In part, that is because there has not been a willingness to write these things back into the award process. </para><para>Through this bill, the government seeks to ensure that the low skill base already there will be further lowered. That does not surprise me, because the Prime Minister, the member for Bennelong, has always been driven by an image of Australia having to compete with Thailand and what were other low-wage countries by effectively trying to reduce Australia's capacity in that area, to try and compete with low-wage rather than high-wage countries. Rather than increasing skill levels, he takes the easy way out and says: `Just let the employers do whatever they want to do. They can get people in from overseas if they need to.' That is what has been happening throughout the nineties and from 2000 to 2004. It is happening now. You can see it around building sites in Canberra: local skilled people just are not there.</para><para>The casualisation of the work force, getting rid of the major training bodies that our major institutions have had and trying to take away power over these matters from the Australian Industrial Relations Commission are part of a great web that the government have. Their design is to recast industrial relations, effectively to get us back to the master-servant relationship, the one-on-one thingâthe unequal situation with one individual and an employer.</para><para>I do not think that is a very smart thing to do. I think that we would be far better to sayâas Labor willâthat this so-called award simplification bill is not on. We have said it before; we will say it again: we are going to vote against it. The reason we are going to vote against it is that it does not seek to make changes in order to better the system; it effectively seeks to nobble the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, to keep the unions out, to keep representation for employees out of the system altogether. It seeks to drive people to certified agreements and to create a situation of powerlessness for workers. It seeks to strip away not just the matters that the commission can deal with but all of those protections between employer and employee that this government does not want. Those protections are still there to allow a greater equality of treatment for employees because you have the mediation of the AIRC. I condemn this bill. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>27967</page.no><name role="metadata">Mossfield, Frank, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MOSSFIELD</name><name.id>MK6</name.id><electorate>Greenway</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1678">Workplace Relations Amendment (Award Simplification) Bill 2002.</inline> I am very pleased to be following the member for Blaxland, who clearly has a good grasp of the issues involved in this bill. Some of the things that I will be saying will probably cover points that he has made. The purpose of the bill is to reduce the number of allowable matters in federal awards from 20 to 16 and to provide for a 12-month review of awards, during which they will be expected to be amended to comply with the bill. This continues the Howard government's policy of reducing federal award protection for Australian workers.</para></talk.start><para>The government's first wave of industrial relations legislation, passed by the Senate in 1996, reduced the number of matters that could be covered in federal awards from an unlimited number to just 20 allowable matters. This bill will remove the following matters from federal awards: skill based career paths, bonuses, long service leave, notice of termination and jury service. In addition, some allowable matters will be further restricted. The government says in its explanatory memorandum to this bill that the matters to be taken out of the award `are more appropriately dealt with at the enterprise or workplace level'. But, at the same time, the government tries to reduce the influence of trade union officials at the workplace by restricting their rights of entry, so preventing them from advising their members on the correct procedures for workplace negotiations to obtain a favourable outcome. </para><para>This push by the government to reduce award coverage and force issues to be dealt with at the enterprise level may be counterproductive from an employer point of viewâand I am wondering just what employer input there was into the framing of this legislation. I believe that employers may well prefer that as many issues as possible are dealt with at the national level and do not become a catalyst for enterprise misunderstanding and dispute. Another issue that could be counterproductive to employers would be the removal of the skill based career paths from awards.</para><para>Just to cover the first point about the removal of items from federal awards, in major industries it is recognised that, if you can negotiate issues at a federal level, that certainly reduces the possibility of misunderstandings and problems at the workshop level. Once agreement is reached, it is carried out by all parties, both the employers and the trade unions. The issue of skill based career paths is also worrying me. Quite frankly, a lot of good work is achieved through award negotiations in encouraging employees to improve their skills. From my experience as a trade union official, this type of negotiation was very productive. There was a common interest. There was not the conflict that might arise when you argue about individual work entitlements, so there was a common purpose. To some extent, I believe it was a bonding issue between employers and employees. It has to be said that, on that issue, both parties put a lot of resources into skill formation. Both the trade union movement and employers used some of their top people to negotiate a suitable arrangement. I do not believe that, if this item is taken out of awards, either the unions or the employers will be able to put the same resources into individual workplaces that they would if they were doing it a national level. As I have indicated, I believe that is rather counterproductive. I do not think it will improve the productivity that one hopes the government is trying to achieve through these changes.</para><para>The key source of productivity growth is skill development. The Howard government, by its failure to invest properly in skill formation, is jeopardising Australia's productivity growth and prosperity. As the previous speaker indicated, the Productivity Commission has found that skill formation slowed during the 1990s, making no significant contribution to productivity growth. By its policies, the Howard government is consigning Australia to being a low-skill, low-wage society, competing on wage costs against countries of East Asia. The Labor senators in their report to the Senate inquiry on a similar provision in the 1999 second wave legislation said:</para><quote><para>4.63. The proposal to remove training and skill-based career paths from awards indicates that the government has not properly considered its amendments to allowable matters, or is simply motivated by an unreasonable ideological desire to downgrade the commission and its award. As witness after witness pointed out during this inquiry, it would be insane to remove training provisions from awards. It is not in the interests of the Australian community or the economy.</para></quote><para>I would certainly endorse those remarks. The other comment by the Labor senators on this issue was:</para><quote><para>4.64. The amendment would send the wrong signal to employers and employees about the importance of training and skill formations. Many employers and employees have spent a great deal of time establishing industry-wide training frameworks.</para></quote><para>I am quoting the Labor senators' comments, but this is also my view from my own personal experience. They said: </para><quote><para>If these industry-based structures were removed, many employers may not have the time, resources or inclinations to renegotiate training and career path structures for their own workplaces.</para></quote><para>It is rather coincidental that only yesterday some TAFE teachers visited a number of members in this place. They expressed to us their concern about the numbers of people who are being trained in industry. As the member for Blaxland has indicated, and this is what the TAFE teachers expressed to me, there is now a shortage of skill based metal tradesmenâboilermakers and fitters and turners. Being an ex-fitter and turner myself, I suppose a lot of these people would be about my age now and are looking forward to retirement. We are not training apprentices; they are not coming through. I am wondering if the removal of the skill based career path from the award will further retard the number of apprentices who are being trained. There is evidence that there is a shortage of metal tradesmen now. There is also evidence that employers are bringing welders from overseas. This should not be necessary, because we do have young people who I am sure would be very happy to be trained in the boilermaker and welding trades.</para><para>The TAFE teachers raised another issue with me, and I think I have a responsibility to raise it here. In the document they presented to us, they said:</para><quote><para>Students are increasingly asked to pay higher fees. In NSW fees had been introduced, and the cost to students is up to 227% greater than the previous administration charge ... Governments are shifting the cost of vocational education and training to students, many of whom can't afford to pay. TAFE is about a second chance education for many, who do not have high incomes. Part time programs are being reduced as students won't pay the high fees for a couple of hours a week.</para><para>Students are increasingly being asked to also pay for the materials they use, whether they keep the products or not. This often involves printing and photocopying costs for assessments, not just class notes.</para><para>Increased numbers of courses are only offered at a full commercial rate. This is true of shorter, statement of attainment courses (those required by the industry) and higher level courses. Not only does this lock many students out, but it also means that students will take lower level courses which are charged less. This can also restrict the variety of options available or affordable, meaning that multi-skilling may be restricted. Again industry and the economy suffer.</para></quote><para>It could well be that, in the case of TAFE students, employers may assist with the paying of fees, but I certainly object to any increase in fees that is going to place a burden on low-income families. Hopefully, this is an issue that the state governments will take up and hopefully it will also be supported by the federal government. In considering this bill, we need to look at the important issues that are facing the Australian work force. Is award stripping one? I do not think that is a major issue. We now have a change in culture. We are seeing full-time employment hard to find and an increased work force of unsecured and casual workers.</para><para>I know that some people might argue that casual employment is good, just as the Treasurer said that the drought is good for farmers. It is in the same category to say that casual work is good for workers. There obviously are some industries that do require casual employment but, at the same time, I do not think that is in the interests of the workers. Even workers who work in those industries would prefer full-time employment. They do not want to be sitting around waiting for a phone call.</para><para>I heard Greg Combet, the very respected and responsible secretary of the ACTU, on the radio in relation to a recent court case. His comments then were that there were 400,000 Australian workers with more than five years of employment with individual companies who are still casual and still not getting their entitlements as full-time employees. In an article that Greg Combet wrote in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian </inline>on Monday, 9 June last year, he said: </para><quote><para>A few statistics tell the story: 90 per cent of the new jobs created during the 1990s paid less than $26,000 a year. Half paid less than $15,600 a year. And low paid work is not confined to students or young peopleâ70 per cent of low wage workers are aged 25 to 54. One million people earn less than $15 an hour before tax. In many lower-income occupations, full-time jobs have shrunk to part-time positions.</para><para>Under-employment means less money for day-to-day essentials, let alone the cost of maintaining a family.</para><para>Many of these workers are also likely to be casuals, who now account for 27 per cent of the workforceâa growing proportion of employees without basic entitlements ... sick leave, holidays or redundancy pay. Half of casuals have worked in the same job for more than a year but still have no job security.</para></quote><para>I think that highlights some of the major issues facing the Australian work force. I think that the government's time would be better spent trying to overcome those issues rather than stripping back conditions in awards. </para><para>An article by John Quiggin in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline><inline font-style="italic"></inline>this month, headed `Older workers forced out', said:</para><quote><para>These days, large-scale retrenchment of workers is commonplace and takes little account of years of service. At the same time, the workforce is increasingly polarised into a shrinking core of full-time workers expected to put in 50 to 60 hours a week, and a growing peripheral groupâ</para></quote><para>whom I think we could call non-core workersâ</para><quote><para>in insecure and casual employment. The decline in employment security is sometimes questioned on the basis of statistics showing that average job tenure has not changed much. But these statistics take no account of hundreds of thousands of older workers who have left the labour force permanently.</para></quote><para>These are the real issues that I believe are now facing people who work in industry. The article highlights the points that I and other speakers on the opposition side have been making. The article draws attention to the burnout rate amongst core workers. It says:</para><quote><para>Structural change has proved very effective in getting more and more work out of fewer and fewer people, but it has a long-term cost. Although workers of all ages are affected by restructuring and redundancy, older workers are less well placed to start afresh and more likely end up in the peripheral workforce if they regain work at all. In these circumstances, the option of a pension or benefit is increasingly the best way out. Even among the shrinking group of winners in the game, the pressures on the core workforce are producing cases of burnout in growing numbers.</para></quote><para>We are now heading into a culture where we have core workers, who are working a lot longer and harder than they ever have before, and non-core workers, who are the casual workers. Unfortunately, as I have been saying, the non-core workersâthe people on casual employmentâare not the students. They are, in many cases, the people who should be in the prime of their work lifeâthose in the 35 to 55 or older age group who should be earning maximum finances so that they can pay for the education of their children and for their mortgages.</para><para>The article has a suggestion for what may be the way to goâit is what I would call a sensible solution. I hope I am not wasting members' time by suggesting sensible solutions, but this is something that has come up and I think it would be worth while if the government took it into consideration. The article states:</para><quote><para>A sensible allocation of work effort over the life cycle would involve working well past the age of 55 for most workers. But it would also involve shorter hours of full-time work, particularly for prime-aged workers (roughly those from 30 to 50) who are also, in most cases, those with the heaviest burden of family responsibilities. Over the past decade or so, an increased amount of total labour effort has been crammed into a shorter and shorter segment of our adult lives. </para></quote><para>Another article that I would like to refer to in the context of this debate, and in suggesting to the government that there are more important issues affecting the Australian work force than simply award stripping, is one from the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline><inline font-style="italic"></inline>on Saturday, 28 February by Paul Robinson, headed `Warning: work is not a grey area'. It says:</para><quote><para>More controversially, COTA chief executive David Deans wants governments to make companies more accountable when they shed staff. `Take Telstra. They keep shedding jobs by the thousands,' he says. `Why shouldn't they be required to submit a demographic profile of the people they propose to make redundant?'</para><para>Deans says jobs are still needed for older workers; Australia's workplace participation rate for people in the 45 to 55 age group is one of the lowest in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. `And the rate for 55 to 65-year-olds, I think, is the lowest.'</para></quote><para>Those figures are worth reflecting on. We talk about full-time employment, but is it really full-time employment? We get figures, but do they really add up to what is happening out there in the real work force? To say that the participation rate for people in the 45 to 55 age group is one of the lowest in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and that the rate for 55- to 65-year-olds is the lowest is quite a serious issue that, once again, the government should be taking note of rather than the issue that they are pursuing at the moment, which is award stripping.</para><para>I will make my final point on casualisation. However effective and suitable it might be for some industries, it is certainly not to the benefit of the people working in the industry. There may be some people who find it suitableâmaybe they have got other jobs and that is the way they make ends meet, with two, three or four casual jobs. But that is certainly not the way that we should be treating the Australian work force. It may well be that the government is saying, `We've got to keep people in the work force until they drop, so maybe we will create more casual jobs and then they can take up those jobs.' But please do not forget the young people coming throughâthe young families who require full-time employment. That is the issue we should be looking at. Labor is opposing this bill and we are suggesting that there are more important labour market reforms to address than simply award stripping.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>27971</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Byrne, Michelle, MP</name><name role="display">Ms O'BYRNE</name><name.id>84S</name.id><electorate>Bass</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âHere we are again, debating another one of the lasting legacies of the former Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, andâsurprise, surprise!âthe anti-union rhetoric and the antiworker obsession continue. The government's fustilarian engagement in industrial reform still has no benefit for those who actually rely on an award structure to ensure they are justly remunerated for their work.</para></talk.start><para>It is for these reasons that we once again have a piece of legislation before the House that the government has cobbled together for the sole purpose of destabilising unions and cutting the livelihoods of Australian workers. This bill seeks to demolish the safety net of employment conditions that has been built up over the last 100 years. Labor will not support this bill, because in its essence it is unfair and totally unjust.</para><para>The Australian industrial relations system is made up of industry or occupational awards. These awards, since Justice Higgins's decision in the very famous Harvester case, have provided minimum wages and have over years developed comprehensive minimum conditions. This has ensured that there is a safe and equitable standard for workers. It has not prevented employers from offering better than award conditions, but it has ensured that there are fair and equitable standards for all workers. </para><para>This bill seeks to reduce matters that can be included in awards from the current 20 matters to 16 and also seeks to put further limitations on the remaining 16. The matters it is seeking to remove from federal awards are: skill based career paths; long service leave; bonuses; notice of termination; and jury service. Of the remaining 16 matters, the bill is seeking to put limitations on: training or education; the rights of unions to take part in industrial settlement procedures; transfers from one type of employment to another; allowances; cultural leave; and public holidays, as well as narrowing the scope for awards to contain matters that are incidental to specific allowable matters. This is what we have: a government that talks big about choice so long as that choice is not extended to Australian employees and the choice of matters that can be covered in their industrial awards. Not content with reducing the number of matters that could be included in awards to just 20 back in 1996, the government tried in its failed second wave of industrial relations changes in 1999 to further reduce the number of allowable matters. Very sensiblyâand I know we do not often give them praiseâthe other place rejected that legislation in its entirety.</para><para>The proposals in this bill are unfair and unjust, because these provisions would only serve to destroy the award safety net, which provides protection for workers and is a significant mechanism of industrial social justice. In fact, if this bill is passed we will no doubt see even more appalling situations like the one we saw this week where a clothing store required its employees to wear tight, provocative T-shirts as a condition of their employmentâthe slogan was `Stop pretending you don't want me'. That is the sort of T-shirt that we are asking young women to wear in their workplaces. We cannot pretend that we want this Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations but unfortunately we are stuck with him. </para><para>Very thankfully, one young woman had the courage to speak out against this condition. But only five years ago there was a provision in her award that stated that employers could not require employees to wear revealing or indecent clothing. That has gone. Under the Howard government's antiworker, anti-union stripping away of awards, this provision was removed, leaving many young people vulnerable to this type of exploitation. This House should not allow that sort of thing to go on and we should not condone it. This bill will only create an industrial environment that makes exploitation like we have seen this week more common and much, much harder to fight. Young people should not have to feel embarrassed or demoralised when they go to work. They should be able to go to work, do their job and receive praise for doing their job, not for wearing revealing T-shirts. </para><para>This bill would also take away the assurance that conditions of employment cannot fall below a decent level and that there is an acceptable community standard available to protect all employees. It would undermine the whole system and weaken the role of the Industrial Relations Commission by taking away minimum award standards through legislation rather than giving the parties the opportunity to explain their respective cases before the commissionâexplain your case and get judged on your merit. </para><para>But, of course, this is the government's agenda: to essentially take away as much power from the Industrial Relations Commission as it possibly can. Australian workers, quite rightly, expect a guarantee that they will be protected by a minimum wage and a minimum standard of working conditions. These conditions cannot be compromised on the basis of the federal government's industrial relations agenda. This bill, along with every other industrial relations bill currently being debated, is part of the government's fight to wipe out unions, which is a fight that the government has been inching towards for some time now. This week they might set their targets on the CFMEU or maybe the MUA, and next week it will be the AMWU, and the week after thatâwho knows? Who is next on the government's hit list?</para><para>Basic workers' rights and minimum industrial awards are not radical ideasâthey are not frightening; they are not a scary, radical thing. In fact, the minister is probably already awareâbut, if not, he might be interested to knowâthat not even the Vatican, an organisation I think he has some interest in, would agree with the workplace reforms being put forward by this government. The Vatican has endorsed the rights of workers and the need for trade unions since as far back as 1891 when the treatise of Pope Leo XIIIâ<inline font-style="italic">Rerum novarum: encyclical letter on capital and labor</inline>âwas delivered. This treatise stated that methods such as the right of workers and unions to strike were recognised by the Catholic social teaching as legitimate actions under proper working conditions.</para><para>In 1891 the Vatican was ensuring workers had proper working conditions, which included a minimum workplace standard. Surely the Australian government today has no right to take these standards away. But the Vatican's teachings do not stop there. The Vatican II document <inline font-style="italic">The church in the modern world</inline> says:</para><quote><para>In economic enterprises it is persons who are joined together, that is, free and independent human beings created to the image of God. Therefore, with attention to the functions of eachâowners or employers, management or laborâand without doing harm to the necessary unity of management, the active sharing of all in the administration and profits of these enterprises in ways to be properly determined is to be promoted. Since more often, however, decisions concerning economic and social conditions, on which the future lot of the workers and of their children depends, are made not within the business itself but by institutions on a higher level, the workers themselves should have a share also in determining these conditionsâin person or through freely elected delegates.</para><para>Among the basic rights of the human person is to be numbered the right of freely founding unions for working people. These should be able truly to represent them and to contribute to the organizing of economic life in the right way. Included is the right of freely taking part in the activity of these unions without risk of reprisal. Through this orderly participation joined to progressive economic and social formation, all will grow day by day in the awareness of their own function and responsibility, and thus they will be brought to feel that they are comrades in the whole task of economic development and in the attainment of the universal common good according to their capacities and aptitudes.</para></quote><para>Workers should have the right to union representation in award negotiations. Workers should have the right to expect fair workplace conditions, and they should expect that they can demand these conditions without the fear of losing their jobs.</para><para>This bill will do nothing but continue to create an environment where some very basic workers' rights that Australian workers have enjoyed for some time are taken away. It creates a very uneven industrial playing field and an uneven competitive environment. I do not think there is working person in this country, whether they are the head of an organisation or a cleaner, that wants to see this type of industrial environment. </para><para>Labor will not stand by and allow this government to create a situation where working Australians are expected to accept working conditions that have no place in Australia today. Labor will not stand by and allow the government to effectively deskill the Australian work force and reduce their bargaining power. Of course, the proposals in the bill are not particularly new. We have seen them time and time again. This bill is just one of the government's dirty dozen bills which are designed to keep vulnerable working Australians in the race to the bottom of low skills and low wages. </para><para>So it seems the choice that the government wants to implement is either the Liberal Party choice, that being the low road to low skills and low wages, or the Labor choice, that being the high road to high skills and high wages. So it seems there really is not any choice. There is no real scope for choice in this bill. It does not uphold the rights of workers or ensure that workers are able to expect a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. The fact the government is willing to push this agenda shows again just how Machiavellian and really out of touch it is. Rather than being up-front about its agenda to undermine unions, it allows provisions such as these to be introduced to the detriment of working Australiansâjust to destabilise and deunionise workplaces. This bill is not about choice; it is about tearing away at the safety net protecting the working conditions of Australian workers.</para><para>The government cannot continue to get away with ideologically driven union bashing to the detriment of Australians. If this bill is passed, the workers of Australia will have no guarantee of appropriate employment conditions. They will have no guarantee of accessing effective representation through their unions because this government will continue its attempt to destroy them in its effort to create its dream of a free marketâa free market where any sort of award and employment is acceptable as long as businesses are able to keep paying increasing taxes to support the government's obsession with its ever-increasing budget surplus. It is a surplus that is growing at the expense of public services and infrastructure, a surplus that is growing at the expense of the provision of a decent standard of living for Australians, despite how much money they earn.</para><para>The plight of the 17 workers who were locked out of the Blue Ribbon meatworks in Launceston has been well documented in this HouseâI have raised it many times. The Tasmanian Industrial Commission ordered that the workers were to have their employment arrangements that existed prior to 2 April 2003, the day they were locked out, reinstated. The commission also ordered that the workers receive back pay for the amount of wages they would have received from that date. The commission found that there was no valid reason for the termination of the workers' employment and that the termination was procedurally unfair. It found the conditions of the employment agreement, which the workers refused to sign, were a contrivance to avoid award obligations and industrial consequences.</para><para>The employers appealed this decision, but the decision of the Tasmanian Industrial Commission has been held up as a victory for the workers in the last two days. These workers were locked out of their workplace for two days short of an entire year for no good reason. Mr Deputy Speaker, do you want to know what the reason was? The reason these workers were locked out is that they had an expectation that they could be employed under award conditions. They had an expectation that they could continue to do a job under award conditions that they had been doing for years and years in some cases. The decision is a victory for the 17 Blue Ribbon workers, but it is also a victory for the right of all Australian workers to be treated fairly and with respect in relation to their employment conditions, contrary to the actions of this government, contrary to the intent of this bill and contrary to the draconian way that this government approaches unions, workplace relations and workers. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>27975</page.no><name role="metadata">Organ, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ORGAN</name><name.id>BNL</name.id><electorate>Cunningham</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe <inline ref="R1678">Workplace Relations Amendment (Award Simplification) Bill 2002</inline> represents yet another attack on the working people of this country and seeks to erode even further their hard-won rights and conditions. Additionally, it will result in a deskilling of our work force. The purpose of the bill is to reduce the number of allowable matters in federal awards. It also provides for a 12-month review of awards, during which time they are expected to be amended so that they comply with the terms of this bill.</para></talk.start><para>Federal awards prescribe employment conditions such as wages, classifications, annual leave, sick leave and other entitlements or obligations. The scope of the provisions which the federal awards may address is governed by the Workplace Relations Act 1996. The act provides some scope for the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to develop principles on award simplification, but this bill prescribes as non-allowable certain award matters previously sanctioned by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The rationale is supposedly to encourage award matters to be negotiated in enterprise agreements in the workplace.</para><para>The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations stated as much in his second reading speech for this bill and argued that Australia's workplace relations system needs progressive, evolutionary change. Presumably the minister is suggesting that the current federal government has delivered just that. I find the use of the word `progressive' problematic in this contextâit is more like regressive. We have before us a bill which further strips workers' rights, entitlements and protections via federal awards. And why are the government further amending the Workplace Relations Act? It is because consistently they have shown themselves willing to go into bat for bosses against the best interests of workers of this country. This should be a government for all Australiansâwhich they are notâand not just for those with vested interests. The minister in his second reading speech told us:</para><quote><para>Reforms since 1996 have resulted in fewer strikes, lower inflation, higher productivity and lower interest rates. This government has helped Australian families improve their living standards with more choice and more disposable income.</para></quote><para>These are fascinating claimsâbut they are spin. In this bill, there is no denying that the government further seeks to improve the ability of employers to dictate to employees the conditions under which they will workâas if they need any further power, for the employer-employee relationship has always been closer to a master-servant relationship than one of equality and partnership, despite the efforts of various work forces throughout this country over the years to make it more of a level playing field with both employers and employees working together.</para><para>There is a simple message that all of the government's attempted reforms to the workplace convey: this government is a friend of employers, not of employees. It staunchly believes that tightening the rope around the necks of employees will improve their productivity and then improve this country's economic performance. But at what price? There are two problems with this approach. Firstly, tightening the rope around the necks of employees will not make them better workers and, secondly, eroding the conditions of working people and promoting a dog-eat-dog approach to workplace relations fundamentally undermines the social fabric of our community.  </para><para>As I said, if the government is successful in pushing it through both houses, this bill will erode the number of allowable matters contained in awards. For example, the bill proposes that award clauses dealing with the following issues are not to be considered as allowable: transfers between work locations; cultural leave, which is to be replaced by a more specific and restrictive form of ceremonial leave for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples; extra public holidays above those specified as public holidays by a state or territory governmentâfor example, union picnic daysâleave for training and study purposes; the recording of employees' work times; and minimum or maximum hours to be worked by regular part-time employees. And that is just to name a few.</para><para>There is no doubt that the government are utterly committed to eroding the conditions of working people via award stripping and they are also obviously committed to union bashing. They refuse to acknowledge the role of unions in building social capital in this country and the role that unions play in ensuring that people are treated fairly in the workplace and are not exploited. But in the eyes of this government, being exploitedâworking hours and hours of unpaid overtime, for example, just to remain competitive in the workplace, or accepting reduced conditions of employment when your coworkers are not prepared toâmakes you a good worker. According to this government, employers who pursue the erosion of workers' rights and conditions are simply responding to a more competitive and altered global environment.</para><para>But I fundamentally reject the government's approach to workplace relations in this country as it does not serve the best interests of the people of Australia and therefore does not serve our national interest. The government has repeatedly attempted to have the provisions of this bill, in varying forms, passed through both houses. Aspects of the bill appeared, for example, in a piece of proposed legislation rather cruelly titled the Workplace Relations Amendment (More Jobs, Better Pay) Bill introduced in 1999. Following its rejection by the Senate, the government introduced this bill on the premise that the Senate, and particularly the Australian Democrats, might consider these provisions more favourably should the schedules be reintroduced as separate billsâor, as the former Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations put it, in `bite-sized chunks'. I am sorry, but an unpalatable meal is still unpalatable, no matter what size the courses are served in.</para><para>I would like to turn to another issue raised by the minister in his second reading speech, wherein he said:</para><quote><para>Despite falls in unemployment, it remains the duty of this government through this parliament to do whatever it reasonably can to create jobs.</para></quote><para>I must point out that, as a representative of an electorate which has the highest unemployment rate in Australia at almost 10 per cent and which has youth unemployment above 25 per cent, we do not feel that this government has done much at all to create employment in the Wollongong region. It has failed dismally in this regard. In fact, federal governments in recent decades have failed the Illawarra in terms of generating investment and ensuring that the region has a sustainable economic future and ample long-term job opportunities for its residents. We fell a long way behind during the eighties and nineties and we now have a lot of catching up to do, with the governments in power not willing to address the issue. I therefore find it somewhat intolerable when this government brags about job creation when so little has been done to alleviate the unemployment situation in Wollongong. </para><para>Also galling is the government's bragging about helping Australian families improve living standards, when plenty of research suggests that the gap between rich and poor is widening in this country. We only have to look at the recent report into poverty handed down by the other place for ample evidence of that. If anything, the federal government have turned their back on struggling familiesâand bills such as this one do not help. `Let the market decide' is the catchcry of the government's ideology and application to policy. They seem to believe that their approach has improved workplace relations for this country, when it has in fact only eroded pay and conditions for Australian workers.</para><para>The government also seems to believe that there have been positive flow-on effects for the community at large because of its approach to workplace relations. Once again, I fundamentally contest that claim. For the struggling families in my electorate of Cunningham, and indeed for my electorate at large, this government's approach has done very little. If anything, it has made life harder for many of those individuals whom it claims to serve. To see this we only have to look at the strike yesterday by general staff at the University of Wollongong, who are operating under federal awards and under enterprise bargaining. The workers there are working hard in the best interests of the university, the students, the region and their own families. Yet, because this government is pursuing award-stripping and is financially starving universities, they have been forced to take strike action. I support their efforts yesterday. But I cannot support this legislation, and I condemn the government for bringing it before us.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>27977</page.no><name role="metadata">Andrews, Kevin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDREWS</name><name.id>HK5</name.id><electorate>Menzies</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âin replyâIncreasing employment opportunity is the most effective way of ensuring that the needs of disadvantaged groups in our community are addressed. Further workplace relations reform will assist this by providing increased labour market flexibility, better productivity and enhanced employment outcomes overall. The measures proposed in the <inline ref="R1678">Workplace Relations Amendment (Award Simplification) Bill 2002</inline> will ensure that awards operate as a safety net of wages and conditions of employment and that they do not discourage enterprise bargaining. The Australian Industrial Relations Commission will retain its key role in determining the award safety net.</para></talk.start><para>The bill will remove from awards those matters most appropriately dealt with in agreements dealt with by state and territory legislation that should not be part of a safety net of terms and conditions and that hinder productivity and high workplace performance. The bill will also tighten the scope of some existing allowable award matters and clarify that certain matters are not within the scope of allowable award matters. In addition, the bill will clarify that provisions that are incidental to an award may only be included in an award where they are essential for the operation of that award. The commission will have 12 months to review all awards to check whether they contain provisions that would no longer be able to be included as allowable award matters.</para><para>The commission has made excellent progress on award simplification. The task before the commission in implementing these amendments will be nowhere near the scale and size of the original award simplification exercise. The bill will also provide that exceptional matters orders be made only by a full bench of the commission. Exceptional matters orders are a remedy of last resort to be used where there is no reasonable prospect of agreement being reached between the parties and where this lack of agreement would result in unfairness. If a dispute is of such complexity and importance that it merits an exceptional matters order, it deserves the experience of a full bench in order to reach a practical and lasting solution. </para><para>The purpose of the bill is to ensure that awards remain a fair safety net of minimum wages and conditions. However, awards should not and need not cover matters that are dealt with in other legislation, nor should they deal with matters that are more appropriately dealt with at the workplace level. Members opposite raised some specific points about the tightening of some of the allowable matters proposed in the bill. Firstly, in relation to skills based career paths, the government remains committed to improving the knowledge and skills of the Australian work force. However, the focus of the workplace relations system is now on enterprises and workplaces, with agreement making being the main form of determining pay and conditions.</para><para>The member for Rankin quoted from a recent Productivity Commission report, entitled <inline font-style="italic">Sources of Australia's productivity revival</inline>, as evidence that skills formation needed to be improved. The government agrees that we should be encouraging skills formation. However, on the following page, the report goes on to say that one of the reasons for the revival of Australia's productivity is:</para><quote><para>Labour markets have become more flexible, particularly with greater focus on enterprise bargaining. As noted in this survey, there is a range of evidence that flexibility in labour markets has allowed work and organisational arrangements to be restructured and labour to be reallocated; and has facilitated the productive use of technology.</para></quote><para>Promoting labour market flexibility is precisely what the government is seeking to achieve by removing skills based career paths from awards. By allowing employers and employees to respond quickly to changing skills needs and to develop training and education arrangements that meet the particular needs and circumstances of their workplace, rather than being tied to the one-size-fits-all industry based arrangements prescribed in awards, the government believes that skills formation will be boosted.</para><para>The bill does not propose to remove classifications of employees from the list of allowable matters. This will include definitions of the work to be done by each particular classification and the skills, competencies and qualifications required to perform that work. However, the government does not believe that awards should prescribe the training programs that employees need to undertake to obtain these skills and qualifications, nor should awards regulate the training regimes under which training is delivered. The formal vocational and education systems run by states and territories will be unaffected by this change. Training and education matters are best dealt with by the formal state and territory systems and supplemented by agreement between employers and employees at the workplace level through workplace agreements rather than being duplicated in awards.</para><para>Secondly, the bill does not make union picnic days a non-allowable matter per se. The bill simply ensures that awards only include those public holidays which state and territory governments have decided should be observed in their jurisdictions. Union picnic days, which do not fit this description, are outside the appropriate safety net of fair minimum standards, which awards represent. Thirdly, long service leave provisions in awards can be lengthy and confusing. They add considerable complexity to what should otherwise be simple documents. Legislation in every state and territory already provides for long service leave. The unnecessary duplication of long service leave provisions in awards can cause confusion and complication for employers as well as additional administrative costs. Removing a matter like long service leave from awards, where that matter is adequately dealt with through another form of legislation, is completely consistent with keeping the award system as a safety net of fair minimum terms and conditions. </para><para>Fourthly, legislation in each jurisdiction already makes provision for payments to jurors. This is consistent with the responsibility of states and territories for the regulation of their courts. If there are to be any changes made to the level of such payments, those changes should be made at the state and territory level and not be dealt with at the federal level through awards. The requirement to pay jury service make-up pay places a considerable burden on employers, who also incur the cost and uncertainty of temporarily replacing an employee on jury service. It is not appropriate for awards to require employers to pay allowances for non-work-related matters, and many awards do not in fact include jury service provisions. Payment for jury service are not standard across states and should not form part of the minimum safety net of terms and conditions to be included in federal awards.</para><para>Fifthly, the award simplification bill is about ensuring that the award safety net provides for fair minimum wages and conditions of employment and does not act as a disincentive to agreement making at the workplace level. When and how transfers from one type of employment to another should take place should not be set at the federal award level. These are matters more appropriately decided at the workplace level and according to its particular needs and circumstances. Prescribing how and when transfers from casual to permanent or full-time to part-time employment must occur will impose inflexible and inappropriate constraints on otherwise efficient workplaces and act as a disincentive to employers to create more jobs.</para><para>Members opposite and the member for Cunninghamâwho spoke prior to me in this debateâshould remember that, since coming to office, this government has created the conditions for the creation of over 1.2 million jobs, and the unemployment rate has fallen nationally from 8.2 per cent to 5.9 per cent. The flexible and efficient workplace relations environment created by this government has played an important role in creating these employment opportunities.</para><para>The Labor Party has an ideological opposition to casual employment and makes hysterical claims about its incidence and effect. In fact, the growth in casual employment is a long-term trend and the growth has actually slowed in recent years compared to the growth when the Labor Party was last in office. Unlike the Labor Party, the government does not want a return to complicated 500-page awards which regulate every minute of every worker's day. In conclusion, the measures proposed in the bill will reinforce the role of awards as a safety net. I commend the bill to the House.</para><para>Question put:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>13:13:00</time.stamp><para>The House divided.</para></division.header><para>(The Deputy SpeakerâHon.

He cannot have it both ways. The minister argues the merits of a unitary system of industrial relations in this country when it suits him, but he also says when it suits him that these matters should all be devolved to the states. Minister, you cannot have it both ways. You either want a unitary system or you want a devolved system. The truth of the matter is: you do not care whether it is unitary or devolved. What you do care about is that legislation is passed through this parliament that reduces the pay and working conditions of vulnerable Australians. That is the end that you have in mind. That is the objective that you are trying to achieve, and you will jump into any vehicle that is available to achieve that objectiveâwhether the vehicle be a unitary system or a decentralised system, as the minister is advocating today. In arguing for the termination of employment bill, which would have effected a hostile takeover of state unfair dismissal systems, he said that the reason for that bill was the pursuit of a unitary system. There is no consistency here whatsoeverâno consistency at all. The truth is the only reason that the minister is invoking these particular provisions in the legislation is to drive down the working conditions of vulnerable Australians. I refer to clause 1 and clause 14 in the bill. Clause 1 says:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Omit âand skill-based career pathsââ</para></quote><para>from the list of allowable matters; and clause 14 specifies:</para><quote><para>... training or education (except in relation to leave and allowances for trainees or apprentices)â</para></quote><para>is not an allowable matter. We oppose both of these clauses in the legislation. Labor have consistently said that today's productivity growth is tomorrow's prosperity. The tragedy is that the Howard government has failed to invest properly in skills formation in this country, jeopardising future productivity growth and the prosperity that flows from it. This was summarised by the Labor senators in their report to the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education Legislation Committee's inquiry on similar provisions in the infamous 1999 second wave legislation. The Labor senators said:</para><quote><para>As witness after witness pointed out during this Inquiry, it would be insane to remove training provisions from awards.</para></quote><para>They also said:</para><quote><para>The amendment would send the wrong signal to employers and employees about the importance of training and skills formation.</para></quote><para>The Productivity Commission has found that skills formation decelerated during the 1990s and made no significant contribution to productivity growth in this country; in fact, it probably detracted from productivity growth. Yet we are confronted with clauses 1 and 14 that would strip out of the award system any reference to skill based career paths and to training or education. The minister says that this provides flexibility. It certainly does not provide training, which is so essential to future productivity growth. The government says productivity growth is good. We agree with the government on that. Why would you take training and education out of the award system if you were fair dinkum about achieving productivity growth?</para><para>We know in the 21st century that one of the absolute key contributors to productivity growth must be investment in skills formation. But this government is effectively saying that it does not support investment in skills formation through the award system. The government wants vulnerable workers to have to go back to the employer and try to persuade the employer to invest in skills formation and training in this country. Why would they do that? There is only one possible explanation: the government wants to deskill the Australian work force at the lower level of skills, in a race to the bottom, competing on wage costs against the countries of East Asia. This is a race we should never have entered, it is a race we should never want to win, but the government wants vulnerable Australians to run faster in that race to the bottom by, in a most scandalous fashion, removing skills formation from the award system.</para><para>This is one of the worst pieces of legislation that this government has introduced in the industrial relations arena. That is a very big statement, because it has introduced plenty of bad legislation. I ask the minister to respond as to what merit there could possibly be in deskilling the work force and how he can reconcile his desire for a unitary system one week and for a devolved system the next week. Minister, is it not the case that there is no such desire; you just want to drive down working conditions? <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>27982</page.no><name role="metadata">Andrews, Kevin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDREWS</name><name.id>HK5</name.id><electorate>Menzies</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âVery briefly in reply to the member for Rankin, there is no inconsistency in the government's approach to the <inline ref="R1678">Workplace Relations Amendment (Award Simplification) Bill 2002. </inline>More than anything else, the government's record over the last seven years in the creation of jobs in Australia and the driving down of the unemployment rate is evidence that the more flexible approach to workplace relations has led to greater labour productivity in Australia. That reality is that there are more than 1.2 million jobs in Australia today that have been created that did not exist in 1996. The reality today is that we have the lowest unemployment rateâunder six per centâin this country for something like two decades. The reality is that there are more people in work and there are people being paid higher wages, on any measure of wages in Australia.</para></talk.start><para>We enjoy a certain degree of prosperity in this country at the present time and what we want to do is move forward so that more Australians have jobs and are paid higher wages in the future. What the Labor Party wants to do is to reimposeâmove backwards toâa one-size-fits-all approach not just to take us back to 1996, before this government came to office, but even to undo some of the modest reforms to workplace relations that the Keating and Hawke governments put into place prior to that and drive us back into the industrial dark ages. That is not the reality that Australia needs for the modern competitive world environment in which we exist at the present time. We are on about jobs and wages and we will continue to move forward in that regard.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>27982</page.no><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Dr EMERSON</name><name.id>83V</name.id><electorate>Rankin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe minister has just said that there is no inconsistency. The inconsistency is glaring. Just a couple of weeks ago in this parliament the government tried to get through the Senate the <inline ref="R1920">Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002 [No. 2]</inline> on the basis that it was in the interests of a unitary system of industrial relations in this country for the federal government to effect a hostile takeover of the state unfair dismissal systems. The government said that was virtuous because it took Australia closer to a unitary system. Similarly, the government seems to be embracing the concept of a national workers compensation scheme on the basis that this is consistent with a unitary system. But when it suits it the government comes into the parliament and says in relation to the legislation before us that these matters should be better dealt with by the states.</para></talk.start><para>The minister stands at the dispatch box and says that there is no inconsistency. Minister, there are only two explanations for that: (1) you do not understand that there is a glaring inconsistency or (2) you do understand it but are not prepared to admit it to the parliament and the people of Australia. This is highlighted even more in respect of clause 3, which deletes long service leave from the list of allowable matters. In explaining that, the minister has said that matters of long service leave are better dealt with by the states. Removing long service leave would mean that workplaces would revert to relying on state long service leave laws, which vary, obviously, from state to state. This could have adverse consequences for both employers and employees, depending on each particular award provision and the state law. It is totally inconsistent with the government's own stated objective of having a more unitary system of industrial relations, which they used as a basis to justify the termination of employment bill that was recently defeated in the Senate. </para><para>The removal of long service leave from awards would particularly affect employers operating in more than one state. It is these multi-state employers that the government is seeking to assist through a national workers compensation scheme, so it is impossible to understand the perspective the government is adopting. It either wants a unitary system or it wants a devolved system. It cannot want both at the same time. The only possible explanation for this glaring inconsistency is that this government does not care whether it has a unitary system or a devolved system; what it does care about is removing allowable matters to facilitate the downward flexibility that it seeks in the working conditions of vulnerable Australians. By stripping out these awards, taking another four allowable matters out of the system, it is tearing more holes in the award safety net.</para><para>The minister needs to clear up this inconsistency or, more likelyâand I would like him to do thisâadmit to this parliament that the government do not care one way or the other whether it is a unitary system, whether it is a decentralised system, whether the states run the industrial relations system. They do not care about that. What they do care about is ways of making it harder for working Australians to make ends meet and to enjoy at least some basic level of protection for their working conditions.</para><para>Clause 10 removes jury service from the list of allowable matters. Surely Australians should be entitled to some protection so that, when they do the right thing and perform jury service, they are not put in a position where they are out of pocket. Are we going to have a justice system based on some sort of user pays model? Probably. If this government got its way that is exactly what it would do. There is absolutely no sensible basis for removing jury service from the award system, yet that is exactly what the government wants to do.</para><para>I move on to union picnic days. Clause 6 restricts public holidays to those declared by the government of a state or territory. Here is a government obsessed with this particular provision. As well as trying it on in 1999 they tried it again in 2000 with a bill specifically targeted at removing union picnic days. The fact of the matter is union picnic days are not only available to union members. In many awards the union Picnic Day forms part of the 11 core public holidays to which all employees are entitled. If it is removed, will it be replaced by another holiday? Will employees have to go back to their employer and seek a public holiday, or is this government, as part of its work-till-you-drop strategy, committed to reducing the number of public holidays in this country from 11 to 10? <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> I want to hear from the minister about that.</para><para>The Australian people need to know: is this part of the work until you drop strategy, that there be one less public holiday and then you work longer as well, not only in your lifetime but in each and every year? I certainly do not understand any basis for removing the union picnic days other than it is one more working condition that the government can strip away. Perhaps the government is blinded yet again by its ideology because the holiday has the word `union' in it. Imagine this government coming into parliament and saying, `We want to make sure that there is no public holiday on Anzac Day or the Queen's Birthday.' I do not think the monarchists on the other side would do that, but they are quite happy to say, `There is no public holiday as far as we are concerned when it has the word `union' in it.' I certainly want to hear a decent and honest explanation from the minister on that.</para><para>I turn to clause 14, transfers from one type of employment to another. Clause 14 specifies that a transfer from one type of employment to another type of employment is not an allowable matter. This bill would also make nonallowable any provision about the transfer from one type of employment to another, such as full-time, part-time and casual work. Job security is a very big issue in this country today, with 27 per cent of our work force in casual employment. Casual employment seems to be the government's favoured form of engagement. Some 2.2 million working Australians are engaged as casuals, and 60 per cent of them have been in the same workplace for more than a year. We know that casual employment can play a valuable role in providing a ready work force in peak seasonal conditions, whether it be in agriculture, tourism, hospitality or retailing. In many cases it does suit employees to have a loading to compensate for no job security or leave entitlements. But, in many other cases, employees are employed regularly for a long time but they cannot get the job security that they want and need, for both peace of mind and to access home and other bank loans. </para><para>The recently released report of the bipartisan Senate inquiry into poverty found:</para><quote><para>... 21 per cent of households, or 3.6 million Australians, live on less than $400 a weekâless than the minimum wage.</para></quote><para>The report said:</para><quote><para>The prevalence of working poor households in poverty is due simply to low-wage employment. Driving this change has been a casualisation of the workforce in the last two decades and a more recent weakening of the industrial relations systems.</para></quote><para>It goes on to say:</para><quote><para>... because of the precariousness and uncertainty of  their employment, career progression and training is often unavailable.</para></quote><para>Then it says:</para><quote><para>The committee has also found that the rise in workforce casualisation is the result of attacks on Australia's traditional industrial relations system ...</para></quote><para>Who has launched those attacks? It has been the Howard government over the last eight years, systematically and at every opportunity. It has had 14 bills in this parliament in the last few months which have all been designed to attack Australia's industrial relations system. This minister and this government favour casual employment. The reason they like casual employment is because it is easier to dictate to casual employees, under pain that, if the casual does not accept the edict or the requirements of the employer or thinks that they are unfair, they have very little recourse. The government likes casual employment because it is easier to dismiss casual employees and because the whip hand is controlled by the employer and the casual employee has little or no bargaining power.</para><para>The fact is that there are at least three awards in Australia in which there is a right for long-term casuals to request a conversion from casual to permanent work. It is in the metals award, it is in a clerk's award and it is in a hospitality award, but it will not be if this legislation is passed. The government says that it favours choice. In these awards there is a choice for employees to go along to the employer and request conversion from casual work to permanent workâa request. The government says there will be no choice for employees. There will be no choice for employees if this legislation gets through. When this government talks about choice, it never talks about choice for employees. When it talks about flexibility, it means downward flexibility for vulnerable working Australians. To take out these provisions that are sitting in awards and are obviously working in a way that has not had any significant deleterious effect on these industries is just scandalous. The government has said that it is pro-choice but, of course, when it comes to choice for employees, it wants to remove that choice from the awards, to make sure that casuals have no bargaining power or even a right to make a reasonable request. </para><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>27985</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Mr ANDREWS (MenziesâMinister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service) (1.35 p.m.)âby leaveâI move:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a third time.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a third time.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>SURVEILLANCE DEVICES BILL 2004</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>27985</page.no><id.no>R2010</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>27985</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 24 March, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ruddock</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>27985</page.no><name role="metadata">McClelland, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McCLELLAND</name><name.id>JK6</name.id><electorate>Barton</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI thank the Attorney for coming into the House and for his courtesy. I note that he did it the other night when the matter was not reached. I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R2010">Surveillance Devices Bill 2004</inline>, which was introduced into the House last Wednesday. The opposition examined the bill and requested a briefing from the government, which was provided. For that, we thank the Attorney and officers of his department for making themselves available. The opposition recognise the importance of this bill and will be giving it in-principle support at the second reading in the House. Because of the important subject matter of the bill and the need to strike a careful balance between giving our law enforcement authorities the tools they need to fight crime and ensuring that these are used appropriately and with due regard to Australians' privacy, we have referred the bill to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committeeâand, again, we note the government's cooperation in that respect. We look forward to the report of the committee and whether they have any recommendations for improvements to the bill.</para></talk.start><para>The origin of this bill is resolution 15 of the Council of Australian Governments Leaders Summit on Terrorism and Multijurisdictional Crime in April 2002âa very important meeting indeed. That meeting called for a national set of powers for cross-border investigations covering, among other issues, the use of electronic surveillance devices. Following this resolution, a joint working group was established by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General and the Australian Police Ministers Council. The joint working group developed model laws which were released for public comment in November 2003. This bill substantially implements those model laws but we understand there have been modifications in a number of areas. No doubt the Senate committee will be interested in obtaining community and professional feedback on these changes.</para><para>I should begin by observing that there is a need for legislation of this kind. Currently, the only Commonwealth legislation governing the use of surveillance devices by law enforcement authorities is division 2 of part II of the Australian Federal Police Act, which provides for warrants for listening devices. In addition, state and territory legislation governing surveillance devices has been undesirably fragmented. As the joint working group stated in its November 2003 report:</para><quote><para>Currently, the law in each of these areas differs significantly between jurisdictions and there is no provision for recognition in one jurisdiction of authorisations or warrants issued in another jurisdiction. Where an investigation crosses State or Territory borders, the need to obtain separate authorities in each jurisdiction can result in delays, loss of evidence and other impediments to effective investigation. The creation of a national set of investigative powers is intended to facilitate seamless law enforcement across jurisdictions. </para></quote><para>As I say, this was on the basis of the joint federal and state cooperation in recognising the need for these measures.</para><para>It is also important that we have Commonwealth legislation covering the full range of surveillance devices, including not only listening devices but also optical surveillance devices and data surveillance devicesâwhich include equipment or programs used to monitor computer inputs and outputsâas well as tracking devices. These of course are becoming increasingly sophisticated with modern technology. I should note that the use of surveillance devices by our intelligence agencies is a separate issue, governed by other legislation, in particular the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act and the Intelligence Services Act. This bill does not affect the direct use of such devices by those agencies and is restricted to the use by law enforcement authorities, specifically: the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Crime Commission, and state or territory police investigating a Commonwealth related offence.</para><para>The bill enables these authorities to use surveillance devices where they have obtained a warrant from an eligible judge or AAT member. The circumstances in which warrants may be sought and issued are broadly comparable to those applying to telecommunications interception warrants and balance a range of factors including the gravity of the offence, the importance of the information sought, the availability of alternative methods of obtaining the information and the impact on privacy.</para><para>A surveillance device may be used without a warrant if an emergency authorisation has been obtained. Emergency authorisations may only be granted by authorising officers, who may be: a commissioner, deputy commissioner or authorised SES level employee of the Australian Federal Police; the chief executive officer or authorised senior executive service employee of the Australian Crime Commission; or a commissioner, assistant commissioner or superintendent of a state or territory police forceâvery senior office holders, in other words. Emergency authorisations may only be granted where the use of the device is necessary in a number of criteria: to deal with an imminent risk of serious violence to a person, or substantial damage to property; to urgently recover a child subject to a Family Court recovery order; or to prevent the loss of evidence in an investigation of a specified serious offence, including terrorism, serious drug offences, treason, espionage and aggravated people-smuggling.</para><para>If an emergency authorisation is granted, the authorising officer must apply within two business days for retrospective approval by an eligible judge or AAT member, who must in turn be legally qualified with five years experience. If the approval is not granted, additional restrictions on the use of the information come into operation, which I will address later. A surveillance device may also be used without a warrant or an emergency authorisation in the following circumstances: where it is an optical surveillance device and its use does not involve entry onto premises without permission or interfere without permission with any vehicle or thing, such as the observation of persons from a distance using binoculars or cameras; where it is used to record words spoken to a law enforcement officer or a group of persons including a law enforcement officer, such as a conversation with an undercover officer wearing a wire for the purpose of recording that conversation; or where it is a tracking device and its use does not involve entry into premises or the interior of a vehicle without permission and its use has been authorised by an authorised officer, which may be one of the people I mentioned earlier in the context of emergency authorisations. An example of that would be the placement of a tracking device on the exterior of a vehicle or vessel. </para><para>We note that these provisions for the use of surveillance devices without a warrant or emergency authorisation are modifications of the model laws released by the joint working group, and are said by the government to share the feature of being less intrusive forms of surveillance. We believe it is desirable to obtain some public input on these proposals through the Senate committee process, and no doubt that will be a point of interest.</para><para>The bill also enables the use of surveillance devices in the investigation of a range of matters, specifically for the investigation of Commonwealth offences which carry a maximum penalty of at least three years imprisonment; the investigation by the Australian Federal Police or the Australian Crime Commission of a state offence with a federal aspect which also meets the three-year threshold; the safe recovery of a child where the Family Court has issued a recovery order; the investigation of offences against the Fisheries Management Act 1991, such as the illegal fishing of patagonian toothfishâand we note that this contemplates the use of tracking devices on illegal fishing vessels in remote waters; and, finally, the investigation of offences under the Financial Transactions Reports Act 1988 of failing to declare the import or export of money in excess of $A10,000 or operating an account with a cash dealer in a false name. This is included not because of the size of the potential penalty but because such transactions are often an indication of more serious underlying conduct, such as involvement in the illicit narcotics trade or, in worst case scenarios, the involvement of financing terrorist activities.</para><para>Similarly, we understand that this range of matters is broader than that proposed in the model laws, but we recognise that these are all serious law enforcement issues of concern to Australians and that the use of surveillance devices will assist considerably with investigations. The bill also allows surveillance devices to be used under warrant for the investigation of Commonwealth offences outside Australia, in accordance with international law. `Outside Australia' means in a foreign country or on a foreign registered vessel or aircraft that is in or above waters beyond Australia's territorial sea. In such circumstances, a warrant may only be issued if the surveillance has been agreed to by an appropriate consenting official of the relevant foreign country.</para><para>The requirement of agreement by a foreign official does not apply if Australia is exercising its jurisdiction in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Seaânamely, the vessel is in Australia's contiguous zone and the offence being investigated relates to the customs, fiscal, immigration or sanitary laws of Australia, or if the vessel is in Australia's fishing zone and the offence being investigated is one of the specified offences under the Fisheries Management Act 1991.</para><para>As one would expect, the extraterritorial use of surveillance devices is peculiarly a matter for the Commonwealth and would not necessarily be dealt with in model laws developed with the states and territories. So, again, we recognise the need for some departure in this area.</para><para>The bill establishes a number of mechanisms to ensure the accountability of authorities using surveillance devices. We understand it was intended that these be broadly based on the mechanisms that have been included in the telecommunications interception regime. There are also restrictions on the use, recording, communication, publication and admission in evidence of information obtained from a surveillance device or relating to a surveillance device warrant or authorisation. In particular, where information has been obtained without a required warrant, authorisation or approval, it may not be used by the law enforcement authority in the investigation of an offence or the bringing of a prosecution, nor communicated to a foreign country under the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act. On the other hand, it may be communicated to an Australian intelligence agency if it relates to the functions of that agency and it can also be communicated for the purposes of investigating compliance with the Surveillance Devices Act or other laws, such as the Privacy Act. </para><para>The bill introduces a number of safeguards, including imposing obligations on each relevant law enforcement authority to, firstly, keep secure, detailed records of applications, warrants, authorisations and the use of surveillance devices and information obtained therefrom and to maintain a register of these; secondly, in some circumstances, destroy information not required for a recognised purpose under the act; thirdly, report all warrants and authorisations to the Minister; and fourthly, submit an annual report to the minister for tabling in parliament. The bill also provides for regular inspections of records by the Ombudsman and a half-yearly report by the Ombudsman to the minister.</para><para>Once again, the accountability regime is another area where the model laws have been modified. This is one of the most important parts of the bill, so it would not be surprising if it did become a focus of public feedback during the Senate committee inquiry. We expect that the committee will run a fine toothcomb over these provisions to determine whether there is room for improvement and the imposition of additional safeguards. For my part, I will be interested to hear what law enforcement agencies have to tell the committee about the training and protocols currently in place to enable officers on the ground to make an informed and appropriate judgment about when to choose to use a surveillance device over other methods of investigation. The extent of these non-legislative safeguards is, of course, relevant when determining what accountability mechanisms are required in the bill.</para><para>In conclusion, the opposition acknowledges the significance of this bill and is able to signal its in-principle support by voting for the bill at the second reading. I have indicated the areas where the bill departs substantially from the model laws and I believe that in these areas parliament's consideration of the bill will be assisted by community feedback through the Senate committee inquiry process. The challenge is to strike a balance between giving our law enforcement officers effective tools to fight crime and ensuring their appropriate use with regard to Australians' privacy. The opposition remains committed to working with the government to make sure we get this balance right.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>27988</page.no><name role="metadata">Ciobo, Steven, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CIOBO</name><name.id>00AN0</name.id><electorate>Moncrieff</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am very pleased to speak on the <inline ref="R2010">Surveillance Devices Bill 2004</inline>. As both the Attorney-General and the shadow minister, the member for Barton, have said, it is broadly based on the model surveillance devices laws that were developed by the Joint Working Group on National Investigation Powers. The bill comes about as a consequence of a mishmash of state laws that applied across this nationâthe result of a number of laws that were passed in each state and territory that led to uncertainty about the appropriate times that surveillance devices could be used. It also led to uncertainty where there were cross-jurisdictional issues. The bill provides greater clarity regarding the times when and the way in which a surveillance device can be used when it deals with cross-jurisdictional issues. The bill does not prohibit the use of surveillance devices; it merely establishes a structured process for their use where that use would ordinarily be prohibited under a state or territory law.  </para></talk.start><para>In summary, and in brief, the bill provides greater scope for the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Crime Commission and state and territory law enforcement officers that exercise Commonwealth jurisdiction to use surveillance devices under warrant or with internal authorisation. It expands the range of surveillance devices that are available to law enforcement, to include, for example, listening devices, optical surveillance devices, tracking devices and data surveillance devices. It expands the range of offences for which a surveillance device warrant may be obtained to include any Commonwealth offence or state offence with a federal aspect that has a maximum penalty of at least three years imprisonment, along with specified offences in the Financial Transaction Reports Act and the Fisheries Management Act 1991. </para><para>The bill provides for the use of emergency authorisations given by senior police for urgent use of a surveillance device, which is then later subject to review by a judge or a member of the AAT, to be given when there is an imminent risk to life or property, when an urgent child recovery order exists, or when, in particular cases, there are certain specified offences. They include serious drug offences, terrorism and other serious offences where there is the risk of loss of evidence unless acted upon urgently.</para><para>The bill allows for the use of tracking devices where there is no interference with private land or goods, upon authorisation by a senior police officer. It creates a regime which restricts what may be done with material gathered by or relating to the use of surveillance devices. It also creates an accountability regime involving reporting to the Attorney-General, record keeping and inspections by the Ombudsman. Furthermore, it amends the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987 to allow for more simple and effective transmission of material, including surveillance device material but not including telecommunications interception material, to foreign authorities and foreign courts for the investigation and prosecution of foreign offences.</para><para>Finally, the bill defines `surveillance devices' as including data surveillance devices, listening devices, optical surveillance devices and tracking devices. Those devices may be used by the AFP, the Australian Crime Commission and state and territory police forces for the investigation of Commonwealth offences which carry a maximum penalty of at least three years imprisonment, or to assist in the safe recovery of a child where the Family Court of Australia has issued a recovery order. Both the Federal Police and the ACC may also use them to investigate a state offence which has a federal aspect which meets the three-year threshold.</para><para>I would like to touch upon in more detail one particular aspect of this bill, and that is the aspect that deals with emergency authorisations. Whilst I certainly welcome the Labor Party's support for the bill in this chamber and, in addition, am pleased to note that the ALP will put out the bill for wider consultation in the community to receive input not only from law enforcement agencies but also from other interested stakeholdersâwhich may include civil liberties groups, for exampleâit is important to recognise that a key role of this bill is to ensure that, where an emergency situation presents itself and where there is not enough time to ensure that a warrant is able to be achieved, there is the ability for an emergency authorisation to be given. </para><para>Important safeguards are being put in place by this bill. The fact that emergency authorisation can be provided only by a senior police officer or, for example, subject to review by a judge or an AAT member, means that Australians can be comfortable in knowing that, even though a surveillance device can be issued in a circumstance which otherwise would be subject to warrant, that surveillance device is authorised to be issued only in an emergency. I say to all that it would be expected of government to provide a circumstance in which, where it pertains to urgent child recovery orders, for example, we have the opportunity for our police to use surveillance devices. It is to be expected. </para><para>I would be interested to know the Greens' positionâI note that the Greens member is in the chamberâand whether the Greens support these kinds of things. There have been many instances in the past when the Greens have objected to these kinds of laws. They have objected to them on the basis of their being an infringement of civil liberties. But the real question is whether it is appropriate that we as a government should provide our law enforcement officers with the kinds of powers that they need, which also would provide a check and balance.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BNL</name.id><name role="metadata">Organ, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Organ</name></talker><para>âIt is a balancing act.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AN0</name.id><name role="metadata">Ciobo, Steven, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CIOBO</name></talker><para>âIt is a balancing act. The point is that this bill achieves an appropriate balance. It achieves a balance where circumstances dictate that we need to ensure that emergency authorisations are provided by a suitably qualified senior legal officer to ensure that they can use a surveillance device, be it a listening device or an optical surveillance device, to ensure that where we are dealing with the urgent recovery of a childâsay a child who has been kidnapped by a paedophileâor something that the police are faced with, they have the opportunity to obtain that emergency authorisation in a timely manner. Quite frankly, we cannot tie the hands of our law enforcement agencies behind their backs by insisting that they jump hurdles and clear ropes in order to ensure that they can undertake the activities we are talking about.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In addition, the reality is that there are often examples involving serious drug offences. A drug supplier might know full well that he is under surveillance and might then seek to shred documents or dump the material that authorities would rely on to bring an action against him. UnfortunatelyâI pre-empt some debate with the Greens memberâI know that the Greens stand opposed to that kind of thing on the basis of civil liberties. That is highly inappropriate.

In seeking to strike the right balance between the risks and legitimate use of this product, we will not be seeking an immediate ban on its use either as an explosive in mining and quarrying or as a fertiliser. </para><para>It is clear that regulations are required to reduce the potential for the misuse of ammonium nitrate. Criteria for granting access to ammonium nitrate will include a demonstrated legitimate need, safe and secure storage and handling and background checking, including checking by ASIO.

Let me take another scenario which will no doubt interest the member for Lilley. Let us take a couple family with two children, the primary income earner on, say, $45,470 a year and his wife earning $28,400. That is a combined family income of $73,895âa not atypical situation. This family in July 2003 compared to January 1996 was $55 a week better off in terms of disposable income in real termsâ$55 a week better off under the policies of this government. They were paying $24 a week less income tax in real terms. They were entitled to receive over $15 a week in real terms more in family assistance payments, and that is not counting the child-care benefit. They were paying over $16 less in net child-care costs in real terms. I quote those two scenarios, Mr Speaker, to give you a reminder that the work and family balance can be served in many ways, and the undeniable fact is that it has been better served by this government than any previous administration. </para></talk.start></continue></answer></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DISTINGUISHED VISITORS</title><type>Distinguished Visitors</type><page.no>27995</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>27995</page.no><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate>PO</electorate><party>N/A</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon the Rt Hon.

In the middle of a baby care proposal the Labor Party has again confirmed a tax increase. On this side of the House we have always believed that payroll tax is a tax on jobs. Payroll tax is a tax on employment. If you want to give people in Australia the opportunity to workâif you want businesses to create more jobsâyou will not be introducing a new payroll tax at the next election.

In fact, it is part of the property business: funds management. The Labor Party should join the Property Council. In this House there are often some very good contributions. There is some great debate. People are often prepared to stand up for what they believe in. I have been trawling through <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> looking for words expressing concern about payroll tax, and I came across these words:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>... it is absurd for state governments throughout Australia to be taxing labour inputs with payroll taxes.</para></quote><para>That is a legitimate concern, isn't it? You would have thought it had come from the coalitionâsomeone in the Liberal Party or someone in the National Party who expresses concern about the impact of payroll tax on labour. But, do you know what, Mr Speaker? When I trawled through and found these words, I discovered they came from the member for Werriwa, who was concerned about the impact of payroll taxes on labour and employment. So what a surprise that yesterday the member for Werriwa, the Leader of the Opposition, should announce that the Labor Party is going to introduce a national payroll tax. In this House, in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>, he says the payroll tax is insidious, yet yesterday, as Leader of the Opposition, he pledges to introduce a new national payroll tax. Isn't it a bit hypocritical to say thatâflipping and flopping, carpet-bombing these sorts of ideas around and hoping that one of them will hit the target? What a shame.</para><para>What the member for Werriwa and most of his colleagues who have never worked in business do not understand is that payroll tax keeps small business small. Payroll tax is a tax on jobs. Payroll tax is a disincentive to employment. Payroll tax turns people away from making that additional job available to another person. We estimate that there are 50,000 small businesses on the threshold of going over the 20-employee markâ50,000 small businesses that now have a disincentive to employ someone because the Labor Party has pledged to introduce a new national payroll tax. </para><para>There is something else that the Labor Party does not understand. The Labor Party does not understand how the red tape of a new national tax can impact on small business and other businesses. Of course, state payroll taxes are based on payrollâthey are based on the size of the payroll. For example, in New South Wales it is about $600,000. That is one form of paperwork for business.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DK6</name.id><name role="display">Mr HOCKEY</name></talker><para>âNow the Labor Party wants to introduce a new national payroll tax that is based on the number of employees.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Crean</name></talker><para>âNo!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DK6</name.id><name role="display">Mr HOCKEY</name></talker><para>âIt is not based on the number of employees?</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âOrder!

How is a farmer going to deal with fruit pickers? Suddenly a farmer may have 40 fruit pickers over one month. Does that bring them into the national payroll scheme of the Labor Party? What about a pub that might be employing an additional few people over the Christmas period? As the member for O'Connor would know, it can be very seasonal working in pubs or restaurants. How are they going to account for that new paperwork? This approach to policy is scattergun. It has a real impact on business, it has a real impact on jobs and, significantly, there is a disincentive for employment. Once again we see the Labor Party not thinking through the impact of policy. They are coming out with a policy a day that is not focused on creating jobs; it is focused on destroying jobs.</para></talk.start></continue></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Social Welfare: Baby Bonus</title><page.no>28000</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>28000</page.no><name role="metadata">Swan, Wayne, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SWAN</name><name.id>2V5</name.id><electorate>Lilley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question without notice is directed to the Prime Minister.

Since July 2002, Invest Australia has helped to attract some 43 investments to Australia, representing a total dollar investment of $3 billion, and creating over 3,000 jobs for Australian workers. Invest Australia also supports the strategic investment coordination process which, since it was created, has brought about some 6,500 jobs by attracting footloose projects to Australia. These jobs would not have been created under the Labor policy that we heard announced yesterday. The baby payment policy will be funded through the abolition of Invest Australia. The reality is that, whilst Invest Australia has a very good track record, particularly in terms of creating projects like the $1.4 billion project from Comalco in the electorate of Hinkler, this process will be stopped under Labor.</para></talk.start><para>There is a whole range of good examples of investments made in Australia as a result of Invest Australia's actions. We have seen $450 million invested by Visy Paper in Tumut to create some 400 jobs; some $400 million invested by Holden in their new V6 plant in Melbourne, creating some 550 jobs; and, of course, $1.2 billion invested in the high-smelt plant in Western Australia, which is currently employing some 1,600 people in its construction.</para><para>When we talk about the projects that have succeeded under Invest Australia, the Leader of the Opposition has actually seen this success first-hand. In fact, about a month ago he visited the Comalco refinery at Gladstone and spoke to its workers, but he did not mention to them thenâperhaps he had not made up his mind at that stage; perhaps he only made it up yesterday when he announced the policyâthat in fact projects like the one that Comalco is building in Gladstone may be the last for that area. He did not mention that he had a plan to abolish the exact process that put that project there. He did not mention that, under a Labor government, not only would that project attract a new tax in the form of a wages tax but he would not be inviting other companies to come to Australia.</para><para>The reality is that the policy announced yesterday to abolish Invest Australia will abolish the opportunity to bring 70 major projects to Australia. Some of them might go to the member for Hinkler's electorate, some of them will go to other parts of Australia, but the impact of the Leader of the Opposition's poorly thought through policy to abolish Invest Australia is that 70 major projectsâwith a prospective investment of $90 billion and producing 17,000 jobsâjust will not happen. Abolish the process and you will not go out in the global environment, you will not attract those projects to Australia and you will not create those jobs in Australia. It is just another example showing that the Labor Party is bad for business in Australia and bad for jobs in Australia.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Taxation: Family Payments</title><page.no>28001</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>28001</page.no><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Dr EMERSON</name><name.id>83V</name.id><electorate>Rankin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is to the Prime Minister.

They need, in other words, to have a whole range of benefits, andâas I indicated to the member for Rankin's colleague a few moments agoâby any comparison those benefits and those choices have been greatly expanded under this government.

MedicarePlus means an extra 1,500 doctors and 1,600 nurses in general practice by 2007, but the benefits are flowing already. Late last year, the visa for temporary resident doctors was extended from two years to four years. One hundred and forty-two overseas-trained doctors have already been granted these new visas. Most of them are already in practice and all of them are working in areas where there are not enough doctors.</para></talk.start><para>But let me make this point: overseas-trained doctors can answer a short-term problem, but they are not the long-term answer to this issue. The long-term answer is Australian-trained students serving Australian communities as doctors. Thanks to the MedicarePlus package, there are an extra 234 medical students starting this year. On graduation, they will be working in areas of work force need. There are 234 extra medical students as a result of MedicarePlusâthat means 1,704 first-year medical students this year: an all-time record, thanks to the policies of the Howard government. MedicarePlus is a $42 million investment in more medical students, and it means a long-term 16 per cent boost in the number of medical students in this country and ultimately the number of doctors in this country.</para><para>I have been asked about alternative policies. The policy of the opposition is to take away all the MedicarePlus benefits. The baby payment scheme that they announced yesterday involves ripping the guts out of MedicarePlus. It involves taking away the `for and on behalf of' MBS item for allied health professionals.

And the Leader of the Opposition refuses to do anything about the stinking dead cat in federal Labor's backyard. Thanks to the sweetheart deal between the former Labor government and the Australian Labor Party, taxpayers have to pay $871 a metre for office space in Centenary House and the commercial tenant in the same building pays just $314 a metre.

After all, he enjoyed the hospitality of the Whitlams in Paris in the 1980s. When he was the Mayor of Liverpool, he built a fountain modelled on the Pompidou Centre.

That is why, with family tax benefit alone, it is $4,800 for family tax benefit part A and over $1,200 for family tax benefit part B, not to mention the enormous amount of money we have given in child care benefits. I always agree with the Prime Minister. He has tremendous vision when it comes to assisting Australian families.

I thank the member for addressing this issue, which does raise important issues about materials to assist in statutory interpretation. First, I should say that, where a bill had been amended in one house, it would be quite reasonable for a second reading speech in the other house to be different in referring to the amendments. Second, as I understand the situation, the second reading speech is only one of a number of things to which a court may refer to interpret legislation. An explanatory memorandum or the legislation itself would be equally important. Finally, I think this would be a matter for the courts to decide in line with the philosophy of the separation of powers.

We know it will say anything and do anything to camouflage its harsh third-term agenda. We saw this early in January when the Prime Minister went to Western Australia in an attempt to be contemporary. He was shamed into it by the actions of the Leader of the Opposition and the enormous public response that he received for his program of reading aloud to children. I knew politics in this country had changed forever when we saw on the TV that night the Prime Minister of Australia sitting there in a child-care centre with his arms all scrunched up and his knees right up under his chin. As John Hewson said, he looked like an abandoned lunch box.</para></talk.start><para>We saw it again today in question time when the Prime Minister was simply incoherent. We had all the proof in the world that he was not living in the 21st century. As we listened to the babbling, the incoherence, that came from the Prime Minister, going through the back of my mind was some popular rock music from the seventies. I am a bit of a fan of a band called the Skyhooks. As the Prime Minister went through question after question, it came to me: a song called Living in the Seventies. I think the Prime Minister is probably living a bit further back than that; I think he is probably back in the fifties. He is back in the fifties because he only recently discovered that most families have two incomes. It was a huge revelation to him. Anyway, we will give him the benefit of the doubt of 20 years and say that he is actually back in the seventies. I would like to share with you some of the lines from that great rock-and-roll song, that great anthem:</para><quote><para>I feel a bit nervous</para><para>I feel a bit mad</para></quote><para>	...	...	...</para><quote><para>I feel a bit fragile</para><para>I feel a bit low</para><para>I learned the right lines</para><para>But I'm on the wrong show ... </para></quote><para>That is where the Prime Minister was today: on the wrong show, completely out of touch. </para><para>We saw once again today that this government has no agenda for assisting low- and middle-income families who are under tremendous financial pressure as a result of this government's policies. Let us look at what is one of the longest lists of government failure you have ever seenâI refer to the initial report of the interdepartmental work and family task force, which came out at the end of 2002. It calls on the government to urgently introduce paid maternity leave, to fix the family payment debt trap, to make desperately needed child-care places available and to take some action to get more family friendly workplaces. This government has sat on this report since the end of 2002. Bear in mind that this was the government that said before the last election that its priority for its third term if elected would be work and family. One year into that third term it gets a whole set of recommendations, which are a damning indictment of its lack of performance across a whole range of areas, and absolutely nothing has come forward. </para><para>We have to ask ourselves what is going on. The truth is that either the government are going to implement some of those recommendations or they are going to implement none. But they simply do not care about the plight of average families; otherwise they would have implemented all of the recommendations, following the receipt of that report at the end of 2002. Seventeen months on, there is still no action. We can only assume that the government are up to their old tricks. What they are really planning is the three more years at Kirribilli bribe. On the eve of the election the Prime Minister will suddenly discover that all this money is now available for some form of paid maternity leave. It will be raining child-care placesâthat is what we will see from Minister Anthonyâin the not too distant future. They will be falling out of the sky.</para><para>This government suddenly find that they do have a lot of money for social priorities. Last year they could not even fund a meningococcal vaccine. This year there are rivers of gold flowing. There is money available for everything. What we are actually going to see in the months ahead is that old trick. They will do one thing before the election, and I will tell you what they will do after the election: if we get all these promises on the eve of the election, they will come along and thieve it all back after the electionâwhich is exactly what happened last time. Remember what happened just before the 2001 election? Remember they walked in here and gave the pensioners an extra $300? They gave all those people who had accumulated family payment debts a waiver of $1,000 on their debt. But what did they do after the election? They came along and took it all back. Family debt just went through the roof. Now they are out there stripping tax returns and ripping money away from families, hell, west and crooked. When it comes to Australian families, this government do not give a damn. They simply do not care. The truth is this: if Australian families did not have a vote, they would get absolutely nothing from this Prime Minister.</para><para>What is historic about this debate today is that Labor's baby care payment is a groundbreaking piece of social policy. If you look through the history of social policy in this country you will see that this is in the top three significant initiatives which have been put forwardâand it is one we will have great pleasure in implementing in government.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>XJ6</name.id><name role="metadata">Anthony, Larry, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

It would rate with the 1941 commencement of child endowment. That is how significant our baby care payment is in terms of the social policy of this country. It is a serious attempt to ease the financial pressures on families who are contemplating having children or having a second or subsequent child. It is that significant. It recognises the financial harshness caused by the withdrawal from the work force of a mother for her health needs and the financial pressures caused by the arrival of another mouth to feed. It recognises that it makes good economic and social sense to support young families and their children through really progressive work and family policies. It recognises that this is the only sure way of combating the problems of an ageing society. We have to value our parents and we have to value our children, because that is where our energy, our commitment, our passion and our idealism come from. But this government does not recognise that. It is so absolutely out of touch with the average family in this society. </para></talk.start></continue><para>This payment is long overdue. In modern Australia if families do not have two incomes they simply do not stand a chance of making ends meet. So I am comforted that the Prime Minister recently discovered that most families actually do need two incomes or one income and a part-time income or multiple part-time and casual incomes. The problem is that just about every one of the government's policies punishes that typical family. The family debt trap punishes those families. High effective marginal tax rates punish those families. All of the government's policy settings punish the typical Australian family in their typical workplace participation. So our policy is targeted fairly and squarely at those families.</para><para>Nine out of 10 families will receive our baby care payment, and 90 per cent of those will receive up to $3,000 from 1 July 2005. Compare that to the government's baby bonus where 90 per cent of families get $500 or less. Isn't that baby bonus just so typical of this government? The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs did not even have the gumption to defend it in this House and the Prime Minister effectively walked away from it. You would think that, if they had any pride in their record, they would have got up and tried to defend this very unfair payment, which has turned into a complete flop.</para><para>The Treasurer let the cat out of the bag today. He tabled some forward estimates from yesterday. That gives new meaning to the term `forward estimates'. They were signed off by a bureaucrat yesterday who, two months ago in the estimates committees, could not provide us with any information on what the forward estimates were. The Treasurer has effectively admitted that the government has revised the forward estimates down from $1.235 billion to $545 million. That means it is a complete flop. Half the money is gone because it has not been spent. That certainly does leave a lot more money, Minister, doesn't it? That is the admission. What the Treasurer did today was condemn his own scheme. He condemned the scheme which the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs would not even praise. He did not have the gumption to stand up and defend the government's record, which, as the Treasurer showed us all, is completely pathetic.</para><para>Since the last election, although this was supposed to be the two or three years of a focus on work and familyâwhich the Prime Minister described as the barbecue stopperâwe have had no action at all, despite all of the evidence in their work and family report that this was urgently needed. The truth is that the Prime Minister has simply choked on the chops. They have not got a fresh agenda for the future. That is what Mark Latham and Labor are going to provide. That is why this baby care payment is so significant. It is not the end of our approach to work and familyâI can assure the minister of that. It is simply stage 1 of what is going to be the most modern family policy that this country has ever seen. There are going to be a series of initiatives which are going to embarrass this government and this Prime Minister time and time again. As I said before, they are living in the past and they have no idea of what to do in the future. They may be living in the seventies, but it is more likely that they are back in the fifties. </para><para>Who came out yesterday after we announced this great measure? Did we see the senior family minister? Where was she? She was hiding. Where was the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs? You would think that he might have come out and had something to say. They had to send the Treasurer outâwho today had to be embarrassed by his revelation that he had chopped his baby bonus in half. He chopped it in half in the space of 24 hours, after he had been out there telling porkies yesterday. This is very revealing of this government. This is a government which is completely out of touch with the economic and time pressures that are hitting average families in this community.</para><para>As we go towards the next election and people are comparing the various policies of the Labor opposition, which is actually behaving like the government, with the policies of the government, which is actually behaving like the opposition, there will be a very clear choice. They will see positive proposals for the future from Labor. Our baby care payment was rubbished by the minister in parliament yesterday. He came in and said that we had brought out our baby payment policy yesterday because it was a distraction from the debate we were having over Iraq. We have been preparing this policy for well over 12 months and intensively over the last three.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>XJ6</name.id><name role="metadata">Anthony, Larry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Anthony</name></talker><para>âWhere is it?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>2V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Swan, Wayne, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SWAN</name></talker><para>âWe sent it to the printers on the weekend, Minister, and we had the costing signed off last Friday.

He then went on to say that our policy was caught up in his flawed family payment system. One of his attacks was that we had included our policy in the family payment system. We did not, Minister. It is not affected by it at all. That is an admission from you that your own family payments rule and your prediction of income one year ahead are a farce. You were frightened that it would be caught up in it but it is not, because we left it out of those rules. Then you came in and said that, in speeches I have been giving, I had somehow plagiarised the wording of the Stronger Families and Communities policy. I gave a speech on stronger families and communities way back in 1999. You only produced your Stronger Families and Communities policy back in 2000, so you are actually following us. It is the highest compliment that you could pay. There is going to be a change in this country some time in the next 12 months. We have a Prime Minister who does not defend battling families; he creates them. From his record, no Prime Minister has done more to create battling families and no Prime Minister has done less to help them.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Let us just think about this Prime Minister. This Prime Minister has now been in power longer than any American President since Roosevelt. He has led his party almost as long as his hero, Winston Churchill. He has led us into our first war in history without international legal sanction or just cause. He has oversighted the highest tax-take in our history. What is his legacy? Eight years of nothing but scares and vilification, a financial squeeze on battling families and millions for friends of the Liberal Party. There was no money to fix the family payment system but plenty of money emerged the other day for ethanol and the mates of the government. The Howard Liberals only ever have one policy: they always have to be setting up a distraction while they are out there ratting the till. That is what the last week and the debate about the policies of the Leader of the Opposition have been about from that side. They have been distracting attention from the harshness of their third term agenda and their inaction in areas like work and family. The government are always about other distractions, such as, `The Taliban are coming on leaky boats. The unemployed are dragging down the economy. The gays are wanting to get married'âdistraction, distraction, distraction from the real agenda. <inline font-style="italic">(Time</inline><inline font-style="italic"> expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

It blames this government for its `failure to propose positive policies for Australian families due to its obsession with the politics of distraction'. The politics of distraction! As I mentioned earlier yesterday, and I will reiterate today, the reason they hastily convened and announced this policy yesterday, out at Queanbeyan of course, was as a deliberate distraction from the embarrassment and the double position they have taken on national security, particularly over the issue of Iraq. This MPI and what the member for Lilley submitted actually endorse the comments I made yesterday that it was put out as a distraction to get them off the hook.</para></talk.start><para>What is interesting is that the member for Lilley professes that this is the most important public policy announcement for decades. He is very fond of recalling Skyhooks. I think perhaps Mental as Anything is more appropriate to the member for Lilley after that diatribe. If this was so important, and there is no doubt that policies on work and family are important, then why did he say, `This is probably going to be one of the most important policy releases in the last decade of Australian politics'? They whipped it out yesterday, hastily convened in the morning. You would have thought that the member for Lilley, who is going to be addressing the work and family conference tomorrow in Brisbane, would have announced it then. No, he walks out of the chamber now because he knows this was a hastily convened policy. They plagiarised some work and family task force documents. Such documents are always around in government. Many different documents come to government with many different ideas as the Howard-Anderson government strive to continue to improve the health, wellbeing and living standards of Australian families. It is extraordinary. They could not even come up with a new name. They had to actually steal it from an internal document. So the old saying applies: `Loose lips Latham'.</para><para>There is no doubt that the press conference yesterday was hastily convened. If it was so significant, why did they not make the announcement at any other time without the distraction of Iraq? It was done because of their embarrassment on that issue. If it is so important, why was it not given, let us say, a more appropriate announcement? I think it just demonstrates this confected indignation that the Australian Labor Party has on the part of Australian families. Members of this parliament and those that are listening to it will recall how Australian families suffered enormously in the nineties with the recession that we had to have: a million people out of work, one of the highest rates of unemployment and interest rates up at 17 per cent. That was hardship for Australian families. </para><para>Since this government have been in power, our whole modus operandi has been to improve the economy by creating more employment, by creating more apprentices and by creating more jobs. Through good economic management, we have reduced interest rates and, if nothing else, that gives young families the opportunity to own a home, to pay off that debt through low interest rates and to provide a safe and secure work environment. The No. 1 priority if you are going to bring a child into the world is to have steady and permanent employment. What have we done with the introduction of the family tax benefitâwhich they are quite happy to criticise and to spin around the edges? Interestingly, in the diatribe from the member for Lilley he said that they are still going to use the family tax benefit structure to assess the means test for the baby bonus. The family tax benefit provided a substantial increase to familiesâskewed of course to families with young children. We make no apologies for that.</para><para>What is interesting, though, is that the Labor Party again have claimed, and they said it at their national conference, that they were going to have paid maternity leave. This is not paid maternity leave. This has become a payment, as the Treasurer outlined today. We know it is unfunded, we know there is a deficit and, on the forward estimates released today, we know there is a $347 million shortfall. It is $220 million for next year, then $260 million, going up to $300 million and, finally, $250 million in 2007-08. Of course, in underfunding this proposal, not only is it not credible in the sense that it has been wrongly costed but they are actually paying for it by stealing payments that were going to Australian families in the context of Medicare. Here they are putting in this baby bonus payment by stealing money that would have been available for the safety net which is terribly important for Australian families. The opposition cried crocodile tears and did not support our better Medicare package that went through the Senate. That will substantially increase the payment going to young families. Also, there is the safety net for concession card holders or those on social security payments at $300, going to $700 for those that are not concession card holders. They are actually going to be stealing about $350 million out of that to fund this payment.</para><para>Interestingly, when you look at other areas where the opposition have decided to take away fundingârobbing Peter to pay Paulâyou see they are going to scrap employee entitlements. As I mentioned yesterday, one of the things that this government has introduced is at least some guarantee, particularly if a company goes into insolvency, that employees will receive their redundancy pay and that some of their employee entitlements will be met. It was never done in the 13 years the Labor Party were in power, and now they are proposing to abolish it and in its place, as was mentioned today, put in a new payroll taxâwhich is a tax on jobs. And, of course, a tax on jobs means that more people will be out of work. This is incredulous.</para><para>Then the thoughts of the opposition turn to gutting a number of public service bureaus we have here in Canberra. Interestingly today, an unlikely supporter of the governmentânone other than the CPSUâcame out with a statement, which says `PS jobs cut to end ALP honeymoon'. It goes on to state: </para><quote><para>Costings released with today's baby care proposal show that they intend to ... abolish or cut another group of public service agencies including the Office of the Employee Advocate (OEA), the Australian Broadcasting Authority/Australian Communications Authority (ABA/ACA) ...</para><para>We estimate that as many as 1,800 positions are now under a cloud ...</para><para>In our view, it is totally unacceptable for the ALP to make announcements such as the abolition ...</para></quote><para>And on it goes. Here is a union organisation, who you would think would be supportive of their political arm, being highly critical of how the ALP are going to pay for this funding. And of course it goes on and on. What we are demonstrating today is that this policy that was made on the run was announced yesterday as a deflection from their embarrassment over national security issues. If it was so important, why didn't they find another time? Why didn't the Leader of the Opposition even speak to the MPI? We did not even have that. What they are doing is taking funding and entitlements off many Australian families, directly impacting on them. Even when they are doing that, they have underfunded it by $350 million. Not only did they have the super blooper a few weeks ago, one could argue that it is the baby blooper today.</para><para>What I find extraordinary is the accusation that the member for Lilley is makingâthe mock indignationâthat this government has been unfriendly to families. What a load of rubbish! Whilst I withdrew a comment in question time today, I think it very much demonstrates the political apparatus used by some members of the Australian Labor Party because they are bereft of vision. When it comes to child care, there has been a substantial increase in funding. We have now committed $8 billion over the next four years.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AMM</name.id><name role="metadata">Hartsuyker, Luke, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Hartsuyker</name></talker><para>âHow much?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>XJ6</name.id><name role="metadata">Anthony, Larry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANTHONY</name></talker><para>âWe spend 70 per cent more today on child care, as the member for Cowper reminds me, than when the Labor Party was in government. There is constant policy refinement. We have increased the number of outside school hours care places which, again, is critically important for Australian families. We have seen an increase of more than 240 per cent in outside school hours care. This story goes on and on when it comes to the increase in child-care benefit, the increase in places for family day care and the increase in places for outside school hours care, not to mention that it was this government that introduced the immunisation regime. When Labor left government in 1995 we had the lowest rate of immunisation of children in the Western world at around 60 to 65 per cent. That figure today is the highest in the OECD at over 90 per cent because of direct policy action by the government to help the health and welfare of young children.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We see the same outstanding record when it comes to employment; when it comes to the reduction in interest rates, which is critically importantâthe No. 1 priority of any Australian family that is battling it out to have the capacity to pay a mortgage to have a roof over their head; when it comes to job security, which has increased dramatically; when it comes to the increase in funding through the family tax benefit; and when it comes to the other payments such as child care. We are unapologetic: it was this government. Yes, it was this government that introduced the baby bonus, recognising that there was a need to help compensate families when they have young children. When you think of what the government has done, it is a fact that it took this governmentâit is 102 years since Federationâto recognise that a dedicated minister for children and youth was needed, particularly for the health and wellbeing of Australian children. We will have more to say about that in due course. To say that we are not concerned about the health and welfare of Australian families and children is outrageous. </para><para>Let me come back to where this started. We know it was hastily convened because it is uncosted by $350 million. We know they are paying for it by taking money away from Medicare. We know they are taking away what we set up as an entitlements system to support workers who might be put out of work. They are ripping that off and putting in a substitute payroll tax. We know they are taking money away from the Employment Advocate. Even the CPSU, of all people, have suggested that is wrong. Obviously the benefit there is to encourage more industrial unionism. The member for Lilley has the hide to say that all we are interested in on the ethanol debate is looking after our mates. They are looking after their own interests through the constant rort of Centenary House. To have the audacity to come into this parliament and suggest that we are looking after mates! I will tell you the mates we are looking after: we are looking after all the young families across Australia through good government policy.</para><para>The self-importance of the appointed rooster, the member for Lilley, is extraordinary. He was claiming credit for Stronger Families and Communities. Here is a guy claiming credit for it when not so long ago, in January, he was highly critical of it. This again shows the inconsistency of their argument. He is now claiming credit for it. In January he said it was a hotchpotch: `If the money was put into a couple of strong national buckets, we could get much better bang for our buck.' At one stage he was claiming credit for it and at the next stage he was criticising it. The Stronger Families and Communities package, I might add, has been an outstanding success, particularly in helping those communities and young families who are at risk. We have been able to specifically target that program. It has been a very positive program.</para><para>That brings us back to the issue of today's MPIâ`obsession with the politics of distraction'. Distraction was the reason they announced their policy yesterday. If it was so important, why did they choose the one day on which we knew the national media would be totally occupied with the member for Werriwa's inconsistent position on withdrawing the troops from Iraq to announce it? That is exactly what today's MPI is about. This is all about smoke and mirrors. The Australian Labor Party have been very good at obtaining documents. The government are in a constant process, as I have mentioned before, of evaluating positions, as we have with the introduction of child-care benefit, as we have with the introduction of the family tax benefit, as we have with the introduction of making more secure work environments to ensure that Australian families have jobs; and as we have in particular in reducing interest rates to ensure that every Australian family can afford a mortgage. In conclusion, the government have a very proud record when it comes to looking after Australian families. We are unashamed about advocating for Australian families. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

I would like to spend a couple of moments talking about the drivel that we just heard from the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. He had a pretty simple line. He spoke about this great utopia that we now live inâthe wonderful world where we are all safe and happy and wealthy and where the birds sing and the butterflies fly. The message that members of the opposition get when we talk to real people is that people are concerned. They say to us things like: `If things are going so well, why can't I cope? Why aren't I managing my life and my budget and my kids? If things are going so well, why can't I afford a doctor? If things are going so well, why can't I get into a child-care centre? If things are going so well, why do I have to give up my job? If things are going so well, why am I worried about my kids' education?' That is the sort of thing that this minister needs to start listening to. This minister can talk as much as he wants about this lovely little world that he might live in, but it is not the world that other Australians live in.  </para></talk.start><para>The minister also bragged a bit about his child-care policies. He failed to mention the shortage of 20,000 outside school hours care places. He failed to mention the amount of people who do not take jobs because they cannot get child care or cannot get the type of flexible child care that copes with the increasing casualisation of work and the increasing nature of part-time work. He bragged about immunisation. Fund the pneumococcal vaccine. Fund the vaccines that are actually listed on the independent recommendations. What else did he talk about? He talked about the Stronger Families and Communities Strategy, about how wonderful it is and how proud he is of it. It lapses on 30 June. This program that he loves so much is about to run out. But he is just doing a great job! </para><para>Then he talked about timing. He said that we released our baby care policy so that we could distract attention from the debate that was going to occur in parliament on that same day about Iraq. We were not the ones who cancelled question time. We were not the ones who got rid of the process where we could actually have an informed debate and ask questions about the issues affecting Australia. The Prime Minister did that. The Prime Minister was the one who needed to have some kind of distraction. </para><para>The Howard government has long tried to claim some kind of moralistic ground when it comes to family but, as we heard today from the Prime Minister himself, this government's commitment to families only serves you if you fit into its narrow view of what a family might be: mum, dadâwho has to be the husband, from what the Prime Minister saidâa couple of kids and a white picket fence. Most people do not actually fit into this mould. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>84H</name.id><name role="metadata">Zahra, Christian, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Zahra</name></talker><para>âAnd an FJ Holden. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>84S</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Byrne, Michelle, MP</name><name role="display">Ms O'BYRNE</name></talker><para>âThat is right, because we are back in the fifties.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WU5</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Gavan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Gavan O'Connor</name></talker><para>âLiving in the seventies.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>84S</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Byrne, Michelle, MP</name><name role="display">Ms O'BYRNE</name></talker><para>âI do not think we made it to the seventies. Maybe a new leaderâmaybe Costelloâmight take the Liberal Party into the seventies, but the Prime Minister is firmly fixed in the fifties. The definition of a family today is actually much more broad. They are not always biologically based. There are foster families, single-parent families, families comprising same sex couples, blended families and many, many more types. You cannot actually have a nice simplistic idea of a family.  </para></talk.start></continue><para>When I was trying to work out how the government define a family, we thought, `I will look it up on the department's web site; they should know what a family is.' There was nothing there. So we rang them and said, `Can you give us your definition of a family?' They said, `No, we can't do that.' They called us back. We had some further conversation. If we want to find out what a family is according to this government, apparently we have to ask the minister. How do you make family policy without even having a definition of what a family might be? The department has got so scared that they might make a mistake and have to issue some kind of clarifying statement they are not allowed to make any statement now about a family without checking with the minister. Perhaps it is just that the conservative nature of this Prime Minister is such that the very notion of defining what a family is just too challenging; it is just too much for him. </para><para>Surely, a family is a group of people who create a set of relationships to ensure their own and their loved one's daily needs are met. It is a symbiotic relationship between a community and a family: families are part of the community and the community influences the family. So a community that is intolerant of broad based family relationships is a community that will destroy family structures. A community embracing broad based family relationships is a community that will be stronger. Families interact with public systemsâeducation, health, social security. So any failures of these systems to support contemporary family structures are an indictment of this government. </para><para>The Howard government has a track record of selling out families. A quick look at the current Medicare package is enough evidence of this. The St Vincent de Paul Society labelled the safety net a cruel hoax on those who live in low- to middle-income families. In my electorate, those families are the bulk of my community. A public system that is set to fail them does not have my support. I think we all have to admit that the current Medicare package is a sham. This government is indeed obsessed with not only distraction but also destruction. It has driven the destruction of Medicare. It has allowed the abhorrent emergence of unmanageable family debt. It has watched an aged care sector sink into absolute crisis. It has played games with the Stronger Families and Community Strategy and it has ignored the community calls for decent child-care services. </para><para>This government is only about the politics of distraction and destruction. It is incapable of understanding the needs of Australian families and has no interest in helping families on low to middle incomes. The Howard government says it is really worried about the falling Australian birth rate. It called on women to start having more babies. But it does nothing to support these women. The Prime Minister in question time today even refused to concede that the introduction of family friendly policies might actually ease the burden on families and make it easier for them to think about having children. The government's cabinet report spoke about the pressure many parents face financially in the period following the arrival of a new baby. The fact that the family income often falls substantially at the same time that new families have to cope with the direct cost of having a child is actually not a huge mental jump to make. Okay, it might be for this minister, but for most of us it is not a huge mental jump to make. It is for this reason that the government needs to ensure that families have access to financial assistance in this time. </para><para>The cabinet report was commissioned by the Prime Minister. In what seems to be an increasing display of government policy, they ignore its findings if they do not actually like what it says. If it does not correlate with the Prime Minister, it obviously cannot be happening. If they do not hear what they want to hear, they employ the dog with a fluffy tail strategy. Families need help. `Oh, really? Oh, lookâa dog with a fluffy tail.' That is not the way you run government policy. That is not the way you make things work.  </para><para>The Australian Social Policy Conference last year heard that there was a clear link between generous child support packages provided by governments and fertility rates. Surely then the government would realise that refusing to assist families economically has a direct impact on the decisions that families make. Labor will provide a substantial boost in financial assistance to new mothers, whether in paid or unpaid work. Labor's policy is simple and easy to understand and will go much further than the government's current payment. There is an inextricable link between health and socioeconomic status. Our Prime Minister tends to move in quite high socioeconomic circles, so perhaps he struggles to understand why ordinary families find it hard to cope with his abysmal health system.</para><para>It is a fact that people who are less educated, unemployed or living in households with a low income report poorer health. So what has the government done? Not so long ago they appointed a new Minister for Health and Ageing. On this side, we thought he was obviously appointed to kick the heads of the health system. But what did we get? We got a minister focused on the policies of distraction; a minister focused on every political issue except the one he is responsible for. He must be getting a bit sensitive about that now, because in order to get his Centenary House question in today they actually gave him a health question.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>84H</name.id><name role="metadata">Zahra, Christian, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Zahra</name></talker><para>âCouldn't have believed it.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>84S</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Byrne, Michelle, MP</name><name role="display">Ms O'BYRNE</name></talker><para>âWhat a shock to most of us here. We were surprised. He did have to have a brief, but hopefully he will learn a little bit more about health as he goes on. A sound education foundation is crucial in terms of future employment. Anglicare Tasmania noted that `people with low levels of education are more likely to be unemployed and to be unemployed for longer'.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Education and training are an investment in developing the capability of all Australians. And herein lies the contrast between a Howard government and the Latham Labor government, which we will have by the end of the year. A Howard government only sees education as a cost, as something for those who can afford to pay. A Latham government is committed to treating education as an investment in not only the future of the individual but the future of the family and indeed the future of Australia. That is why a Labor government will introduce new programs to assist struggling schools. That is why a Labor government will provide incentives to ensure that the best teachers and school leaders are available to assist those struggling schools. We believe that every school in Australia should have the opportunity to be a high-achieving school. We understand how important a good education system is to a family unit.</para><para>I have run out of time and I am getting very disturbed about this. There is so much I wanted to talk about, such as the pattern of deceit that has emerged from this government. They have been caught out on this time after time. We have had so many instances in this House of ministers not telling the truth. It is a pattern drawn by the Prime Ministerâthe chief architect or artist of the policy. He was caught out on the ethanol scandal, caught out on `children overboard', caught out with his own WMDs: words of mass deception. He has been caught out so many times that even the journos take it for granted now. The Prime Minister shamelessly lectured schools about values and sat on the sideline pointing his finger at government schools, saying that they have to have better values, yet he leads a ministry who shamelessly tell half-truths. A half-truth is no different to a whole lie. The best political advice I ever received was from Lance Barnard. He said, `Don't tell a lie because no-one's smart enough to remember what they were.' Maybe the government should take note: they are not bright; they should just tell the truth. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>28022</page.no><name role="metadata">Thompson, Cameron, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CAMERON THOMPSON</name><name.id>84C</name.id><electorate>Blair</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt is a pleasure to take part in this matter of public importance today. I am interested in juxtaposing the MPI today with the MPI yesterday. They appear, from the opposition's point of view, to be two sides of the one coin. We have a scenario where members opposite want to continue to basically sell a message to try and get over the problems that they have with the character of the Leader of the Opposition. A great deficit was exposed here yesterday in the Leader of the Opposition's character, and the yawning chasm will not be filled, no matter how many pages of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> they try to stuff into it.</para></talk.start><para>It was interesting to hear the machine man of the ALP, the member for Lilley, reciting songs from the seventies as part of his address, and it is interesting that they now have a leader who looks back to the seventies. His great oracle is Gough Whitlam. I suppose, in the spirit of the moment, if the member for Lilley wants to quote some 1970s songs, I can do that too. We have had mention of the `Mental as Anything' policies of the members opposite, but I also favour a particular group from that period: the David Bromberg band. They would be known to members opposite as the authors of the song <inline font-style="italic">The Dangerman</inline>: `I'm a dangerman from a dangerous city and I lead a dangerous life.' But they have now got `The Idol'âI think that is what you could say in terms of the David Bromberg band's latest position: `I bought myself an idol with a golden head; I put it on the shelf just up above my bed.' That is what they are doing over there. They have got the member for Werriwa as their idol and nothing can be seen to be pecking at the idol, because he can come up with whatever kooky policies he likes, and we do not have to go back far to see them.</para><para>He has been the exponent of Google politics and Google policies in this place for some time. We are hearing his Google policies from time to time. Whenever he gets out his computer and types in some kind of policy on Iraq, health or families, out the other end comes, he hopes, a policy. We had it years ago. I think the first of the Google policies must have been his policy to apply GST rates differently in different shopping centres across Australia. That has got to be an example of the ultimate in Latham Google politics: Google politics that would result in different tax rates when you go from one shop to the next shop. It would be pretty difficult. How would you arrange the rent structure if you were the landlord running that shopping centre? How would you entice all the businesses to come back? They would all run down the road to the other shopping centre where they could be GST exempt under the wonderful Google policies of the Leader of the Opposition.</para><para>The latest one is a beauty. They have now come up with a policy that has a $350 million hole in it. That is to match the earlier policy they had with an $8 billion hole in it: the one that was based on average weekly, ordinary time earnings instead of average weekly earnings. They can muddle about with the definitions as much as they like, trying to dig their way out of that particular hole, but it is quite evident that the Leader of the Opposition is the guy in this place who likes to play fast and loose with the truth, who likes to have a slick sounding policy, but at the end of the day does it amount to anything? Does it add up? It does not add up. That is the whole problem. As I said, we started off with the man from the seventies, the man who has been in the ALP since the seventies, the member for Lilley. If you go back to the Khemlani loans affair of the seventies, there you have some figures that really did not add up, and I think they are trying to work on revisiting those days. Every policy that they produce does not add up. It is a problem that they have with the public out there. </para><para>If you take this policy that they have just producedâthe baby package or whatever it isâthey say that 90 per cent of people will get the package. Meanwhile, 100 per cent of people will be subject to the payroll tax that goes with it, because that will be a tax on jobs and that will be reducing jobs. So when the family gets the bonus, or whatever it is they call it, they can sit there and say, `Wow, look! We've got this money,' and they can say, `Yes. But dear, didn't you lose your job the other day because of these wacky new payroll taxes?' Well, tough luck about that.</para><para>The mob opposite have been pursuing a very strong effort, whenever they get in trouble, to distract attention away from it. They are doing it againâin particular, when it comes to the failure of the Leader of the Opposition to show any real character about the question of Iraq. It was made clear yesterday by the Treasurer, in particular, in his speech, where the member for Werriwa was absolutely laid bare as someone who has been flipping and flopping and changing his view, changing his position, on whether or not to have troops in Iraq. He was quoting policies before the war had even started, for heaven's sake, as a justification for what he has in relation to a policy today. It is pretty damn thin.</para><para>How are they going to pay for the policy that they now trumpet in this place? They are talking about abolishing GEERSâthe scheme that gets out there and tries to recover the lost entitlements of employees caught up in situations where companies go bankrupt. That is an incredible thing for them to be cutting back. I thought they were working in favour of the workers. People used to think that about the ALP, but it is many years since they did anything like that.</para><para>Now they also want to get rid of the safety net. They have had a real problem with the Medicare safety net ever since it appeared that the government was going to take some real, serious steps to radically improve the nature of Medicareâthe system that has been struggling on ever since it was brought to life by the Labor Party. This safety net is a good addition to it, and now, of course, in order to pay for their latest quirkâin order to pay for the latest Google policies of the Leader of the Oppositionâthey want to abolish it.</para><para>They want to abolish the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Research Economics. That is an important organisation for many of the people in the rural areas of my electorate and many other electorates in Australia. They want to get rid of Invest Australia: `Gee whiz, that's a terrible thing; it has to go.' It created 1,900 jobs in the last financial year. That goes with the record of the opposition in terms of job-destroying policies: let us get rid of Invest Australia and stop it creating jobs. The Office of the Employment Advocateâthat is another thing they want to get rid of. Of course, that is another organisation working on behalf of employees, but what are employees to the members opposite? I think you could say, in relation to the money that the ALP extract out of unions, that they are probably milk cows, but they are not much more. </para><para>One of the great things I have to say about this government is that we have the runs on the boardâabsolutely rolled goldâwhen it comes to providing a better environment for employment for people. This is the basic support that families need: they need a job. And this government is doing something about it. They also need the capacity for financial stability, so official interest rates are also important. The average official interest rates under this government are about half what they were in the period from 1983 to 1996, while the Labor Party was in power. The average was 11.35 per cent under Labor in that period; the average now is 5.28 per cent.</para><para>The average unemployment rate is now 7.03 per cent and under Labor it was 8.5 per centâbut of course we can remember that period between December 1991 and March 1994 when the Labor Party had those rates pegged out at over 10 per cent. Unemployment rates were up to 10.9 per cent in that period. It was absolutely corrosive on the families of Australia at that time. It was terrible unemployment, and there was no real effort by the government of the day to address it.</para><para>We had high interest rates under the Labor Party. In the 1989 period, 17 per cent was the standard variable mortgage interest rate. Juxtapose that with the rates that people pay today. Families are 100 per cent better off when they have those fundamentals working in their favour. You do not have the fundamentals in your favour when you have the Labor Party at the helm, with their record from throughout the ninetiesâand then you go back to that heinous time under the great guru of the Leader of the Opposition, Gough Whitlam, when we had the Khemlani loans affair and all those disasters. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

However, it became apparent that a far more fundamental problem was the physical security of Commonwealth computing assets and the information held on them. Towards the end of the inquiry, the committee had been angered to learn through the media about the theft of IT equipment from an Australian Customs Service facility at Sydney airport, rather than from Customs officials, who had appeared before the committee the previous day. So concerned was the committee at the approach by Customs and the nature of the security breach at the airport that members resolved to extend the inquiryâin part, to take further evidence from Customs. The committee accepts that agencies will make mistakes from time to time and need to improve their procedures. What is totally unacceptable, however, is any lack of openness before the committee.</para></talk.start></continue><para>As a result of the security breach of Customs at Sydney airport, the committee recommenced gathering evidence and discovered an array of problems associated with poor levels of physical security in the Commonwealth, including the theft of electronic equipment from Commonwealth facilities, poor record keeping of lost or stolen IT equipment and a lack of knowledge of appropriate reporting mechanisms in the event of security breaches. Besides addressing the physical security of electronic information, the committee also has recommended the implementation of standards to protect electronic information against access by unauthorised persons or for unauthorised purposes. In particular, attention needs to be given to the making and management of contracts between Commonwealth agencies and outsourced service providers.</para><para>The committee has also responded to complaints from both Commonwealth and private sector agencies that the Commonwealth's public key infrastructure systemâGatekeeperâis too complex and too expensive to make agency accreditation practicable. The committee has recommended that the effectiveness of Gatekeeper procedures be reviewed in light of other commercially available PKI technologies. Finally, the committee has recommended the implementation of adequate data storage practices to allow ongoing access to data in the face of rapidly changing technology.</para><para>In conclusion, I would like to express the committee's appreciation to all the people who contributed to the inquiry by preparing submissions and giving evidence at public hearings. I wish to thank the members of the sectional committee involved for their time and,  in particular, the deputy chair, the member for Sydney, for her efforts. I also thank the secretariat for their time and dedication. I recommend the report to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>28025</page.no><name role="metadata">Plibersek, Tanya, MP</name><name role="display">Ms PLIBERSEK</name><name.id>83M</name.id><electorate>Sydney</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>ââby leaveâI also rise to commend to the House the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit report: Report 399â<inline font-style="italic">Inquiry into the management and integrity of electronic information in the Commonwealth</inline>.

I do not think that any of us were experts in the area before we started, except for Senator Lundy. We all learnt a great deal not just from our witnesses but from Senator Lundy, who certainly has a great deal of expertise in this area. I want to thank the committee secretariat for all of their hard work.

I made the majority of my remarks on this bill prior to question time and simply seek now to summarise. In short, the Surveillance Devices Bill is an important bill before the chamber. I am pleased that it has Labor Party support, and I am pleased that, through Senate processes, there will in fact be further consultation in relation to it with law enforcement agencies, civil liberty groups and the like.</para></talk.start><para>As I stated at the outset of this particular debate, the reality is that this bill ensures that we can correct and make better the regulatory framework applying to the use of surveillance devices by pushing to one side the piecemeal approach that previously existed as a consequence of the various state and territory laws dealing with surveillance devices. This bill encapsulates a uniform approach to dealing with surveillance devices, insofar as it pertains to surveillance devices and matters involving criminals that have a federal jurisdiction.</para><para>As I said earlier, I would dearly like to see the member for Cunningham support this bill. It has the support of the Labor Party and the coalition. I would like to think that a bill such as this had the support of the Greens. It does ensure that there are adequate checks and balances put in place in those scenarios where perhaps eyebrows would be raisedâfor example, scenarios dealing with the urgent retrieval of children, evidence that was going to be disposed of or if the subject became aware that they were under surveillance. This bill ensures that adequate safeguards are in place.</para><para>I know that I can look parents et cetera on the Gold Coast in the eye and say to them that this bill does not overstep the mark. This bill does ensure that there are adequate safeguards in place. This is a good bill for empowering law enforcement agencies to undertake the kind of work that they need to do. It provides a national uniform approach when it deals with federal issues. I commend the bill to the House and I am grateful for both sides' support.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>28026</page.no><name role="metadata">Organ, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ORGAN</name><name.id>BNL</name.id><electorate>Cunningham</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI welcome the opportunity to speak on the <inline ref="R2010">Surveillance Devices Bill 2004 </inline>today. I am also happy to accommodate the member for Moncrieff in his interest in knowing exactly what the Greens' position is. I notice that, in his speech just before question time today, he raised some of those concerns and was wondering where we stood. He pointed out that, in the past, the Greens have objected to a lot of bills on the basis of infringement of civil rights. I say: thank God for that! That is something that we all should be mindful of when we are considering the passage of these bills through parliament. So I will make reference to civil rights and civil liberties issues as I speak to this bill. </para></talk.start><para>The Surveillance Devices Bill is a remarkably complicated piece of legislation. The Attorney-General has told us:</para><quote><para>This bill deals with Australia's law enforcement personnel and the means by which they strive to stay ahead of criminals. Our police forces rely on a variety of tools to investigate, catch and prosecute criminal groups which are becoming ever more organised and sophisticated.</para><para>One increasingly important tool is the use of surveillance devices.</para></quote><para>Surveillance has, of course, been an integral part of state institutions for hundreds of years. However, as the technology of surveillance becomes increasingly sophisticated, it becomes increasingly divorced from public and legal understanding and therefore increasingly divorced from control and scrutiny. It is that aspect which causes me some concern. I note that, in his second reading speech, the Attorney-General has specifically told us:</para><quote><para>This bill does not prohibit the use of surveillance devices, but rather establishes a structured process for the use of surveillance devices, where such use would ordinarily be prohibited under state or territory law.</para></quote><para>I note, for example, that many states have already passed laws banning or severely restricting the use of optical surveillance in the workplace. In Victoria an optical surveillance device cannot be used to record visually or observe a private activity to which the person is not a party without the express or implied consent of each party to the activity. So there is a lot of concern out there in the community about surveillance and its increasing imposition on our private lives.</para><para>The bill now before us seems to contain no such restrictions, even though it is implicit in the nature of optical surveillance that people other than the person named in a warrant issued under the proposed act would be observed. While a democracy may tolerate the need to use such equipment in certain circumstancesâand the member for Moncrieff, in his speech, has talked about child-kidnapping and other issues as some of those types of circumstancesâthose circumstances must be exceptional and highly controlled.</para><para>In my view the Surveillance Devices Bill fails in both of those tests. Clearly, Commonwealth offences which carry a maximum penalty of at least three years imprisonment would not be described as exceptional circumstances. As the President of the Australian Council of Civil Liberties has said, this covers nearly every offence except shoplifting. The provisions which allow warrants to be issued up to two working days after surveillance has commenced could not reasonably be considered highly controlled. The Council for Civil Liberties have concerns here as well. Their president said last week that, if police were allowed to use surveillance devices and seek a warrant after use, a special counsel should advise the issuing authority on whether the situation truly involved imminent danger. As the council's president, Terry O'Gorman, put it:</para><quote><para>A judicial warrant after the event is not going to undo a search that wasn't justified. The risk is that the so-called serious or imminent danger test, in practice over time, will be abused.</para></quote><para>Is that a risk we want to take? I do not think so. In a paper presented to the Fourth National Outlook Symposium on Crime in Australia, New Crimes or New Responses, in 2001, the federal Privacy Commissioner put it this way:</para><quote><para>... it is important to recognise that our individual privacy is an issue that is often taken for granted. Privacy is clearly perceived by Australians as a fundamental human right, and a right we are eager to preserve in a rapidly changing global environment.</para><para>As always, the challenge in the debate is to balance this important human right with our rights and responsibilities as members of a civil society. That is, the right to privacy must be balanced against factors that recognise the importance of ensuring government, businesses and law enforcement agencies are able to achieve their objectives in an efficient way. </para></quote><para>The fact that just three members are listed to speak on the Surveillance Devices Bill does not give me great confidence that we are really addressing this issue in detail. In that 2001 paper, the Privacy Commissioner, Malcolm Crompton, went on to say:</para><quote><para>Existing law enforcement strategies combined with new technologies or powers can add up to a powerful set of tools; the question is when and how to use them while respecting the values of the community including its privacy values. There are complex judgements to be made here that need to take account of the impact of the prevention or detection strategy on the community as well as its efficacy in dealing with law-breakers.</para></quote><para>That challenge of technology and privacy is a theme that he returned to when he addressed a Committee for Economic Development of Australia lunch in Melbourne recently. Mr Crompton said:</para><quote><para>We are entering a period where technology has the potential to change our lives fundamentally in ways we could never have imagined.</para><para>...	...	...</para><para>Given the nature of this change, one of the greatest values at risk will most definitely be privacy.</para></quote><para>Mr Crompton also said that, with the creation of new technologyâfor example, the tiny cameras that we see in most of our mobile phones nowadays, GPS tracking devices and personal identification systemsâthe protection of people's privacy would become even harder. I would suggest that most members of this place would be very much aware of privacy issues in this regard. Mr Crompton went on to say:</para><quote><para>In this context, I believe it becomes more important than ever for us to focus on creating a culture that respects privacy. Only by taking this approach can we ensure that privacy is in the minds of ideas people and technicians from the moment that an idea or a technological development is a twinkle in the eye.</para></quote><para>In his second reading speech, the Attorney-General told us that this bill began as an initiative of the Leaders Summit on Terrorism and Multijurisdictional Crime in April 2002. That summit set up a joint working group that would in turn develop:</para><quote><para>... comprehensive model laws to improve the effectiveness of cross-border criminal investigations in the areas of controlled operations, assumed identities, protection of witness identity and electronic surveillance. These model laws were released in a public discussion paper to solicit feedback from groups and individuals on the suitability of these proposed powers.</para></quote><para>But neither the Attorney-General's second reading speech nor the explanatory memorandum which he presented at the end of it disclose whether those model laws are this <inline ref="">Surveillance Devices Bill 2004</inline><inline ref="">, and </inline>nor do they disclose what the feedback is from the public discussion paper. I find those two omissions curious and concerning. I am not comfortable with the developments which this bill will bring about and I would greatly prefer that it be subjected to much closer scrutiny. I can only hope that such scrutiny will be applied in another place, and greater community input facilitated through that process. So it is welcoming to hear from the previous speaker and others that there will be Senate scrutiny of this bill and it will be put out to the public for consideration as well. I am sure that the Greens and members of the public will welcome the opportunity to give this bill further scrutiny.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>28028</page.no><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name><name.id>0J4</name.id><electorate>Berowra</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Attorney-General</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âin replyâI thank the member for Barton, the member for Moncrieff and the member for Cunningham for their contributions to this debate. I thank the member for Barton particularly for his indication of serious consideration of the elements raised in this bill, his indication of in-principle support and his indication that there will be a positive consideration of the issues before a committee to see whether there are matters that require further attention. That is as it should be. </para></talk.start><para>This bill is important for law enforcement in Australia. The <inline ref="R2010">Surveillance Devices Bill 2004</inline> is a vital tool in the fight against serious criminal activity, including terrorism. I say to the member for Cunningham that that is why this issue arose out of the leaders' summit in the context of the new environment in which we are operating. The surveillance device powers available to the Commonwealth today are inadequate and lag behind comparable powers already in a number of states. It is for this reason that the government proposes to implement the electronic surveillance model bill developed by the Commonwealth and state working group on national investigative powers. Let me make it clear that in my speech I said that this bill was tailored to the Commonwealth's purposes, and I think the member for Barton acknowledged that it is not a mirror copy. I make that clear to the member for Cunningham. That was not disguised. It was intended to be made quite clear in the speech that, where it needed be reviewed to more effectively achieve the purposes that we had outlined, that would occur.</para><para>This legislation will bring law enforcement surveillance device powers into the 21st century. We must never doubt that the criminal and terrorist organisations today make the very best use that they can of all the technology that money can buy. You have only got to look at Madrid and the use of mobile phonesâwho would have envisaged 20 years ago that technology could be used in this way? And I think I was an early user of mobile phones. The bill creates a legislative framework which covers the application for and use of surveillance device powers, regulates the use of surveillance device material and provides appropriate accountability measures.</para><para>It will broaden the surveillance device powers in two important respects. The range of devices which may be used will be expanded beyond listening devices, which may be only used to record spoken words, to also include types of devices, such as optical surveillance devices which may record visually or monitor activities, data surveillance devices which may record the input or output of information to or from a computer, and tracking devices which monitor the geographical location of an object or vehicle. The range of offences for which a surveillance device warrant may be obtained has been expanded to include any Commonwealth offence or state offence with a Commonwealth aspect that carries a maximum term of imprisonment of at least three years.</para><para>The bill provides that a warrant issued by a judge or a nominated AAT member must be sought for the most intrusive uses of surveillance devices. The bill makes it an offence to use or disclose information gathered or used relating to surveillance devices except in accordance with a limited set of exemptions. This set of exemptions is even more limited still when the information in question has been illegally or improperly obtained. Finally, the bill provides a powerful set of accountability measures. These include strong record-keeping and reporting requirements as well as strong powers for the Ombudsman, who is charged with ensuring compliance with this legislation.</para><para>The member for Cunningham raised one other matter, which I think was the circumstances in which it might be necessary to obtain a warrant outside of the arrangements for regular use of them. It is in a situation dealing with terrorism where there is imminent danger. The difficulty is one of balance in relation to these matters, and the member rightly makes that point. But I have to say that, if it is imminent danger which is going to possibly take the lives of very large numbers of people, I would not want to see delay in being able to pursue that matter because you had to dig out some special counsel to give you some further advice. </para><para>I recognise that there is always the opportunity for abuse in these matters if people come without the right motives. But one of the things I have found in the time that I have been in public life is that, while this abuse is possible in a small number of cases, in the great majority of cases reputable public servantsâpeople who serve in the national interest in organisations like the Australian Federal Police and some of the other agencies we haveâundertake their role in a professional way and would not want to see a power of this sort abused. But obviously if it were, and if it were to come to notice, it would have very significant implications not only for the status of the evidence obtained but also in disciplinary terms.</para><para>So I simply say to the honourable member that I think it is a question of getting the balance right. I am not encouraged to a view that we should abandon proposals of this sort, which we believe are clearly in the national interest, simply because some of those folk who have had long interests in civil liberties think that we can continue in this new environment in much the same way as we have over a long period. I am confident that the bill will allow Commonwealth law enforcement officers to use surveillance device powers to great effect in the war against crime, without infringing on the privacy of the great majority of law-abiding Australians. I commend the bill to the House and I hope that, with the cooperation of the Senate, it can obtain a speedy passage.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a second time. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>28030</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Mr RUDDOCK (BerowraâAttorney-General) (4.46 p.m.)âby leaveâI move:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a third time.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a third time.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>HEALTH AND AGEING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>28030</page.no><id.no>R1749</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>28030</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 11 March, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Ms Worth</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>upon which <inline font-weight="bold">Ms Gillard</inline> moved by way of amendment:</para><para>That all words after âThatâ be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</para><para>âwhilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the government for:</para><para>(1)	planning to cover up bulk billing figures by electorate until after the next election;</para><para>(2)	causing a bulk billing crisis;</para><para>(3)	trying to divert attention from its plans to destroy Medicare by introducing so-called `safety net' arrangements which will make 98% of Australians worse off and which will waste $72 million of precious health dollars on administration; and</para><para>(4)	consistently ignoring the advice of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee thus depriving many sick Austra-lians of affordable access to cost-effective medications while agreeing to a Free Trade Agreement with the USA which:</para><para>(a)	has the potential to undermine the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme over time through the establishment of an on going Australia/USA Medicines Working Group; </para><para>(b)	has ensured US Pharmaceutical comp-an-ies can challenge the decisions of the expert committees that advise govern-ment on PBS listing and price;  </para><para>(c)	may force changes to the current Australian blood plasma fractionation arrangements with consequences for the safety of blood products; and </para><para>(d)	may result in job losses in Australian firms which manufacture generic medicines as a result of changes to patents and intellectual property protectionâ.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>28031</page.no><name role="metadata">Mossfield, Frank, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MOSSFIELD</name><name.id>MK6</name.id><electorate>Greenway</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe <inline ref="R1749">Health and Ageing Legislation Amendment Bill 2003</inline> makes amendments to the various acts within the Health and Ageing portfolio and a minor consequential amendment to the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. In principle, we support the legislation, but I am also speaking in support of the amendment moved by the member for Lalor.</para></talk.start><para>The bill provides for membership of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, the PBAC, to be increased by up to four persons, from 11 to 15, to effectively increase the number of medical specialists on the committee, which has previously experienced a considerable increase in workload. The membership of the PBAC will consist of a chairperson and no fewer than 11 and no more than 15 other members.</para><para>These amendments also provide that no less than two-thirds of the total number of members be selected from nominations by the prescribed organisations. This is to ensure that the current ratio of the number of members nominated by external organisations to the number of members appointed by the minister be retained. There is a need for complete transparency in the functioning of the PBAC, which recommends which drugs attract subsidies, to avoid the potential controversy that occurred during the time that Michael Wooldridge was in charge of these things. This legislation does not address these concerns.</para><para>The Australian Consumers Association have indicated that they support the proposed increase in the committee's membership. The <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline> gives some background to the PBAC and details of this legislation. The PBAC aims to provide Australians with timely and affordable access to necessary and cost effective prescription medicines. The PBS was designed in 1948 by the Chifley Labor government and it is a credit to that government that it continues today in a similar form. It was designed to provide access for all Australians to a free list of life-saving medicines. Medicines must be approved for use in Australia and then assessed as being cost effective in order to be listed on the scheme. There are currently 2,500 medicines listed on the PBS.</para><para>The PBAC was established as an independent statutory body in 1954 to make recommendations and give advice to the minister about which drugs and medical preparations should be made available at reduced costs as a pharmaceutical benefit. No new drugs can be made available at reduced costs unless the committee has made such a recommendation. The committee is required by the act to consider the effectiveness and cost of a proposed benefit compared to alternative therapies. It recommends maximum quantities and repeats based on community usage and can also recommend restrictions as to where PBS subsidies are available. The committee also provides advice to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority regarding comparisons with alternatives and their cost effectiveness. The membership of the PBAC includes eight members selected from six interest groups or professions: consumers, health economists, general practitioners, clinical pharmacologists and medical specialists. At least one member must be selected from each of these groups.</para><para>The remaining four members, a third of the PBAC membership, are appointed by the minister, subject to them having qualifications and experience, in a field related to the functions of the PBAC that allows them to contribute in a meaningful way to its deliberations. The range of drugs and medications put forward to be considered by the PBAC is increasing in the complexity and range of intended benefits. The supporting medical information provided by manufacturers is expanding. </para><para>One such drug is glivec, which has recently been rejected by the PBAC but which medical professionals say can be used to treat rare and otherwise incurable forms of stomach cancer. The PBAC refused to fund glivec in its recent quarterly deliberations at the end of last year, but the PBAC chairman said that the committee was entering into a dialogue with oncologists on how to progress the issue. Professor John Zalcberg of Melbourne's Peter MacCallum Institute is quoted in an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> by Judith Robotham on 21 June last year, saying:</para><quote><para>I accept absolutely the right of government to ration health-care but they need to look patients in the eye and tell them, `We can't afford this' ... the clinical community has lost confidence in the [Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee] to be able to provide drugs like this.</para></quote><para>In the same article, Professor Zalcberg contrasted the glivec impasse with herceptin, an expensive drug that can give extra months of life to a breast cancer patient in the terminal stage of the disease. It was given public funding after a campaign by patient groups. Professor Zalcberg made the point that glivec saves lives:</para><quote><para>It doesn't just improve the symptoms and make people feel better ... It took a consumer advocacy group at the time of an election to change policy ... Glivec is even more dramatic in its impact yet it's been rejected three times.</para></quote><para>Clearly, the adequate assessment of new medications such as the drug that I have been mentioning requires detailed scrutiny by professionals with a deep understanding of the benefits of any new drug submitted by the manufacturer. There has been concern on the part of the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry about delays involved in the assessment process for drugs submitted for listing, as well as some industry concern about what has been described as a `lack of transparency' in how drugs are listed.</para><para>Concerns have been expressed about lengthy delays in listing a new diabetes drug on the PBS, despite the drug being recommended for inclusion by the government pricing advisory committee two years ago. The GlaxoSmithKline government affairs manager said:</para><quote><para>People look at Australia and say, `We don't quite understand why that hasn't happened,' and that makes them uneasy in terms of perception about increasing R&amp;D here.</para></quote><para>The additional membership of the PBAC should overcome delays in making these much needed drugs available to the general public and improve the transparency of the system. These amendments will also amend section 100 of the National Health Act to clarify that special supply arrangements can be used for the funding of particular medicines that are not available through the normal operation of the PBS. This is necessary when highly specialised drugs are required for the treatment of hospital in-patients with specific conditions.</para><para>The amendments also enable better arrangements for the reimbursement of a pharmacist in circumstances where the pharmacist has relocated without applying for approval and cannot lawfully be paid for any pharmaceutical benefit supplied from the unapproved premises, as well as enable an agent to make and sign an application for a PBS safety net concessional or entitlement card or for an additional or replacement card on behalf of an applicant where a person who has qualified for a card is unable to sign the application. </para><para>The value of the PBS to needy Australians can be seen quite clearly in figures produced in a research paper by the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling at the University of Canberra which show two-fifths of total PBS government outlays being directed to the poorest one-fifth of Australians. Older Australians receive far greater PBS benefits than younger Australians. The PBS affects the lives of most Australians, with an overwhelming majority consuming at least one prescribed pharmaceutical a yearâand of course many others consume many more. Some 30 per cent of all Australians living in families possess a concession card. Needy Australians therefore benefit from reduced prescription drug costs. Some other figures show that 11 per cent of total PBS government outlays are directed to women aged 75 years and over. Couples without children received 47 per cent of total PBS subsidies, reflecting the significance of the scheme to older retiree couples.</para><para>It is of concern that Australia's unique system for prescription medicines was under threat in the Australia-US free trade agreement negotiations. The US pharmaceutical industry was demanding that the cost of medicines be put on the table as part of the free trade agreement negotiations. The price of pharmaceuticals in the United States is more than three times the price of medicines in Australia, and the US drug companies wereâand still areâlobbying for higher prices for their products under the free trade agreement.</para><para>It has been reported in the media that US trade negotiators are considering ways to increase profit margins in Australia, with US drug companies complaining that our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme keeps the price of prescription medicines lower than in the US. With strong public and political opposition to any change to our PBS system, one way the US drug companies could increase their profits is to extend the patent life of both over-the-counter and prescription drugs in Australia. This would ensure low-cost competitors could not edge into the market share by selling cheaper generic drugs.</para><para>A 1996 Industry Commission report found that extending patents by five years would largely benefit American companies and cost Australian consumers up to $7.4 million. Lincoln Wright, writing in the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Herald Sun </inline>in Melbourne on 30 November, covered this point in a very informative article. He said:</para><quote><para>With the Government reluctant to change the PBS, the period of time a drug company could monopoliseâor patentâa drug is an alternative way to get higher drug prices.</para></quote><para>	...	...	...</para><quote><para>Australia Institute research shows that when a drug âcomes off' patent, allowing other companies to produce it cheaper, the price tends to fall by more than a third.</para></quote><para>Quoting Richard Dennis, a senior fellow at the Australia Institute, the article says:</para><quote><para>Extending patent laws was the next best thing to keep prices higher ...</para></quote><para>The article goes on:</para><quote><para>In two recent US free trade deals, with Chile and Singapore, Mr Dennis said patent laws had been toughened.

I believe the details of the free trade agreement are still murky at best. The DFAT fact sheets neglect to mention quite a deal of the fine print on this issue, such as the setting up of the medicines working group. What will they be working on if not future changes to the system? </para><para>The new appeals mechanism is also of long-term concern: will it become like the Land and Environment Court, which upholds the vast majority of appeals by property developers over the concerns of local councils, so much so that local councils no longer oppose any development for fear of losing ratepayers' money in the court? Is this the way it could go? Will this appeals mechanism, the details of which are still unknown, favour the US drug companies at the expense of Australian consumers? There are many questions that the government is yet to answer on the free trade agreement, and the proposals regarding the PBS are only a fraction of them.</para><para>In emphasising that point I refer to an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline>. The concerns that some industry people have about the free trade agreement is covered in this fairly informative article by Lisa Allen. It states:</para><quote><para>The top official of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme says that giving drug companies the right to appeal against decisions will place a greater burden on the bureaucracy.</para><para>Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee chairman Lloyd Sansom said the review process mandated under the United States free-trade deal would involve a flood of new work, taxing the resources of the body which recommends whether to include medicines on the subsidised PBS list.</para><para>âThe implementation of these things will require greater resources from sponsor drug companies and the government,â he said.</para><para>While the extra expense will perhaps be marginal compared with the $4.5 million cost of the subsidised medicines system, Professor [Sansom's] comments are a sign that he is concerned that drug companies might use the new review procedures aggressively to push for faster listings and higher prices for the new drugs. </para></quote><para>Appearing in the same article were some other comments from industry sources:</para><quote><para>Australian Consumers Association spokeswoman Nicola Ballenden said the review process would lead to higher drug prices and delays getting drugs to market because companies might try to stall the release of drugs if the PBS price was too low.</para><para>Australia Institute research fellow Richard Denniss said: âThere is no doubt there is going to be an adverse impact on the price of medicines under the FTA.</para><para>âThere's no point having an appeals process unless the drug companies are going to claim that they are not being paid enough.â</para><para>Mr Denniss also claimed that the FTA had opened up a âback doorâ to higher prices because of changes to patent laws.</para></quote><para>In conclusion, as I have indicated, I support the amendment moved by the member for Lalor.

I believe that there are some important issues covered in this piece of legislation and I find it rather disturbing that it has laid on the table in this House for over 12 months. It is interesting to see the priority that the government puts on issues of such importance, particularly the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, which is covered in this bill, and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.</para></talk.start><para>It is also interesting to note the tack that the government has taken when looking at the Pharmaceutical Benefits Schemeâthat is, it aims to increase the contribution by people in the Australian community rather than looking at the overall operation of the scheme. On the one hand, the government rushes into this House legislation to make Australian families and pensioners pay more for their medicines whilst, on the other hand, it has let this bill lay on the table for over 12 monthsâlegislation that should streamline the system and allow medicines to be assessed more quickly by the pharmaceutical board. This legislation, which will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, has been left on the table for over 12 months. </para><para>We on this side of the House support the major components of this bill but have moved an amendment which I will be speaking about shortly. Firstly, I would like to deal with issues that this legislation raises. As I have already indicated, the bill provides for the membership of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee to be increased by up to four persons, from 11 to 15, in order to cope more effectively with a substantially increased workload experienced by the minority of medical specialists on the committee.</para><para>It is interesting to note that last time this House focused on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee we were looking at political interferenceâI think I would have to call it thatâby the former health minister, Dr Wooldridge, who sought to change the composition and the balance of that committee by putting his political cronies on it. Professor Henry was an excellent member of the committee and had an outstanding knowledge. He was from the Hunter region, where part of the Shortland electorate lies. At that particular time, I was very disturbed that the then minister sought to interfere and to change the balance and operation of the committee.</para><para>Some questionable decisions were made by the minister following the changes. Medications such as celebrex were approved for listing on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Schedule, whereas previously the recommendation had been for it not to be listed. It always worries me and I always get a little uneasy when changes are made to committeesâparticularly the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committeeâby this government. In this instance, the Australian Consumers Association has indicated that it supports the increase in the membership of the committee, as it will enhance the ability of the committee to consider the listing of new pharmaceutical products, making their availability more timely and, therefore, benefiting the majority of Australians. We on this side of the House are about ensuring that Australians get the best of everything, including the best access to the medications they need. If new medicines are going to be of benefit to the Australian community, we would like to see them assessed quickly and listed as soon as possible.</para><para>This bill clarifies the scope of section 100 of the National Health Act 1953, which provides a mechanism to enable special distribution arrangements for medicines where the normal PBS supply arrangements are not convenient or efficient. This is a very positive change and we do not have a problem with it. The bill improves the arrangements for the reimbursement of pharmacists where they have relocated without applying for approvalâonce again, this is a streamlined and fairly minor change that makes it better for all partiesâallows an agent to sign an application for a PBS safety net concession card, entitlement card, additional or replacement card where the person who is entitled to use the card is unable to sign on their own behalfâthis is also a very sensible change that is included in this legislationâand clarifies whether or not the decision maker has the discretion to cancel or approve the supply of pharmaceutical benefits.</para><para>We on this side of the House believe changes in legislation are about making things function better for the Australian people. The changes that I just mentioned do that. These changes also simplify the claiming system. Where a service is provided as part of a Medical Purchaser Provider Agreement, the National Health Act 1953 requires that the provider of medical services forward all accounts to the health fund. If this provision is not complied with, the health fund is prevented from paying benefits in excess of 25 per cent of the MBS fee. This requirement creates an anomaly between the Medical Purchaser Provider Agreement arrangements and other gap cover arrangements, to the detriment of consumers. Given the rationale that I just stated, we will be supporting that change because we do not want to create problems for consumers. </para><para>This bill restores specialist recognition status for the purpose of ensuring access to Medicare benefits at the specialist rate, which corrects an unintended anomaly in earlier legislation. This change will ensure that Australians get the level of rebate they are entitled to and tidies up a consequence relating to overseas doctors.</para><para>I turn now to the amendment that has been moved to the legislation. Whilst supporting those parts of the legislation that I have already detailed, I think it is very important that we spend some time concentrating on this amendment. The first part of the amendment deals with plans to cover up bulk-billing figures by electorate until after the next election. This is an issue of great concern to me, particularly given that, in the Shortland electorate, which I represent in this parliament, the rate of bulk-billing had declined to 51.3 cent at the end of last yearâa decline of over 30 per cent since this government came to power. This means that 30 per cent fewer services in the Shortland electorate are being bulk-billed and that pensioners in Shortland will go to their doctors and find that they no longer bulk-bill. In fairness to the government, I must acknowledge that they have implemented their new MedicarePlus packageâand I emphasise `plus'âbut unfortunately that is not what it is seen as in the Shortland electorate.</para><para>In the Shortland electorate, very few doctors bulk-bill pensioners. Even fewer bulk-bill young people under the age of 16. They charge, and this is a very conservative figure, approximately $10 over the bulk-billing rate. A pensioner can go along and pay $10 to their doctor, the doctor will send their bill off to the Health Insurance Commission, the bill will come back to the pensioner, they will take it to the doctor and there is a $10 gap. The MedicarePlusâor, as we tend to call it, the `MedicareMinus'âpackage will only increase the rebate to the doctor by $5. So doctors in the Shortland electorate are not going to change their current practice of requiring pensioners to pay $10. Remember that I said that that is the mean difference in the rates? The gap can be as high as $25, though there are a couple of doctors who charge around the $5 fee. I will be surveying all the doctors in my electorate to see how many of them intend to take up this package.</para><para>This government has caused a real crisis in bulk-billing. The crisis is affecting the people of Australia, such as the pensioners who cannot afford to go to the doctor. For the benefit of those members on the other side of the House, I point out that I have had numerous phone calls to my office from pensioners who have self-medicatedâwho have decided that they cannot afford to go to the doctor. They have had to make the decision as to whether they are going to pay their electricity bill, put food on the table or go to the doctor. The safety net of $300 that has been put in place for those people means that a person has to visit the doctor 30 times a yearâworking on the average gap that is being charged by GPs in the Shortland electorateâbefore they reach the safety net. Unless that person is chronically ill, they will never reach that safety net. It shows that it is a sham. </para><para>This government has created a two-tier system. We are not surprised about that, because the Prime Minister has never been a supporter of Medicare. Right back in the 1980s, he stated very strongly to this parliament that Medicare was a sham and quagmire and that it should be disbanded and the sooner that happened the better. I see this as our Prime Minister following his planâhis plan to get rid of Medicare; his plan to destroy Medicare; his plan to disadvantage the majority of Australian people. This is a plan that is against the interests of the majority of Australian people. It is a plan to change our health system from one that gives universal coverage to a two-tiered system where the very wealthy can afford to get the best possible health care available and those people who are not quite so fortunate will find that they have to make decisions, like those pensioners who have contacted my office, as to whether they will go and see their doctor or put food on the table.</para><para>I will spend a little time on pharmaceuticals. I have already indicated that this government rushed into this House, with indecent haste, legislation to increase the price of pharmaceuticals and charge the pensioners and families of Australia extra money for vital medicines. Just as pensioners and families have had to decide whether they will visit doctors, pensioners and families have also had to decide whether they can afford to buy that vital medication that, in some cases, is lifesaving. I have heard of pensioners who have thought of rationing their medication. Instead of taking two tablets a day, they will take one tablet a day to make that medication last just a little longer.</para><para>On the one hand we have a government that rushes in, with indecent haste, legislation to make Australian pensioners and families pay more, and on the other hand we have a government that left this legislation sitting on the table of this parliament until it decided that it was worthwhile getting around to debating. It is hardly a government that really has the interests of the Australian people at heart. Legislation that would allow new medicines to be assessed more quickly has sat on the table for over 12 months, while legislation that would charge Australian people more for their medication was rushed into the House. It shows the agenda of the government. It shows its priorities. Charging and taxing the Australian people is more important than delivering vital pharmaceuticals to them.</para><para>The free trade agreement has raised some real concerns on this side of the House. We are quite concerned about how this will impact upon the affordability of medicines and the fact that we do not know enough at this stage about the ability of pharmaceutical companies to ask for a review. We like to think of things as being very open and transparent, and we feel that this has the potential to be decided behind closed doors. This will then have the potential to undermine the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme over time. This could happen through the establishment of an ongoing Australia-USA medicines working group.</para><para>We do not understand how that will work. It is something that I fear may end up pushing the interests of the big pharmaceutical companies and pushing the US interests, as opposed to the interests of Australian families and pensioners, Australian men and women that are out there struggling on limited budgets. We do not want a situation in Australia similar to the situation that exists in the US, where the price of pharmaceuticals is exorbitant and where some drugs are listed that should not be listed. Here in Australia we have got a very good, transparent process where the pharmaceutical advisory committee is accountable to the government, it gives information to the government and then the government acts on that information. It looks at new medications and it has kept the price of medications affordable in this country. There are also concerns about Australian blood plasma fractionation arrangements and the consequences for blood products. Here in Australia we have very high standards when it comes to blood products. I am also quite concerned about issues revolving around DNA.  </para><para>Most importantly, many Australians could lose their jobs if Australian firms are forced out of business because of changes that relate to the manufacture of generic medicines. This government needs to look to the interests of Australia and of Australian people and ensure that all Australians will get medication that they need at a price they can afford and not cater to its friends in the United States.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>28038</page.no><name role="metadata">Livermore, Kirsten, MP</name><name role="display">Ms LIVERMORE</name><name.id>83A</name.id><electorate>Capricornia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am pleased to have the opportunity to participate in this debate on the <inline ref="R1749">Health and Ageing Legislation Amendment Bill 2003</inline> and to raise in the House the important issues that this bill, and the second reading amendment moved by the shadow minister for health, put up for debate. This bill makes changes to a number of acts, including the National Health Act 1953 and related legislation within the Health and Ageing portfolio. </para></talk.start><para>One of the main outcomes of this bill is the increase in the size of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. The PBAC plays a key role in the operation of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, a crucial scheme that ensures that Australians have affordable access to the medicines they need. We on the Labor side of the House are very proud of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and the fact that it was an initiative of a Labor government, the Chifley Labor government, back in 1948. It is a scheme that we have stood by ever since as an essential part of the social safety net of this country. It just goes to show that when it comes to making access to health care equitable and affordable it has always been the Labor government that has delivered. The Labor Party have always used our terms in government to build a fair and accessible health care system in this country and we have then spent our time in opposition trying to protect the system from the inevitable attacks by the conservative parties. </para><para>The strength and sustainability of the PBS over its 50-year history is based largely on the rigorous and comprehensive listing process carried out by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, which recommends to the health minister what drugs should be included as a pharmaceutical benefit. Once a drug has been fully assessed by the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee and cleared for sale within Australia, the drugs manufacturer applies to the PBAC for listing on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The PBAC is an independent body with the responsibility to assess the effectiveness and cost of the drugs that are put forward to it and to advise the Minister for Health and Ageing as to whether the drugs should be listed on the PBS. No new drug can be listed as a pharmaceutical benefit without a decision by the PBAC that it is medically effective and cost-effective in comparison with alternative therapies.</para><para>Part 1 of the bill being debated amends section 100A of the National Health Act by allowing for an increase in the membership of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee by as many as four members. Currently the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee is made up of a chairperson and 11 members. The amendment contained in this bill provides for a PBAC of up to 16 members, including the chairperson. In the last parliament, when Michael Wooldridge was the health minister, we in the ALP had real concerns that he had designs on the make-up of the PBAC that could have undermined its independence. I am therefore pleased to see that the expansion of the PBAC foreshadowed by this bill will be on the basis of maintaining the same balance between those members nominated by external organisations representing the interests and expertise of consumers, health economists, practising community pharmacists, GPs, clinical pharmacologists and medical specialists and those suitably qualified members appointed by the minister. This bill requires that not less than two-thirds of the total number of members be selected from nominations of external groups.  </para><para>It seems from what the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing said in her second reading speech that this change to the PBAC's membership is about managing the increased workload and complexity of applications rather than any attempt by the government to manipulate its composition, and that certainly has the support of the Labor Party. In fact, the Labor Party have no problem with any of the fairly technical changes outlined in this bill. However, as the shadow minister indicated in the second reading amendment moved on 7 March, we have grave concerns about the threat posed to the security of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme as a whole by the free trade agreement that the Howard government signed with the United States. So far we have been given no detail on what the free trade agreement really means for the continued operation of the PBS, only bland assurances by the government that it will be okay: `Trust us, we're the government.' When it comes to the health of my constituents and their access to vital medicine, that is not good enough to me. Right now we just do not know the full implications of the deal for the PBS. There needs to be a thorough inquiry into the arrangements proposed by the free trade agreement and whether they have any ability either directly or indirectly to compromise the operation of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. </para><para>From what we have seen of the free trade agreement so far, there are real concerns about the very vague review process of Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee decisions that has been agreed to by the government. It is also not clear whether it leaves the door open for the direct advertising of drugs to consumers, which threatens to blow out the cost of the PBS, or whether the free trade agreement will allow for a weakening of the cost-effectiveness criteria currently applied by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee in its deliberations. These clauses have the potential to change significantly the operation of the PBS. When it comes to such a vital part of this country's health system and social safety net, the ALP is looking for a lot more detail and some guarantees that the government has not sold out the PBSâand the many Australians who rely on the affordable medication it providesâin its desperation to seal the deal with George Bush.</para><para>I would like to take the opportunity in this debate to raise a number of issues relating to the availability of health services in my electorate of Capricornia. The first concerns the town of Clermont in the Central Highlands region, where residents are becoming increasingly worried about the provision of aged care places to meet the demands of an elderly population. Clermont had a population of 3,262 people at the 2001 census. Of these, around 375 people are aged over 65, which I am told is well above the state average. Queensland Health indicate that by their records there are more than 150 patients aged over 75 years in the Clermont district. </para><para>There appears to be a growing trend for people to stay in Clermont beyond retirement age. People from rural properties outside the town, particularly, are frequently choosing to move into Clermont when they become elderly rather than relocate all the way to the coast. This is not surprising, as facilities in Clermont have improved. I have seen some significant changes in the seven years that I have been visiting the community. It is a very close-knit country town, and people naturally want to stay as they get older so that they remain in touch with friends and family and a community that cares about them.</para><para>This trend, however, is placing pressure on the aged care facilities that exist in Clermont, and action is required now before the baby boom generation retires and the situation reaches crisis point. There are a number of organisations and facilities in Clermont that provide a range of services to the elderly and frail aged residents of the town. Most of these services fall under the Clermont Multipurpose Health Service, which manages a 16-bed hospital; Montcler, a six-bed, high-care nursing home attached to the hospital; and Monash Lodge, a 16-bed aged care hostel. I am informed by the Minster for Ageing that there are also five community aged care packages in Clermont.</para><para>Monash Lodge is a terrific facility and it stands as testimony to the compassion and commitment of the Clermont community towards their aged residents. It is the result of a collaboration between the federal and state governments, the Belyando Shire Council, Blair Athol Coal and the RSL, who all contributed capital funding towards the cost of construction and fit-out of Monash Lodge. This funding supported the already substantial amount of money raised by the local community to ensure that their aged friends and relatives would no longer have to leave Clermont to seek appropriate care in Emerald or even further away in Mackay or Rockhampton. Monash Lodge opened its doors in 1990, and in 1994 it was included in the Clermont Multipurpose Health Service pilot program, which combined the resources of the town's existing health services under the auspices of Queensland Health's Moranbah Health Service District. The Monash Lodge committee continues to raise funds and advocate for improved aged care services in Clermont. For example, the Monash Lodge committee donated $132,000 towards the high-care nursing home, Montcler, when it was built in the late 1990s.</para><para>It was the members of the Monash Lodge committee who earlier this year brought to my attention the emerging crisis in aged care services in Clermont and in particular the shortage of residential aged care beds. The committee members know the problems but do not have the capacity themselves to expand the number of places at Monash Lodge. They do not receive the residents' contributions, so they cannot accumulate the necessary capital, and experience has shown that private investors will not take any interest in such a small project in a country town. The committee are therefore calling on the government to listen to their concerns and to help them meet the growing aged care needs of the Clermont community. I understand that the next multipurpose service agreement is being negotiated right now. It is important that the federal government understands exactly what is going on in Clermont when it comes to those negotiations and the funding that it will be asked to contribute.</para><para>It is obvious when I speak to people involved in the aged care and health sectors in Clermont that the current facilities are just not coping with the demand. For example, a local nurse commented to me earlier this year that the six beds in the high-care nursing home, Montcler, are always full. In addition, a community worker noted back in November last year that there were three elderly patients in the acute care section of the Clermont Hospital who should have been in either Montcler or Monash Lodge but there were no vacancies for those people. I also have a letter from the medical superintendent at the Clermont Hospital stating that a dementia patient recently spent two months in an acute bed in the hospital because there was no alternative. That kind of practice is bad for the patient because the facility is not appropriate for dealing with dementia, and it is bad for the hospital to have its acute beds taken up and unable to be used. I will quote further from the doctor's letter, which is contained in the community's submission seeking more aged care places. The doctor writes about the dementia patient being placed in the acute care part of the hospital: </para><quote><para>We also do not have any ability to confine such patients to their room or the hospital area. They do tend to wander from their room. This puts an enormous strain on our already stretched nursing staff trying to keep an eye out for them all the time. It also did happen that patients wandered out of the hospital at night and a search of the community had to be launched for hours in the dark.</para></quote><para>That highlights the unsustainability of placing dementia patients and other aged care patients in an acute care hospital situation and underscores the fact that we do need extra and more appropriate facilities in Clermont to deal with these demands.</para><para>Figures prepared by the Moranbah Health Service District in February this year back up the anecdotal evidence that I have picked up in my visits to the community. As of 13 February 2004 there were five Clermont residents who had been assessed by the aged care assessment team and who were waiting for an aged care place. A further six residents wished to take up a place in an aged care facility and were awaiting ACAT assessment. There were also two residents living in facilities elsewhere who would like a place in Clermont closer to their families if possible. A survey carried out by the Clermont Multipurpose Health Service committee, through the local newspaper, indicated that 39 people hope to enter a local aged care facility within the next five years.</para><para>The history of Monash Lodge demonstrates the willingness of the Clermont community to get in and make its own way, and the committee members have once again taken matters into their own hands. They have prepared a submission that has gone to many politicians, including the Minister for Ageing, asking for assistance to provide at least four extra beds at Monash Lodge to cater for the demand that I have just described to you. I know that the situation in Clermont has been brought to the attention of the Minister for Ageing. The Mayor, Peter Freeleagus, and the CEO of Belyando shire met with the minister last November to put Clermont's case for extra beds. I also wrote to the minister earlier this year asking for assistance for the community. So far the government's response has been non-committal.</para><para>I want to take this opportunity to place on the record my support for this project. I urge the government to look closely at what has been achieved already in the aged care sector in Clermont thanks to the dedication and initiative of the local people and the appropriate support from all levels of government. In closing, the ALP has already indicated its overall support for the bill being debated this evening. However, in the context of the health issues that still require attention in this country, I wanted to highlight to the House the situation in Clermont. The second reading amendment moved by our shadow minister also details the concerns that we have about the issues of bulk-billing and access to health services right across Australia, and those concerns are certainly current in my electorate of Capricornia. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>28042</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Byrne, Michelle, MP</name><name role="display">Ms O'BYRNE</name><name.id>84S</name.id><electorate>Bass</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAuthor Robert Orben once said, `Thanks to modern medicine we are no longer forced to endure prolonged disease, discomfort and wealth.'

It is a system that has become a great Australian institution and is an expression of the basic Australian value of looking after one another.

It has become a two-tiered system based on the ability to pay rather than based on need.</para></talk.start><para>The Prime Minister is on the record with his plan to destroy Medicare.

Even more recently he was quoted remembering fondly a time before Medicare when he said:</para><quote><para>I thought we had a very good system in the very early 1970s, before there were some changes made that I don't think it made it better, I think it made it worse.</para></quote><para>The Prime Minister was referring to the system before Medibank, the system that dominated the Prime Minister's culturally comforting period: the 1950s. It was a system that forced many Australian families to face the cruel choice between getting no treatment or paying to go to the doctor, a system where you even had to pay at a public hospital, a system where failure to pay medical bills could lead to bankruptcy or imprisonment and a system where charity was often the basis of the provision of medical care. That is the system that the Prime Minister would like Australia to return to.</para><para>Health and ageing are two of the most important issues in my electorate. Bass has one of the largest number of people per capita over the age of 65 in the country at around 66,000 people, representing approximately 14 per cent of the Tasmanian population. It is estimated that this number will increase by about 10,000 every five years for the next 30 years and will total approximately 22 per cent of the population by 2021. This demographic is serviced by one of the lowest levels of access to a bulk-billing doctor. As of September 2003 the bulk-billing rate in Bass in Tasmania had fallen to 41.5 per cent. That is a 9.2 per cent drop since 2000. In Launceston, the major town in my electorate, it is now impossible to find a doctor who bulk-bills and who is also taking on new patients.</para><para>For many people this means that the only option they have if a member of their family falls ill is to turn up at the casualty ward of the hospital, placing enormous strain on an already struggling hospital staff and resources. For many families and older people the cost constraints of seeking health care services can mean that they have to make a choice between going to the doctor or having enough money for food, heating or other essential living requirements. These families should never have to make decisions like this. The onus should never be on a parent to decide whether to feed their children or take them to the doctor. Older people should not have to feel as if they are a burden on society because they are ill. They should not have to suffer in silence because they cannot afford to go to the doctor.</para><para>Australia's universal health care system has been held up as an example of excellence around the world. Why would you want to destroy a system that has been proven to work for two decadesâa system that provides affordable health care to everyone and a system that is globally recognised as one of the best? The <inline ref="R1749">Health and Ageing Legislation Amendment Bill 2003</inline> seeks to make a number of amendments to various health and ageing acts, including several changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, one of the pillars of Medicare and an important part of providing access to universal health care and medicines for all Australians. </para><para>Some of these changes are positive, such as the increase in membership of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. However, some of them are of great concern, such as the proposed management of the appeals process for the PBAC under the free trade agreement. It seems the Minister for Health and Ageing and the Prime Minister are quite prepared to bow to United States pressure for the sake of this agreement rather than ensure that it is the best decision for Australians. This government has made some alarming health care decisions over the last eight years, and its refusal to fund all of the recommended vaccinations under the Australian Standard Vaccination Schedule is just one of many.</para><para>In September 2002, the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation advised the minister that it had added a number of new vaccines to the schedule. However, for the first time a federal government made the decision to not fund the whole suite of recommended vaccines. Among the vaccines left off is the vaccine for pneumococcal disease. This has meant that Australia is now short of vaccine stocks and leaves some families on waiting lists of up to four months, despite confirmation from the maker of the vaccine that it would honour a government contract but could not guarantee supply for a fluctuating private market.</para><para>The government's decision is leaving babies exposed to a disease that kills and seriously disables more Australians than meningococcal C, which the government has agreed to fund the vaccine for. In Tasmania in 2003 there were 86 cases of pneumococcal disease, an increase from 61 cases in 2001. Children under one year of age are at the highest risk of contracting the disease, and the fatality rate generally ranges from 10 to 30 per cent. The government must reassess this decision to ensure that all children have access to the vaccine. Parents should not have to decide whether they can pay the $400 to $600 to fully immunise their child or whether to take the risk that their child will be okay.</para><para>A couple of years ago the Treasurer made an incredible discovery: he discovered that all babies born post World War IIâfrequently known as the baby boomersâare getting older, that the population is ageing and that we now have to find solutions to the economic and social issues that this will create. He is a bright one! Since making his discovery, we have now seen two government discussion papers, but no solutions. We have heard a lot about how the government recognises the ageing population as a significant issue, but no real solutions. In Bass, the aged care industry is in utter crisis, with the industry itself estimating that 30 per cent of not-for-profit providers in Tasmania are running at a financial loss. But it is not just in Bass; this is happening right across the country. </para><para>Recently the Salvation Army, one of the larger not for-profit providers of aged care services, made the announcement that it could not continue to viably provide aged care services, so it decided to sell 15 of its 19 services. In Bass, the Salvation Army own Tyler Village, which provides 75 beds and 85 jobs. Whilst I do not believe there will be an issue in selling this particular facility, many of the residents, staff and families are very concerned. They are concerned because for these residents this is their home, and I think that is something that governments forget when they make decisions about aged care and aged care facilities. This is not a facility to these people; it is their home, it is where they live. They are happy there and they are happy under the auspices of the Salvation Army. They do not want particularly to have to undergo change in the style of management or to change the delivery of service. The Salvation Army have assured residents and staff of Tyler Village that an impending sale will not result in any significant changes, and I certainly hope that is the case. </para><para>The Salvos have done a tremendous job in the provision of aged care services over the years, and it is certainly a frightening sign of the times that one of the largest charitable organisations must sell off a whole section of its core services. However, the Salvation Army are not the only service selling their share of aged care services. In my electorate of Bass, the Seventh Day Adventist Church also found it was unable to afford to continue providing aged care services and has sold its service to the Presbyterian Church to manage. In recent discussions with aged care providers in Bass, as well as with unions, workers and residents about the aged care industry in the north-east of Tasmania, all stakeholders told me that there is a sense of desperation in aged care. They are telling me that the industry has been in a downward spiral since the federal government's reforms in 1997, and they are saying that the government has failed to keep aged care funding at a level that allows it to keep pace with the increases in costs of the provision of services.</para><para>In the <inline font-style="italic">Examiner</inline> newspaper recently the President of Aged Care Services Tasmania said that it was a matter of when, not if, aged care facilities were going to close, unless the issue of funding was addressed urgently. He said that the industry needed $10 per day per person to restore the current viability of providers and to ensure there was appropriate indexation and review processes to ensure adequacy of future funding levels. He also said that, while the government claims that they had increased funding for new beds by 80 per cent, the lack of capital funding meant that these new beds were not actually in existence.</para><para>This year's funding increase was less than one per cent for high-care places or nursing homes and 2.2 per cent for low-care places. How are providers expected to maintain a high level of aged care service when they are struggling so much? As much as 80 per cent of funding is spent on staff wagesâwages that are already significantly lower than they should be. This leaves a very small amount of money left over for the actual provision of service. Is this really how we should be treating the estimated seven per cent of older people that require care in an aged care facility?</para><para>These issues are of particular concern in rural and regional areas where there are limited service choices and where aged care facilities are really struggling to meet demands under their current budgets. Some areas are managing their aged care bed crisis by admitting acute aged care patients into hospital beds. This strategy is not sustainable and places a huge strain on the hospital system. It is also one of the less appropriate places for people to be in. In Tasmania, an average of 117 aged care patients per year are occupying hospital bedsâa strategy that is inappropriate for the environment of the patient as well as it taking up valuable beds in an overstretched hospital system. This approach also has a direct impact on health issues such as increased waiting times for elective surgery and hospital nursing staff doubling as aged care nurses.</para><para>The unnecessary burden placed on the hospitals and nursing staff is not a viable long-term solution to the lack of aged care beds. It is also not appropriate for aged care places to be taken up by younger persons, particularly younger persons with disabilities or palliative care needs and in need of residential care. Younger, severely ill or disabled people, incapacitated veterans and others in need of residential or respite care must be housed appropriately. They should not be taking up aged care places. It is not the best solution for them or for the aged people that they replace. </para><para>At the moment, the aged care planning ratio is 40 high-care places, 50 low-care places and 10 community aged care packages for every 1,000 people over the age of 70. Obviously, this ratio is in urgent need of review and can no longer be considered to be an effective measure for aged care funding in a society where the demographic is changing. It is also argued that this ratio is further outdated in the respect that generally people are opting to continue to live in their own homes for much longer and are accessing in-home services for extra support when necessary. That leads me to another key issue which has been raised with me by staff and families and that is the issue of access of waiting times, the number of beds available and the geographical location of aged care facilities. At present, waiting lists for many aged care services are long. Potential residents and their families are finding they have to face periods of uncertainty or lengthy waiting periods before they can be admitted into servicesâsometimes up to six months. This of course leads directly into the issue of the number of aged care beds provided in particular areas and where those beds might be needed most.</para><para>In northern Tasmania in June 2003 there was a shortage of 110 aged care beds with a further 80 phantom bedsâbeds that are paid for but not there yet. This is a large part of the overall state shortage which showed a shortage of 189 beds and 374 phantom beds for the whole of Tasmania. This is worrying, as often when it is identified that people need to move into an aged care service it means that they are unable to look after themselves in their homes any longer. It is not always possible to predict that in six months your parents, your partner or even you will require to move into the care of an aged care service. The requirement for such a move is often not the result of a condition or continued deterioration of health that develops over time but the result of something sudden such as a stroke or another medical emergency. The government has encouraged people to stay in their homes for as long as possible, and this is a good thing, but it means that when people require nursing home accommodation it is because it is no longer possible for them to live in their own homes. It also means that many more aged care residents are high care, which requires increased nursing assistance and increased funding. </para><para>This is a sentiment pointed out recently in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>, which reports that a national alliance has told the government that it must address the aged care funding crisis so we are able to properly look after the growing number of people with dementia, who obviously come into services as high care. It says that two-thirds of nursing home residents are high-care patients, with these statistics showing that by 2030 the number of people in the over-80 years age group at high risk of dementia will have increased by 200 per cent. The alliance has warned that the government has to come up with $600 million in capital and recurrent funding subsidies or it will face severe shortfalls in residential aged care services.</para><para>To properly manage aged care services, the government must start objectively looking at the current situation and start funding appropriately. The government has got to release the Hogan report so that we can start the dialogue about aged care funding. It is not good enough to spend $7.2 million on such a report and sit on it for so long because the recommendations are not what you politically want them to be. </para><para>The majority of people using aged care facilities are in fact now over 80 years of age and when they do eventually enter residential aged care services require more acute and specialised care, particularly for conditions such as dementia and Alzheimer's. These factors need to be reflected in future planning for aged care. Under the current 85-plus benchmark, it is estimated that in Tasmania by the year 2016 the number of places required will be 1,000 more than the number already existing.</para><para>Aged care is an issue that requires a cooperative approach between federal, state and local governments and private sector and non-government organisations. It requires an approach that starts with federal funding and reaches across the spectra to develop better ways of working with local authorities in the planning and development process. A cooperative approach to aged care requires an understanding of what the requirements will be and where they will be. This approach is necessary if we are to ensure that aged care services will be able to cope with the increasing demands expected over the next decade.</para><para>In Tasmania the need for services from all levels of government as well as non-government organisations is possibly of greater urgency than anywhere else in the country. Tasmania's population is older on average than the rest of the country. How we respond to the issues of provision of adequate aged care services will set a precedent for the rest of Australia. The Tasmanian state government has already made a commitment that it will work with the federal and local governments to improve services and shoulder its share of the responsibility for ensuring the welfare of older Tasmanians. However, to do this it is imperative that issues such as access to services and increasing demands on staff are addressed.</para><para>The Tasmanian state government last year announced its funding commitments for capital development, particularly in rural areas, as well as its planned upgrading of state residential facilities to meet the Commonwealth's 2008 certification deadline. All up, an allocation of $26 million has been committed by the state to meet these obligations. The federal government's current funding level for residential aged care is $4.517 million, with an extra $479 million for community and in-home services. The total budget for 2003-04 is approximately $6 billion. However, it is estimated that this budget is still underfunding the sector by approximately $393 million, particularly in light of the fact that the cost of the provision of aged care services has risen on average by 26 per cent over the last five years.</para><para>To address the funding needs for the aged care sector there needs to be a significant increase in funding and greater transparency in how that funding is distributed. A cooperative approach would also work in addressing the issue of those beds allocated but not actually availableâthe phantom beds I mentioned beforeâan issue that often comes out of local planning processes. Proposals to address this issue include a longer planning cycle that allows a projection of services for up to five years down the track. This would then allow beds to be allocated for a five-year period, giving providers an agreed timetable within which to deliver the services. Such an approach would provide a level of certainty for the aged care sector and ensure that beds are open for care when they are actually needed.</para><para>The physical location of aged care facilities is also a major issue, particularly in rural and regional areas. Already in Tasmania we have situations where for some people the only access to residential aged care services is many kilometres away. It is thought that for a residential aged care facility to be sustainable it needs to have 30 beds or more, but the reality is that for many regional communities it is just not possible to maintain an aged care facility of this size. A facility of 10 beds is more realistic. However, smaller facilities are difficult to establish and sustain, based on funding levels. Often the only option is for people to go to the closest residential facility, which is often suburbs away. This is unsatisfactory, because it removes the person from their established support networks, making it harder for families, ageing partners and friends to regularly visit. </para><para>All of these issues have a profound effect not only on the aged care services but also on aged care staff, particularly aged care nurses, who are leaving the sectorâan issue which is vitally important to the future of aged care services as there is already a chronic shortage of aged care nurses. Increased numbers of staff leaving the sector then places enormous pressure on existing staff. This of course further compounds the pressure leading to people leaving the profession. To manage this crisis there needs to be an urgent joint focus on improving the conditions and payâas well as education and training opportunitiesâfor nurses across the aged care sector. While the government has provided a significant amount of money in an attempt to address this matter, it unfortunately does not yet mean that the standard of conditions is met. Aged care nurses currently earn 17.1 per centâor $127.16 a weekâless than acute care nurses. We cannot realistically expect aged care nurses to work under increasing pressure for the amount of remuneration that they receive. There has to be action to ensure that aged care nurses are paid at least on par with acute care nurses.</para><para>In Tasmania the EBA offer to nurses from the aged care industry has been withdrawn after five months of negotiationsâa situation that may lead to further defections from the industry by aged care nurses. It is a problem that is recognised by the nurses and by the owners and managers of these facilities. They want to pay enough money so that they can afford the staff, but if they pay what they need to to attract the staff they will not be able to provide the service. They are in a terrible position. The response to Australia's ageing society needs to be a combined one where there is an increase in services and funding to meet the increasing needs. Australia cannot afford to get aged care policy and planning wrong.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Slipper</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (FAMILY LAW) BILL 2002</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>28047</page.no><id.no>R1717</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration of Senate Message</title><page.no>28047</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill returned from the Senate with amendments.</para><para>Ordered that the amendments be considered forthwith.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Senate's amendmentsâ</inline></para><quote><para>(1)	Clause 1, page 1 (line 6), after â<inline font-style="italic">Family Law</inline>â, insert â<inline font-style="italic">and Other Matters</inline>â.</para><para>(2)	Clause 2, page 2 (table item 1, cell at column 1), omit â4â, substitute â5â.</para><para>(3)	Clause 2, page 2 (at the end of the table), add:</para></quote><table pgwide="1" border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><tgroup><tbody><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>3.

This bill includes amendments to a number of acts that deal with superannuation arrangements for members of the Australian government civilian schemes and members of the Australian Defence Force schemes. Those superannuation arrangements are being amended as a consequence of the provisions of the Family Law Act 1975 and regulations under that act that allow for the splitting of superannuation on marriage breakdown. Under those arrangements, superannuation is now treated like the property of a marriage and is able to be divided as part of a property settlement. Separating parties or the Family Court are able to value a member's superannuation interest and make an agreement or order for the superannuation to be split.</para><para>The bill provides for a framework within the relevant scheme for dealing with such an agreement or order in relation to a scheme member. The framework enables a separate superannuation benefit account to be established for the member's former spouse where an agreement or order is issued in respect of the member's superannuation. The bill amends the relevant acts or allows ministerial orders to be made to provide for indexation of the former spouse's separate benefit before payment, the payment of that benefit and the reduction in the benefit paid to or in respect of the member. </para><para>Earlier today the Senate agreed to a number of government amendments to the bill. These amendments will include similar provisions in the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act 1948 to those that will apply to Australian government civilian schemes. This will allow a separate superannuation benefit to be established with a former spouse of a member of the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Scheme as a result of a splitting agreement or Family Court order. In addition, the Senate agreed to amendments that will provide for twice yearly indexation of pensions payable under the Defence Force's Retirement Benefits Act 1948, in line with similar arrangements already in place under the civilian and other Defence Force superannuation schemes. Amendments were also made to certain amending provisions contained in the bill in respect of the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1973 to correct minor technical drafting errors. On that basis, I commend the amendments to the House.  </para><para>Question agreed to. </para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>HEALTH AND AGEING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>28061</page.no><id.no>R1749</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>28061</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed. </para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>28061</page.no><name role="metadata">Griffin, Alan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GRIFFIN</name><name.id>VU5</name.id><electorate>Bruce</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe <inline ref="R1749">Health and Ageing Legislation Amendment Bill 2003</inline> makes amendments to various acts within the Health and Ageing portfolio and a minor consequential amendment to the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. Specifically, the bill puts in place provisions regarding the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Labor supports the provisions of the bill. Labor is a strong supporter of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The maintenance of the PBS, like Medicare, is central to Labor's health policy. Labor has always supported and will continue to support a system that provides equitable, affordable access to safe and cost-effective pharmaceuticals for all Australians. </para></talk.start><para>The bill will amend the composition of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee and provides for other minor amendments to the PBS, including that the determinations of forms, strengths and brands of PBS medicines and their maximum quantities will apply to the supply of pharmaceutical benefits by hospitals in the same way as they do to the pharmaceutical benefits supplied by pharmacies. The bill contains a number of provisions. I will focus on the amendments to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, pharmacists supplying benefits from as yet unapproved premises and PBS medicines from hospitals to meet the same standards that apply to pharmacists and medical practitioners. </para><para>The amendments in this bill increase the membership of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee from 11 to 15. These amendments will also provide that no fewer than two-thirds of the total number of members be selected by the prescribed organisations. Labor believes that the increase in members of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee will increase the efficiency of the committee when considering new medicines to be listed on the scheme. This view is shared by the Australian Consumers Association, which has indicated that it supports the increase in membership as it will enhance the ability of the committee to consider the listing of new pharmaceutical products in a timely way. </para><para>It is refreshing to be in agreement with the government for once on an issue relating to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. In 2001 Labor was at odds with the government regarding the PBAC. In 2001 Dr Wooldridge, then the Minister for Health and Aged Care, made the composition of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee a political issue. As health minister, Dr Wooldridge appointed an industry representative to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. Concerns were also raised in an article written by Chelsey Martin in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> on 15 June 2001 entitled `Drug scheme ``underminedâ':</para><quote><para>Two former members of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee yesterday revealed the deputy head of the Department of Health's pharmaceutical benefits branch, Mr Alan Stevens, had been replaced as the Government's price negotiator with drug companies by the minister's Departmental Liaison Officer, Mr Jamie Fox.  </para><para>The former PBAC head, Professor Don Burkett, and the former consumer representative, Mr Martyn Goddard, resigned from the drug subsidy advisory committee earlier in the year in protest at the appointment of an industry representative. </para><para>In a joint statement released yesterday, they claimed Mr Fox's appointment was âa further shift in the goalposts towards the interests of the industryâ. </para><para>âThese changes will further weaken the capacity of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme to ensure Australia receives value for money in its prescription pharmaceuticals and can be expected to add to costs with an effect on the scheme's long-term viability,â they said. </para></quote><para>Also, confidential documents of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee were leaked by a middle manager within the health department to the pharmaceutical industry in mid-2001. A press release from the then shadow minister for health states: </para><quote><para>âThe leaking of confidential Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) documents to the Pharmaceutical Industry by a `middle level manager' within the Health Department, detailed in today's Medical Observer, must be urgently investigated,â Shadow Minister for Health, Jenny Macklin said today. </para><para>âThis is very serious because PBAC deliberates in confidence about the price and volume of medicines proposed for listing on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) and the information should definitely not be given over to the pharmaceutical industry,â Ms Macklin said. </para><para>...	...	...</para><para>It appears that Dr  Wooldridge has known that the documents had been leaked for over a month, but he seems more interested in Professor Henry than investigating why a middle ranking departmental officer gave confidential PBAC documents to the pharmaceutical industry. </para></quote><para>Labor strongly opposed the actions of the health minister at the time. Labor strongly believes in the independence of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. It is therefore a welcome change to be in a situation today where we can say that this is a change which will hopefully enhance the operation of that committee rather than what we were dealing with in the last term with respect to the development of change on that committee.</para><para>The second issue I will focus on is pharmacists supplying benefits from as yet unapproved premises. Labor supports the provision of this bill to permit pharmacists to provide medicines, at a subsidy, which are listed under the PBS scheme, in cases where the pharmacists have relocated. Currently the subsidisation of medicines under the PBS and the subsequent reimbursements to the pharmacists could only be received if the pharmacies were approved. Labor supports this amendment as it will enable pharmacists to supply medicines under subsidy while approval is pending and obtain reimbursement once approval is granted. Labor believes that the Australian public will benefit from this amendment. Unlike now, consumers will be able to access subsidised medicines when the pharmacist is pending approval, as opposed to having to pay higher prices for medicines listed on the PBS, because the pharmacist has just moved to the pharmacy.</para><para>The third issue is PBS medicines from hospitals to meet the same standards that apply to pharmacists and medical practitioners. Labor supports the provision in the bill to ensure medicines listed under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme that are supplied in hospitals meet the standards which are applied to pharmacists and medical practitioners. This will mean that the forms and quantities of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme medicines supplied at the hospital will now have to adhere to those standards required for pharmacists and medical practitioners.  </para><para>I would now like to refer to a matter of importance that relates to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The recent free trade agreement between Australia and the United States has raised some unanswered questions regarding the future of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. In particular, Labor is concerned about the introduction of a new appeals process that reviews decisions of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. Labor is concerned with the impact that the new independent process will have upon the listing of drugs. Will the process have influence on which drugs are listed and at what prices? A number of people have raised criticism about this particular issue.</para><para>An article headed `US drug groups can appeal' in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial </inline><inline font-style="italic">Review</inline>, again of Tuesday, 10 February this year, states:</para><quote><para>Australian Consumers Association health policy officer Martyn Goddard said an appeals process would increase the cost of the PBS to the government and would be a âdisasterâ for the scheme.</para><para>âEvery decision a company doesn't like will now go off to appeal, with teams of lawyers.</para><para>âAustralian patients will have to wait months or years longer for access to new drugs, including drugs for conditions like HIV. The cost of the PBS will of course rise.â</para><para>As part of its free-trade agreement with the US, the Australian government has also promised to introduce âtransparent procedures into the marketing approval process for pharmaceutical products coming off-patentâ.</para><para>Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration may have to advise the patent holders of generic companies' interest in manufacturing their drugs years before patents expire.</para><para>The ACA's Mr Goddard said if major drug companies were warned of generic drug companies' intent they could tie them up in court for years.</para></quote><para>An article headed `Cost of subsidised drugs will rise: critics' in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> on 10 February states:</para><quote><para>Under the deal, drug companies have won the right to a review of decisions made by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committeeâthe independent expert group that evaluates the cost-effectiveness of new drugs.</para><para>The deal also sets up a joint Medicines Working Group, which will discuss further health policy changes. And the Australian Government will adopt an early warning system so companies that hold drug patents will be warned that another manufacturer is preparing to market a cheap generic alternative to their brand-name drug.</para><para>Australian Consumers Association health policy officer Martyn Goddard said the extra review process would give companies more influence in gaining lucrative subsidies.</para><para>âThe PBS listing process is founded on objective evidence of how well a drug works, but inevitably it is also a process of bargaining and negotiation,â he said.</para><para>âThe Government has just agreed to have one hand tied behind its back in its future negotiations with these very powerful foreign companies.â</para></quote><para>Stephen Duckett, a health economist and former head of the federal health department, also had quite a bit to say about this particular arrangement. In the same article, Mr Duckett said:</para><quote><para>... the drug companies had won a âthird bite at the cherryâ to lobby for taxpayer subsidies on drugs that might not stand up to evaluation.</para><para>âObviously the pharmaceutical manufacturers hope the appeals process will increase the number of drugs listed that haven't met the cost-effectiveness criteria, and that will mean a bigger burden on the taxpayer that is not economically justified.â</para></quote><para>Labor agrees that this text had to be released, as it has been, but we also believe that it has to be thoroughly scrutinised to determine the impact on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Labor will oppose any changes to the PBS arising from the trade deal that may increase the price of drugs in Australia. Labor will support this bill. We believe the provisions in the bill, which I have mentioned earlier, will improve the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and in particular the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, and therefore it is a welcome but small step forward. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>28064</page.no><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Dr EMERSON</name><name.id>83V</name.id><electorate>Rankin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe <inline ref="R1749">Health and Ageing Legislation Amendment Bill 2003</inline> before us provides for membership of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee to be increased by up to four persons, from 11 to 15, in order to cope more effectively with the increasing workload of the committee. Labor supports this bill. The medical specialists on the committee are experiencing a substantially increased workload and, as a consequence, the assessment and approval of pharmaceuticals is being delayed. With additional expert members to share that workload, the result for Australian consumers and the manufacturers of pharmaceuticals is that certainty and assessment times will be greatly improved. For the new products that meet our rigorous standards, approval will be granted more efficiently and the product can be on its way to the Australian people more quickly. For the products that do not meet the standards, manufacturers will be advised more quickly, allowing them to better manage their business and, if necessary, move more quickly to obtain further evidence in support of their application.</para></talk.start><para>I do welcome the fact that on this occasion the government has not sought to politicise the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, as it did seek to do so under a previous health minister, Dr Michael Wooldridge, which caused a furore at the time. We consider that the initiatives contained in this bill to increase the number of members of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee have been pursued in good faith. That is why we support these provisions.</para><para>However, I want to comment on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and its treatment in the proposed free trade agreement with the United States. That is an agreement that is anything but a free trade agreement, but today I want to concentrate on those provisions relating to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. When belatedly releasing the details of the trade deal with United States, the Australian government said that its agreement to establish a review process would have no impact on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and therefore on Australian users of pharmaceuticals. On the other hand, in the United States it was heralded as a very significant breakthrough. Both cannot be right. The Australian government and the US administration are interpreting the provisions relating to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme in the trade deal with the United States very differently: the Australian government saying it has not  conceded anything and the US administration welcoming the concessions that the Australian government has provided, on the basis that these are very real and meaningful concessions. Both cannot be right, and that is one reason amongst many why Labor has moved to establish a Senate references committee inquiry into the trade deal with the United States. We have signalled very strongly that we are very angry about any prospect of that trade deal creating a situation where Australian users of prescription medicines would face higher charges.</para><para>Let us hear the words of someone who is well versed in these issues. Professor Stephen Duckett, a health economist and, might I add, a former head of the federal health department, said that as a result of this trade deal the drug companies had won a `third bite at the cherry' to lobby for taxpayer subsidies on drugs that might not stand up to evaluation. He said: </para><quote><para>Obviously the pharmaceutical manufacturers hope the appeals process will increase the number of drugs listed that haven't met the cost-effectiveness criteria, and that will mean a bigger burden on the taxpayer that is not economically justified.</para></quote><para>We really need to get to the bottom of this, because the government has form. The government has form when it comes to circumstances where there is increased pressure on the budget in relation to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, and its form is to seek to pass on that increased pressure to users of pharmaceuticals in Australia. We know that, because there is a double dissolution bill in the Senate at this very moment, because the government had tried to increase the cost of pharmaceutical medicines by up to 30 per cent. Labor has opposed that consistently. We know that if the US administration is telling the truth in relation to the trade deal with the United States and this is indeed a breakthrough for United States drug companies, then the pressure that that creates on the budget will be relieved by this government, if it can do so, by increased pharmaceutical costs for Australian consumers. That is why we have set up the Senate inquiry: to find out who is telling the truth and get to the bottom of this review process.</para><para>Another provision in this legislation before us relates to simplified claiming processes. Where a medical service is provided as part of a medical purchaser provider agreement with a private health insurance fund, the National Health Act requires the medical service provider to forward all accounts to the fund. If this provision is not complied with, the health fund is prevented from paying benefits in excess of 25 per cent of the MBS fee. This requirement creates an anomaly between MPPA arrangements and other gap cover arrangements, to the detriment of consumers. The health fund is prohibited from extending coverage to any gap that may exist, and the member is left with an unexpected out-of-pocket expense. The bill removes this anomaly, and therefore Labor welcomes that provision.</para><para>While we are on the matter of private health insurance premiums, the habit of the current Minister for Health and Ageing is to get out the old rubber stamp and stamp any private health insurance premium increases that the private health insurance industry seeks. So much for the government seeking to curtail the cost of private health insurance to Australian consumers. That was its boast before the last election in a document described as <inline font-style="italic">Heading in the right direction ... securing Australia</inline><inline font-style="italic">'</inline><inline font-style="italic">s future</inline>. The government said this:</para><quote><para>The discouraging of `hit and run' membership of health funds will lead to reduced premiums over time and to the stabilisation of the private health insurance industry, thus taking pressure off Medicare and our public hospitals.</para></quote><para>That was an undertaking that the government gave before the last election. Has it met it? No, it has not, because the current health minister routinely rubber-stamps increases in private health insurance premiums to the detriment of Australian policyholders, but alsoâalways, consistentlyâto make the private health insurance industry happy to continue to support the coalition on any endeavours that it may wish to undertake. That is a very cosy arrangement. It is a cosy arrangement for the government; it is a cosy arrangement for the private health insurance industry, but it is not a cosy arrangement for those Australians who feel that they need to take out private health insurance coverâand that is most Australians, as a result of decisions that this government took.</para><para>Before the last election, the government promised that, as a result of the decisions they took, private health insurance premiums would not simply plateau or increase at a modest rate. In fact, they said that their decisions would lead to reduced premiums over time. Where are the reduced premiums, Minister? Put the rubber stamp away and put a bit of scrutiny and a bit of rigour into the private health insurance industry, instead of rubber-stamping it and saying, `Well, we've got this cosy arrangement between you and the coalition government.' </para><para>Who is going to lose as a result of that? It will be all those people who are in the situation of facing ever-rising health insurance premiums. I certainly would have expected the current minister for health to apply the same vigour to this portfolio that he did to his previous portfolio in workplace relations, where he was intent every day on trying to drive down the wages and working conditions of vulnerable Australians. However, when it comes to private health insurance premium rises, it is: `Where do I sign? Where's that rubber stamp?' He gets the old rubber stamp outâbang: `There you go, approved.' That is clearly yet another broken promise, a promise this government could never keep, a promise this government never wanted to keep.</para><para>So, while we support the simplified claiming arrangements because we see that as a modest improvementâand wherever Labor see legislation that improves the living standards of the Australian people, we will support itâthe government ought to see the big picture for private health insurance and try to ensure that there is some rigour in the assessment of claims for increasing premiums, instead of getting out the old rubber stamp and saying, `Where do I sign; where do I bang the stamp on the piece of paper?'</para><para>That is why I support the amendment moved by the shadow health minister. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is one of the pillars of Medicare, part of Labor's original vision to provide universal access to health care and medicines for all Australians regardless of their ability to pay. With improvements in pharmaceutical technology and the increasing cost of new pharmaceuticals, it is more important now than ever that ordinary Australians do not have to worry about whether they can afford the medicines that they need.</para><para>But this is the government's philosophy; it is the government's intentâit is the government's double dissolution bill. Despite two rejections in the Senate, this heartless government persists in its nefarious plan to increase PBS co-payments by up to 30 per cent for the whole population, including pensioners. The government's own figures show that Australian pensioners, concession card holders and families under financial pressure will go without almost 5Â½ million prescriptions for their essential medicines because they will not be able to afford the proposed increaseâand that is why Labor is blocking this bill in the Senate.</para><para>The fact is that the government should have been honest with the Australian people about this before the last election. They had an opportunity to be honest about it. The then health minister, Dr Wooldridge, was interviewed on <inline font-style="italic">Meet the Press</inline> on 3 June 2001, which was not very long before the last federal election. The question, about the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, was:</para><quote><para>How is this ... sustainable?</para></quote><para>The answer that Dr Wooldridge gave was:</para><quote><para>Well people were saying it was unsustainable at one billion dollars a year. It's going to be four point two billion next year and it is sustainable. If you have a look what was happening between 1992 and 1996. The PBS was going up seventeen and a half per cent a year.</para></quote><para>Here was the health minister before the last election, when the interviewer was questioning him about the sustainability of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, saying: </para><quote><para>It is sustainable.</para></quote><para>How very convenient, because not long after the last election the Treasurer discovered the <inline font-style="italic">Intergenerational Report</inline>. The <inline font-style="italic">Intergenerational Report</inline> is in fact quite an important document in mapping out some of the challenges for Australia over the next 40 years, but the only reason that the government commissioned the <inline font-style="italic">Intergenerational Report </inline>was to give them a pretext to increase the cost of pharmaceutical medicines for ordinary Australians. That is the reason they commissioned the <inline font-style="italic">Intergenerational Report</inline>.</para><para>That is the only use to which they put the <inline font-style="italic">Intergenerational Report</inline> that they commissioned after the election; yet not long before the election the health minister was saying the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme was sustainable. It was one story before the election, another story after the election. After the election the Treasurer said, `Oh, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is not sustainable and that's why we have to have 30 per cent increases in the cost of pharmaceutical medicines.' It is just a repetition of the government's pattern of saying one thing before the election and another thing after the election.</para><para>That is why we are opposing the legislationâthe double dissolution triggerâthat is in the Senate: the government could not have had two completely different views within months. So it either told the truth after the election or it told the truth before the election, but it could not have told the truth on both occasions. In fact, this government is constitutionally incapable of telling the truth, so the likelihood is that it was not telling the truth on either occasion.</para><para>I move on now to the issue of vaccines. Pneumococcal disease is an insidious and deadly disease. It is a disease that claims more lives and causes more injury than the better known meningococcal disease. On 5 September 2002, the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation advised the Minister for Health and Ageing of its recommendation that a number of new and updated vaccines be added to the Australian Standard Vaccination Schedule. Then, on 18 September 2003, the National Health and Medical Research Council met and endorsed the draft eighth edition of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Immunisation Handbook</inline>, including the advisory group's new recommendations.</para><para>Among those recommendations was the meningococcal C vaccine, which the government had already agreed to fund, but there were also other vaccines recommended, including the vaccine for pneumococcal disease. Pneumococcal disease causes a range of serious illnesses just like its better known relative, meningococcal disease. These illnesses include pneumonia, meningitis and septicaemia. It attacks both our youngest and our oldest citizens. In fact, although each case is less likely to be fatal than meningococcal disease, pneumococcal affects more and therefore kills more Australians each year, leaving other Australians permanently incapacitated.</para><para>Now, as a result of the government's rejection of the recommendations of the advisory group, families are placed in the unenviable position of looking at the immunisation schedule, hearing their GP recommend that the pneumococcal vaccine be administered, particularly to children, and then having to make a choice: `Do I take a risk with my children or do I meet other day-to-day expenses?' And, in many casesâcertainly in my electorateâpeople are struggling to meet those expenses.</para><para>This is the choice that ordinary Australians have to make. This is the choice that vulnerable Australians have to make. Meanwhile, the government spends $27 million on an advertising campaign supposedly in support of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. That campaign is basically about self-promotion and trying to soften up the Australian people to accept the bitter pill of this double dissolution triggerâincreases in the cost of pharmaceutical medicines by up to 30 per cent. </para><para>It is shameful that in this country a government could receive a recommendation from its advisory group in relation to pneumococcal disease and then say, `We can't afford to do it.' It brought down a budget surplus last year of $7,500 million. The cost of vaccinating all children for pneumococcal disease would be $100 million. That is $100 million compared with $7,500 million, yet the government says, `We can't afford to do it.' It does say, of course, that it can afford to spend $100 million on advertising to promote its re-election, which is what it has been doing, but it says that it cannot afford $100 million to ensure that Australian children are vaccinated against pneumococcal disease.</para><para>The government says that what it will do is ensure that those children who are at risk of contracting pneumococcal disease will be vaccinated. I say that all Australian children are at risk. How dare this government say that one child is at risk and another child is not at risk, or not at significant enough risk to be vaccinated against pneumococcal disease? In my own electorate a very young girl almost died of pneumococcal disease. Fortunately, she survivedâshe struggled throughâbut now she has development and vision impairments, all because this government has said it  will not fund pneumococcal vaccinations. Yet it said to politicians just a couple of weeks ago that it would provide pneumococcal vaccinations for all politicians. This government has the gall and double standards to say: `We will preside over a situation where young children can contract, be maimed by and die of pneumococcal disease, but we do not consider that they are sufficiently at risk to be vaccinated. But we will vaccinate all politicians.' That is a scandal of the Howard government.</para><para>I have said that I will not receive any vaccine for pneumococcal disease when the children of Australia are not protected against this disease. Here we have the government's double standards and hypocrisyâit says that it cannot afford to ensure that all young children in Australia are vaccinated against pneumococcal disease, but it will ensure that politicians are. Does this government have no shame at all that it would dare to suggest that it is right to vaccinate politicians for this disease but wrong to ensure that young kids in our society and our community are not vaccinated against this disease? I will not stop campaigning to get the government to change its decision on this pneumococcal disease vaccination. The only decent thing a government can do is to make sure that mothers and fathers do not have to choose between paying bills for electricity and other essential items and putting their kids at risk because they cannot afford almost $500 for pneumococcal vaccination.</para><para>This is a scandal in this country. I will do everything I can, as will the member for Corio and all other Labor members, to ensure that this scandal stops and that this disease is vaccinated against by a government that should ensure that all children receive this vaccination, not just politicians and so-called at-risk children. All children are at risk of this deadly disease. We will support this legislation, but it does give me the opportunity to point out the hypocrisy, double standards and gall of the government to say that politicians ought to be vaccinated but our children should stand in a situation where they are vulnerable to this deadly disease. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>28069</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Gavan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR</name><name.id>WU5</name.id><electorate>Corio</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI congratulate the member for Rankin on his contribution to this debate and what he had to say in the closing stages of his speech. The Howard government certainly can find almost $1 billion to fight a war in Iraq on the basis of a false premise, but it cannot find some basic moneys to protect Australian children against pneumococcal disease. As the honourable member for Rankin said, this is an absolute disgrace and it gives you an indication of the priorities of this government. </para></talk.start><para>I rise in this debate on the <inline ref="R1749">Health and Ageing Legislation Amendment Bill 2003</inline> to support the second reading amendment to this legislation moved by the shadow minister for health, and my next-door neighbour in electoral terms, the member for Lalor. The opposition will not oppose giving the bill a second reading, but we do condemn the government for causing a Medicare bulk-billing crisis in this country, for planning to cover up the bulk-billing figures by electorate until after the next election and for trying to divert attention from its plan to destroy Medicare by its so-called safety net arrangements, which will make 98 per cent of Australians worse off and waste some $72 million in administration costs into the bargain. I also support the sentiments expressed by the shadow minister in relation to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme in the second reading amendment. This scheme is most important to many families and pensioners in my electorate in Corio, who rely on access to the PBS for essential medicines when they are ill.</para><para>I think it is timely that I raise these matters in this House today, because tomorrow the Prime Minister visits Geelong as part of his frantic campaign to save his own political skin and that of the member for Corangamite, his good friend and colleague, at the next election. The Prime Minister knows what the Labor Party knowsâthat is, that the seat of Corangamite is poised at the moment on a political knife edge. The Prime Minister in his desperation now has to shore up the seat of his friend and colleague the member for Corangamite because things have gone so badly for the member for Bennelong, not only over the past week but also certainly over the past month.</para><para>The rabble that now constitutes the Victorian Liberal Party once regarded Corangamite as the jewel in its political crown. It can be of little comfort to the current member for Corangamite that the store of political capital that he enjoyed when he won the seat in 1993âor it may have been 1983âhas been unceremoniously squandered by the Prime Minister, who is well past his use-by date and now flays about in the Liberal seats that are exposed to his folly.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âOrder!

Let me say that when the Prime Minister arrives in Geelong tomorrow he should explain to the people in this region why health careâthe subject of this particular debate and this second reading amendmentâis in such a mess.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The Prime Minister must explain to many of my constituents who cannot access a GP why they cannot do so. The Prime Minister must explain to the electors of Corio why the bulk-billing rates have declined so significantlyâthat, of course, is the subject of the second reading amendment that has been moved by the shadow minister for health in this debate here this evening. The Prime Minister must explain to us tomorrow why the Howard government took $900 million out of the Medicare budget and created a crisis in the outpatients section of our great Geelong Hospital. The Prime Minister must also explain why residents have to queue up at the Geelong outpatients section for hours to get treatment. He must explain why, when they were in government, his colleagues in the state of Victoria sold off key parts of the Geelong Hospital to the private sector. He also must explain why many households in Geelong have had significant increases in their private health insurance premiums, when the Prime Minister promised that the government would contain those particular costs. The Prime Minister must explain why many pensioners are suffering because they cannot access appropriate dental care. The Prime Minister must explain why his health care legacy, which is the subject of the debate in this chamber tonight, in Geelong is a health care mess. </para><para>I am very pleased that the honourable member for Lalor has moved a second reading amendment in relation to the bulk-billing figures in the Geelong region and of course I want to relate to the Corio electorate my comments in relation to those figures. As we speak, the bulk-billing rates are about 66 per cent across the length and breadth of Australia. When Labor left office that level was some 80 per cent. In the seat of Corio in 2003 it was 57.9 per cent. We have had a significant decline in the bulk-billing rates, which has imposed a significant burden on working households in my electorate. Many families cannot access a bulk-billing GP, and the result is that they face an extra impost on the household budget.</para><para>My figures in the seat of Corio in Geelong are abominable, but how does the member for Corangamite feel? Just over the Barwon River, in the seat of Corangamite, those bulk-billing rates are now below 42 per cent. They are now at a level that is approximately half the level of the national rate that existed when Labor left office. I know that in the seat of Corangamiteâbecause I grew up there and I know it quite intimatelyâsome residents cannot even access a bulk-billing doctor. For example, in Colac, where I was born, peopleâwhatever their station in lifeâare not able to access a bulk-billing doctor. That is an appalling situation and, as I explained, the result of this is that households in Corangamite, Corio and the whole Geelong region have been short-changed in the whole area of health policy by this government.</para><para>The bill we are debating before the House makes several changes. The bill provides for membership of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee to be increased by up to four persons, from 11 to 15, in order to cope more effectively with the current situation whereby the minority of medical specialists on the committee have experienced a substantial increase in workload. This legislation also makes amendments in relation to simplified claiming, the recognition of specialists, and overseas doctors.</para><para>But it is the recent package of so-called reformsâthe `MedicareMinus' packageâthat the Minister for Health and Ageing introduced into this parliament that I would like to address my remarks to in the remaining time available to me in this debate. The Howard government, in its desperation, has allocated some $2.85 million in a blatant political attempt to buy back some support that it has lost in the Geelong region and elsewhere throughout Australia because of the Prime Minister's commitment to destroy Medicare. There are many people who would look at the actions of the Howard government, the Minister for Health and Ageing and the Prime Minister and the so-called safety net arrangements that they have put in place with this new package and say, `That seems to be a fair thing.' I say to those people: do not look at what the government does; look at what the Prime Minister says. That is the key to his attitude to Medicare. The Prime Minister wants to destroy itâthose are not my words; they are his. </para><para>He declared a long time ago in his political career that he would destroy Medicare. I do not think we ought to mince words on the floor of this parliament, especially when they have been used by the Prime Minister. I say to the House and to the people listening to this debate tonight that these are not my words; they are the words of the member for Bennelong, the Prime Ministerâhe said that one of his aims was to `stab Medicare in the stomach'. Those are the Prime Minister's words. Those are not the words of a Prime Minister dedicated to making this Medicare systemâthis universal health care systemâwork.</para><para>So, no matter what the Prime Minister says, no matter what he does, we know that, in his heart of hearts, the focus of what he does and what he says is the destruction of one of the great universal health care systems in the world. Medicare is a great Labor construction. It is something that we are proud of and it is something that we will defend. We will defend it in every electorate across the length and breadth of this country because it gives every Australian access to the health care that they need in times of crisis.</para><para>Many of us are quite healthy. Many of us really look after ourselves in the physical sense. We go out of our way to make sure that we eat the right food and do not subject ourselves to inordinate stress, and we are able to preserve a reasonably healthy lifestyle. But each one of us knows that at some point in time we may become, for whatever reason, diseased and unhealthy. And, at that time, we want to know that we have access to the best health care that can be provided by this great Australian nation. We want to know that when our children become sick they have immediate access to the best quality health care that can be provided in the land of plenty.</para><para>But, sadly, we know that there are many Australians who do not have that access. They are not able to access a bulk-billing doctor for their basic and primary health care needs. They are not able to get into a hospital and receive treatment. Every person in this House would know a constituent or have heard a story of somebody to whom the situation I am about to describe has occurred. Recently, in my own family, a 97-year-old person slipped and broke her hip. She went to the Geelong Hospital and had to lie there for seven hours before she got some treatment. If that is the kind of health care system that this government are proud of, then they will wear this particular health care record to their political graves. Now that the government have played catch-up with this piece of legislation, let me say that the people of the Corio electorate and the Corangamite electorate will not forget what has been done to the health care system in our area.</para><para>We now have a two-tiered safety net system operating. We now have a government that has unceremoniously backflipped on the issue of dental health care. The government is always playing catch-upâwe have seen it in the last couple of weeks of this sitting session. There is nothing more unceremonious in a political sense than seeing a weak and tired government without a third-term agenda and with a leader who continually backflips. It is really sad to see, but it is even sadder for the Australian population to see a government deliberately set out to destroy a great health care construction that is the envy of the world. Of course Medicare, at points along the way, will need amendment and revamping. There are things that can be done to improve it. But what the government has done and what the Prime Minister has done in his pledge `to stab Medicare in the stomach'âhis words not mineâis short-change the people of my electorate and put an economic burden upon them. </para><para>I support the second reading amendment that has been moved by the member for Lalor because we need to expose at every opportunity the hypocrisy that the government is now displaying with regard to health care in this country.

However, some amendments were passed in the Senate that now need to be considered. The government introduced amendments to clarify that the bill was intended to address potential security risks to the Australian communications industry and not risks that may be posed to individual users of the communications system. The government amendments preclude the Attorney-General from issuing a direction to a carrier or carriage service provider to cease supplying a carriage service to a particular person, particular persons or a particular class of persons. This picks up an issue raised by the Senate legislation committee, as well as a key concern of the opposition raised by that debate.</para><para>I welcome the fact that opposition and Democrat senators have supported the government amendments in the Senate. But in relation to those amendments proposed by Labor and the Democrats I have to say that the government considers that the amendments proposed by the opposition do not add to the objectives of the bill. The government therefore rejects them. The opposition proposed the inclusion of a sunset clause in the bill. The government does not support this amendment for the obvious reason that the security of Australia's telecommunications network is not a short-term issue. </para><para>The other amendments of the opposition remove the proposed changes to the definitions of `officer' and `senior officer' from the Telecommunications Act. The government opposes these amendments as it believes that the changes to the definitions are necessary to reflect current law enforcement management and operational structures. The government does not support the opposition's proposal for a mandatory review of this legislation, given that the bill itself is largely based on extensive reviews of communications interception arrangements. The government also opposes the Democrats' amendments which are unnecessary and do not enhance the operation or effectiveness of the bill.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âThe question is that amendments (1) to (3), (5) to (9) and (12) and (13) be disagreed to.</para></talk.start><para>Question agreed to.</para></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>28076</page.no><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name><name.id>0J4</name.id><electorate>Berowra</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Attorney-General</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI present the reasons for the House disagreeing to Senate amendments (1) to (3), (5) to (9) and (12) and (13), and I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the reasons be adopted.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>28076</page.no><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name><name.id>0J4</name.id><electorate>Berowra</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Attorney-General</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That Senate amendments (4), (10) and (11) be agreed to.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>28076</page.no><id.no>R1563</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration of Senate Message</title><page.no>28076</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Message received from the Senate returning the bill and acquainting the House that the Senate does not insist on its amendments disagreed by the House, and has agreed to the amendments made by the House in place of those amendments, with amendments to House amendments Nos 6, 7 and 8, and requests the concurrence of the House in the amendments made by the Senate to House amendments Nos 6, 7 and 8.</para><para>Ordered that the amendments be considered forthwith.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Senate's amendmentsâ</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">House of Representatives amendment (6) </inline></para><quote><para>	Schedule 1, item 162, page 35 (line 19), omit paragraph (c), substitute:</para></quote><para>	(c)	a police officer;

These amendments will require the prescribing of organisations established or continued in existence for a public purpose under a Commonwealth law before employees of such organisations can be appointed as quarantine officers. Some concern was expressed in the Senate about a lack of consultation in relation to the selection of organisations. Commonsense dictates, however, that before any employee of another organisation is appointed as a quarantine officer there would be consultation, with an agreement between the organisation and the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, to ensure that the employee can be made available for any quarantine functions. The amendments will enable parliamentary scrutiny of the types of organisations that are selected for prescription, while providing the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service with the flexibility it needs to draw on extra resources when necessary to protect Australia's vast border.</para><para>The government has decided to accept the amendments, but I hope that when the regulations proposing those organisations from which AQIS can draw quarantine officers come before the parliament we will not see the union movement hamstringing Australia's quarantine response. It is certainly important that we have the necessary flexibility to enable these officers to be appointed and to ensure that decisions are made in the best interests of the Quarantine and Inspection Service. There is no doubt that the Labor Party's policy on this issue has simply been driven by the union masters, and it is important that there be no compromise on our quarantine just to suit the will and the whims of the various unions. I commend the amendments to the House. It is not the government's preferred course of action, but it will enable the majority of the proposals and the intention of the bill to proceed.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âThe question is that amendments made by the Senate to amendments Nos (6), (7) and (8) made by the House be agreed to.</para></talk.start><para>Question agreed to.</para></interjection></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>KYOTO PROTOCOL RATIFICATION BILL 2003 [NO. 2]</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>28077</page.no><id.no>S399</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>28077</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill received from the Senate, and read a first time.</para><para>Ordered that the second reading be made an order of the day at the next sitting.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (EXTENSION OF TIME LIMITS) BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>28077</page.no><id.no>R1888</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration of Senate Message</title><page.no>28077</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Message received from the Senate returning the bill and acquainting the House that the Senate does not insist upon its amendments disagreed to by the House of Representatives. </para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>28078</page.no></debateinfo><para>Mr TRUSS (Wide BayâMinister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (7.09 p.m.)âI move:</para><motion><para>That the House do now adjourn.</para></motion><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health and Ageing Legislation Amendment Bill 2003</title><page.no>28078</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>28078</page.no><name role="metadata">Crosio, Janice, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs CROSIO</name><name.id>7T4</name.id><electorate>Prospect</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn indulgence, I am asking to have certain things recorded in the House.

The fact that the federal government has completely failed on this issue will haunt their term of government for decades to come. The CSIRO has said that average global annual emissions over the past decade were 13.3 billion tonnes, but its latest figures show that 18.7 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide were released into the atmosphere in 2002 and 17.1 billion tonnes were released last year. This level of annual increase in emissions could lead to a faster than expected jump in the Earth's temperatures.</para></talk.start><para>Almost every other equivalent nation on the planet has signed the Kyoto protocolânot because it will fix global warming but because it is the first small step towards reversing the pollution of the atmosphere. That pollution will lead to massive social, environmental and economic dislocation in the coming centuries if we do not do something. The following examples demonstrate the impacts of recent weather and climate change. Although it is impossible to precisely link individual catastrophes to global warming, the frequency and intensity of these kinds of events is projected to increase as the world warms. In August last year a heatwave hit Europe and led to as many as 15,000 deathsâmostly amongst the elderlyâin France alone, where temperatures hit 40 degrees Celsius. Just last week we heard reports of the first-ever cyclone off the Argentine coast. Germany received as much rain as it normally gets in a year in less than two days in August of last year, and the resulting  floods killed at least 108 people in Europe and forced 450,000 people to evacuate.</para><para>Weather related disasters, including floods, droughts and windstorms, are growing in frequency and intensity. Since 1980, 10,868 weather related disasters have caused more than 575,000 deaths and have forced many more people to flee their homes. In 2002, economic losses to homes, businesses and crops from weather disasters approached $53 billion worldwideâa 93 per cent increase over 2001 losses. It is predicted that by the year 2050 megacatastrophes, which used to appear every 100 years, will occur every 25 years. </para><para>There has been a lot of anguish in international discussion amongst the major pollutersâthe Western developed countries. Unfortunately, during the term of this government Australia has gone to the forefront as the worst per capita greenhouse gas emitter on the face of the planet. The Minister for the Environment and Heritage and the government, I would assume, recognise and have taken heed of the CSIRO's warning that a 60 per cent reduction in global warming gases by mid-century is a minimum if we are not going to have the most disastrous destruction of the world's environment since the extinction of the dinosaurs. The world is rapidly warming. The news coming from scientists around the planet is not getting more reassuring but more alarming. I therefore am relieved that at least the state and territory governments around this country have the foresight to take some action on this very important issue.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Casey Electorate: Croydon and Lilydale Community</title><page.no>28080</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>28081</page.no><name role="metadata">Smith, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANTHONY SMITH</name><name.id>00APG</name.id><electorate>Casey</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI wish to pay tribute to the work of three great stalwarts from the Croydon and Lilydale community in the electorate of Casey: Neil Gryst, Ken Gibbons and Eric Dosser. Neil Gryst has recently retired as secretary of the Croydon RSL, having served in that position and in other roles within the RSL for many years. Neil is a great community person who is always looking out for the welfare of others. So too is Ken Gibbons, who has just completed his term as president of the RSL sub-branch in Croydon. Both men have served our nation with honour in times of need, and both continue to do so at the local community level in Croydon. Neil's longstanding service was acknowledged through the awarding of a Centenary Medal last year.  </para></talk.start><para>In a similar way, Eric Dosser has also served the veteran community in Lilydale and in the wider Yarra Valley. In recent times, he has been president of the Lilydale RSL, making a great contribution to many of the ex-servicemen thereâwhether making sure that the facilities at the RSL were up to date or ensuring that veterans from Melbourne's outer east and the gateway into the Yarra Valley got all the help they needed. Eric has been a key contributor and a friend to many. As the sub-branch president, he was instrumental in establishing the Yarra Valley Ex-Services Support Centre, which runs totally on volunteer effort and the help of many of the other local veterans and their families. Eric was also awarded a Centenary Medal and continues to work tirelessly on behalf of the community.</para><para>In recent years, these three men have had key roles in organising and running Anzac Day and Remembrance Day ceremonies. Both ceremonies at Croydon and Lilydale are increasingly well attended by hundreds of local residents. It is a credit to them that the Lilydale and Croydon ceremonies have featured a wide array of participants, including large numbers of young people from local schools and youth organisations. Around our nation the Anzac spirit lives on. It is pleasing to know that younger generations have a growing understanding of the sacrifices made by those who served our nation. In our area, this pleasing trend is growing because of the efforts of people like Neil, Eric and Ken. Meeting and knowing them and having an understanding of what drives them shows in a very clear way the strong community spirit that exists throughout the suburbs and townships of Melbourne's outer east and Yarra Valley.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Taxation: Business Activity Statement</title><page.no>28081</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>28081</page.no><name role="metadata">Sercombe, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SERCOMBE</name><name.id>QK6</name.id><electorate>Maribyrnong</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI think all members would be aware of the difficulty small businessesâand particularly, I suppose, microbusinessesâface in achieving compliance with GST requirements, particularly the work involved with the preparation of the BAS, which takes small business people away from the vital functions of putting in the often very long hours involved in running their businesses.

In the question and answer section of the ATO's circular they give the following examples:</para><quote><para>If bookkeepers don't charge a separate fee for BAS preparation, are they allowed to prepare a BAS as part of a total bookkeeping serve? </para></quote><para>The answer is noâthey cannot. The next question is:</para><quote><para>If bookkeepers don't charge a fee for BAS preparation, are they allowed to show a client how to prepare a BAS as part of a total bookkeeping service? </para></quote><para>Again the answer is no. This is going to impose extraordinary additional difficulties on small businesses in this important activity. It is also going to put a significant number of peopleâmainly more experienced womenâout of economic activity because they are not going to be able to earn a dollar for those services.</para><para>One understands that there are some areas where care needs to be taken. For example, it would be quite improper for a person unqualified in a professional sense to make representations to a potential client that they have got a qualification. It is similarly important for clients to understand that, with the sort of arrangement that has existed in the very small business sector, the businessperson themselves needs to be signing the statement and accepting full responsibility for the preparation of the statement. But, as I said, the difficulty in getting access to professional advice and the cost of it means that things are going to be much harder for small business. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Employment: Mature Age Workers</title><page.no>28082</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>28082</page.no><name role="metadata">Lindsay, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LINDSAY</name><name.id>HK6</name.id><electorate>Herbert</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want parliament to understand that I was angry yesterday when I saw a postcard entitled `Why mature age workers?' It was a postcard that was promoting the employment of older Australians, but it sends the wrong message. By the use of the words `mature age', it indicates that these are people who are at the end of their working life. What it should say is `Why experienced workers?' People over 45 or so, who are generally considered in this category, bring wide-ranging experience and skills to any business that employs them. They relate well to customers of all agesâand I think we all understand that. They have less absenteeism, fewer accidents and are a steadying influence on younger workers. They are enthusiastic, they welcome training, and they adapt well to new technologies. In short, an experienced worker is the perfect employee. </para></talk.start><para>In my particular area in Townsville, where tourism is a very significant industry, there are huge opportunities for experienced workers. I ask Townsville and Thuringowa locals to consider the tourism industry. In Australia, one employee in 10 is employed in tourism or in related industries. It is a huge job market. Currently there are 325,000 jobs available Australia wide in the tourism industry. Experienced workers are best able to meet the requirements of the tourism industry, and I encourage Townsville's experienced workers to apply for jobs, to look for some extra training that is available, and to join that industry because there are opportunities that suit both the employee and the employer. Often in the tourism industry, you can make an arrangement with your employer that you work hours that are not the normal nine to five, because they happen to suit both the employer and the employee. It is a good outcome for everybody. I ask the departments responsible for the usage of the words `mature age' to say what they really are and change those words to `experienced workers'. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health: Food Additives</title><page.no>28083</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>28083</page.no><name role="metadata">Griffin, Alan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GRIFFIN</name><name.id>VU5</name.id><electorate>Bruce</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThere has been some publicity in recent times regarding nitrofurans. It first came up in newspapers and also on the program <inline font-style="italic">Today Tonight</inline>. More recently, nitrofurans have again been in the media. The government must act to rebuild consumer confidence as a result of concerns about the safety of imported prawns and honey.</para></talk.start><para>For the past two years, any food product containing a traceable amount of nitrofuransâa carcinogenic antibiotic used in some overseas farming practicesâhas been banned from entering the European Union and North America. Australia, technically, has a zero tolerance of nitrofurans in food, and it is illegal to import any food product containing a detectible amount of this antibiotic. However, the food agency which is charged with enforcing this zero tolerance, Food Standards Australia New Zealand, is out of step with the rest of the world by claiming that low levels of nitrofurans do not pose a health risk and by not acting to deal with this issue. The problem with this claim is that consumer confidence in Australian producers and manufacturers of products linked to imported foods containing nitrofurans, such as honey and prawns, may suffer as a result of the government's tardiness in ensuring that a proper testing and enforcement regime is in place.</para><para>The government must act immediately to ensure that FSANZ's scientific evidence, which has led them to claim that low levels of nitrofurans are safe, is peer reviewed. If the Europeans and Americans are banning food products containing nitrofuran and we are not, the right thing to do is to have FSANZ's evidence peer reviewed, as this is a fundamental tenet of good science.</para><para>The second thing the government needs to do is explain how an antibiotic found in food products can be illegal but little or no action is taken to prevent its entry into Australia. If a food product is deemed illegal and there are potential public health and safety risks, that product should be refused entry or withdrawn from supermarket shelves so that consumers are not exposed to any potential harm. I am gravely concerned about having imported prawns, honey or any other product with this antibiotic in it on our shelves.</para><para>Even though FSANZ are saying that low levels of nitrofurans are not dangerous, products containing nitrofurans are illegal. It should be black and white when it comes to food safety and protecting consumers: if it is illegal it should not be sold here. It is fundamentally important that we ensure that consumers are not put off buying Australian foods such as prawns and honey because of the concerns about their imported counterparts. The last thing we want is a lack of consumer confidence in our seafood and honey industries. So I stress: when we are talking about nitrofurans, we are only talking about products imported from parts of Asia and Argentina.</para><para>The government has failed to prevent imported food products containing nitrofurans being sold in Australia, despite stringent bans overseas. So I call on the minister responsible to make sure that FSANZ's claims are peer reviewed. I also call on the government to instigate more rigorous testing of imported food products in order to protect both consumers and Australian food manufacturers. More needs to be done on this issue, and this government has to start doing it. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Cowper Electorate: Dorrigo Dramatic Club</title><page.no>28084</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>28084</page.no><name role="metadata">Hartsuyker, Luke, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HARTSUYKER</name><name.id>00AMM</name.id><electorate>Cowper</electorate><party>NATS</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>â<inline font-style="italic">Summer of the Seventeenth Doll</inline>, by Ray Lawler, is a key work in the history of Australian theatre and has been drawing audiences since its Australian premiere in 1955. On Saturday I had the pleasure to attend a performance of this play by the Dorrigo Dramatic Club. The production, directed by Gwynneth Denner, is a credit to this small but dedicated production company.</para></talk.start><para>The play deals with mateship, loyalty and change and is brought to life by a cast of local actors. The cane cuttersâBarney Ibbot, played by Leo Bradney-George, and Roo Webber, played by Wayne Burleyâtravel to Melbourne from the cane fields for the annual lay-off over the summer months, as they have done for many years. Lisa Rogers, who plays Olive Leech, and Dina Luciani, who plays Pearl Cunningham, also bring the show to life. Bubba Ryan, Emma Leech and Johnnie Dowd, played by Jennie Clayton, Francis Aylott and Liam Pastro respectively, complete the cast and provide for a very entertaining evening of drama.</para><para>Like all productions, much work goes on behind the scenes and I would like to commend the work of stage manager Monica Sala, and production manager and lighting operator Bob Denner. Sound assistance was provided by Peter Munro, wardrobe by Cass Heness and set construction by Mick Fawcett and Bob Denner. Poster design was by Caitlyn Streets-Hanby and Mary Kell was assistant to the director. This production had widespread community support, with the CWA craft group and the Uniting Church meet and greet group assisting in making some of the props for the production. The season commenced in the old Gazette Theatre in Dorrigo on 13 March and concludes on 2 April.</para><para>The Dorrigo Dramatic Club also supports very young actors and Dorrigo Young Drama, which meets at 10 a.m. on Saturdays during the school term. Dorrigo Young Drama is for children aged between seven and 14.</para><para>As I have said, the production at the theatre is one that is very much a community effort; the theatre oozes with charm; and it has been basically done completely with volunteer labour. In our area we depend very much on tourism. To have great beaches and a great environment is only part of the total tourism experience. Our region has a very important focus on culture and the arts to complete a total tourism experience. It is pleasing to see the Dorrigo Dramatic Club playing their role in enhancing culture in our region, increasing enjoyment for the people of Dorrigo and for tourists in the area who may wish to see a very fine local production. If we can allow tourists to stay one extra night it greatly increases employment and greatly increases wealth in our area.

It is really a welcome development in this area. In the community a lot of concern is expressed over our classification system. I believe we have a very good classification system. Certainly if you look around the world you will see that we are lucky that our classifications are largely well understood and adhered to.</para></talk.start><para>The bill before us today will bring into line the classification systems that apply to films and to computer games. It is going to be a very useful tool, particularly for parents who are keen to ensure that they exercise some control and guidance over their children and the sorts of material their children will be using. It is difficult for parents to ascertain what level of violence, sexually explicit material or other sorts of matters that come within our classification systems are in computer games in particular, and we are in a world where they are changing quickly. This is raised with all of us every now and again when we are in the community and in our electorate offices. It is welcome that this bill seeks to make the classifications in the film area, which are perhaps better understood, apply consistently to video games. </para><para>The major change deals with making `a more effective distinction' between the advisory classification types G, PG and M and those where a legally enforceable restriction applies: MA15+, R18+ and X18+. I think that the reference to age in the legally enforceable classifications gives parents some sort of guidance. It makes clear to children and young adults what is appropriate for them to view and gives a little bit of consistency so that people do not have to understand what the classification categories mean for video games as opposed to what they mean in the film area.</para><para>I had a discussion with a colleague of mine yesterday about this billâshe has a child who is 14. She said it would be the most effective thing to be able to say, when telling him he cannot see a film that he wants to go and see, `You know, if you go to the cinema they'll ask you for your identification or your age and you won't be allowed to go in.' She said she did not have that confidence with video games and so was very pleased that this bill would ensure that a restriction would apply to some of the potentially damaging materials that most people in the community would prefer to see mature adults dealing with rather than young children. She said that having a legally enforceable cut-off point in some of these categories would be useful to parents as a way of encouraging their kids to use appropriate material. It will also be useful to have the backing of some enforceability and to be able to say, `Actually, you're not going to be allowed to buy those,' or `You're not going to be able to get into the cinema.' I guess we have to be realistic: young adults are pretty good at getting around some of these guidelines and it is difficult to see how we can stop some of them seeing material that is not appropriate for them, but I think these guidelines and changes will assist.</para><para>It is true that as a result of this bill there will be no change to what is classified in a particular wayâso there is no suggestion that the classification guidelines themselves will be alteredâbut there will be some consistency in the labelling of material so people can understand what is meant by a classification. I am also pleased that the government has indicated that, along with changes to the act, there is an intention to more widely discuss what the different classifications mean and to encourage others in their obligations to conduct broader community education on this issue. I think that is welcome; I think it would be welcome with the existing classification structure, but now that there is to be consistency across film and video games it makes it even more worth while because a bit of a blitz education campaign or advertising material would be really helpful. </para><para>I note that initially there were some concerns expressed by the commercial television industry about what the new requirements would mean for the showing of MA15+ material on TV. I understand that some of their concerns have been worked through and that because there is, as I understand it, also going to be a review of the code of practice there may be an opportunity to take up those issues. Obviously, it is in everybody's interest to make sure that the classification structures are actually workable. Whilst the parliamentarians in this House and parents in the community will not always share 100 per cent the interests of the commercial television associations or film distributors, it is worth while for us to make sure that we have discussions with them about practical ways to ensure that these classification structures have meaning for parentsâthat when a warning is issued before a film starts on TV it needs to give families, young adults, parents and others watching a clear indication of what it is they are going to see.</para><para>I must say my personal viewâand it is not an issue that is really dealt with by this billâis that it would also be helpful for TV viewing if some of those classifications and warnings were shown a little more regularly throughout the film. I think it is not a realistic expectation, because of the way we live our lives, view TV and do all sorts of other things, that everybody will be there at 25 past eight when the film starts. It might be preferable if there were some way of making those classifications more widely noticed. Often just the logo is there and I think this ties back in with the need to make sure that the classifications are widely understood; so that if you do see the new MA15+ classification you understand what that means and whether it is appropriate for your children to watch that sort of film.</para><para>It is good that confusion is going to be removed as a result of this bill. It will be helpful not just for consumersâalthough that is the primary consideration that we in this parliament haveâbut also for distributors, broadcasters and others who run video stores and sell computer games to have some consistent application as well. I note that this is the result of discussions and agreements that have been reached with the states and territories. I understand that it will be necessary for the states and territories to implement some changes by introducing complementary legislation to support this bill and that they have the primary role of ensuring that the classification structure is adhered to. Some of the issues that I am concerned about are not reflective of there being any particular inadequacy in this bill. It will fall to the states and territories to make sure that the implementation is as effective as it can be.</para><para>There is nothing more that I want to raise regarding the bill other than that I understand that there will need to be a transitional phase-in. There is going to be some provision made for existing material which has already been marked with the old classification structure. There obviously will be some phase-out time, which is appropriate, and there should not be any problem with there being a short phase-in time. I understand that the Office of Film and Literature Classification is to carry out a national public awareness campaign to draw attention to the revised classification types. I urge the House to take an interest in that. </para><para>It is of growing importance to the community to make sure that, without unnecessarily censoring the material that adults are able to see, we have clear guidance available to our children and young adults. Frankly, as adults, we want to be able to choose whether we see films that contain violence, sexual activity or other things. The more information we have and the more easily as adults we can make choices about the sort of material that we want to view or the games that we want to use, the more that is in everybody's interests. It is particularly for children and young adults that these classifications will have an impact. I commend the bill to the House and indicate Labor's support for these changes. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>28087</page.no><name role="metadata">Baird, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BAIRD</name><name.id>MP6</name.id><electorate>Cook</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am very happy to follow the member for Gellibrand. I note the opposition's support for the <inline ref="R2009">Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment Bill 2004</inline>, and appropriately so; it is a non-controversial piece of legislation which the community in general will support. I support the member for Gellibrand's comments on the regular indication of the classification of particular films. It is unlikely that viewers will be present at the very beginning of the showing of a film, so regularly showing the level of classification is worthy of pursuit.</para></talk.start><para>The bill brings computer games into line with film classifications. It ensures that, when computer games are sold, parents have a clear guideline of whether such games meet various criteria and what their appropriate classification is. It is important to note that the classification for X-rated films does not apply to computer games, and rightly so because of the ease with which they are obtained and young people's access to them. The predominant aim is to bring computer games into line with film classification and to ensure that we do not have X-rated computer games depicting violence or showing explicit scenes which would readily be available to young people.</para><para>I believe it is a sensible way of classifying. It is appropriate that there has been some discussion with the community about the way the films should be classified. I am aware, on the straight suitability of films, that there are many people who are not necessarily prudish in terms of films but who certainly take exception to extreme violence. They want to be aware, if they go to see a film, that the classification is right. They want to be aware that it does contain violence or explicit sexual scenes. They want to be aware so they can make an adult choice as to whether or not they wish to view them. But its predominant assistance is to parents, because our aim is that young people do not have access at too early an age to pornography, scenes of violenceâparticularly the ultraviolence that is often displayedâor sadomasochism. That is something that we simply want to avoid in the publications, films and computer games that our young people are seeing.</para><para>This bill will amend the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995 and will assist in a more fluid operation of the classification scheme. The aim is to make a common classification scheme for films and computer games, as I have said. The bill will not alter the type of material permitted within each classification group; it will merely bring the two classification schemes into one. There is a more effective distinction between the class types. For example, the G, PG and M classifications will stand for film and apply to computer games. For classes where legally enforceable restrictions apply, there will be a reference to the specific ageâfor example, MA15+, R18+ and X18+. Of course, as I have said before, you do have R18+ and X18+ for films, but for computer games the highest classification will be MAâfor mature adultsâ15+.</para><para>The bill will help make classifications easily available to parents and give a clear, distinct hierarchy to the classification of films. The bill does not deal with publications; they are not classified in the same way as films and computer games. It will also give effect to the agreement by the Commonwealth, state and territory censorship ministers to change classification laws to better inform the community about strong materials in films and computer games. The bill also does not affect the Commercial Television Industry Code of Practice, nor does it affect the importation of publications, films or computer games. Imported products remain subject to classification prior to release in Australia. </para><para>By way of background, there are two main pieces of legislation which oversee the classification of publications, films and computer gamesâthe classification act and the broadcasting act. Descriptions of the products which would fall within the classifications are contained in the National Classification Code. For example, the code sets out the level of depiction of sex, violence and other issues which would cause a film to be classified as G, PG, M et cetera. The criteria for classification are also contained in the Guidelines for the Classification of Films and Computer Games. The broadcasting act deals with program standards for broadcasting primarily for commercial television. It permits radio and/or television industry groups to develop codes of practice relating to broadcasting standards and provides that, in developing codes of practice, the industry must take into account community attitudes to issues such as violence, sex, offensive language, drugsâincluding alcohol and tobaccoâand the depiction of gender and ethnicity.</para><para>It is a bill that both sides of the House agree to. It does bring the two classification schemes together in terms of films and computer games. It is a useful guide to parents. It is not a question of the government introducing more restrictive guidelines but rather providing a useful means for young people to be guided on publications, and of course it provides a clear indication to those who run video shops and who lease and sell computer games that they must abide by those requirements.</para><para>The ready availability of pornographic films to young people and imported computer games which are also available through the black market are of concern. We want our young people to develop a healthy attitude towards sex and personal relations, and this is one aim of such a classification system. We also want to ensure that they do not see depicted excessive violence, which can lead to them simulating that behaviour in the streets of Australia. This is a sensible and worthwhile approach, and there have been extensive public discussions on this issue. I commend the bill to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>28088</page.no><name role="metadata">Ciobo, Steven, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CIOBO</name><name.id>00AN0</name.id><electorate>Moncrieff</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt is pleasing to note that the <inline ref="R2009">Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment Bill 2004</inline> is one of those bills for which there is bipartisan support. It is an important bill because it is at the centre of the type of government regulation we would like to see in this country. That applies especially to the coalition insofar as one of the most concerning problems for many in the community is the different regulations, different levels of regulation and inconsistent standards about content that the government applies. This unfortunately was the situation that applied to the differentiation between film classification and computer games classification.</para></talk.start><para>There is a growing convergence between the games industry and the films industry. We are seeing many games modelled on films and vice versa. One example is the highly successful film series <inline font-style="italic">The Matrix</inline>, which quickly developed into a computer game. In reverse, the computer game <inline font-style="italic">Lara Croft Tomb Raider</inline>âwhich I am sure you are very familiar with, Mr Deputy Speaker Causleyâcame from the computer game industry first and was then transferred into a film. </para><para>Many people rely on the operation of government and the agencies that are charged with making the appropriate classification of films and computer games. Parents rely on them because in today's time-poor society parents do not have the opportunity to perhaps sit down and watch a film or play a computer game to deem whether it is suitable or otherwise for their children. If it were not for the classification system, parents would be required to do this if they wanted to be good parents. If parents wanted to determine whether or not something was suitable for their children, they would need to ensure that the computer game or film was appropriate. Of course, that is not feasible, and that is why government need to send a clear message that we take the time to look at and make an informed decision about the appropriate classification of a computer game or film.</para><para>In this regard, parents need to have confidence that they can rely upon the classification that is given to a film or a computer game. The fact that there was previously an inconsistency between the two classification types applying to films and computer games meant that it would sometimes be a little confusing for parents to make this decision. I am very pleased that the bill before the chamber today deals with minor amendments to the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995. These amendments seek to bring classifications into line so that you have a uniform standard that applies both to computer games and to films.</para><para>The existing classifications for films are the ratings of G, PG, M, MA, R, X and those that are refused classification. To the corollary, the existing classifications for computer games are G, G8+, M15+, MA15+âthere is no R or X categoryâand those that were refused classification. Now the two are coming together. We will now have one uniform standard which will applyâthat is, G, PG, M, MA15+, R18+, X18+ and RC, which is the refused classification. The benefit of this is that you have the one uniform standard. The introduction of MA15+, R18+ and X18+ means that there are now legally enforceable age thresholds which will apply to both films and computer games. This is a fairly uncontroversial piece of legislation, and I have pretty much touched upon all the areas that I sought to cover, but I will go on while I wait for the parliamentary secretary to come into the chamber.</para><para>I would like to assess in more detail the various points of this bill. It ensures that we help to protect those aged under 15, for example, from exposure to unsuitable material. It is most concerning, I am sure, for many parents to walk in and see their children playing a computer game or watching a film which they would deem to be unsuitable. It is very important that there is a comprehensive and detailed list of material available so that parents can make informed decisions about what their children are watching.</para><para>I turn my mind to one game in particular, which I know has been controversial of late: <inline font-style="italic">Grand Theft Auto</inline>. I have had the benefit of seeing and playing <inline font-style="italic">Grand Theft Auto</inline>, because I am a firm believer in and supporter of my local computer games industry, which, incidentally, is in fact bigger than the film box office industry. This highlights the way that society is changing as computer games become more and more popular. <inline font-style="italic">Grand Theft Auto</inline> caused a lot of controversy when it was released because it dealt with a number of fairly violent, some would say, aspectsâin particular, in this game players steal various cars and drive them around, and this often leads to situations such as beating people up or driving over them in their vehicles. </para><para>Understandably, this caused some concern for many parents, but the point I would raise is that this game is targeted towards a specific age group only. It is a game that, like many films, is targeted towards a mature age groupâpeople that can differentiate between simulated violence, for example, that they might see when playing a computer game versus other violence that occurs in the real world. It is important that we do not seek to impose a government enforced mandate about what is appropriate or inappropriate but rather that we try to ensure that people have actual information about whether a game might be appropriate for the intended audience. That really is the point, because classification of films and computer games is largely built upon providing information to families and parents, as well as to customers.</para><para>Classification operates in parallel with our need to ensure a strongly enforced system for the sale of such products. There is no point, quite frankly, in appropriately classifying films and computer games if we then do not ensure the enforcement of the sale of these products. There is little point in classifying a film X-rated or R-rated, or indeed MA15+ for a computer game, if there is no enforcement of the market to which these products are sold. This is a two-pronged approach. If, for example, an X-rated video is readily and widely available to children, then that classification obviously serves no benefit whatsoever. There must be a strong enforcement of classifications in terms of sales, because that is a fundamental aspect.</para><para>I note that the member for Gellibrand said that she was of the view that the bill will give parents greater control and confidence about what is appropriate for their children, particularly young adults, to see. This applied, in particular, in respect of the legal restrictions that might apply to MA15+ material. I am very pleased that this is the Labor Party's position, because it is consistent with the Liberal Party's position, and that is always a good outcome. I heard the member for Cook speak about this bill, highlighting the fact that the very last thing we would want to do is ensure that there is a prevalence of violent material made available to our children. The reality is that we do not want our children to see unnecessary levels of violence nor, indeed, unnecessary levels of sexual material in film and on TV. In that respect, it is very important that this new code applies. I notice that the member for Franklin is particularly keen to speak on this bill, so I will wrap up my comments there. I commend the bill to this chamber. It is a good bill. It ensures that we have consistent and uniform legislation. I am very pleased to support it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>28090</page.no><name role="metadata">Quick, Harry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr QUICK</name><name.id>AV5</name.id><electorate>Franklin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI, like other speakers in the chamber today, congratulate the government on this initiative. I think it makes real commonsense. It obviously has bipartisan support. A couple of issues came to mind as I listened to the debate this morning. One of those is the suggestion by the member for Gellibrand that we should have a continuous classification logo on movies. We see that WIN TV, in particular, have their little logo for the duration. I am not too sure whether or not it is to discourage you from videotaping whatever is on television, but I do think that a continuous classification logo on movies would be a great idea.</para></talk.start><para>One thing that worries me is that the explanatory memorandum says that states and territories are going to pass complementary legislation. I would be interested to find out what the time frame for this is. Knowing some of the states and territories as I do, they have got such a backlog of legislation and they meet so infrequently that one wonders whether this is going to take 18 months, two years; whether there is a time frame for Commonwealth and state agencies to sit down and work this out. </para><para>Another thing that worries me is, when you go into video stores, whether these new 15+ computer games are going to just be up there with bestsellers, top rating things, or whether there is going to be a discrete section in the video stores of 15+ video games, so that young kids do not wander in. If you visit a video store, as I do reasonably infrequently, you find it is just a great big barn. There is stuff all over the walls and people wander around. You are grabbed only at the end, when you rock up to the counter with whatever you have got. There is no real perusal of whether you are there looking at MA15s and you are eight years of age and scanning what is on the box. I would be interested to know who is monitoring this, whether there is going to be a discrete 15+ section for computer games.</para><para>As I say, this bill has bipartisan support. As federal members, each and every one of us will be alerting our constituents through our newsletters to the changes that have been proposed in this <inline ref="R2009">Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment Bill 2004</inline>. I congratulate the government and the minister for doing this. It is interesting that the original bill was in 1995 and, in less than 10 years, we are now aligning both films and computer games. People, when they introduced the original 1995 bill, did not realise the way computer games were going to take over many people's lives. For most of the young people that I am in contact with, much to their educational edification, these computer games are taking over their lives. Some people are even saying that our thumbs are going to be more useful than our fingers. I again congratulate the government, and I appreciate the opportunity to speak on the bill this morning.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>28091</page.no><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SLIPPER</name><name.id>0V5</name.id><electorate>Fisher</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would at this stage like to thank all of those honourable members who have spoken on the <inline ref="R2009">Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment Bill 2004</inline>. As members of parliament we often get pilloried for appearing to disagree on everything, but every so oftenâin fact, more often than people appreciateâwe do find a unanimity of purpose and a oneness of aim, and that is represented by the way in which all honourable members have supported the very positive improvements included in this particular bill.</para></talk.start><para>The Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment Bill makes a number of procedural amendments to the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995. The bill merely renames the existing classification types and does not affect the criteria used to classify films and computer games. The amendments will improve the operation of the national classification scheme by lifting the profile of the computer games classifications and making the distinction between the advisory and legally restricted classifications clearer. The amendments will be of great assistance to all consumers, and particularly parents. The confusion currently experienced about the difference between the M and MA classification types should be addressed by the changes to the names of the classification types in conjunction with education activities by the OFLC and the use of consistent classification information by all sectors, including television. Amendments to state and territory classification enforcement legislation will closely follow the passage of this bill. Consequential changes to the National Classification Code have been agreed in principle by censorship ministers and will be formalised prior to the commencement of the bill.</para><para>The member for Franklin in his speech congratulated the government, and I thank him for those worthy words. He pointed out that this particular bill is commonsense. We note his view that there should be classification on movies continuously. This is an issue for the determination of markings. States and territories are committed to making amendments to complementary legislation, and the passage is expected in about 12 months. I also note that the member for Franklin suggested that there should be a discrete section in video stores for 15+ classified computer games. As the member for Franklin would be aware, video store placement of games is not an issue for the Commonwealth. Maybe that is a matter that could be taken up with the various censorship ministers in the states and territories. As a parent myself, I see a lot of worth in the suggestion made by the member for Franklin. </para><para>The member for Cook, in his usual bipartisan way, welcomed the support of the opposition for this noncontroversial bill, and he supported remarks made by the honourable member for Gellibrand in favour of more frequent classification information on television. He noted that the X rating does not apply to computer games and saw that as being sensible. He pointed out that there had been appropriate consultation with the communityâand there has been appropriate consultation. The government always prides itself on seeing what the community wants and trying to reflect community standards and attitudes.</para><para>As the member for Cook said, issues related to TV codes of practice are not addressed by the bill. Comments by members in respect of classification information on television will undoubtedly be noted by Commercial Television Australia and the Australian Broadcasting Authority. In my view, it would not do any harm to bring some pressure to bear on those particular organisations. The important point has been made that everyone can use classifications to make viewing choices, especially with respect to violence. The member pointed out the extensive consultation that has taken place. I do note concerns regarding potential access to restricted products by children. This is actually a state and territory matter, and again this is one of those situations where we need the states and territories to act as well.</para><para>The member for Moncrieff also noted the bipartisan support for the bill and spoke very strongly with respect to his support for its provisions. Parents use the classification system to make choices regarding films and computer games for kids. Parents are not in a position to make informed choices without classifications, and I think that is an important point to be noted.</para><para>The shadow Attorney-General, the member for Gellibrand, pointed out that Labor supported the bill. I think she said that it was a welcome development and a very useful tool, especially for parents. As the member said, this bill will give parents greater control and confidence about what is appropriate for their children, particularly young adults, to see, and particularly in respect of the legal restrictions about MA15+ material. As the honourable member noted, the government wants TV and the OFLC to keep discussing consistent classification messages for TV, films and computer games. Various industry groups, consumer groups and community organisations around the country have contributed to the policy and, on behalf of the government, I express my appreciation of their involvement. The collective wisdom that has emerged from those consultations has given effect to the provisions of this bill, which I now commend to the chamber.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para><para>Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. </para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE FORCE: DEPLOYMENT</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>28093</page.no></debateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 31 March, on motion by<inline font-weight="bold"> Mr Abbott</inline>:</para><motion><para>That the House take note of the paper.</para></motion><para>upon which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Snowdon</inline> moved by way of amendment:</para><para>That the following words be added at the end of the motion:</para><para>âand the Prime Minister's and Leader of the Opposition's speech of 30 March 2004 to the Prime Minister's motion relating to ADF personnel in or around Iraqâ</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>28093</page.no><name role="metadata">Macfarlane, Ian, MP</name><name role="display">Mr IAN MACFARLANE</name><name.id>WN6</name.id><electorate>Groom</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise in support of the Prime Minister's motion. As a nation, we have a proud tradition of sticking to the end, of seeing the job through. That is what we are doing in East Timor, that is what we are doing in the Solomon Islands and that is what we will do in Iraq, provided the decision remains with the coalition government. Sadly, the Leader of the Opposition has been caught on the hop on this issue and does not have the presence of mind to admit that he is wrongâand that tradition will not be the case if the member for Werriwa is the Prime Minister after the election later this year.</para></talk.start><para>As reported in today's media, and in fact in the media all this week, an explosive mixture of Iraq, intelligence briefings, confidentiality, misrepresentation of intelligence and credibility has been catapulted into the public arenaâand, with it, the Labor leader has been catapulted into his second major miscalculation on security in two weeks. The bottom line is that the Labor Party wants Australia to shirk its responsibility. That is a sad thing for the people of Iraq, but it is a shameful thing for Australia for a number of reasons.</para><para>We have 850 ADF personnel in Iraq at the moment. They are undertaking an important and practical role. This role extends to the RAAF C130 Hercules contingent of 150 personnel providing vital airlift support. This air support is the principal means for Australian officials to enter and leave Baghdad, which currently has no commercial flights. As well, there are 80 air traffic controllers managing ATC service operations at Bagdad international airportâand, by all reports, doing a very good job. As well, 53 Army trainers are training the new Iraqi army, and no-one could doubt the importance of that. A Navy training team of 12 is also due in April. All these roles are vital to Iraq's security, both present and future. The work of the Australian Defence Force is about creating a modern army in Iraq, focused on the defence of Iraq not tyranny. And, of course, we have HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Melbourne</inline> conducting maritime interception operations in the northern gulf, combined with RAAF AP-3C Orions, also conducting maritime patrols and support on counter-terrorism operations.</para><para>As the shadow foreign affairs minister said, the people of Iraq need us at this time. In a nation that was governed by a tyrant for so long, our peopleâAustralian men and womenâare providing important training to the Iraqi police force. It is in the interests of democracy in Iraq that we train these people. It is also in our interests to protect our diplomatic personnel from attack by foreign and local terrorists operating in Iraq. It is even more important that we do not send a signal to terrorists that we are an easy touchâthat we roll over when they, the terrorists, carry out their despicable acts.</para><para>I am afraid that this is the message that the Leader of the Opposition has inadvertently sent: bully us, Australia, and we will back down; murder our citizens, the citizens of our allies and innocent people, and Australia will give ground. It is a sad but not an irreversible position. The Leader of the Opposition needs to put politics to one side and do the right thingâadmit he is wrong and get behind our troops based in Iraq. Remember, it is not the government but defence experts that have pointed out that the Leader of the Opposition's position may have put our troops in great danger. For instance, Professor Ross Babbage said: </para><quote><para>In the wake of Madrid, words can be bullets. Any suggestion we are going to withdraw the troops before the job is done could give the impression Australia is weakening ...</para></quote><para>Dr Alan Dupont of the Lowy Institute said:</para><quote><para>If the US, Britain and Australia all pulled out, then Iraq would descend into civil war and the terrorists would be able to say Western governments can't stay the course ... </para></quote><para>Finally, let me quote Brigadier Jim Wallace, who said:</para><quote><para>... I am concerned it could make our people more vulnerable.</para><para>It invites the terrorists to think they've had a victory ...</para></quote><para>I call on the Leader of the Opposition to reverse his position, but I fear he will not. The member for Werriwa's stance on this issue is the start of the peeling away of the facade of policy credibility he has concocted. He had a hard issue to deal with; he failed the policy test and then resorted to accusing the government of playing party politics. Our troop commitment in Iraq is a weighty issue. It is not a populist, low-hanging fruit that the Leader of the Opposition can suddenly pick and use to ingratiate himself with the electorate. </para><para>He has failed the policy credibility test on a number of fronts already. Firstly, it seems that he did not consult with his shadow cabinet and he was caught making policy on the run. He should have done the right thing and confessed to a mistake, but instead he spun the line that it had been policy for 12 monthsâall of which was news to the shadow foreign affairs spokesman. The member for Werriwa talks about honesty and integrity, he talks about reengaging the electorate, but he has been caught out spinning to cover his own disregard for the process, to cover his own mistakes. </para><para>Secondly, he claimed that he had received substantive briefings on the strategic environment in Iraq and the ADF's role, but the government's advice showed that this was incorrect and yesterday's debate showed that the opposition leader was still unable to substantiate his claim that he had been thoroughly briefed on the matter. Perhaps he was briefed by Andrew Wilkie. Andrew Wilkie, of course, is ex-ONA and now a Green candidate in the next election. It is just like the Minister for Foreign Affairs said last week: perhaps the policy was worked out with Bob Brown during the Styx Valley tour.</para><para>In conclusion, now is not the time to withdraw into ourselves and hope that by pulling out of Iraq we will somehow be less of a target. Now is not the time to be pulling back on our responsibilities in the hope that someone else will do the heavy lifting. That is simply not the Australian way and we do not do that. If we leave we will diminish the solid international and hard-fought reputation that Australia's Defence Force personnel have built up over the last 100 years. To leave will have the opposite effect to that intended, providing comfort for the likes of bin Laden who have attacked us first, not for what we do but for what we are.</para><para>As Australian Defence Association executive director Neil James said, Mr Latham is offending the troops and their families by playing politics. Mr James said:</para><quote><para>When you're over there doing a job for the country, the last thing you want to hear is a politician of either side in Australia saying you shouldn't be there. If the people we're fighting think that we might pick up and go away, it's more likely to increase the risk to Australian troops rather than decrease it. </para></quote><para>It is for that reason that I support the motion before us; it is for that reason that I support our troops in Iraq.

In regard to the war in Iraq, we talk about `American intelligence' being a classic oxymoron, but I have another one: John Howard and honesty and integrity. That is one of the classic oxymorons of this debate. We have heard that we should not cut and run, but that is exactly what the Prime Minister intends to do if he gets elected at the next election. He will not be around to see everything through; he will be cutting and running and handing over to someone else. So I find it ripe that the Prime Minister is saying that we need to stay in Iraq to see the job through, when, if he is elected again, he will be cutting and running himself. We know that he will probably be handing over to the Treasurer orâheaven forbidâthe Minister for Health and Ageing. We know that because the member for Sturt said so publicly. I think he got a bit chastised for that, but we all know that he was telling the truthâthe PM himself is going to cut and run.</para></talk.start></continue><para>On numerous occasions I have stated in this place my objections to the government committing Australian Defence Force personnel to military intervention in Iraq, recklessly endangering their lives, based on the facade of disarming Iraq of their weapons of mass destruction. Of course, we are all now aware of how fictitious this reasoning was, yet the Prime Minister is still hanging his hat on the argument that Australian troops will be needed in Iraq for an indefinite period. He talks of `getting the job done' and says that the ADF should not be withdrawn from Iraq until their respective tasks have been completed. Mr Howard talks of how it is the `Australian way to stay there and go the distance, to see it through'.</para><para>Given that the government used the reasoning that sending troops to Iraq was to disarm Saddam Hussein of his supposed weapons of mass destruction, that was the job to be done; that was the government's instruction. Although incorrect, it has now been finalised. The job has been completed, yet we see the government moving the goalposts on this issue. They are ducking and weaving, changing their reasoning for keeping troops in Iraq to suit their own political purposes. Perhaps the Australian Labor Party announcement to withdraw military forces as soon as practicable once the handover of power from the coalition to an interim Iraqi government occurs in the middle of this yearâperhaps the Labor Party announcement to bring the troops home by Christmas 2004âis just too sagacious for the government. They have had to politicise this issue because our policy is just too logicalâthey are jealous that they did not get to call it first. We have rained on their parade again, so to speak. </para><para>This is the government's hypocrisy at its best. Just a few days ago the Prime Minister was talking time lines of May or June for the withdrawal of ADF personnelânamely, air traffic controllersâfrom Iraq. The Defence minister also referred to May or June as the time that the air traffic controllers can look forward to rejoining their families in Australia. Mr Howard spoke of Australia's military commitment in Iraq as being `of a quite short, specific duration'. It smacks of duplicity that we have had the most senior member of the Liberal Party and his Defence minister both referring to a timetable of troop withdrawal and yet this motionâ`that no elements of this contingent of Australian Defence Force personnel should be withdrawn until their respective tasks have been completed and that no arbitrary times should be set for such withdrawal'âhas been introduced.</para><para>Mr Howard speaks of the increased threat to us of terrorism if we make an exit out of Iraq and how we `would be the very first to unconditionally break ranks if we pulled our people out'. He is creating a fictional crisis between the US and Australia if we pulled troops out of Iraq. He is again kowtowing to the Bush government. He thinks we will be letting down our close friend and ally and that removing troops from Iraq would not be in the long-term best interests of Australia. Didn't our friend and ally let us down in the very first instance, dragging us into a war based on a false pretext and providing to Australian intelligence agencies incorrect and inconclusive information? I would say that in this case our ally was not acting in the long-term best interests of Australia. Mr Howard says:</para><quote><para>We would let down our allies and friends at the worst possible time in the worldwide struggle against terrorism and, worst of all in the immediate context, we would send the wrong signal to the terrorists not only in Iraq but around the world.</para></quote><para>The conflict in Iraq, albeit successful in capturing Saddam Hussein, has unnecessarily diverted Australian Defence resources away from the focus of capturing terrorists, of breaking up networks which will continue to develop and prosper without Saddam Hussein overpowering smaller fundamentalist groups. The Osama bin Laden and the Jemaah Islamiah networks in north Pakistan, Afghanistan and South-East Asia will flourish. The Australian Defence Force personnel should be in Australia defending our nation against terrorism, not based in Iraq defending that country.</para><para>Mr Howard talks about how our reputation and standing on the world stage would be adversely affected if troops were withdrawn from Iraq. However, according to Dr Adel Abdul Mahdi from the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq it will not have any impact in Baghdad. He said:</para><quote><para>The sky won't fall in. As long as we do not have chaos, their leaving by Christmas will not be an issue.</para></quote><para>The Secretary-General of the Arab League, Mr Amr Moussa, claims that the war in Iraq will cause ongoing havoc in the region. Mr Moussa said:</para><quote><para>The region is already engulfed in extreme anger and agitation because of what's going on in Iraq and what is going on in Palestine. More than that, it will sow havoc across the region.</para></quote><para>The foreseeable future may hold a bloody civil war for the people of Iraq as these groups rally and gain potency. The new interim government has a tough task ahead. Australian troops, as part of the coalition forces, will have fulfilled their duty when that government becomes established. </para><para>Just prior to the war in Iraq I was in Egypt as part of a delegation. We were meeting the then head of the united Arab League. He pointed out to us that if Saddam Hussein was removed from power in Baghdad there would be chaos: there would be civil war and there would be all sorts of unrest because although Saddam Hussein was an evil dictator he actually kept in check many of those groups in the country that sought to cause terror and create instability in the region. Basically, that is what has happened. I am not a fan of Saddam Hussein. I am not a fan of Robert Mugabe. I have said in this place previously that it is interesting that we sent troops to Iraq and a cricket team to Zimbabwe. I believe that dictators, wherever they are, need to be dealt with. But they need to be dealt with a in a proper way and in a way that is not going to cause havoc in that country once they are removed. Unfortunately at the moment that is exactly what we have seen happen.</para><para>The lives of the Australian men and womenâand I am thankful that none has been lost in this deployment in Iraqâshould not be treated with disrespect by the government. These people should be sent home as soon as possible. They have completed their duties once the interim government is in place midway through this year. In March 2003 the foreign minister said:</para><quote><para>We made it clear to the Americans right at the outset, early this year before the war began, that whilst we would make a contribution to the war ... we weren't intending to stay on there for any period of time.</para></quote><para>Well, time is up: the war is over. ADF personnel have already been used in an international game controlled by the government and allies. These Australian men and women deserve to be returned to Australia to be reunited with their families, particularly at Christmas, given that since their deployment to Iraq they have served their nation in such a proficient and professional manner. As John Lennon and Yoko Ono sang in their happy Christmas song <inline font-style="italic">War is over</inline>, let us make it a good one for Australian Defence Force troops: a merry Christmas and a happy new year without any fear. Labor wants Australian Defence Force personnel back on our soil, protecting Australians in the war against terror. When it committed our troops to Iraq the government effectively made Australia a target for terrorism. Our troops should be here at home in Australia protecting Australian citizens. It is obvious. The opportunity to withdraw once the interim Iraqi government is established is perfect timing.</para><para>The Howard government have got it wrong again. Labor calls for Australian national security and the war against terror to be a principal priority for our defence forces. We should have clear-cut and defined exit strategies for removing the Defence Force personnel when committing troops overseas so as not to leave them and their families languishing with indefinite time lines. I believe that the second part of the motion should be replaced and instead clarified timings provided for the withdrawal of Australian military forces from Iraq as soon as viable, preferably before the end of 2004. </para><para>It is interesting that we have heard speakers from the other side go on and on about how withdrawing the troops would increase our risk of terrorism. I would like to remind members opposite that the war in Iraq was not about terrorism; the war in Iraq was allegedly about removing weapons of mass destruction, which we did not find. Now it is supposedly about removing a dictator. It was nothing to do with the war against terror. That is why I say that we have 850-odd personnel in the region and many of those personnel are involved in antiterrorism activities in the gulf. Labor would support those people staying there because they are fighting the war against terror. But in relation to Iraq we are saying that those people should be brought home when the interim government is there, and preferably before Christmas. Earlier the honourable member opposite suggested that he wanted to ask a question. I would be happy to answer that if he wants to ask it now. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>TK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP</name><name role="display">Dr Southcott</name></talker><para>âI wanted to ask the honourable member if he was aware of the report in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> that a spokeswoman for the Leader of the Opposition initially said that it was all 850 troops that would be withdrawn.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>84G</name.id><name role="metadata">Wilkie, Kim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr WILKIE</name></talker><para>âThe government goes on and on about how newspapers are often getting reports wrong.

Hawker Britton have tested it and apparently it tests quite well. It is the sort of thing that they said in Britain in August 1914 when the British Expeditionary Force went across to France as part of the mobilisation in the First World War. Then, as now, it was clearly wrong to set an arbitrary deadline. We know with hindsight that of course the troops were not back by Christmas; they were back four years later. </para></talk.start><para>In Australia we did not say our troops would be home for Christmas. We said something differentâthat Australia would be there. These days people might feel that that was jingoistic or whatever, but it is actually the nature of the country that we have always been. Australia does have a proud record of standing up for what it believes in, of standing up for the rights of democracies and of standing against tyranny. In the First World War, the Second World War, Korea, Vietnam and, more recently, Iraq we have always been a tough country which stands up for what we believe in.</para><para>There are really two parts to the debate we are currently having in parliament. They go to the heart of, firstly, the quality of the decision that the Leader of the Opposition made on the important issue of troop withdrawal and, secondly, the process of that decision. It has been very evident in the last week that talking about reading to children is easy, but actually making decisions on national security is hard. We have clearly seen the inexperience of the Leader of the Opposition in full view. The world in the last week has got a glimpse of how dangerous and erratic Mark Latham would be as Prime Minister of Australia.</para><para>If the Labor Party regarded national security as a priority and as being serious, why on earth did it choose the current Leader of the Opposition over the member for Brand as leader of the Labor Party? The member for Brand is a former defence minister, a former Deputy Prime Minister, a long serving member of the cabinet National Security Committee and one of the most experienced members of the Labor Party in national security. It is inconceivable that the Labor Party would have behaved as it has over the last week under the leadership of the member for Brand. We all know that. So the day that the Labor Party elected the member for Werriwa over the member for Brand as Leader of the Opposition was the day it gave up any pretence of regarding national security as a priority. </para><para>The government's approach is to say that the troops should be withdrawn from Iraq when the job is done, when reconstruction is finished. This was the Labor Party position until the member for Werriwa went on Mike Carlton's radio program. What are we talking about? There are 850 Australian troops in and around Iraq. This makes Australia a significant country in the reconstruction of Iraq. According to the Brookings Institution, after the United States, Britain, Italy, Poland, the Ukraine, the Netherlands and Spain, we are No. 8 on the list of countries. A withdrawal by Australia before reconstruction is under way, while the security situation in Iraq is still not good, sends a terrible message.</para><para>We have been told by the Leader of the Opposition that the rationale for this, his defence of Australia doctrine, is that they are needed back in Australia. What are we talking about? Who is over there? The ADF includes 85 troops who are providing security to Australian civilians and the Australian representative office. This enables the ARO staff to move around Baghdad and Iraq to advance Australia's political, security and economic interests in Iraq. That is pretty important. There is a contingent of 150 RAAF Hercules personnel, which is providing vital airlift support, which is the principal means for Australian officials to enter Baghdad. That is also important. </para><para>There are 80 air traffic controllers managing air traffic control services and operations at Baghdad International Airport, and by all accounts they are doing a tremendous job. There are 53 Army trainers training the new Iraqi army. There are 12 people in a Navy training team, and there are 270 people on HMAS<inline font-style="italic"> Melbourne</inline> conducting maritime interception operations in the northern gulf. There are also 160 people with the RAAF Orions conducting maritime patrols and support to counter-terrorism operations. The shadow minister for foreign affairs, the member for Griffith, agreed after he visited Baghdad that the protective security as it relates to the wellbeing of several hundred Australians still in country is of paramount importance.</para><para>In the Australia Defence Force we have 51,000 personnel. The Labor Party, if I follow their argument correctlyâand it does change day by dayâare suggesting that bringing back a couple of hundred who are essential for the security of our officials in Baghdad is essential for the defence of Australia. From what? Are they seriously suggesting that 100 or 200 people will make the difference in the defence of Australia? And, if the `home by Christmas' principle is so important, why aren't we applying it to the 500-odd troops in the Solomon Islands and the 450-odd troops in  East Timor?</para><para>More importantly, this sends a very bad signal. Do not take my word for it; Paul Kelly in an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>, following the bombings in Spain, said:</para><quote><para>The legacy from Spain is that political parties, in government or opposition, must decide whether to lead or merely to follow public opinion as the war on terrorism penetrates the political culture of Western democracies.</para></quote><para>He concludes by saying:</para><quote><para>But in the interim the terrorists, utterly convinced that the West is weak to its core, will seek to divide the alliance and to intimidate its electorates.</para></quote><para>If we look at similar countries to Australia, in Britain the approach of the Labour Party could not be different. Jack Straw said in mid-March that all countriesânot just those who supported the campaign to topple Saddam Husseinâwere the targets of terrorists. He went on to say, `We are under a threat from Islamic extremism and so is almost every other country in the world.' No-one should believe that somehow, if you say, `I opposed the military action in Iraq,' it will make you safer or exempt you as a potential victim.  </para><para>But the positions of oppositions are very important as well, because it is part of the objective of extremist terrorists in Iraq to get deep within the political culture of democracies. I read the words of  British opposition leader Michael Howard. You could not find a greater contrast when reading the words of this opposition leader who has approached this with a bit of courage and a bit of resolve. On 19 March, Michael Howard said:</para><quote><para>If the terrorists hope they can gain their ends by perpetrating in Britain a similar outrage to that in Spain, their wickedness will be in vain. Whatever my disagreements with Tony Blair, any government that I lead will not flinch in its determination to win the war against terror, wherever it has to be fought.</para></quote><para>Can you imagine hearing those words from Australia's Leader of the Opposition? If only! Michael Howard went on to say:</para><quote><para>Countries could not insulate themselves from terrorist attack by opting out of the War on Terror. We cannot buy ourselves immunity by changing our foreign policy. Apart from the moral cowardice of that position it can never work in practice.</para></quote><para>And we have seen similar comments from Senator John Kerry. He said that it would be wrong for Spain to withdraw their troops from Iraq at this point.</para><para>A lot has been said about the chronology of this. I found on the ALP web site an interview that has not been taken off the web siteâa doorstop interview with the Leader of the Opposition on 15 December at Ingleburn, following the capture of Saddam Hussein. The Leader of the Opposition said that it was `very good news indeed', but `that doesn't mean the work is over.' The Leader of the Opposition was asked:</para><quote><para>What can the Australian Government do now?</para></quote><para>He said:</para><quote><para>Labor's stance with our troops is that of course, at the first practical opportunity we want them back in Australia. But, there's still work to be done, there's still a task there, there's no room for complacency. ... at an appropriate time of course the work of the Australian troops will be complete.</para></quote><para>That is basically the government positionâthat, when the work is done, the troops will return.</para><para>It disgusts me that we have seen the Labor Party basically accept a demand by the leader of the Australian Greens, Bob Brown. We never saw this under the leadership of Kim Beazley. Bob Brown said, `A 10-point plan: I want the troops home by Christmas,' and the Leader of the Opposition went walking in the Styx forest and, under pressure from Mike Carlton on 2UE, that was the position. And we have now heard from the former Leader of the Opposition, the member for Hotham, that this was never part of the shadow ministry decision; that this was something made on the run.</para><para>We also now know about the whole process of how this decision was made, and we know that it was made with very little information. There was a long debate in the House of Representatives yesterday regarding what was discussed at the various briefings with ASIS, DSD and so on. I have met the defence secretary, Mr Ric Smith, and the head of ASIS, David Irvine, when they were ambassadors. I met Ric Smith in Jakarta when he was Australian Ambassador to Indonesia; and I met David Irvine in Port Moresby when he was Australian High Commissioner to Papua New Guinea. If I were to make a judgment about who I would trust, I would come down firmly on the side of the public officialsâboth of whom have been ambassadors to China and are our most senior people in the area of defence and foreign affairs. It is ironic that the great defender last week of the head of the AFP is now saying that ASIS and Defence have not put the full picture. </para><para>The Leader of the Opposition has not said anywhere that he did actually receive a full briefing on our deployment in Iraq. He has never said anywhere that they discussed reconstruction in Iraq. We have heard a little bit about the shadow cabinet decisions; these all dated back to March or May last year. What we know is that over the last year the security situation in Iraq has not been good. To cut and run at this point is going to send a very bad message to the whole of the Middle East, because we now have a situation in the Middle East where something is going on, and the fall of Saddam Hussein has been perceived very differently in the Middle East from the way it has been perceived in Western democracies. Members of the opposition have to ask themselves: why did Libya give up its weapons of mass destruction programs? Why are we starting to see the first chink of light coming through in countries like Syria, Iran and so on? There is now an opportunity to see a Middle East which is going to be much more favourable for the long term to all Western countries rather then being a haven for extremism and terrorists.</para><para>In conclusion, I support the motion of the Prime Minister in support of the troops. As always, Australian troops will return when the job is finished, and we should never cut and run.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>28101</page.no><name role="metadata">Hoare, Kelly, MP</name><name role="display">Ms HOARE</name><name.id>83Y</name.id><electorate>Charlton</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âTo listen to government members participating in this debate on the motion of the Prime Minister, anybody would think that the Leader of the Opposition had said that Australia should pull its troops out of Iraq tomorrow. To look at the plain facts, Christmas is nine months away. The handover to an Iraqi governing body is less than 100 days away. If the invaders cannot get it together by Christmasâin nine months timeâto enable Iraqi governance in Iraq, it will just emphasise that this invasion was wrong and that the Prime Minister sent young Australian men and women to a war to search for weapons of mass destruction that were not there, based on dodgy intelligence reports. The original motion moved by the Prime Minister on Tuesday this week was as follows:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this House:</para><para>(1) expresses its continued support for and confidence in the 850 Australian Defence Force personnel currently deployed in or around Iraq and records its deep appreciation for the outstanding professionalism they have displayed in carrying out their duties; and</para><para>(2) is of the opinion that no elements of this contingent of Australian Defence Force personnel should be withdrawn until their respective tasks have been completed and that no arbitrary times should be set for such withdrawal.</para></motion><para>Mr Deputy Speaker Adams you will remember the fiasco in the House of Representatives on Tuesday because of that original resolution. The Prime Minister originally moved it to try and force the Labor Party to vote against the support of our troops. That is something that we in the Labor Party would never, ever do. Of course we support our troops. We support our troops wherever they are, whatever circumstances they are in.</para><para>The Prime Minister must have then had second thoughts. Maybe Arthur Sinodinos has got on the phone and said, `Look, this might not be the right way to go. In the electorate out there, Australians will be able to see that you are just trying to play politics with this situation.' So what did we see in the House of Representatives on Tuesday? We saw the government's bovver boy, the Leader of the House, call for a division on this particular motion, only to have the Prime Minister come rushing in to overrule him, saying, `No. This isn't the right way to go. We should be allowing the Australian Labor Party to support the troops in and around Iraq.' That was the right and proper thing to do on this particular occasion and I commend the Prime Minister for allowing us to do that. </para><para>What do we have here? We have a motion that we in the Labor Party are voting against. The second part of the Prime Minister's motion is that the Defence Force personnel should not be withdrawn until their respective tasks have been completed and that no arbitrary time should be set for such a withdrawal.</para><para>As I indicated, it is less than 100 days until the handover to an Iraqi government but it is nine months until the end of Decemberânine months to enable Australian troops and other invading powers to get their act together to help the Iraqis in their governance. We should be supplying expertise in relation to electoral matters, to enable them to hold elections, and we should be supplying a physical presence on the ground to resurrect the basic infrastructure that we helped blow apart in Iraq, such as water and electricity supply, housing, hospitals, and schools for Iraqi children. We do not support the second part of this motion. That is why the Leader of the Opposition moved on Tuesday that the House:</para><para>... is of the opinion that:</para><para>(a)	Australia's international security policy should have as its principal priorities:</para><para>(i)	the on-going war against terrorism;</para><para>(ii)	enhancing the security and stability of our immediate region; and</para><para>(iii)	the protection of Australians both at home and overseas;</para><para>(b)	any Australian Government committing Australian forces overseas should have a defined exit strategy for the eventual withdrawal of those forces;</para><para>(c)	the Howard Government has previously provided public undertakings to the Australian people ruling out a post-war Australian military commitment in Iraq altogether or else limiting that commitment to months, not years;</para><para>(d)	Australian military forces in Iraq should be withdrawn from that country as soon as practicable once Australia's responsibilities as an Occupying Power have been discharged with the intention of returning our forces to Australia by the end of 2004;</para><para>(e)	Australia should continue to provide strong levels of humanitarian assistance and economic reconstruction assistance to the Iraqiâ</para><para><inline font-style="italic">A division having been called in the House of Representativesâ</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Sitting suspended from 11.18 a.m. to 11.30 a.m.</inline></para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83Y</name.id><name role="metadata">Hoare, Kelly, MP</name><name role="display">Ms HOARE</name></talker><para>âThe final point of the Leader of the Opposition's amendment is:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>(f) all members of this Parliament express their unqualified support for the courage and professionalism of the members of the Australian Defence Force deployed to Iraq and the surrounding region.</para></quote><para>As I said, this debate is happening less than 100 days out from the Iraqis taking control of the government in their own country. While this debate is happening here, and while the occupying forces are still in Iraq, an independent commission into the 11 September 2001 attacks is currently being held in the USA. The national commission in America is made up of five Republicans and five Democrats and is due to report by 26 July this year. One of the people who have testified before the national commission in America is Richard Clarke. Richard Clarke was President Bush's top counter-terrorism expert until he resigned in February 2003 after serving in every US government since the Reagan administration. He has been reported on US television, and one of the main quotes from Mr Clarke is quite telling. He said on American television: </para><quote><para>... to those who are here in the room, to those who are watching on television, your government failed you, those entrusted with protecting you failed you and I failed you.</para></quote><para>This continues on from David Kay, the weapons inspector, who said in January that he did not believe there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.</para><para>This independent commission is investigating the 2001 hijacked plane attacks in New York and on the Pentagon. Mr Clarke said in his evidence that President Bush took him aside the day after the September 11 attacks and ordered him to `see if Saddam did this. See if he's linked in any way.' Clarke said he responded that al-Qaeda was responsible and that Iraq was not linked to the attacks. However, with Bush's insistence, he agreed to look into the request and again found no cooperation between Saddam and al-Qaeda. So not only are questions being asked in Australia about the reasons why Australia invaded Iraq but there are also questions that are now going to be aired through the national commission in the USA.</para><para>I want to also look at what has happened and what is happening in Iraq. I have already mentioned the devastation of the infrastructure of Iraqâthe loss of power and water and the bombed schools, hospitals and homesâbut I want to look at some of the statistics. I refer to an opinion analysis in the <inline font-style="italic">Newcastle Herald </inline>at the end of March by Phillip O'Neill, the Director of the Centre for Regional and Urban Studies at the University of Newcastle. He refers to an American newspaper and says:</para><quote><para>If you read it with a young son's image in your mind you will be shocked, for the story reports that eight American 18-year-olds have been killed ...</para><para>Also dead are 34 American sons and daughters aged 19 years, 53 aged 20 years, 52 aged 21, 39 aged 22, 32 aged 23, 36 aged 24, 28 aged 25, 36 aged 26, 28 aged 27, and the list goes on.</para></quote><para>He goes on to talk about the US:</para><quote><para>... maintaining a massive military force of 1,400,000 active service personnel, about 150,000 of whom are in Iraq. By comparison, Australia's defence forces number about 50,000 with about 850 in Iraq.</para><para>So far, 545 young men and 17 young women from across America have died in Iraq, most of them since President Bush declared a cessation to combat on May 1 last year.</para><para>Most were young, denied a good shot at the American dream of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.</para></quote><para>Phillip O'Neill concludes:</para><quote><para>Eventually history will judge if they have died in vain.</para></quote><para>Point (d) of the amendment by the Leader of the Opposition refers to Australia's responsibilities as an occupying power. On 13 April, our shadow foreign affairs spokesman, Kevin Rudd, issued a statement that clearly defined Australia's responsibilities as an occupying power under the terms of the fourth Geneva convention. In that statement he noted on behalf of the federal parliamentary Labor Party: </para><quote><para>The Geneva Convention confirms that as one of the three combatant states in Iraq, Australia is now one of the three âOccupying Powersâ in Iraq.</para><para>Australia's status as an Occupying Power has been confirmed by the UN Secretary General, the British Government and even Prime Minister Howard (albeit with great reluctance).</para></quote><para>The convention outlines what precise responsibilities occupying powers have towards the civilian population of the country they are occupying. These responsibilities include the maintenance of law and order, the provision of health and hospital services to the local people and the operation of basic infrastructure such as electricity, water and roads. Australia's responsibilities are therefore clear cut. We have nine months to ensure that we adhere to the Geneva convention that we participate in the building of infrastructure in Iraq.</para><para>Government members have been talking a bit about the interview in which the Leader of the Opposition indicated that he would like, as a Labor Prime Minister, to see the withdrawal of the troops from Iraq and the troops in Iraq home by Christmas. We need to look at the transcript to get a correct understanding of that interview. The Leader of the Opposition said:</para><quote><para>We believe we have a responsibility to rebuild that country and as soon as that responsibility is discharged they should be back here. Hopefully that will be before the end of the year. Under a Labor Government our strategy is to get them back as soon as that responsibility is discharged, and you have got a sovereign hand over to a new Iraq Government.</para></quote><para>The interview went on, and the Leader of the Opposition said:</para><quote><para>Things can go wrong things can get pushed back a while, but our intention is to ensure that once the responsibility is discharged and that is at the time of the hand over to the new sovereign Government in Iraq then Australian troops will come back under a Labor Government.</para></quote><para>It is quite clear that we understand that things can go wrong in the takeover, that we have a responsibility to help the Iraqi people rebuild their infrastructure, that we have a responsibility to help the Iraqi people embark on a democratic processâwhich would mean providing electoral supportâand that we have a responsibility to provide continued aid to help Iraq rebuild its community and its society. Hopefully all of that can be done over the next nine months by our troops that are already there. In that interview the Leader of the Opposition concluded:</para><quote><para>Yes well if that timetable of mid year is adhered to then that would be the case.</para></quote><para>That is, the troops would be home by Christmas under a Labor government. I spoke about the statistics of the war in Iraq and the number of US service personnel killed. As well as those, there have been 22 armed forces suicides to the end of 2003, 600 troops in America are absent without leave to avoid service in Iraq and a further 3,273 troops have been injured in the invasion of Iraq.</para><para>I have a friendâDonna Mulhearnâwho is well known in the Hunter region. During the war she was a human shield. She went back to Iraq to help the children that she befriended during that time and to set up an orphanage. In conclusion, I would like to quote from her email sent to us at the beginning of the year. This is what it is like on the ground and why we want our troops home by Christmas. She said:</para><quote><para>I tried to talk to the soldiers, to ask them how they felt, but they didn't want to chat with me. They responded angrily prompting one bystander (who looked and sounded remarkably like me) to challenge their presence here ... One soldier responded in no uncertain terms: âWe don't want to be here! I have a wife and a daughter at home, do you think I want to be here?â </para><para>So the soldiers don't want to be here. the Iraqis don't want them here. It seems one point on which both sides here agree! It's just a few politicians sitting behind desks on the other side of the world who want these young kids to risk their lives for a mission they admit they don't understand.</para></quote><para><inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>28105</page.no><name role="metadata">Nairn, Gary, MP</name><name role="display">Mr NAIRN</name><name.id>OK6</name.id><electorate>Eden-Monaro</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would like to put on the record my support for the Prime Minister's motion and, in supporting this motion, show my strong support for the troops that are in Iraq and for the job they are doing. I repeat the motion that is before the House:</para></talk.start><para>That this House:</para><para>(1)	expresses its continued support for and confidence in the 850 Australian Defence Force personnel currently deployed in or around Iraq and records its deep appreciation for the outstanding professionalism they have displayed in carrying out their duties; and</para><para>(2)	is of the opinion that no elements of this contingent of Australian Defence Force personnel should be withdrawn until their respective tasks have been completed and that no arbitrary times should be set for such withdrawal.</para><para>That is all commonsense stuff, and it is strongly supported by the government. Unfortunately, the second part of the motion is not supported by the opposition. But I certainly support it very strongly.</para><para>In my view, this whole episode really shows up the incredible contrast between the government and the opposition. The government is operating extremely professionally, working with our defence forces, working with the people who understand these issues on the ground and working closely with all of the various agencies to do the best possible job. This very professional approach from the government is contrasted with the most incredibly amateurish, cavalier way in which the Labor opposition handles these very serious matters. This seems to be an ongoing thing. It does not matter whether it is our national security, the deployment of troops or any other portfolio policy area, at the moment we are seeing this amateurish, cavalier way in which policies and various announcements are being made. We saw it with the superannuation announcement, where a definitional error was put down by Mr Latham as, `Sorry, just a definitional error'âa mere $8 billion definitional error. I understand that the announcement that was hurriedly put together over the last couple of days and announced yesterday out in Queanbeyan, in my electorate, also has some question marks over it about some aspects of the funding. The constant amateurish way in which they are going about announcing and developing policy is in stark contrast to the way in which the government handles these issues.</para><para>I think the opposition leader has in fact dug himself into a hole over this. To me it is obvious what his modus operandi has been with respect to many policies. He is picking out various issues that he thinks are popular out there in the broader community and throwing something in each day, deciding on a different one every second day. That is how we got this notion of `let us get the troops home by Christmas'. He probably thought, `That will run pretty well with the people out there in voter land. Everybody will want the boys back for Christmas.' It was that sort of attitude. It was another one of those almost throwaway lines and populist comments, but it is backfiring. So now he is scurrying around trying to work out a way in which to get around that. Hopefully the people out there in voter land take notice of this sort of operation by the opposition and see that stark contrast that I mentioned. Sure, it sounded like a popular thing, but it was not. As we have seen from many people and many quarters around the nation since he made that announcement, even people who were opposed to our troops going to Iraq in the first place have come out very strongly, saying, `But they need to be there for however long they have to be there to do the job that is required.' </para><para>What is that job they are doing? It is quite varied. We have got in the order of 850 people, all told. There are 150 with the Hercules contingent. They are doing a variety of airlift work. In fact, the Hercules are the principal means for Australian officials to get in to Baghdad, because there are no commercial flights. We have got 80 air traffic controllers, managing those sorts of issues at Baghdad International Airport. There are 53 Army trainers, training the new Iraqi army. From the Navy training team, 12 will be there this month. They are going there in April. That is all incredibly vital to Iraq's security right across the board. We have 270 on HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Melbourne</inline>, conducting maritime interception operations in the northern gulf, and we have got another 160 involved with the P3C Orions, conducting maritime patrols and support to counter-terrorism operations. So they are doing a very important job.</para><para>The security aspect of personnel cannot be overstated. We have heard reports this morning of a number of American civilians who have been killed in an attack in a town near Baghdadâcivilians there doing the job of helping to reconstruct Iraq. Those sorts of people need to be protected. Our troops are doing a variety of that sort of work. There are constituents from my electorate in Iraq. The Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation has a contract for getting the power back on in northern Iraq. I certainly want to make sure that those people, from a company based in my electorate of Eden-Monaro, are secure. So we need to continue to do our job there.</para><para>How important those key positions are came out last Friday at a hearing of the Defence Subcommittee here in Canberra on US-Australian relations. During those hearings a number of questions were asked of defence officials about the positions that our personnel are occupying in Iraq. Defence official after defence expert who gave evidence last Friday clearly stated the important role of those people in Iraq. There are issues here that I am sure the opposition leader has not even given one second of thought to, because a number of the Australian troops are holding down particular positions within the overall structure in Iraq that are vital to the work they are doing now. If you pull them out, somebody might be able to replace themâbut not easily, because our people are so highly regarded. That is the first thing that would happen if you pulled them out prematurely.</para><para>The second thing that would happen if you pulled them out prematurely is you would deny those people incredible experience. The defence officials, in the hearing last Friday, went through the very good experience that those people are getting. You can do all sorts of operations with our foreign allies, but there is nothing like being there amongst the real thing. The type of work they are doing will bode well for those troops in the future.</para><para>The third thing that would happen if we pulled them out, and this was made clear as well in our hearings, is it may cause a problem in our relations with our allies. Our allies are relying upon those people to continue to do the jobs they are doing. If all of a sudden they are pulled out, our allies have to make arrangements to have them replaced, and that may not go down all that well. Our relationship with the US is clearly a vital matter that needs to be further developed. At the moment, it is probably as high as it has ever been, and that is a very good position for Australia to be in, for our own future security. You would not want to do anything to compromise that. But the opposition leader's announcement will certainly compromise that. </para><para>Clearly, thought was not given to that decision. You would normally expect, before a person in that position made such a statement, a series of very detailed briefings from the full cross-section of people within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Defence. That has not happened. We know it has not happened. Various senior officials of those departments have written to the Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence telling them that those briefings have not happened. What has happened is that, out of some other briefings which were designed for a totally different purpose, the opposition leader claims that he is fully on top of all these matters. There is no way in the world that the standard briefings that he had after he became the opposition leader could in any way equip him with the necessary information to make the policy decision that he made.</para><para>The opposition leader never intended that. When he became opposition leader he was asked, `What are you going to do about pulling the troops out?' He said: `I can't really make that sort of decision now; I have only just been elected. I need to get very detailed briefings. I will need to talk to these people and those people.' You would expect that, at the very least, he would have talked to the Chief of the Defence Force and/or the Chief of Army and/or the Chief of Navy and/or the Chief of Air Force. But none of that has been doneânot even involving some officials below those key personnel. It is an extremely amateurish way in which to develop foreign policy and I think he has been caught out something dreadful in that respect.</para><para>In finishing, I reiterate that I strongly support our troops and I strongly support that they should do the job that they have been sent to do and not be pulled out prematurely until they complete that job. I want to see the great work that they are doing in Iraq continue to assist Iraq to form its democracy. I want to see the security of not only the Iraqi people but also the various personnel in Iraq maintained, including people from companies like the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation, who are helping to get the power back on in various parts of Iraq. Let all the personnel in Iraq get on with the job without such pressure being applied to them by the Leader of the Opposition.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>28107</page.no><name role="metadata">Price, Roger, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PRICE</name><name.id>QI4</name.id><electorate>Chifley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt is a pleasure to speak in this debate. I listened closely to the member for Eden-Monaro. I wonder whether, on some future opportunity, he will inform the House of what he thinks of the recommendation by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade that the Howard government develop an exit strategy for peace monitors in Bougainville, which the government ultimately accepted. We are debating whether it is the Australian way to `cut and run', as the Prime Minister describes itâthat is, to leave before the job is finished. `It is a longstanding philosophy,' says the Prime Minister. That is interesting. In the first and largest deployment of infantry after the Vietnam War we sent troops to Somalia, and we did it the Labor way. What is the Labor way? We set a firm time line and we extracted those troops. Yes, it is true that in the Australian area of operationânot that we had a civilian infrastructureâelders pleaded with us to stay. What did the Prime Minister say about that? What did the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer, say about that? </para></talk.start><para>I say to the member for Eden-Monaro and other members of the government: `Go and look at the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record,' because they said absolutely nothing. If you had listened to the Prime Minister today, you would believe that we should have had troops in there until we had a <inline font-style="italic">Black Hawk Down</inline> incident ourselves. But when Labor send troops overseas, we value the lives of our serving men and women. We understand that we put them in harm's wayâthey are not playthings. They are not things to make political points out of. We need to value those lives. We need to value the service of those men and women. Labor administrations, whether you talk about Somaliaâand it is exactly the case for Rwandaâgo in there for a finite time, set goals, exit strategy and pull them out. Irrespective of whether our coalition partners, friends and allies want them, that is what we have done in the past. </para><para>The Prime Minister says, `Oh, cut and run.' I could accept that if he had at least once got up in the House and said, `We object to you pulling the troops out from Somalia,' because, arguably, the job was not done. Somalia is still a lawless state. It is the same with Rwanda: we could have had troops there for years if we wanted to. I make this other point: we are an occupation force in Iraq. This is not some peacekeeping mission; we are an occupation force. That responsibility ends when a new civilian administration takes over in Iraq, as it should. We all have a vested interest in seeing a democratic Iraqâan Iraq that respects human lives, an Iraq free from tyranny. There is no argument about that, but at some point you have to transition from the troops being the primary force there to other forms of aid. What Mark Latham as the Leader of the Opposition has said is, `We'll pull them out by Christmas.' He did not say, `We're going to pull them out if we have an opportunity on the day after the transition to a civilian authority.' No, he said, `We'll pull them out by Christmas.' Even this government is pulling out some of the troopsâsome of the air traffic controllersâby May. That is your own defence minister saying that. Why are you cutting and running on air traffic controllers? But this is just a debate about hypocrisy. This is a debate about wanting to politicise what is in Australia's interest.</para><para>The other thing I wanted to say is this: there has been a lot of discussion this week about the role of intelligence agencies, whether or not you can have a briefing from an intelligence agency and canvass some issues. The first thing I wanted to say is that these things are confidential. It is quite usual for ministers to be aware that someone is being briefed but not the detail of the briefings. That is being politicised by the Prime Minister. Here we were in this Main Committee debating an intelligence report by the joint intelligence committee of this parliamentâchaired by a coalition memberâthat was furiously leaked before it was ever tabled, and we all know that that leaking came out of a minister's office. Here we have the Prime Minister writing to intelligence agencies seeking details of the briefing and then wanting to argue with the Leader of the Opposition about whether he had adequate briefings upon which to base his decision to withdraw the troops by Christmas. It is most extraordinary.</para><para>In fact, even worse was an argument that the Minister for Foreign Affairs made saying that Mr Latham had received no briefings whatsoever, putting the Leader of the Opposition in a diabolical position. To say yes he would have had to acknowledge the possibility that they could have been intelligence organisations. Mr Latham tried to craft it in a way to protect those confidential briefings. He said it was the Department of Foreign Affairsâin other words, ASISâand Defence officials. That was not good enough for the Prime Minister. He had to go to the heart of the matter and discover the Leader of the Opposition had had intelligence briefings. What better person, I might say, to get a briefing from than the head of the Defence Intelligence Organisation, the Defence Signals Directorate and our geospatial organisation. This bloke heads them all up, and they are trying to say he would not have known. </para><para>I am pleased to say that we on the joint foreign affairs committee received a confidential briefing from Defence intelligence. I cannot go to the nature and detail of that, but I can tell you we were talking about things 10 and 15 years out and assessing their views. I have to say I respect their views. In fact, I found some of them in accord with my own. I respect them.</para><para>Not only did the Leader of the Opposition have these briefings but, more importantly, he acted consistent with Labor Party policy: that is, we do not have indefinite commitments. Look at the commitments this Howard government has made in relation to committing troops: Bougainville was open ended; East Timor was open ended. Yes, we are bringing them out; I admit we are bringing them out. But they were very open-ended commitments. There is no concern for the lives of our serving men and women, with no defined exit strategy developed. There is also the Solomon Islands. I hope to see the troops out by the middle of the year, to be frank with you. They have done an excellent job. But I do not think that if we bring them out by the middle of the year we are saying we can cut and run, because there is still a lot to be done in the Solomon Islands.</para><para>The other thing I want to mention is the extraordinary circumstance of Howard government ministers outing directly and indirectly the role of ASIS. I have never seen that before. There are people in this place with longer memories than me, but I have never seen that before. It is embarrassing; it is a disgrace. I suppose if you have a government that is going to leak a joint report by the intelligence committee, it should not be unexpected. But it is clear that in this unprecedented outing of ASIS and its role and the location of its agents we are putting some lives at riskâall to score political points.</para><para>Why can't we just have a decent debate about the fact that the Howard government likes open-ended commitments and the Labor Party, when in government, has always had a defined term of commitment and gets the troops out to allow the country to transition? Why do we have to wait for a `Black Hawk Down' in Iraq? That is what I would like the government members to tell me. When you get up to speak, tell us why we should have to have a `Black Hawk Down' in Iraq. Isn't it going to be better for Iraq to grapple with the difficulties that they have? Isn't there a need, with a new administration in Iraq, for there to be a regional response there to the problems? The Leader of the Opposition has been flayed by government members because he said, `My priority is the defence of Australia. We should have our troops back here.'</para><para>We have sent an unprecedented number of troops to the Solomon Islands because it is a failed state. This government has tried to take some action in Papua New Guinea but is waiting for a joint resolution of that country's parliament before it can become effective. But make no mistake about it: the jury is still out in PNG, and in terms of defence tasks that could be one of our significant jobsâI use a different word usuallyâand a significant challenge for us. But it is not the only failing state. The Philippines is now listed as a failing state. These will present monumental challenges for the region if we do not transform their status, if we do not get in there as a friendly country and help. Any one of them could become an issue at very short notice. The deterioration in the Solomons was quite dramatic. I might say, in response to `cut and run', that it is interesting that the Howard government rejected a much earlier request by the former Prime Minister for a battalion to go to the Solomonsâ`No, we're not going to send a battalion over there.' That is why we need troops back here. In fact, if anything, it is fair to say that in recent times the defence forces have been so stretched by the requirements of the government, which they honourably fulfil, that they actually need to get back and work up their skills. </para><para>I want to make this point: this government has adopted a policy not of one unit being deployed, one training up and one resting, but in twos. The Army sustainability model is based on the fact that one battalion is deployed and one is getting ready to leave, and when the one that has been deployed comes back it has to get ready to leave. That is a disgraceful state of affairs, particularly if we get involved in a longterm commitment like the one that East Timor represented for us, because we are supposed to be able to send a brigade and a battalion overseas, and the Army knows we cannot do it. We cannot sustain that in the long term. It is an utter disgrace. Therefore, we have to very carefully review each and every commitment we have. We should not place Australia and our region as a second-class priority when it comes to defence and security matters. </para><para>Last but not least, what has happened to the war on terrorism? As the member for Bendigo said in an interjection, we have a one-man war in Afghanistan: a lieutenant colonel is the only Australian military figure in Afghanistan tracking down the Taliban and Osama bin Laden. What a joke, when we are unctuously lectured about the war on terrorism. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>28110</page.no><name role="metadata">Ticehurst, Kenneth, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TICEHURST</name><name.id>00ANF</name.id><electorate>Dobell</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to support the Prime Minister's motion and acknowledge the great contribution of the ADF troops and the other Australians serving in Iraq. It is a crying shame that the ALP, through cynical vote-grabbing manoeuvres, have put at risk the stature of Australia as a world leading country. Australians do not cut and run. Australians have always stood up and been counted when it really mattered. It matters now that we stay to finish the job.</para></talk.start><para>Unfortunately, the ALP have sent the wrong message abroad before. I have spoken to ADF troops who served in Iraq last year during the war phase. They were confronted by US troops who, having got their story from the US media, had a view that our country did not support our troops being there, fighting alongside the US troops. Fortunately, the Australian troops were able to explain that only some Australians supported the ALP, the Greens and this insular view. How tragic it is that this sort of propaganda has been circulating among our courageous troops.</para><para>The majority of Australians know and understand the consequences of allowing a sadistic dictator who supported terrorists to be given a free rein to continue his evil ways. When I went for an interview for my second job, my future boss asked me if I ever made mistakes. My answer was: `It does happen sometimes.' He was pleased with my answer, because everybody makes mistakes. As he explained, it is just as well, because if you cover up a mistake you will eventually be found out, and the more you try to hide the error the more problems are created, and eventually the situation becomes far worse in the long run.</para><para>This is exactly what is happening to the Leader of the Opposition. He has compounded his mistake of `policy on the run' to bring troops home by Christmas; he has shown the failings of his one-man-band leadership by ignoring the member for Griffith's knowledge on the subject; he has shown his inability to be truthful to the Australian publicâand, in doing all of this, he has put our troops, the people of Iraq and the reputation of Australia at risk. This graphic illustration of absolute inexperience does not bode well for Australia if ever this nation has the misfortune of having Mr Latham as Prime Minister. As Barry Cohen, a former member of the Whitlam government, has said in newspaper articles in my electorate, `The problem with today's Labor Party is that they are all ex-unionists or ex-lawyers or ex-staffers, and they have no experience in a real-world job.' This is exactly the case with the Leader of the Opposition. He has been a staffer to John Kerin, to Gough Whitlam and to Bob Carr. He has never had a real job, he has never worked in industry. </para><para>The Australian government have indicated that Australian led air traffic control functions are likely to have concluded by the time the transition of power to the Iraqi authority occurs in mid-2004âthis is of course once the 80 or so air traffic controllers can be replaced with a new, trained Iraqi army. Many would see this as a confirmation of our position: to stay until the job is done. Only the opposition leader, with his twisted rationale, could conclude that this reflects government hypocrisy.</para><para>The Leader of the Opposition simply cannot be trusted. He failed to get advice from the head of Foreign Affairs on this issue. He failed to get advice from the head of the Department of Defence. He failed to get advice from the Chief of the Defence Force. In other words, the very people he said he would get advice from, the very people whose advice is relevant to forming a balanced judgment as to whether or not we should remain in Iraq, are the very people with whom the Leader of the Opposition has failed to liaise and of whom he has failed to ask the right questions.</para><para>The Leader of the Opposition has not given any thought to this issue. Given the likelihood that the current levels of violence being experienced in Iraq will continue past July 2004, the withdrawal of approximately 90 personnel performing escort and protection duties would make the conduct of general business by other Australian government personnel in Iraq extremely hazardous. Without the escort and protection provided by combat personnel, other Australian government personnel are likely to face the risk of assassination unless a similar escort, by other coalition or Iraqi forces, can be provided.</para><para>Even if such a level of escort could be provided by other international contingents, these other Australian government personnel would need to adjust their movements to accord with the timetables under which security could be provided by these other contingents. Such adjustments would undoubtedly hamper the current speed with which Australian officials can move about in Iraq. Allowing this to occur would also require some surrender of Australian dignity. How could the Leader of the Opposition's policy not allow for this? Because his is a reactive policyâit is bad policy and, as I have said before, it is policy on the run.</para><para>The greatest threat to terrorists is a free, independent and democratic Iraq. Australia plays a critical role in ensuring that Iraq completes its transition from tyranny to democracy. Some 53 Australian Army and 12 Navy personnel are helping to build a new state through the training of the Iraqi defence force and the Iraqi police. How can we leave these budding forces before they are fully trained? How can we leave Iraq before our job is done?</para><para>The Labor Party knows that the return of the 850 Australian defence personnel assigned to Iraq would not substantially alter the broader tasks and capabilities undertaken by 51,000 Australian Army and Navy troops in the Australian region. Comments by the Labor Party and the Greens that Australia, with its large landmass and small population, needs its Defence Force personnel at home defy the obvious, fundamental differences between second-generation warfare and today's war on terror. Indeed, we heard the member for Chifley talk about there being no exit strategyâno fixed time frame. There is no time frame for terrorists. Challenging the asymmetric threats posed by terrorist networks cannot be done through battlefield linearity and the reliance on masses of men poised near the border, awaiting invading armies. That is what you did in the old days; that is what happened in the past. The ways of war need to be revised for this new kind of terrorâit knows no bounds.  </para><para>Intelligence is vital. The war against terror is fought primarily with good intelligence. Look at what has just happened in Britain. The British intelligence forces have found that six Britons who were going about their daily lives normally were actually terrorists. They uncovered quite a lot of bomb-making materials. Britain surely has thousands and thousands of army personnel in Britain, as they do in Iraq, but it was intelligence that uncovered this unseemly act about to occur.</para><para>Indeed, even in Madrid it was stated in a newspaper article that the vehicle carrying the explosives was stopped due to a traffic offence. Because the vehicle was not reported stolen, the police in that country let them go, to go on to do their evil thing. An army was not there to stop themâan army could not stop them. The problem is that the Labor Party does not understand the simple ways of terrorism. It does not understand that terrorism knows no boundaries and that to remain insular is not to remain safe. If we are to protect Australia from the long-term threat of terrorist attack, we cannot walk away from our responsibility. Spain, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Turkey, France, Germany and Russia have all experienced al-Qaeda attacks. This is not because they were in Iraq, for not all of them were. </para><para>This is the wrong time to get out of Iraq. Withdrawal from Iraq may raise doubts in US circles about broader Australian willingness to commit military to the war on terror in areas beyond our immediate region. This may have a twofold impact. Australia may forgo the opportunity to interdict terrorist operations in havens which are intended to target Australia directly. It may also raise doubts in US minds about the value of the ANZUS alliance. Why can the Leader of the Opposition not see that this is a highly unstable time to turn our backs on our friends and allies in the fight against terrorism? If Australia and the rest of the world react wrongly to the tragedy in Madrid and rush to withdraw our defence forces from Iraq before the job is done, what kind of message is going to be sent to the terrorists who thrive on weaknesses?</para><para>The Leader of the Opposition has not only made a fundamentally bad decision about the deployment of our forces in Iraq but also given the worst impression possible. He is saying that, if enough pressure is applied by terrorists, he will bow down to them by changing Australian policy accordingly. We need to be emanating the message that Australia does not bow to terrorism. Terrorism, far from weakening the resolve of this country, merely strengthens our resolve to finish the job and make the world a safer place.</para><para>I conclude by asking the Leader of the Opposition to stop compounding bad policy with misinformation to the Australian public, to acknowledge that Australia as a nation has a political and moral obligation to finish the job in Iraq and to cease engaging in cynical, political, poll driven populism. We Australians have never been ones to shirk our duty and responsibility when it comes to international events. We always stay until the job is finished, and Iraq is no different. We cannot walk away from building a new Iraq. We cannot pretend the threat of attack does not exist. Let us work with our friends and allies to fight against this war on terror.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>28113</page.no><name role="metadata">Organ, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ORGAN</name><name.id>BNL</name.id><electorate>Cunningham</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI welcome the opportunity to speak on the Prime Minister's motion relating to the Australian Defence Force personnel in and around Iraq. As I told the House during my truncated contribution to the debate on Tuesday, I support our troops. No-one should have any doubt that the Australian Greens and all Australians support our troops. However, I do not support this motion, which the Prime Minister has turned into a cheap political stunt by tying support for our troops in Iraq to the question of their eventual withdrawal. </para></talk.start><para>The call for Australian troops to be withdrawn from Iraq is one which the Greens have been making since last year, and we are not alone in that. Indeed, my colleague in the other place Senator Bob Brown included the call in the 10-point plan titled `How to make Australia a proud, compassionate, independent nation', which he offered publicly to the opposition leader on 2 December last year, following his appointment.</para><para>The Greens are not alone in calling for the withdrawal of troops. For example, there is a growing campaign in the United States calling for exactly the same thing. In that regard I draw the attention of members to a rally held at Fayetteville, Fort Bragg, North Carolina on 20 March 2004, just a couple of weeks ago. That rally was, like many rallies, rather emotional. It was addressed by a retired US Special Forces Master Sergeant, Stan Goff. I would like to read out what he told the rally, as it is relevant to the motion now before us, I believe:</para><quote><para>The Bush administration is a gangster administration, and they have used gangster tactics at home and abroad, and they have signed our names to their crimes, and they have spent our treasure on their crimes, and they have spilled out children's blood and the blood of the children of others to commit their crimes, and we have hadâby Godâenough. </para><para>And we are not going to sit idly by and pretend about this. We are not going to pretend that we haven't heard that John Kerry's only criticism of this war is that it isn't being fought competently. We are not going to pretend that this is not about oil. We are not going to pretend that this was an intelligence failure. We are not going to pretend that this is something we can change by being civil or by being obedient. We will not be civil with gangsters, and we'd better learn to quit obeying them. Because it is our obedience that co-signs their crimes, and it is our silence that will make us complicit. </para><para>So we will not be silent, and we will not be obedient, and we will not stand downâno matter how long it takes, no matter the cost, no matter the effort, because we are fighting for our children and our grandchildren who we will not surrender to gangsters. </para><para>We are not going away. This may be called the instant gratification society, but hear us right now, George Bush and Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld and John Kerry for that matterâwe are not an instant gratification movement, and we are not here to make deals with the lives of our children or the children of others. </para><para>NOT ONE MORE DAY.</para><para>NOT ONE MORE DIME.</para><para>NOT ONE MORE LIFE.</para><para>NOT ONE MORE LIE.</para><para>BRING THEM ALL HOME NOW!</para></quote><para>So it was a very impassioned address by US Special Forces Master Sergeant Stan Goff, and I make no apology for drawing it to the attention of honourable members. You see, there is more.</para><para>The <inline font-style="italic">New York Times </inline>of 26 March 2004 reported that 75 per cent of US soldiers in Iraq say command leadership is poor and lacks concern for troops, while 52 per cent say morale is low or worse. And this is the United States' war. The troops, and their families, are sick of the war and want to go home. The movement is growing and it is becoming a political threat to President George W. Bush's re-election chances. Perhaps that is why the Prime Minister is so reluctant to commit to an exit strategy: he is still supporting his `great and powerful friend'.  </para><para>I therefore reject the Prime Minister's motion as it was presented to the House, relating to Australian Defence Force personnel in and around Iraq. We had a vote on the first part of the motion, for which there was unanimous support, but the second part of the subsequently split motion I must say we still reject. The Prime Minister is the same man who told us the war was about weapons of mass destruction, but he now says it was about regime change. The cold, hard truth is that it was about neither of those issues. It was about oil. The rest of the world is coming to realise that. We knew at the time the war started that that was also at the heart of it. Consider what Canada's former Ambassador to the United Nations wrote in the <inline font-style="italic">Toronto Globe and Mail</inline> on 19 March this year:</para><quote><para>Rarely in life is a decision so quickly and thoroughly vindicated as Canada's decision to opt out of the war in Iraq. A year later, the stated <inline font-style="italic">casus belli</inline> has evaporated. No weapons of mass destruction have been found, despite the best efforts of more than a thousand American weapons inspectors with free rein. No connection to al-Qaeda has been established. No persuasive argument endures about the urgency of the U.S. need to act.</para></quote><para>...	...	...</para><quote><para>The most obvious consequence is that the United States and its posse are caught in a morass. They cannot end the occupation precipitously without triggering a civil war and undoing the good they have done in removing Saddam Hussein. They cannot stay in Iraq without losing more soldiers and more money. Echoes of Vietnam. Meanwhile, the Iraqi toll also rises. As one ... ambassador at the United Nations put it, the Americans have swallowed a razor and nothing they do now will be painless or cost-free.</para><para>The cost to U.S. interests extends well beyond Iraq. In December, the U.S. Advisory Group on Public Diplomacy for the Arab and Muslim World, headed by former U.S. ambassador to Israel and Syria, Edward Djerejian, reported that âthe bottom has indeed fallen out of support for the United States.â According to a poll released this week by the Pew Research Centre, international discontent with the United States and its foreign policy has intensified rather than diminished since last year. In some Muslim countries, support for the United States is in the single digits. Pew found little change in the overwhelmingly negative attitudes of countries toward the Iraq war. In Britain, support has plummeted from 61 per cent last year to 43 per cent now. The Globe and Mail/CTV News poll found that two-thirds of Canadians believe that President George W. Bush âknowingly lied to the worldâ about Iraq. </para><para>Nor are all the critics foreign. The war, according to a report of the U.S. Army War College, was a strategic error, a distraction from the war on terrorism. Beyond the neo-cons, few see terrorism as monolithic. The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace found that weapons of mass destruction were not an immediate threat, inspections were working, the terrorism connection was missing and war was not the best or only option.</para></quote><para>In the face of all that, our Prime Minister wants our troops to stay in Iraq. That is impossible to comprehend. The same man who told us that our troops would be committed in Iraq for months, not years, now wants an open-ended deployment, and we cannot support that.

I refer to the ludicrous answers of the Minister for Transport and Regional Services to my questions on notice. This government not only has betrayed the Calder Highway but also is butchering history to legitimise its atrocious performance. This government, after winning the 1996 federal election, promised under its Roads of National Importance program to go fifty-fifty with the Victorian government to duplicate the Calder Highway all the way to Bendigo. It has repeatedly promised to match the funding put up by the state government for each section of the work. It distinctly stated two years ago that the finishing date was originally set at 2002-03. It failed. Through its candidate for Bendigo in the last federal election, Mr Maurie Sharkey, a decent man who was misused by this government, the Howard government specifically promised Bendigo to complete it by the Bracks government's deadline of 2006. Now it wants to wreck that too and blow out the completion date to well beyond 2010.</para></talk.start><para>Bendigo region people know this government by its appalling Calder history and will not trust any panic promise it cooks up to restart funding the Calder on the way to the next election. This road is now notorious: `John Howard's Calder Lie Way'. He has never delivered on it, and what he promised to deliver he never will deliver. All his Calder promises have crashed. It is a city-centred government that wants a two-class roadâa fast duplicated highway all the way from Melbourne to Kyneton and then a goat track from Kyneton to Ravenswood. That section of the Calder would just be a passing lane if it were put next to any of the other major highways in Victoria.</para><para>Last year, for the first time, the transport minister, Mr Anderson, in reply to my question, made the outrageous claim that the Howard government had already fully met its commitment to the Calder and that it not provide any RONI funding for the Calder north of Kyneton. That claim is rubbish. The original commitment was duplication all the way to Bendigo. It took the minister 142 days to answer this week my further question to him about the government's commitment. He now claims that the Howard government's commitment was not to duplicate the Calder from Melbourne to Bendigo but merely to `begin the task of upgrading the worst sections' between Melbourne and Mildura. This is yet another of the coalition's Calder cop-outs. Note the language: only to begin the work and not to finish it, and only what he chooses to list as the worst sections. He talks as though he promised only to fill up the occasional pothole along the Calder. Maybe he promised only to start to fill them up. Maybe he meant only to fill up the worst potholes. If he undertook to fix the worst, why has he pulled out of funding the appalling long sections between Kyneton and Ravenswood? The biggest pothole is in his promise: it extends all the way from Kyneton to Ravenswood. </para><para>The total cost of the Calder duplication, as originally promised by the Howard government, adds up to around $530 million. The Howard government has abandoned the Calder after paying just $100 millionâ17 per cent of the total costâinstead of the $265 million it should have paid under the RONI agreement. It really rankles with my electorate that the Bendigo region is the only major provincial region in the state without a duplicated highway to Melbourne. It is the only major provincial centre in Victoria that cops the Liberals' CityLink entry tax to drive into Melbourne and then pays a GST on top of that. This government refuses to duplicate the Calder to Bendigo, but it has duplicated the road taxes paid by Calder motorists driving to Melbourne. It is giving nothing back to the Calder. </para><para>Where did the money go? The Howard government stole it from the Calder to pay for the Scoresby Freeway. They robbed the Calder to pay for a RONI-come-lately. Even now, now that it is not needed for the Scoresby, this miserable government will not give it back to the Calder. What a contempt they have shown for central Victoria, as they have set out to sabotage the Bracks government's work on the Calder and let them go it alone. This is another of their petty wars on the state governments. They are happy to crush the Calder in central Victoria just for the joy of sniping at governments that do the jobs that the Liberals and Nationals will not do. There is not a single cent of federal money being spent on construction work on the Calder. The last new federal funding was before the election in 2001. Since then, there has been a five-year federal freeze on new Calder works and nothing to match the $70 million put down by the Victorian government for the next major stage.</para><para>We all know that the Howard government originally promised to complete the Calder to Bendigo, because the Minister for Transport and Regional Services' answer shows that they allocated $3.9 million to help plan works from Kyneton to Ravenswood. Why would they plan a project that they were not going to take on? He says that one of the two studies is finished, so why was there nothing in last year's federal budget for this year and nothing at least for another three years, to 2006-07? I questioned the minister 142 days ago on who made the funding decision to kill the Calder, who approved it and when. He will not say. He will not say, because the decision is so disgraceful that nobody will own up to it. The Howard government decided well ahead of the state election in 2002 to dump the Calder. Their crocodile tears over the Scoresby Freeway since last year were just another bogus excuse for backflipping on the Calder. It just shows the hypocrisy of the Treasurer's wailing over promises on the Scoresby Freeway while he himself welches on his promise to the Calder. Why didn't he speak up against Jeff Kennett's CityLink tolls on Calder motorists when they introduced them on the Tullamarine Freeway?</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Fuel: Ethanol</title><page.no>28116</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>28116</page.no><name role="metadata">Gash, Joanna, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs GASH</name><name.id>AK6</name.id><electorate>Gilmore</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âLast week during question time the opposition asked five questions specifically attacking Manildra and its owner, Dick Honan. While the questions were openly and fairly answered, their attempt to denigrate Manildra and Dick Honan only confirmed that the Labor Party intend to bring about the demise of Manildra. So preoccupied are they with Dick Honan that they are prepared to destroy the ethanol industry and the jobs that it brings. So preoccupied are they with their political needs that they have effectively said that Manildra, all of its employees and all those who depend on the business can go to hellâthis from the member for Fraser, a member who proudly displays his trade union credentials. The workers can cop it on the chin as long as the political ambitions of the Labor elite are satisfied. The fact that Manildra donated to both parties seems to have become irrelevant. Rather, the preoccupation is how much was donated and that somehow this is encouraging favourable treatment as a result. It is not my purpose to argue the pros and cons of these assertions. What I want to point out is that a whole industry is about to be sacrificed by the so-called champions of the workers and the environment. Here we have an ex-trade union leader willing to sacrifice 260 direct jobs at the Bomaderry mill, with another 60 to 70 contractors jobs and a downstream effect on another 1,700 jobs.</para></talk.start><para>The opposition spokesman on agriculture and fisheries is equally bereft of forward thinking. He supports the attack and thereby supports the demise of Manildra, the jobs and an opportunity to develop an alternative fuel industry. This is especially confounding since Labor constantly harps and whinges about the loss of jobs, the loss of industry. Here they are, doing exactly what they are railing against. What utter hypocrisy! What utter spivs! I doubt whether either of these two honourable members have been to Manildra and seen for themselves exactly what the industry is about. If they had, they would have gained a better appreciation of the negative effect of these tactics they are pursuing. A further irony is that most of these endangered employees are union members themselves. I just hope that their Labor representatives here in parliament have gone to the trouble of letting them know that they were playing with their livelihoods. If not, that only compounds the complete shallowness of this action. If not, then I would urge all of the unionised employees of Manildra to put pen to paper and let the honourable members know of their displeasure, tell them that they are not willing to be the pawns in their game, that they want their jobs and that they have families to support and mortgages to pay. </para><para>I want to reiterate my position on the ethanol industry and Manildra. I have spoken before on this subject in the House and, for the benefit of those that want to destroy the industry, I think it is necessary to repeat the message. Let me repeat a statement I made as recently as 19 February this year:</para><quote><para>I am not afraid of promoting ethanol against those who seek to question its reliability. When people look at the facts on ethanol, it is obvious that the campaign against it seeks to play on people's fears. Surely, if people were told the truth about the virtues of ethanol in fuel it would not be hard to appreciate the benefits of a clean-burning additive. In fact, it is the only fuel additive you can actually drink. Compare this to the harmful carcinogenic additives contained in other petrol ... Labor's campaign has made it hard enough for Manildra to sell ethanol ... If Manildra cannot shift its products, it stands to reason that it cannot continue.</para></quote><para>That statement holds true even more now, as Labor's deliberate and dishonest campaign escalates. They create a scare campaign and destroy the reputation of fine Australians and their companies all in the name of getting at the government. It is called point scoring. Given the level of ignorance that prevails in the Labor Party on ethanol, as evidenced by some of the debate we have heard, it is not surprising to see them resorting to a hysterical fear campaign. That is what they are good at. They have no policies. What are their plans to promote ethanol in Manildra and Bomaderry? That takes creative ideas and it takes hard work, and they are not up to that. Instead, they scare the people, because what would they know? They think people are stupid enough to believe what they have to say. I meant it then and I mean it now: this is pure politics, and the so-called party of the workers just does not seem to care. Again I issue an invitation to the honourable members on the other side to come and see Manildra for themselves, to see the jobs that are involved, and to see the work they do. Come and speak to their families about how you are attacking this ethanol industry and see how it affects them.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Hasluck Electorate: Kalamunda District Community Hospital</title><page.no>28117</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>28117</page.no><name role="metadata">Jackson, Sharryn, MP</name><name role="display">Ms JACKSON</name><name.id>00AN2</name.id><electorate>Hasluck</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThere is an important public meeting being held in my electorate of Hasluck this Sunday concerning Kalamunda District Community Hospital. At the outset I wish to record my continuing support for the hospital, its staff and the services they provide. They perform a vital function in our local area with care and with friendship. I am a strong advocate for the redevelopment of the hospital and a supporter of the proposal by local doctors to establish a new medical centre co-located on the hospital site. </para></talk.start><para>The local community has been kept waiting by respective state governments of both political persuasions since 1998 for the redevelopment of the hospital. Redevelopment of the hospital is necessary to ensure that our hospital can cater for the health requirements of the local community both now and into the future. It is critical for everybody involved to be bipartisan. Our motivation should be: what is in the best interests of quality health care services for our community?</para><para>I want to acknowledge the hard work of the local Kalamunda hospital redevelopment planning groupâconsisting of representatives from the community, the Perth and Hills Division of General Practice, the Kalamunda medical advisory committee and the Eastern Metropolitan Health Serviceâwho have worked over many months to develop an updated concept plan for the redevelopment of the hospital, which includes the proposed medical centre. The planning group was formed by the state government to progress the redevelopment of the hospital, and they have done a good job.</para><para>One area of disagreement that has become apparent is in the area of obstetrics. The obstetric service provided at the hospital is a very good one, with excellent clinicians andâmight I sayâeven better midwives. Many locals fondly talk of their own babies being born at Kalamunda hospital; in some cases generations of families started out at Kalamunda hospital. I want this service to continue, safely and responsibly, for our community. However, I understand from my discussions with various stakeholders that there are clinical concerns about the obstetrics service into the future. Appallingly high medical indemnity costs for GP obstetricians and a looming work force shortage of obstetricians have limited the number of specialist obstetricians available. In addition, there has been a state-wide review of obstetric services that has questioned the clinical safety and responsibility of continuing obstetric services in smaller hospitals such as Kalamunda. I would urge clinicians to address these concerns urgently to clarify what is required so that there is an appropriate clinical coverage to ensure the retention of a safe obstetric service at the hospital.</para><para>In addition to the direct concerns of the hospital, the main area of health concern is the ability of Hasluck constituents to access appropriate GP services. The number of GPs practising in Western Australia is decreasing and the Western Australian health department has said that an additional 600 to 700 GPs are needed for Western Australians to have the same per capita level of access to GP services as other Australians.</para><para>Though it has been widely acknowledged that Australians living in rural and remote areas have great difficulty accessing GP services, less recognition has been given to the situation in outer metropolitan areas. I have consulted local doctors and have been advised that the pressure on remaining practices and the doctors concerned is unsustainable. Concerns have also been raised by constituents regarding their inability to access a GP who bulk-bills. Over the past three years there has been a decline in bulk-billing of 12.4 per cent in my electorate to just 69.2 per cent in December 2003. This decline in bulk-billing is already causing some constituents to delay seeing a doctorâwhich has implications for their health status: that is, they get sicker before seeking assistanceâand/or to present at public hospitals for care.</para><para>This is the major reason why I am supporting the innovative proposal for a new co-located medical centre with investment from the private sector and the federal government. I note that the federal government, unlike the state government, has not given a commitment to supporting the proposed medical centre. I am astounded that the federal government short-changed Western Australia in the recent Commonwealth-state health agreement. In 1996, the Commonwealth share of health expenditure in Western Australia was 47 per cent. By 2002 it had fallen to 41 per cent. </para><para>I agree with the observations of Mike Broad, member of the legislative assembly and the state Liberal shadow health spokesperson. He said in state parliament on 19 November last year:</para><quote><para>Large amounts of money are being spent on primary health care by the State that ought to be paid for by the Commonwealth or provided more cheaply by a more adequate health care service or a secondary hospital closer to where people live.</para></quote><para>In conclusion, I would like to reiterate my support for the Kalamunda Hospital and the co-located medical centre. I further call on all levels of government and the local medical community to work together in the best health care interests of my constituents. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment: Kyoto Protocol</title><page.no>28119</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>28119</page.no><name role="metadata">King, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KING</name><name.id>00AMQ</name.id><electorate>Wentworth</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn the question of climate change policy, honourable members will be aware that it is now considered unlikely that the Kyoto protocol will be ratified, certainly not in the immediate future, as Russia, one of the critical signatories, has failed to sign. With the United States declaring its intention not to ratify, it remained imperative that four of the major players, including the European Union, Russia, Japan and Canada, ratify for it to come into effect. It was intended that at the October 2003 meeting in Moscow this would occur but Russia is yet to ratify the protocol.</para></talk.start><para>From the Australian point of view there is also a concern regarding the Kyoto protocol that it may be a flawed mechanism in that it fails to ensure that those countries which are among the largest producers of greenhouse gasâin particular in our region the industrialised economies of India and Chinaâare included within its ambit. It is important, though, that we should still address the concerns about climate change in a way that is going to be sensitive to real concerns and at the same time ensures that Australia does have a policy that is driving towards a successful outcome.</para><para>I want to propose briefly a 20-year proposal to address those challenges. The need for such a long-term approach is because national, regional and international solutions to the challenges are necessary and a long lead time is appropriate. There should be five-year goals, with the conclusion being that at the end of the period Australia will have led the world in bringing forward a program of legislative and administrative reforms that may even achieve a better outcome than Kyoto, particularly if through regional cooperation the other economies I have mentioned, which are responsible for 75 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions, are included.</para><para>One way of proceeding, I suggest, is that government should develop a comprehensive and coordinated proposal based on the current greenhouse gas reduction programs with some minor adjustments, such as phased introduction of natural gas refrigerants as replacements for CFCs, but specifically targeting the critical areas of stationary energy, transport, fugitive emissions, industrial processes, agriculture, land use change, forestry and waste. It is also appropriate within the target period, providing that international cooperation does occur, that Australia not be left outside the carbon trading opportunities, especially in the area of electrically generated carbon. These can only be addressed through legislative reforms, having regard to the need for a comprehensive Commonwealth-state agreement on such matters. </para><para>Within 10 years it is possible for Australia to have greenhouse gas emissions below those of the Kyoto projection rather than take the averaging approach which has been adopted by some. By that date, through APEC and other regional institutionsâand I commend the government for taking initiatives so far through the World Summit on Sustainable Development, the APEC Energy Working Group and the International Partnership for Hydrogen Energyâit is possible for Australia to have adopted the position along the lines I have suggested. It can include China and India as long as appropriate negotiations have been conducted with the governments of those countries. </para><para>The 15year stage would see Australia not only as a world leader in its own right in achieving climate change outcomes but also as a regional player in this internationally important area of policy development, with a view by that stage, in cooperation with our regional neighbours and through APEC, through a similar-minded group of nations to develop a world alternative to Kyoto.</para><para>The 20year stage, I suggest, would see a new world approach more comprehensive, more workable and fairer than Kyoto, based on reasonable commitments and sound outcomes for all countries prepared to address climate change issues. By stages such a program is practical and achievable. It should be truly universal and actually address the critical issues necessary to bring about climate change instead of being a political document flawed by northsouth language.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Family Services: Family Payments</title><page.no>28120</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>28120</page.no><name role="metadata">Plibersek, Tanya, MP</name><name role="display">Ms PLIBERSEK</name><name.id>83M</name.id><electorate>Sydney</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise today to speak about Labor's new baby care payment. This fantastic proposal is an excellent start to helping family balance their work and family life commitments. It leaves the United States as the only OECD country not having paid maternity leave and brings us almost up to scratch with most of the other OECD countries, where paid maternity leave has been an absolutely standard provisionâfor many decades in some cases.</para></talk.start><para>Some purists, I suppose, would argue that this is not paid maternity leave; it is also being paid to women who are not in the work force at the time of having a child. But what we need to remember about the modern condition is that women constantly move in and out of the paid work force, particularly in their child bearing years. It would have seemed unfair not to pay this baby care payment to someone who may have been in the paid work force for five years and taken a year off and who, probably when her children are a little older, will return to the work force but, because of the anomaly of not being in the paid work force on the day she leaves on maternity leave, would not receive the payment. That would have been very unfair indeed.</para><para>The baby care payment will be worth $3,000 in 2005. It can be taken as a payment over 14 weeks or people, if they wish to, can extend the payment by receiving a smaller amount every fortnight over 12 months, still adding up to $3,000 in 2005. It will rise to $5,380 by 2010. This is very important because it will then be the after-tax equivalent of 14 weeks of pay under the federal minimum wage and will truly represent what it is supposed to be, which is paid maternity leave. It is important also to remind people that it is tax free. It is means tested, but its cut-out is very high so that 90 per cent of women having children will be eligible for the payment. </para><para>As I have said, this is one very important measure in balancing work and family and it has been received very well. Pru Goward, who has never been a particular friend of the Labor Party, has welcomed it. She has said:</para><quote><para>Let's hope this proposal is the beginning of a policy bidding war, not the high point. </para></quote><para>There is a backhanded compliment. I really hope it is the beginning of a bidding war. But for three years the Prime Minister has been talking about balancing work and family and we are yet to see something from him. Yesterday we heard accusations that this was an idea that the Labor Party stole from the government. The government has had a substantial amount of time to do something. At the last election the Prime Minister said that balancing work and family would be his key issue for this term of government. We have heard nothing about paid maternity leave from him. He raises it and says, `We're thinking about it,' and then it is dropped again. But the idea that we would have to steal policies from the government on balancing work and family is laughable.</para><para>The ACTU have also praised the scheme, calling it `a major policy breakthrough', and Sharan Burrow, the ACTU President, has said that it is in stark contrast to the `shonky baby bonus'. I have criticised the baby bonus in the past. The take-up has been massively lower than the government expected because it just does not meet the needs of working families.</para><para>As I said, this is only the beginning of the task of helping people balance work and family commitments. We need to address a number of other issues, including issues of overwork for both men and women. Australians are working the second longest hours of any OECD country. It is important to have a realistic understanding that people should not be working 70- or 80-hour weeks. We need to have more flexibility in the work force. Part-time work is very good for some families, but it has to be regular, well-paid part-time work that also has some career advancement built into it. Low-paid and casual work has been the trend, and that is not flexibility; that it just exploitation.</para><para>The other area we need to address is the affordability and quality of child care. The ABS suggests that there is a shortage of 174,500 places in child care. The stress of not being able to find child care is enormously difficult for many working families. One woman, Cathy, wrote to me from Alexandria, saying that she has a nine-month-old daughter whom she put down for child care before she was born, yet she could not find a place for her. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Cowper Electorate: Westpac Lifesaver Rescue Helicopter Service</title><page.no>28121</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>28121</page.no><name role="metadata">Hartsuyker, Luke, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HARTSUYKER</name><name.id>00AMM</name.id><electorate>Cowper</electorate><party>NATS</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise in this debate to speak on the vital issue of the services provided by the Westpac Lifesaver Rescue Helicopter. I do not think a day goes by that we are not reminded in the media of the great work that this service provides. They certainly do a great job. Reid Harris and Associates' review of aeromedical services in New South Wales recommended the establishment of a base facility for a rescue helicopter in Coffs Harbour in 1994. Following that, a white paper was prepared by the then superintendent, James McLachlan, which recommended the placement of a rescue helicopter in Coffs Harbour in 1995. There was a further review of aeromedical services in 1999, which also made reference to basing a rescue helicopter in Coffs Harbour.</para></talk.start><para>It is a vital service. A number of reviews have recognised the importance of having a facility established in Coffs Harbour for a range of reasons. The Pacific Highway is being constantly upgraded, and part of that upgrading has resulted in a shift north of the fatigue zones to an area between Kew and Ballina. We have had a lot more accidents happening in the largely unimproved area between Kew and Ballina. The general volumes of traffic have also been increasing rapidly, particularly heavy vehicles. Heavy vehicle movements have increased by an incredible extent, particularly with the opening of the Chinderah to Yelgun freeway. We have large amounts of traffic coming down the highway and a shift in the fatigue zones, and in Coffs Harbour we need the establishment of a base for the rescue helicopter. </para><para>Not only do we have growth in through traffic; we have growth in local traffic and growth in the local population. All of these things point to the need for a rescue helicopter based in Coffs Harbour. We also have adventure tourism. Many adventure tourism activities, such as whitewater rafting or horse riding, occur in highly isolated spots, and the possibility of misadventure by virtue of the relatively risky nature of these activities also points to the need for a rescue helicopter to be based in or around Coffs Harbour.</para><para>The community of Coffs Harbour has recognised this need and has been raising funds to finance the service. All that is required is for the New South Wales government to declare Coffs Harbour a rotary-wing aeromedical service base and to guarantee that the helicopter will be tasked by appropriate authorities. When the necessary state government approvals are obtained, the board of Westpac Lifesaver Rescue Helicopter will purchase an additional helicopter to enable a craft to be based permanently at Coffs Harbour. The rescue service will absorb all the additional costs in getting the Coffs Harbour service up and running, with regard to training the medical crews and up-skilling our various ambulance personnel. The Westpac rescue helicopter facility will meet the establishment costs and a lot of the costs of getting this service up and running. The board would only be seeking additional funds from the New South Wales state government when the agreement, which is due to be renegotiated in March 2005, comes along. The initial establishment costs would be met by the board.</para><para>Certainly the need is there. We saw recently an accident where a woman who was driving a tractor fell underneath a slasher and the resulting injuries were quite horrendous. Any time that can be saved in getting to such an accident situation should be saved indeed. The community is behind our getting this very important service. The local council has been highly supportive and very proactive in seeking to have a rescue helicopter based in Coffs Harbour. The local National Party state member, Mr Andrew Fraser, has been very vocal in attempting to secure the necessary New South Wales government approvals. I think our securing this service really transcends party politics. The New South Wales state government should come on board with the Westpac Rescue Helicopter Service to give the necessary approvals to get the service up and running to save those precious moments that may save a life in our community.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

CSA may also contact Centrelink and other third parties who may be able to provide relevant information for consideration.    CSA obtains comments by the parents on any conflicting information.  After considering all information available, the CSA officer decides on the balance of probabilities what care levels should be reflected in the child support assessment.</para><para>In relation to Centrelink, where former members of a couple share the care of a child of that former relationship, and the parties disagree as to the level of care, verification is required of both carers to determine the actual care arrangements.  Each carer is given the opportunity to provide verification of care.  Where a formal arrangement exists (family law order; parenting plan; or custody order) a copy of the document is required for verification.</para><para>(3)	In order to be reasonably satisfied that particular care arrangements are occurring, CSA will accept any credible information provided by any source. Both parents can seek review of the decision in relation to their assessment if they are unhappy.</para><para>Centrelink advises that additional evidence to support parents' declared arrangements may be by way of: confirmation of playgroup, kindergarten or school enrolment, </para><para>	proof of attendance or membership of local organisations or activities, </para><para>	receipts for expenses incurred while the child was in care, </para><para>	confirmation of care arrangements from close family friends or relatives, social worker reports, especially in cases where there may be a fear of violence if the other parent is contacted, </para><para>	proof of travel arrangements at contact times (e.g. rail or airline tickets), </para><para>	records from Centrelink or other government departments which may confirm present or previous patterns of care, such as information about past shared family payments which may be relevant to the current situation, or</para><para>	confirmation from professional members of the community who have regular contact with the family, such as teachers, police, ministers of religion, accountants, lawyers or doctors.</para><para>(4)	Family Court documents are not proof of actual care. Child support legislation requires CSA to consider orders or parenting plans where a parent is not complying with the order or plan and is seeking a higher assessment of child support as a result. Where the order or plan is being breached without reasonable excuse, carers are assessed as having care to the level provided for in  the order or parenting plan, or to their actual level of care, where this is less.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Aviation: Airservices Australia</title><page.no>28127</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 3246)</subtitle><id.no>3246</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>28127</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Martin Ferguson</name><name.id>LS4</name.id><electorate>Batman</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 3 March 2004:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	What is the status of discussions between Airservices Australia and the airlines concerning the Government's review of the Control Tower Subsidy paid to Airservices Australia;</para><para>(2)	For each of the last five financial years, (a) what sums has the Government advanced to Airservices Australia to assist in ameliorating the terminal navigation changes at regional and aviation airports, (b) what has been the cost of providing the services at those airports by Airservices Australia, and (c) what sum was collected via the excise on aviation fuel.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>28128</page.no><name role="metadata">Anderson, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Anderson</name><name.id>4K4</name.id><electorate>Gwydir</electorate><party>NATS</party><role>Minister for Transport and Regional Services</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: </para></talk.start><para>(1)	Airservices Australia has not held discussions with the airlines concerning the Government's review of the Control Tower subsidy paid to Airservices Australia.
