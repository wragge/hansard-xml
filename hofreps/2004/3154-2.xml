This report did not come about from the top down. It came about as a result of the closure of two particular National Australia Bank branches in my electorate of Flinders, branches in San Remo and Koo Wee Rup. Neither San Remo nor Koo Wee Rup are towns which are on the outskirts of Australia. They are, however, on the rural and regional fringe of the metropolitan zone—too far out to be suburbs but not far enough out to constitute small, remote towns. What was significant about these closures was that these were banks of significance within those towns which withdrew and, as a consequence, left a genuine and real hole in the fabric and ability of those communities to function, both socially and commercially.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In response to requests from many people, I looked at the question of what could possibly be done. In conjunction, a number of other colleagues and I produced the concept that there needed to be an important high-level inquiry and report into the question of access to financial services in rural, remote and regional Australia. As a result of that, and in particular as a result of the suggestion of Mr Georges Muylles, a constituent of mine who embodied the idea, this report came to pass.</para><para>It is an important report because it does the following. Firstly, it examines the phenomenon that we are a modern and globalising economy and that we are successful as a country because of the very fact that we have embraced change, not resisted it. Australia has a golden double at present of low unemployment and low inflation—a unique combination in the last 35 years—as a result of our capacity to harness and embrace change. Secondly, it examines the costs and consequences which have come about as a result of that. In particular, there are people in areas such as San Remo, Koo Wee Rup or Tanunda, which the committee visited, and in other parts of rural Australia and further out in remote Australia who have had difficulties as a consequence of this process. So we have to adapt and we have to change.</para><para>The committee has made a series of important findings. In particular, the committee noted at an overall level that there are pockets in the Australian community where competition in the retail banking industry is not strong and where the withdrawal of bank branches has created a vacuum in the provision of banking and financial services. Communities, at both the social level and the financial or economical level, are disadvantaged when a financial service withdraws. One of the things which we noted was that there were two enduring images used to describe the impact of the withdrawal of banks from country Australia. Firstly, the concept was given that when a bank withdraws it is the beginning of the end for a small town. That is often the case, and it was certainly a picture which was presented to us by genuine and informed locals throughout rural and regional Australia. Secondly, the phrase which people in rural and remote communities throughout Australia used was that this can lead to the `slow death' of the community. The end for a small town and the slow death of the community—those were the two concepts which were presented to this committee on many occasions.</para><para>In response to those concepts, that frustration and that sense of futility experienced by communities who have lost or are losing their bank branches, the committee developed a series of wide-ranging and significant recommendations, which we commend to the parliament and the government and which as a committee we will work towards on a bipartisan basis. We do that both from a sense of policy and from a sense of obligation and commitment to all of those people who made submissions to the inquiry and who appeared before and gave time to the inquiry.</para><para>Perhaps most importantly, the committee in its <inline font-style="italic">Money matters in the bush </inline>report made the recommendation that a branch closure protocol should be established. Where banks have withdrawn or are withdrawing their branches, residents and businesses experience a number of problems, such as the trouble, anxiety and costs associated with rearranging or transferring their accounts. Simply put, if a bank closes up shop, residents and businesses have to move their accounts and their banking or have to travel extremely large distances.</para><para>As a result of the problems that occur when banks close, the committee made the following recommendations. Firstly, a protocol should be adopted which ensures that a bank will give a minimum of six months written notice prior to the closure of a branch when it is the only branch in a town. At the moment, there is a requirement of 12 weeks; we want to extend that to 26 weeks. This will give people a chance to prepare at both a societal level and at an individual level for the transitions which are necessary. Secondly, where a bank gives notice of closure of a rural or remote branch, the bank will release a community impact statement. We understand that time moves forward, but banks must be made to take account of the impact of their actions on a community, and they must be held publicly accountable for those actions. That is a fair and reasonable expectation. We are not talking about imposing commercial constraints; we are arguing absolutely for the imposition of a new community service obligation in terms of public information and public accountability.</para><para>Thirdly, the committee recommends that a clause be inserted into the protocol requiring a bank which is closing a branch to make a clear statement of intention that the bank will facilitate the transfer of accounts to another institution of the customer's choice. This is an extremely important recommendation. It is saying that, if one of the major banks is pulling out of a town, the bank should be bound to transfer the account of a depositor or a loan holder, without penalty, to another bank in the same town. That means that there is a cost and a consequence for a bank. We are building in what would otherwise be externalities borne by the customer for something which is beyond their control. That is a reasonable and fair imposition which encourages competition and ensures that consumers do not bear costs which are externally imposed upon them by the actions of an institution. It is an extremely important step which will cause institutions to think about not just the costs of transactions but the business that they will be forgoing. Under the recommendations put forward by the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services as part of the <inline font-style="italic">Money matters in the bush</inline> report, banks cannot simply assume that they will hold onto the business of customers when they close a branch.</para><para>The committee has made a second set of recommendations in relation to access to other forms of financial services in remote and disadvantaged communities which might not have adequate financial resources. Firstly, we think that it is important that financial institutions do more to use post office outlets, such as giroPost, to better service small communities, and we encourage financial institutions which are not yet using giroPost to consider doing so. We think that would be an important step. Secondly, we believe that there should be more emphasis on rural transaction centres. The reports on these have been good; it is a very good program, but in some cases, such as in the town of Grantville in my electorate, there has been slow progress in pushing through the approved rural transaction centre—not, on this occasion, because of any lack of action on federal scene but because the state has yet to supply its matching money. Thirdly, we believe that there is no case for increases in fees, or cross-charging, in country areas in relation to foreign ATM fees.</para><para>All up, <inline font-style="italic">Money matters in the bush</inline> contains a series of recommendations which cover training for Indigenous people, encouragement into financial institutions for Indigenous people, and a range of other initiatives for education, participation and services. We commend those initiatives to the House. I thank the chairman of the committee, Senator Grant Chapman, and all of the members for their participation. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>24737</page.no><name role="metadata">Byrne, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BYRNE</name><name.id>008K0</name.id><electorate>Holt</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak to the two reports that have been tabled—<inline font-style="italic">Money matters in the bush</inline> and, in particular, <inline font-style="italic">Report on the ATM fee structure</inline>. Really, one report flows into the other. Banks find themselves in a very interesting situation: they provide a service but, in providing that service, there is an obligation to the community. People's livelihoods, wellbeing and capacity to conduct financial transactions are predicated on whether or not they can access money—whether they can deposit money, take money out, phone bank or not phone bank. In regional areas in particular over the past 10 years, 750 bank branches have been removed. As a result, as the member for Flinders said, there is a reduction in face-to-face service. Whilst some may write that off as unimportant, those face-to-face transactions are very important for people from non-English-speaking backgrounds, for elderly people et cetera. Banks have, instead, channelled people into using ATMs. There has been an explosion of ATMs in Australia. There are something like 21,000 ATMs at the present, whereas in 1990 there were about 4,600. Banks have made a very deliberate choice in channelling people from a bank branch into an ATM.</para></talk.start><para>Labor members of this committee believe that there are very important responsibilities—almost community service obligations—that banks need to undertake. With respect to the <inline font-style="italic">Money matters in the bush</inline> report, the member for Flinders was saying that banks would have to consult with a community six months before withdrawing their services or closing down a branch. My belief, and Labor's belief, is that that should happen as a matter of course—regardless of where it is. For example, in Noble Park in my electorate and in Hampton Park et cetera bank branches were closed with virtually no consultation. Whilst this sort of thing clearly has a poor effect in the bush, it also has a fairly substantial effect in outer metropolitan areas. Labor's view is: why are we doing this only in regional areas? This should be done as a matter of course—not only when there is just one bank in a particular area but for any bank which is to be closed. People rely on banks. They rely on face-to-face transactions.</para><para>There is a good recommendation in the <inline font-style="italic">Money matters in the bush</inline> report which refers to people being encouraged, if the bank branch does have to close, to use other forms of banking. But, believe me, a lot of people have problems with telephone banking. A lot of people have problems with EFTPOS, for example—as you can observe in shopping centres. They do have an easier time with an ATM, and that is what makes the particular recommendations arising out of the <inline font-style="italic">Report on the ATM fee structure</inline> quite important. I want to address some specific comments to that. The committee brought down four recommendations in its <inline font-style="italic">Report on the ATM fee structure</inline>. The first reads:</para><quote><para>The Committee recommends that the ATM Industry Steering Group include in its considerations on the reform of ATM interchange fee arrangements the special circumstances of fees and charges associated with the use of foreign ATMs in rural, regional and remote Australia.</para></quote><para>The second recommendation reads:</para><quote><para>The Committee recommends that the AISG when considering reforms to the ATM fee structure give full consideration to ensuring that the price of obtaining an account balance is kept to a minimum and at the very least is in alignment with the costs associated with delivering the service.</para></quote><para>The third recommendation reads:</para><quote><para>The Committee recommends that, irrespective of progress on the introduction of a direct charging regime, the AISG develop a framework for real-time disclosure of ATM fees and charges to be implemented as soon as practicable. The framework is to ensure that information on the cost of a transaction is made available so that a customer can cancel the transaction before incurring any fee.</para></quote><para>The fourth recommendation reads:</para><quote><para>The Committee recommends that should a direct charging regime be introduced both the RBA and the ACCC closely monitor shifts in fees and charges for foreign ATM services and report publicly on developments in fees charged.</para></quote><para>That final point is very interesting; it goes to a thing called `foreign ATM' transactions. That effectively means that, if I am a member of the ANZ Bank and I want to take money out but there is a Westpac ATM and I access the Westpac ATM I am charged a fee—at the moment it is a bundled fee, a series of fees wrapped up in one fee that the bank charges. Incidentally, when you use the ATM, those fees are not necessarily disclosed in real time—the committee has recommended that and Labor has been pushing for that for some time.</para><para>What makes this pertinent to rural and regional areas is that about 40 per cent of ATM transactions are foreign transactions. It is understood that there is a disproportionate number of foreign ATM transactions in rural and regional areas, given that in some particularly remote country towns there is not a lot of choice. What concerns me in terms of recommendation 1, where the committee talks about unbundling those fees and putting a direct charge fee, is that there can then be two fees in place—one fee for the bank providing you with access service to the other bank and the other a direct charge for providing the service. This has caused a level of concern. Even though banks are saying that this is not actually going to result in an increase in fees, if you look at their track record in respect of ATMs you find that it unfortunately provides a countervailing point of view. For example, if you look at the cost of accessing an ATM you will see that it has risen by 292 per cent since 1995. That is a fairly substantial fee increase, particularly given that banks charge between $1.50 and $2 for an interchange fee through a foreign ATM and the actual cost of providing that service is 50c. So there is a fairly substantial discrepancy in the fee being charged by the bank to provide this service and the actual fee people are being charged. Labor has raised that concern for some time. Page 10 of the report, where it speaks about a particular study by the Reserve Bank, says:</para><quote><para>The study also showed that interchange fees have remained largely unchanged over the past decade even though there are grounds to believe that costs may have fallen.</para></quote><para>In fact, they have fallen—</para><quote><para>It suggested that ATMs have become cheaper, that at the upper end of the range they have become more sophisticated and are capable of undertaking a variety of functions while at the other end there are now more basic, low-cost machines available. It also pointed to the substantial reduction in costs of data processing and telecommunications equipment.</para></quote><para>If you follow that argument, ATM fees should have been reduced, but they have, in fact, increased by 292 per cent since 1995. This does not augur well for the ATM Industry Steering Group's recommendation to now charge two fees for foreign ATM transactions. That recommendation will be going to the ACCC. Labor have a very grave concern about what that means, because we believe that that unbundling of fees will result in one cost being charged to a rural ATM which does not have a high usage and a disproportionately lower cost being charged to a group which might be, say, in the suburbs of Sydney or Melbourne. In fact, people who have testified to this committee have effectively said the same thing.</para><para>I am concerned about the evidence given by people to the committee when they have been asked about what they think banks will do with regard to this particular recommendation to unbundle the fee—evidence given by people like Mrs Margaret Brown from the Country Women's Association of New South Wales. Her testimony typified the attitude of many retail banking customers in country Australia when she told the committee:</para><quote><para>We have had a lot of theory today but when it comes down to the practice of living in rural areas, the rhetoric is not being matched by the practice. I do not care if there are 21,000 ATMs in Australia, how many are in a suburb of Sydney or Melbourne, how many are in the average country town of 500 to 600 people?</para></quote><para>So there are concerns by people in country areas about what this proposition which has been endorsed by the committee—but we have additional comments by Labor members which dispute that—will mean. I think it is up to the banks to adopt a code of practice. We on this side have been saying for some time that, if banks are not able to adopt a responsible code of practice, then it should be legislated. This is the challenge for banks. This recommendation will go to the ACCC and may well be passed. But, if we see a large increase in fees, which many witnesses in this committee have testified to being concerned about, then we on this side believe it should be legislated. Banks have a community service obligation, and we expect them to honour that obligation.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

This recognition of a legal and ethical anachronism in Australian political life is long overdue. The notion of `substantial revenue' means the bill will not apply to those whose revenue from the retailing of tobacco is only incidental to their supply of other retail products—for example supermarkets, corner stores and petrol stations.</para></talk.start><para>This bill has been moved by me, a member of the Australian Labor Party, and seconded, courageously and with a conviction which extends beyond party politics, by Dr Mal Washer, the member for Moore and a member of the Liberal Party. The procedures of the House will not allow Dr Washer to speak immediately but he will be doing so later this week in adjournment debates. And we now know that on both sides of politics many of our colleagues agree with us. Like us, they are uncomfortable that for so long we have all benefited from the financial largesse bestowed on us or our parties by companies which manufacture a product which kills many of the people who voted us into this place. At the government's last estimate, 19,000 Australians die each year because of tobacco related illness and the health cost is $21 billion annually.</para><para>Since news of this bill first surfaced late last year, the anti-smoking lobby has actively campaigned to secure bipartisan support. The Australian Medical Association, the Royal Australasian College of Physicians and Surgeons, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, the Cancer Council of Australia, the Heart Foundation, Action on Smoking and Health and the Australian Council on Smoking and Health all voiced loud support for this bill.</para><para>ACOSH executive director Stephen Hall wrote in a letter to all federal MPs this month: </para><quote><para>This industry has based its fortune on over sixty years of deceit, duplicity and treachery.</para></quote><para>He urges us to:</para><quote><para>... not feel any obligation to this lethal industry that openly, destructively, painfully and at public expense kills off your constituents ...</para></quote><para>Professor Alan Coates and Dr Andrew Ellerman from the Cancer Council of Australia have also written to all MPs urging bipartisan support. They argue:</para><quote><para>This is an opportunity for our federal political parties to exhibit leadership and a commitment to addressing the smoking epidemic in Australia by rejecting any suggestion of a relationship with tobacco companies.</para></quote><para>And Maurice Swanson, chief executive of the Heart Foundation of Western Australia, wrote:</para><quote><para>Tobacco causes several cancers, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, other respiratory diseases, asthma, low birth weight babies and sudden infant death syndrome.</para></quote><para>We know the risks to human health. How can any of us continue to give implicit support to such a toxic industry?</para><para>Last month a watershed was reached in Australian politics when Labor's leader, Mark Latham, announced that the ALP will put public principle first and no longer accept donations from tobacco corporations. This announcement has changed the dynamic of a debate which will not go away until the last cent is handed over to a political party for the last time. Because of the Leader of the Opposition's announcement the coalition government now faces the political sharp edge of an issue on which it has more to lose ethically and publicly than it has to gain financially.</para><para>But there is pain in letting go. Tobacco donations have been a hugely remunerative source of funding for the major parties. Hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts from tobacco corporations are extremely hard to refuse in the context of costly election campaigns. For that reason it was entirely predictable but disappointingly out of step with public sentiment when the Treasurer came out on the day of Mr Latham's announcement and said nothing would change because, in essence, the tobacco industry is a legitimate business selling a legal product. That was an unfortunate first response to an issue which goes to the core of the public's faith in its elected representatives. Mr Costello appears to have a tin ear. Such a response ignores the fact that no other legal product, when used exactly as intended, has the same potential to kill the user.</para><para>Why do cigarette manufacturers like Philip Morris and British American Tobacco donate money to political parties? Who is so naive to believe it is a gift, an act of benevolent support to electoral campaigns? In politics, as in life, there is no such thing as a free lunch. Cigarette companies belong to one of the most persuasive industries of the modern era. Much of their marketing to hold on to existing customers and to hook new ones is subliminal. An important part of their capacity to turn multi-billion dollar profits at the expense of human health is by looking legitimate through their sponsorships of public events and through the entirely respectable practice of donating money to political parties. These measures, carefully targeted and sold, help tobacco companies appear to be part of the ordinary fabric of public life.</para><para>While firmly against prohibition because I believe in the freedom of individuals to make their own choices, it offends my sense of citizenship that we have a political system which gives the appearance of allowing itself to be influenced by the producers and wholesalers of tobacco products. Once you take up cigarettes they are very hard to give up—I know that. Doing everything possible to discourage people from starting smoking is the key.</para><para>I table the explanatory memorandum and I commend the bill to the House.</para><para>Bill read a first time.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—In accordance with sessional order 104A, the second reading will be made an order of the day for the next sitting.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>EMPLOYEE PROTECTION (EMPLOYEE ENTITLEMENTS GUARANTEE) BILL 2004</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>24741</page.no><id.no>R1974</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>24741</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Crosio</inline>.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>24741</page.no><name role="metadata">Crosio, Janice, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs CROSIO</name><name.id>7T4</name.id><electorate>Prospect</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1974">Employee Protection (Employee Entitlements Guarantee) Bill 2004</inline> is a bill to provide for the establishment and administration of a scheme to guarantee the payment of wages and other accrued liabilities owed to employees in the event of employer insolvency and for related purposes. This is a bill which I have introduced to this parliament in various amended forms. Each time, the bill has been ignored and allowed to lapse by the Howard government. In 1998, I wrongly assumed that this bill would in some way prod the conscience of the Howard government and we would then have legislation passed to protect the entitlements of Australian workers. This government has had untold opportunities to fix this problem with adequate legislation.</para></talk.start><para>The majority of Australian employers do the right thing by their workers. They are diligent in putting in place mechanisms to meet their liability for accrued employee entitlements in the event of insolvency. But there are many who still regard employee entitlements as interest free loans to be used as they want; they are not. They are legal entitlements that most workers rely on to plan for their retirement. Many of them have spent their entire working life accruing benefits so that in their later years they can enjoy a worry-free lifestyle with least some degree of financial security.</para><para>What I am proposing in this bill is not some pie in the sky. It is a genuine attempt to have in Australia protection provided to workers in cases of insolvency. Unfortunately, this government's idea of protection is to cap entitlements at $20,000, and this has been repeated in the latest tender documents for GEERS. I regard the payment of $20,000 to a worker who is entitled to some $70,000 as outright theft. The protection of employees' entitlements is important and complex and deserves closer consideration than the superficial approach the government has put in place. There have been too many years of inactivity by this government, and this has created serious concerns for workers in relation to job security and the protection of their entitlements. The workers of National Textiles are the only workers in Australia to have received their full entitlements—and we all remember them.</para><para>The bill which I present today will guarantee all workers their full entitlements. It is a fair bill, it is a just bill and it is an affordable bill. It is a bill which the Howard government should embrace as the best possible step to ensure the entitlements of all Australian workers. The workers of Australia want no trade-offs. Tragically, for those workers, we have in this government a mindset that is to look after the big end of town. This government's approach has left Australian workers with no option but to seek to achieve proper protection for their rightful entitlements—and in several cases through industrial action. Rather than debate my bill, the Howard government has now swept it under the carpet on seven occasions. I believe the government's failure to allow the parliament to consider this bill clearly demonstrates its lack of commitment to solving a serious economic and social problem.</para><para>It will take a Latham Labor government to take the necessary action, and I can assure members on the government benches that this will happen in the next election. I look forward to that day and so do the workers of Australia. I am very proud of the fact that our national conference some two years back decided that this would be a part of the Labor platform.

The motion before the House is referred to in a letter dated 16 February 2004 and signed by Dr Julie Ruth, the Executive Director of the B'nai B'rith Anti-Defamation Commission. I am pleased to say that she is in the House today accompanied by Dr Paul Gardner, the commission's chairman. In that letter Dr Ruth comments:</para><quote><para>The resolution ... is needed ... because the rising incidence provides an early warning signal to take action to prevent an alarming situation from developing in this country.</para></quote><para>I note that the Board of Advisers of the ADC includes three former governors-general and two former prime ministers. Also commenting on this motion is Mr Jeremy Jones, the Executive Director of ECAJ in Australia, who states:</para><quote><para>Over many years of trying to understand the phenomenon of, and confronting, antisemitism, it is apparent that the strongest defence against the development and growth of anti-Jewish racism are strong, public and unequivocal condemnations of the phenomenon from respected public figures, complemented by appropriate police action and successful legal prosecutions of hate mongers and racist thugs.</para></quote><para>The member for Melbourne Ports and I were approached by constituents and supporters of this motion in November of this year and, in particular, by the representatives of B'nai B'rith and we were both very happy to cosponsor this motion which, I am very pleased to say, is supported by both sides of the House. The terms of the resolution are important. The preamble refers to the long history of anti-Semitism as the first notation.</para><para>When I was President of the World Heritage Committee, immediately prior to my election to this parliament, and was based happily in those days in Paris, I took a delegation to the Auschwitz concentration camp, which is a world heritage site in Poland not far from Krakow. It was one of the more harrowing things that I have ever done or, indeed, seen. The report that we presented to the Polish government and UNESCO ultimately led to improvements in the way in which that particular site was conserved—because it is a lesson for all time to all the world, not just the people of Poland, whose villages once held large prosperous and thriving Jewish communities and now have none at all. It is quite extraordinary to visit places such as the village of Oswiecim and others in the vicinity of Auschwitz.</para><para>In Europe itself, in the week before this motion was lodged, there were a number of incidents which were particularly worrying. For example, the Jewish school near Paris was fire bombed and two Istanbul synagogues were devastated by suicide truck bombs that killed 25 and wounded 300. Turkey, which hopes to join the EU, suffered on several occasions through what appear to be al-Qaeda inspired terrorist threats, with truck bombs targeted at British installations. In the same month the EUMC, which is a racism watchdog that is part of the European Union, commissioned a report from the Centre for Research on Anti-Semitism at the Technical University of Berlin but shelved it because the report was thought to be politically incorrect in the criticisms it made of Muslim and pro-Palestinian perpetrators of anti-Semitic conduct.</para><para>So there were at that time, and there remain, very worrying trends. Indeed, in our country itself there have been a number of incidents which give rise to concern. Until 2002, the average number of incidents of all types reported to ECAJ was 279, but in 2003 the reports reached 481 incidents, including physical violence and property damage, threats, face-to-face harassment including assault, threatening and abusive telephone calls, threatening and abusive mail items, and anti-Semitic graffiti, leaflets, plasters, stickers and emails. This sort of conduct gives rise to particular concern, not just to ordinary people going about their business but to the broader society and those of us who are concerned that Australia remains a beacon of freedom and a place where decency and right conduct is what our country is all about.</para><para>As I have indicated, there were a number of incidents in Australia, and some of those occurred in my electorate. For example, on New Year's Day there was an assault on a group of Jews who were walking through a park in Vaucluse. One man had a glass bottle smashed over his head and another was bitten on the chest. These assaults were preceded by anti-Semitic abuse. On 9 January this year, graffiti was sprayed on a billboard outside the Temple Emanuel Synagogue in Woollahra, reading `F-ck Jews'. Just a few days later, on 22 January, the Australia Post head office was sprayed with graffiti reading: `Jews—The New Nazis'. The same sort of graffiti was found at Eastpoint Shopping Centre in Edgecliff just a few weeks before.</para><para>In relation to verbal abuse of ordinary citizens going about their daily lives, on 10 January this year, at Temple Emanuel in Woollahra, the occupants of a car driving past the synagogue screamed out `F-cking Jews' at the security personnel on duty. Likewise, on 2 December last year in Bondi Road, occupants of a car, who were described as being of Middle Eastern appearance, screamed anti-Semitic abuse at an identifiable Jew walking down the street. There have also been attacks on symbols. For example, a man wearing a prominent Magen David symbol around his neck was verbally abused in the city on 12 January this year, and a lady in Bellevue Hill had the mezuzah on her backdoor melted. Scorch marks were found on the doorframe, but there was no other sign of damage. Racist groups have appeared, giving rise to real concern. A group calling itself the National Alliance put stickers along several streets in Randwick in my electorate on 23 January—just a few days ago. Another group calling itself White Pride Australia posted similar anti-Semitic and antiIsraeli stickers just down the way in Camperdown.</para><para>These things cannot be ignored. They are matters of real concern. I have mentioned the first aspect of the preamble to our motion. Of course, going back to the Second World War and what happened there, it could not possibly be said that there is any such repeat of those heinous acts—but there has been an upsurge in violent anti-Semitic acts in many countries, including our own. It is in that cautionary context that this motion has been introduced.</para><para>There has also been an upsurge in anti-Semitic propaganda. It is of some interest to look at the history of the word `anti-Semitism'. It was coined by a German man named Mr Wilhelm Marr in the 1880s. He was himself an anti-Semitic propagandist. His idea was to castigate people not because of their religious beliefs as Jews but rather because of their racial backgrounds as coming from that part of the Middle East, using what is called the Semitic text. Of course, it led to the heinous act in the Second World War, which was one of the great acts of bastardry in human history. But even in this House during the Iraq war our members received emails that referred to the motivation of some of those of us who supported, as we did, the resolution of the Prime Minister in this House to join the conflict in Iraq. Those emails, which based our support on completely misconceived motives, were identified as being effectively anti-Semitic.</para><para>A very interesting article was recently published by a Canadian academic named Irwin Cotler, who has recently been appointed a minister in the Canadian government. He speaks of the new anti-Jewishness, which almost requires a new vocabulary. These issues are of great importance. But let me finish by saying: let us refresh the wellsprings of decency in our community, take note and move forward together, accepting difference but embracing a strong social fabric. I commend this motion to the House. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

I commend the member for Wentworth and the organisation B'nai B'rith, which suggested this motion to us, on bringing this motion before the House. I have obviously a deep personal interest in this motion as the only Jewish member of the current parliament. As I said in my first speech to this House, my grandparents were victims of European anti-Semitism, and my father came to this country as a refugee in 1939.</para></talk.start><para>Australia is regarded by many people in this country who are of Jewish origin as a `goldeneh medinah'—a golden country—that is, the 120,000 Jewish Australians or 0.6 per cent of our population regard it as that. Thousands of my constituents survived the Shoah to settle in post-war Australia and lead successful, constructive lives. Australia continues to provide a haven for people such as the former residents of the former Soviet Union who are also found in large numbers in my electorate. I believe Australia has gained immensely through its generosity to Jewish Australians. Names such as Sir Isaac Isaacs, Sir John Monash and Sir Zelman Cowen come to mind. In this parliament I recall recent distinguished Jewish members such as former Senator Sam Cohen, Dr Moss Cass, the Hon. Joe Berinson, former Senator Peter Baume and my good friend the former minister for the arts and the environment, Barry Cohen.</para><para>But even in Australia it is sad to have to note that incidents of anti-Semitic speech and action continue and have increased in recent years. To its great credit, on 7 September the premier current affairs program in this country, the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday </inline>program—with John Lyons as the reporter and Peter Hiscock as the executive producer—did a very important reprise of the physical threats and violence which Jewish Australians face because of the changed world situation. For anyone who is seriously interested in this issue, that <inline font-style="italic">Sunday</inline> program is essential viewing. The Internet is a favourite medium for these new anti-Semites to spread their bizarre conspiracy theories. As the member for Wentworth said, many members of this House can recall getting some of these crazed emails, particularly during the Iraq war. Only this morning some crank faxed one of these prejudiced screeds to all federal MPs.</para><para>Anti-Semitism in various forms has been a feature of European societies for 2,000 years and has spread even to societies where there are no Jews at all, such as Malaysia and Indonesia. We all know the situation in Malaysia, with the very recent bigoted statements by its former Prime Minister, Dr Mahathir. Led by Pope John Paul II and the Catholic Church, mainstream Christianity today condemns anti-Semitism, and that legacy of Jewish-Catholic reconciliation will be a great legacy of His Holiness the Pope. In the late 19th century a new form of secular anti-Semitism, based on pseudo-Darwinian theories of racial superiority came into vogue. It was this evil ideology above all other factors that motivated Hitler and his seizure of most of Europe. This cursed and demonic hate nearly led to what Winston Churchill called `the abyss of a new Dark Age, made more sinister by the lights of perverted science'. In that abyss, six million Jews were murdered—in a war that civilisation only survived after the death of a total of 50 million people.</para><para>For a time it seemed that anti-Semitism would not raise its head again because of the Holocaust. However, today it has found new bases and new slogans, particularly in one of the persistent phenomena of our time, anti-Americanism. No-one resiles from our right to vociferously disagree with the citizens or government of the United States, a fellow democracy. It is, however, worrying to see mainstream ABC TV programs talk about US policy makers in terms of their Jewish origins. It is far more worrying to see the infiltration of prejudice into it than screeds from cranks that arrive via email. The new anti-Semitism has also affected some people in the intellectual classes.</para><para>I do not equate criticism of Israel with anti-Semitism; it is reasonable to make criticisms of any country's government, including Israeli policies and actions—indeed, many Jews are among Israel's critics. However, some of what passes for anti-Zionism these days is a form of anti-Semitism. This is the kind of rhetoric that accuses Israel of genocide, such as the mythical massacre at the Jenin refugee camp in 2002. Claims that Zionists control the world's media or banks, or that the United States has a Zionist-occupied government are part of this kind of modern anti-Semitism. These people do not wear black armbands or jackboots. Some of them hide in universities and the media; others order the bombing of synagogues, like Ayman al-Zawahiri, al-Qaeda's No. 2 who articulates its anti-Jewish ideology. And this unreasoning hatred, whether it is from Hitler or Osama bin Laden, is a lethal threat not just to Jews but to people all over the world. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>24746</page.no><name role="metadata">Georgiou, Petro, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GEORGIOU</name><name.id>HM5</name.id><electorate>Kooyong</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is one of the great sadnesses of history that half a century after the Holocaust we should be debating a motion condemning anti-Semitism. If there is one thing that any reasonable person should have expected history and experience to have cauterised, it is anti-Semitism—the scapegoating and demonisation of Jewish people, the blood libels and the displacement of the dislocations of modernisation onto the Jews. Anti-Semitism ultimately led to the murder of six million Jews in an advanced Western society. That crime against humanity should have totally inoculated the world against anti-Semitism in all its forms, but the unfortunate reality is that the lessons of history do not keep on communicating themselves; they have to be taught, reflected on and reinforced.</para></talk.start><para>We have to realise that at the beginning of the third millennium there is a resurgence of anti-Semitism. I do not mean by this that there has been some golden age since the Second World War in which anti-Semitism vanished—witness the persecution of the Jews in the former Soviet Union, amongst many other persecutions—but the fact is that in recent years we have seen the intensification of anti-Semitism and violence against the Jewish people; the vandalisation of Jewish cemeteries; the bombing of synagogues; attacks on members of the Jewish community; the proliferation of anti-Jewish libels, such as the accelerated circulation of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion; and the persistence of Holocaust deniers.</para><para>To the traditional and destructive European forms of anti-Semitism has been added the virulent anti-Semitism of Islamic extremists. Some historians believe that Islam has been less prone to persecute the Jews than Christian polities. I am not a sufficient historian to make a considered judgment about that, but what is certain is that in the here and now Islamic extremism is making a fundamental contribution to the resurgence of anti-Semitism. I have time for just one example, that of the editor of the newspaper <inline font-style="italic">Al </inline><inline font-style="italic">Risali</inline>, who supports Hamas and who said:</para><quote><para>Hamas, the whole of the Palestinians, clearly distinguish between Israelis and Jews ... We don't fight against the Jews. We fight against the occupation.</para></quote><para>He then rapidly proceeds to assert that Adolf Hitler `came to punish the Jews because of their faults and their practices'. Beyond this the response to the creation of a Jewish democratic state has given a new dimension to anti-Semitism.</para><para>I am not one who believes that criticisms of the actions of the Israeli government or its policies amount to anti-Semitism. To accept this would be to surrender independence of judgment and to fly in the face of the reality of Israeli democracy—its vibrancy, its internal combativeness and its capacity for self-criticism. Not least, it would do a disservice to Israel, which relies on its friends being able to speak frankly. Nonetheless, it has to be said that some of the criticisms of Israel are of a character that amounts to anti-Semitism, because they demonise the Israeli state. As one writer puts it, some of the attacks on Israel attribute to Israel `all of the evils of the world—the portrayal of Israel as the enemy of all that is good and the repository of all that is evil'. I believe that descriptions of Israel as the apartheid state, the equation of Zionism with racism and the depiction of an infant Jesus being threatened by an Israeli tank, with Jesus saying, `Surely they don't want to kill me again,' all cross the line. To say this is not to deny the aspirations and the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people to their own state. It is a right which is widely recognised.</para><para>As I said in opening, it is sad that we have to revisit the condemnation of anti-Semitism. Such a condemnation should have become deeply ingrained as a result of the history of the persecution of the Jews and the murder of millions in the Holocaust. It is sad to revisit this, but it is necessary. The parliament does have to unequivocally condemn anti-Semitism, violence against Jews and all forms of racial and religious persecution. I commend the motion to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>24748</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Laurie, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LAURIE FERGUSON</name><name.id>8T4</name.id><electorate>Reid</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As a critic of Israeli policies on many fronts, I very much associate myself with this motion. It does a number of things. It raises the question of anti-Semitism in this country and it calls for activity by our diplomats overseas to make sure that internationally we counter this. These are matters that we should very much associate ourselves with. I was impressed by the figures of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry that showed that over the 12 months to September 2003 there were 500 anti-Semitic incidents, and that has been the same for two years. It is interesting to note that over the 10-year period since 1990, there were fewer than 300 incidents. This growth is of concern. As is noted in the motion, it seems to be an international phenomenon. </para></talk.start><para>From 17 March 2001 to 17 April 2002 in France there were 395 of these incidents. There were earlier references to the bombing of synagogues in Istanbul. It is ironic that the Ottoman Empire, which historically saved fleeing Jews from an inquisition and the forced conversions there, is itself experiencing this. Internationally, there have been matters of concern in Germany. The commander of the special forces had to be taken to task when he associated himself with a German politician, Martin Hohmann, and said that anyone that says that the Germans are a race of perpetrators ignores the Jewish role in the Russian Revolution and the resulting persecutions and tyranny.</para><para>Egyptian television had a 40-episode analysis of the ridiculous fictions of The<inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Pro</inline><inline font-style="italic">tocols of the Elders of Zion</inline>. It is very worrying that on a national television system in the Middle East this kind of twaddle is put forward to the general public as indicative of truth. One must be concerned also at the Syrian defence minister. In January 2002 he stated that Mossad had planned the ramming of airliners into the World Trade Centre. These are worrying indicators of the degree to which people, for their own political futures, utilise anti-Semitism. I note that even at Liverpool in Western Sydney we had assaults upon an exhibition which praised the role of those righteous gentiles who helped to protect the Jews during the Holocaust. Those assaults were answered on 5 August 2003 by the Chairman of the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia, Abd Malak, who said:</para><quote><para>These extremists often target the most vulnerable in our society, in particular small faith communities and Aboriginal Australians. They attempt to appeal to the most degraded of human instincts. </para></quote><para>He asks that we be vigilant. It is indeed important that in this country, where we tend to emphasise our tolerance, our harmony and our multiculturalism, we are equally firm in regard to the upsurge that we have witnessed—for example, in regard to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and any question of undermining its powers or reducing its authority. There is also a need for anti-racism legislation in this country. That is a matter that this parliament has in purview. All of these things must be undertaken.</para><para>The situation is, of course, a weird amalgam of various forces which utilise anti-Semitism, from the crackpot fascistic theories of the mid 20th century—the distorted view of Christianity that saw the Jews as having killed Jesus and therefore being hostile to Christianity—to Holocaust denial, people finding all the reasons in the world for the six million Jews who died not actually representing the fulfilment of Hitler's theories, and the analogy of Judaism and Israel with Nazism. All of these are various strands of this effort. It is particularly worth while that in this country Jeremy Jones and the Executive Council of Australian Jewry trace these upsurges. They tell us something about the need for an authoritative answer from our parliamentary leadership and our government leadership. In meetings with him he has made the point to me that when these things are unanswered, when there is no response from our parliamentary leadership, it is a perceived green light to people. They perceive that it will not be answered.

It has the strong support not just of all of us speaking today but of many members of this House and, I am sure, the Senate. The Member for Sturt, while unable to speak in this debate due to his status as a parliamentary secretary, nonetheless is here for the debate to show his support. The speakers before me have well articulated the issues at hand. This motion not only illustrates and signifies our combined resolve that anti-Semitism is repugnant and unacceptable but also highlights the danger it poses to all of our values and freedoms. </para></talk.start><para>Anti-Semitic attacks on Jewish people and Jewish property are also attacks on our very democratic principles. Allowing anti-Semitic activity to go unchecked and trying to rationalise it away is not just to allow injustice and racism to take root but also to knowingly allow a cancer to eat at the foundations of our democracy and our tolerant and free society. That is a critical point in this debate. The Jewish people are a minority who have been subject to attacks, violence and oppression for most of their history. The Holocaust, as the member for Kooyong pointed out, was the most horrific culmination of that, but the pages of history are littered with earlier examples in France and, many hundreds of years ago, in Spain.</para><para>This motion is a positive thing, but I have to say that its real value and strength will be if it also demonstrates an ongoing dedication by this House and this parliament to continually highlight these issues. It is a task that never ends. Previous speakers have highlighted some of the evidence of an increase in anti-Semitic activity around the globe. The nature and frequency of those attacks has also been well documented by other houses of parliament in other democracies, by international bodies and, in graphic detail, I have to say, by the international media, particularly in London. Whilst there is evidence of an increase in anti-Semitic activity in many parts of the world, there is no doubt, as previous speakers have illustrated, that Europe, where the wave is largest and the need is greatest, is the epicentre. Both Democrats and Republicans in the United States have taken up the need for action in Europe in a similar bipartisan way. Democrats like Congressman Robert Wexler have been prominent in highlighting the need for European leaders to take a stronger stand and stop seeking to substitute motives on the part of those who perpetrate the acts. In a similar tone, in June last year Rudolf Giuliani put it well in an article entitled `How Europe can stop the hate'. He said:</para><quote><para>Hate flourishes when excuses for the conduct are accepted, or justified by vague connections to international politics. If a synagogue is torched, the response must not be, “The act is wrong, but we can understand the reasons the arsonist feels he must resort to such extreme measures.” The perpetrators must not be allowed to advance their so-called cause through violence.</para></quote><para>We have seen here in our country some attacks on synagogues and on Jewish people and property during the recent Iraq conflict. We can never allow that behaviour to be rationalised away under the cover of tension or difficulty in the Middle East, or war in Iraq, because to do so is to give a green light and a licence to those who wish to practise anti-Semitism.</para><para>In the time remaining to me in this debate, I would like to briefly address the aims of the motion and the reality. We all rightly wish for the day when anti-Semitism exists only in history books, but I think we all know in our heads that, unfortunately, this is not likely. There will always be people with despicable views and others prepared to follow them. Our task must be to continually spread the lessons of history and advocate the cause of tolerance. </para><para>Teaching history in schools is extremely important, and I would like to think that more can be done on this front. Teaching the history of the Holocaust to all students, rather than just to those who choose to undertake European or modern history, would be a valuable step, particularly since we are now at the point where younger generations do not have the same benefit of receiving first-hand the knowledge and experience of parents and grandparents to familiarise themselves with the horror and persecution that occurred in the Second World War. A student cannot leave an Australian school without learning Australian history, which is exactly as it should be. But, in my view, modern world history and the lessons it can teach us are equally important, and I would like to see the day when no Australian student could leave school without having studied the Holocaust and the consequences of anti-Semitism. Wouldn't that go a long way towards insulating future generations against the sickening conspiracy theories, falsehoods and racism that feed anti-Semitism? <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>24750</page.no><name role="metadata">Smith, Stephen, MP</name><name role="display">Mr STEPHEN SMITH</name><name.id>5V5</name.id><electorate>Perth</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I support the motion, which expresses its unequivocal condemnation of anti-Semitism, violence directed against Jews and Jewish religious and cultural institutions, and all forms of racial and ethnic hatred, persecution and discrimination on ethnic or religious grounds whenever and wherever it occurs, and which resolves to condemn all manifestations of anti-Semitism in Australia as a threat to the freedoms that all citizens should enjoy equally in a democratic society. As the Israeli Minister for Diaspora Affairs, Natan Sharansky, recently said:</para></talk.start><quote><para>No hatred has as rich and as lethal a history as anti-Semitism—“the longest hatred”, as the historian Robert Wistrich has dubbed it. Over the millennia, anti-Semitism has infected a multitude of peoples, religions and civilisations, in the process of inflicting a host of terrors on its Jewish victims. </para></quote><para>Xenophobia, the exclusion of groups that do not fit within our own tribal context, has been with human society throughout our history. While it may well have contributed to our survival a million years ago, it has but added to our collective shame since recorded history began. The first significant recorded example of anti-Semitism seems to have occurred in Alexandria in Egypt in the year 38 BCE, when, following riots in which many Jews were killed, the local Jewish population were confined to a designated quarter of the city—a trend we see repeated in the 2000 years that follow. As well, it was less than a hundred years later that around 50,000 Jews were massacred in the very same city of Alexandria—in proportion to the then population, an even more horrific number than we would imagine today.</para><para>Our modern history, of course, records the recent horror of the Holocaust. I was personally very moved by my own experience as one who has had the opportunity to visit Israel and Yad Vashem, the unique memorial where a flame burns in a darkened hall as an eternal memorial to those who lost their lives in the Holocaust. Only such a simple memorial would be powerful enough to pay sufficient tribute to those who lost their lives in such a monstrous crime.</para><para>Fortunately, in Australia, historically we have been, and are, remarkably free of mainstream anti-Semitism, with which our global history is regrettably all too replete. However, it has existed, and does exist, here, and there has recently been the concern of an inexplicable increase in anti-Semitic incidents. Australian society must remain aware and vigilant of the need to identify it for what it is and, when it does occur, of the need for our law to deal with it firmly and effectively. In my own electorate of Perth, the first recorded anti-Semitic acts were condemned by Rabbi Freedman in 1933. On 10 October 1943 a community meeting was held in the North Perth Town Hall to unite and organise against vicious anti-Semitic literature.</para><para>While anti-Semitism is by definition an attack on those of the Jewish faith, it represents an attack on the fundamental elements of our society, on the very tenets and building blocks of a civilised society. If we allow those who practise anti-Semitism to go unpunished, and their hate crimes to evade the rule of law, we are all diminished by that failure, no matter what our faith or beliefs. Anti-Semitism is not about an attack on those of a certain religious belief; it is about the freedom to attack those who are not a member of the same group or tribe as you. Anti-Semitism is an ugly, grotesque action. What underlies the intent of those involved is prejudice and rejection of others, based on reasons of race or religious belief—the usual reasons which have led to the exploitation of others and which have led one person to devalue the life of another human being and treat another's life as being of lesser value than their own. This is the fundamental reason why as a parliament and as a society we must always come to the defence of those who are the victims of anti-Semitic attacks. It is just and it is right that we should do so, because it underpins the very core values of our modern Australian society.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>24751</page.no><name role="metadata">Forrest, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr FORREST</name><name.id>NV5</name.id><electorate>Mallee</electorate><party>NATS</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am delighted to join with my colleagues on this important motion today. I am opposed to racial and religious vilification of any form and I am proud as an Australian that in this country we recognise that people have differences and we embrace each other and talk about it. That is the Australian way. It is with some concern that I see the evidence from around the world that this particular form of racial and religious vilification is on the increase. We are well aware of what is happening in Europe; we know about the instability in the Middle East; but it is happening here on our own shores. So I think it is absolutely important—and this is why I wanted to speak to this motion—that the parliament of this great nation shows the lead by condemning this particular form of racial and religious vilification, expressed as anti-Semitism.</para></talk.start><para>An incident that moved me on 8 December last year was when a 13-year-old student on his way to Yeshiva College was pushed off his bike by a motorcyclist and then subjected to anti-Semitic curses and abuse.

I had the delight in August last year to visit Israel on a study tour involving a separate subject and see the museum at Yad Vashem.

I have the privilege of being able to pray in the way that I like, which is to probably the greatest Jew of all, as a Christian. I delight that I can share a worshipping experience and share the nature of my faith with my Jewish friends.</para><para>I stand with my colleagues here—I stand with the whole parliament—and urge Australian society to give its support to this motion and condemn this kind of activity because it is un-Australian. If we let it happen, as other speakers have said, we undermine the very things that our forefathers have fought for in defending this great country. I am delighted to speak with other colleagues on this motion. I would like to leave some time for the member for Lowe to make his comments because I know what happens with these motions: the minutes get consumed. I finish my remarks by supporting the recognition by this House in expressing its unequivocal condemnation of anti-Semitism, of violence directed against Jews and Jewish religious and cultural institutions, and all forms of racial and ethnic hatred, persecution and discrimination on ethnic or religious grounds. I do not know what I would do if I were subjected to it. I have the freedom to express the faith that I enjoy, and I want everybody to have that same right. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>24752</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MURPHY</name><name.id>83D</name.id><electorate>Lowe</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank the member for Mallee. I commend the member for Wentworth's motion before the House and the contribution by the member for Melbourne Ports and the other speakers. In supporting this motion it is timely to reflect on one of the core foundations of democracy: the principle of universalism. Australia's jurisprudence is founded upon inalienable democratic principles, including universalism, the rule of law, natural justice and procedural fairness, to name just a few. Take away any of these basic tenets of jurisprudence or compromise them in any way and democracy itself is compromised.</para></talk.start><para>Universalism means that every human being holds inalienable rights. The opposite of universalism is relativism. Governments founded on relative ideology use moral, religious or other dogma to assert that certain human beings lose or forfeit their humanity simply because of who they are. Disturbingly, relativist ideologies can be used to discriminate against human beings on religious or racial grounds or their relative value to society. Anti-Semitic ideologies, like any cultural or moral relativist ideologies, offend the senses. This is so not because a person holds a subjective view of whether Jews should or should not be seen in a certain way but because there is an intrinsic wrongness in a government or person discriminating between a person's intrinsic dignity as a person and the ideology or view that detracts from that dignity.</para><para>There are examples throughout history of both cultural and moral relativist ideologies that are anti-Semitic. These regimes have never survived and eventually come crashing down. Any ideology that proclaims relativist views cannot stand the test of time, for such ideologies are founded on presumptions that offend the natural law—the law of reason. Notorious examples of anti-Semitism have included communist, fascist and other totalitarian regimes. Today a new wave of religious anti-Semitism attempts to justify itself on similar relativist ideologies. Moral relativist laws discriminate against asylum seekers or unborn children, including the human embryo. Indeed, the application of relativist ideology is a social cost of flawed law making.</para><para>Terrorism may be described as culturally relativist ideologies `otherising' and dehumanising innocent people in the name of freedom and retributive justice. These terrorists would seek to kill innocent people with moral justification, and such thinking is the logical consequence of moral and cultural relativism. We would all do well to heed the warnings of anti-Semitism and learn to correct relativist anomalies in areas such as antiterrorist laws, border protection, immigration, the rights of the unborn child and family and gender equality laws, and enshrine universalism as the touchstone in all law making. I believe you cannot fight fire with fire, and a lasting peace for the world will only be achieved when all the world's children are taught to truly understand the meaning of jurisprudence.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

I recently met with senior management at Wollongong Hospital, who are seeking federal assistance in obtaining a Medicare licence for a magnetic resonance imaging machine—an MRI—as the state government has allocated $2.8 million for a machine to be in place by the end of June. I wrote to the Minister for Health and Ageing on 21 January asking for such a licence and have yet to receive a reply. This matter is urgent, Mr Speaker. It is one which should have been dealt with years ago—and would have been were it not for the Wooldridge MRI scam scandal of 1999, wherein licences were handed out left, right and centre to small private operators throughout Australia, to the detriment of large regional and teaching hospitals such as Wollongong Hospital.</para></talk.start><para>At present the Illawarra, a region of over 300,000 people, is serviced by one small private MRI clinic which is subject to three-week waiting lists and is not able to adequately deal with emergency situations at the nearby Wollongong Hospital. This is clearly a case of the government favouring the private health sector against the public sector and the public good. I would ask the minister to respond to my call, consider the urgent need and issue a licence to the new MRI machine at Wollongong Hospital immediately. If he does not do this, that large section of the community which does not have private health insurance or independent means will be unable to access this important diagnostic facility and the emergency response of the largest hospital in the region will be less than it could be.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Capital Territory: Prison</title><page.no>24753</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>24753</page.no><name role="metadata">Nairn, Gary, MP</name><name role="display">Mr NAIRN</name><name.id>OK6</name.id><electorate>Eden-Monaro</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In recent weeks the ACT government has attempted to locate a jail on land where the closest residents do not get to vote in ACT elections.

Last Thursday night a public meeting of nearly 200 people passed a number of motions in relation to the ACT government's actions. The first motion, passed unanimously, demanded that the ACT government immediately reverse its decision to locate its jail at Hume. Another motion referring to the possibility of land near the airport being available called on the ACT government to consider using its own land in the Majura area if the land near the airport is not available. The Australian government is currently determining what the future needs of the airport are—something that everyone should agree is necessary.

Even more worrying is the release of a toxic plume of sediments into the bay.

I think there is a much more immediate concern about local content—the proposal by the ABC to nationalise its sport news coverage out of Sydney. The problem is not about whether the service is going to come from Sydney; the problem is that the ABC is planning to centralise it. It is nonsense for those advocating the experiment to suggest that there will still be the possibility for local sport to be covered. In the relatively small amount of time available each day within its 7 p.m. news bulletin, it is difficult for the ABC to cover all the major national news sport stories of the day, let alone a range of local stories from around the country. </para></talk.start><para>What is considered a major sport in one city of Australia is in many cases hardly worth a mention in other cities. From a Tasmanian perspective, I can foresee the only occasion on which we might get a mention in a national bulletin might be once a year when the yachts make it in from Sydney. I doubt that the city to casino fun run, the Launceston Cup or even the Tassie Thousands Axemen's Series would get a run nationally. We have already seen ABC current affairs coverage essentially nationalised down to just 30 minutes local content per week. Aggregation of regional commercial television and the arrangements that go with it have seen significant reduction in local news, sport and current affairs coverage on our alternate viewing channels. A real sense of local community is important on our television screens.

I think it is a fair, reasonable and entirely defensible—and, indeed, well-arguable—proposition that people who enter into an arrangement or part of their career on a certain basis are entitled to enjoy the entitlements of that arrangement as they entered into it. Speaking for myself, I will be very happy at any time to answer to the Australian public in relation to my stewardship of both the position that I now hold and the positions that I have held during my almost 30 years in public life.

The member for Boothby takes a great deal of interest in this issue, not just on behalf of his constituents in Adelaide—some of whom may benefit in the automotive sector from this deal—but also as the chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, which will be running a critical analysis of the negotiated outcome of the Australia-United States free trade agreement. In response to his question, the South Australian Labor government did have some work done prior to this agreement. That was conducted by the Allen Consulting Group, and they found broad benefits to the Australian economy. Their report indicated that, even with no improvement in agriculture, no access for cars and automotive parts, and no access to the US government procurement market, the gains to Australia would grow by around $500 million per annum. That is with those three key areas excluded from their analysis. As we know, those three areas are now included in the deal that has been negotiated. Every state, and the Northern Territory, is better off, according to the analysis by the Allen Consulting Group. Even with no sugar access, Queensland is a straightforward winner, according to this report that was delivered to the South Australian Labor government.</para></talk.start><para>The member for Boothby asked if there are other examples of industries that are clear winners and that support what we have done. There are. I instance a couple of very diverse and different industries in Australia—one being the macadamia industry. Macadamia farmers will see real gains. Our macadamia nut exports attract a tariff of 5c a kilo on unprocessed nuts and a tariff of 17.6 per cent on value-added products, such as roasted nuts. Under the agreement, the tariff on unprocessed nuts will disappear immediately and the value-added tariff will be phased out over four years.</para><para>The macadamia industry is worth $120 million and it employs 5,000 people. It is a labour intensive industry. Members of the industry are looking forward to better access to the world's biggest market for macadamia nuts. Graeme Hargreaves, the President the Australian Macadamia Society, said that the tariff removal would enable Australian growers to do more value adding here, create more jobs and expand the industry.</para><para>The FTA could also enormously benefit our health sector.

It is perfectly open to the Labor Party to support this measure without inhibiting their capacity, if they were to win the next election, to introduce their own policy, because there is no conflict between what Labor are offering in this area and the introduction of the MedicarePlus safety net. The only reason Labor are against this is because it has been put up by the Howard government. That is the reason, and that, of course, is why they are against the free trade agreement.

In response, let me make essentially three points. First of all, this country has entered into free trade agreements since 1983, which was the year when we entered into the closer economic relations agreement with New Zealand. A review was done last year—the 20th anniversary of CER—and it found that, as a result of that agreement, two-way trade had grown by 550 per cent in those 20 years. So the benefits have been enormous for New Zealand as well as Australia. Proportionately, I would concede the benefits have been greater for New Zealand because it is the smaller economy but nevertheless benefits have been there for Australia as well. It has been a good thing. There have also been free trade agreements negotiated recently with Singapore and Thailand.</para></talk.start><para>The fact is that these agreements are a win-win situation for Australian trade. I note that the Labor Party did not oppose any of those agreements. Although the free trade agreement with New Zealand was negotiated by the Fraser government it was actually brought into force once the Hawke government came to power—no opposition from the Labor Party.</para><para>The second point I would make is that the free trade agreement Australia has entered into with the United States is not unique in another respect: the United States is entering into free trade agreements with a number of other countries. Recently, it concluded a free trade agreement with Chile. It is negotiating a free trade area of the Americas, which is expected to be completed in 2005, and it is about to initiate negotiations with Thailand. One point that the House—particularly the opposition—needs to reflect on is that if we do not proceed with our free trade agreement with the United States then those countries that have concluded those agreements will gain a still greater competitive advantage over Australia in the American market.</para><para>My own electorate includes a lot of grape growers and winemakers, as does yours, Mr Speaker. Those people will be less competitive in the American market after the free trade agreement with Chile comes into effect because Chileans will have the advantage over Australians in the American wine market. The list of countries that have FTAs with America will grow and grow and our relative disadvantage in that American market will grow and grow if the Labor Party gets its way and scuttles the free trade agreement with the United States.</para><para>Let me make my final point: Labor's proposal is apparently that it is better to reject the free trade agreement we negotiated, it is—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83U</name.id><name role="metadata">Cox, David, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order, the member for Kingston's wishes to continually interrupt!

The free trade agreement is unambiguously good news for science and technology. It gives us the opportunity to better tap into the world's largest and most successful and best funded science and innovation system. The free trade agreement will encourage United States venture capital and know-how investment in Australia that will boost scientific research uptake, particularly in the area of commercialisation of research.</para></talk.start><para>Let me give two examples of how the FTA will enhance the size of our markets and create new opportunities. Firstly, in the private sector there is ResMed. That, as many members would know, is a distinguished New South Wales based manufacturer, specialising in products for the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders. They have established a new factory in the north-west of Sydney in the electorate of Mitchell. I have visited that area with the member for Mitchell and met a great many of his science and innovation practitioners. I know that this is very considerable investment for his electorate, as well as for the nation. The company advises us that implementation of the FTA could be worth several million in sales in the short-term, with the prospect of a much larger uptake in the years ahead.</para><para>Let us look now at the public sector and the science agency CSIRO. CSIRO's experience is that engagement with the United States presently comprises a variety of impediments and CSIRO's view is that the FTA will lead to advantages particularly in relation to its more commercially oriented projects where it has an Australian company as a partner—and that is the key to it: where it is in partnership with an Australian company. CSIRO is involved in discussions on hybrid and electric vehicles, fuel cells, light metals, hydrogen storage in the form of super capacitors and batteries from the automotive industry. CSIRO considers that the FTA will facilitate this engagement and that it removes both perceived and real barriers to expanding collaborative efforts in these important areas. Other examples include CSIRO's extensive research collaboration with Boeing in Seattle, which also offers the prospect of expansion under the FTA. </para><para>It is incomprehensible that the Australian Labor Party is opposing the FTA. Anybody with an interest in science and innovation knows that it is to the benefit of Australia in a way that has not been offered or open to us previously. But the Australian Labor Party's opposition should not surprise us, with its complete absence of a science and technology policy. There was but one item discussed at its recent national conference, and that was a resolution moved by the still invisible shadow minister for science which committed the Labor Party to completing the $300 million construction of the replacement research reactor at Lucas Heights, but not to operating it once its construction has been completed. Instead there would be another inquiry into the research reactor; that would be the seventh inquiry in the last decade. The Labor Party has no science policy. The stupidity of completing the construction of the research reactor but not operating it defies belief. But, then again, this is the Australian Labor Party that has never been able to distinguish the national interest from its own self-interest.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Trade: Free Trade Agreement</title><page.no>24765</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>24765</page.no><name role="metadata">Windsor, Antony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr WINDSOR</name><name.id>009LP</name.id><electorate>New England</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Prime Minister.

I can inform the House that the Australian Bureau of Statistics released the December lending finance figures today. Those figures showed that in December total housing finance fell by 3.9 per cent following a four per cent fall in November. I should put that in perspective. Notwithstanding a fall in both November and December, over the course of the year housing finance has risen still by 20.0 per cent. The decline in housing finance in the latter part of 2003 reflected a fall in both owner-occupier and investor finance: owner-occupier finance decreased by 2.5 per cent in December following a 3.4 per cent fall in November, and investing housing finance decreased four per cent in December after a 5.6 per cent decrease in November. The lending finance publication also shows that personal finance commitments fell 1.1 per cent in December while commercial finance remains very strong, increasing by 9.3 per cent.</para></talk.start><para>These figures appear to confirm other signs that indicate the housing market is beginning to cool. These include a decrease in building approvals, lower auction clearance rates and slower house price growth. Over the course of the last year and indeed previous years, housing finance has dramatically increased, as you would expect in an economy where interest rates are at historical lows, where consumer confidence is at historical highs and where unemployment is at the lowest rate for 22 years. Notwithstanding that, the growth in housing finance, building approvals and prices has been at such a rate that it is hard to think that it would be sustainable over the medium to longer term.</para><para>So the government welcomes the fact that it looks like prices are beginning to stabilise and lending finance is beginning to stabilise as well. The likelihood is that, if those indicators plateau and there is a stabilisation, the situation will be more sustainable over the medium term and into the longer term and that the housing market could avoid a substantial correction. I think overall these figures, notwithstanding their showing a decline, will be welcome. They will be consistent with a slowing in the market, which gives better options over the medium to longer term.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Taxation: Family Payments</title><page.no>24766</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>24766</page.no><name role="metadata">Swan, Wayne, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SWAN</name><name.id>2V5</name.id><electorate>Lilley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question without notice is directed to the Prime Minister.

The introduction of A New Tax System in 2000 brought lower personal tax rates and enhanced government transfers to families with dependent children. The government spends over $8.5 billion per annum on family tax benefit part A, which has strengthened financial support for low- and middle-income families. It spends over $2.5 billion per annum on family tax benefit part B, which has made the choice to have a parent at home caring for children full-time, particularly in children's early years, more viable for many families, including sole parents. Expenditure on childcare benefit has grown to over $1.3 billion per annum, improving the previously declining affordability of child care, particularly for lower income worker families.</para></quote><para>Paragraph 81 goes on and gets even better. It says:</para><quote><para>The government's reforms to the workplace relations system have increased flexibility for employers to provide and for employees to negotiate family friendly policies tailored to the individual workplace.

As the opposition will know, in preparing the last budget, after providing for necessary additional expenditure on defence and national security, it was decided that priority should be given to across-the-board tax relief. Any suggestion from the opposition that the government deliberately sat on this report, having the capacity to implement further enhancements while at the same time delivering tax cuts and extra spending on defence and national security, is completely wrong and one that I totally reject.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Roads: Funding</title><page.no>24767</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>24767</page.no><name role="metadata">Hartsuyker, Luke, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HARTSUYKER</name><name.id>00AMM</name.id><electorate>Cowper</electorate><party>NATS</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services.

As members are aware, the Australian government has been working to ensure that rural and regional roads are properly funded. Often those roads are small, out of sight and all too easily put out of mind, yet the great bulk of our exports start on those roads, as do a lot of our jobs and a great deal of the nation's value adding. There are also many social factors, such as the capacity to get your kids to school when it has been raining, to get to a doctor in an emergency and so forth.</para></talk.start><para>It is hard to think of a program that has been more widely welcomed the length and breadth of the nation than Roads to Recovery. It has been extremely successful in delivering funds to where those funds are needed and where they can do the most good—directly to the councils across the nation. To that end, as part of a $2 billion increased funding package for roads that I announced in January, I announced an additional $1.2 billion to continue this program for a further four years. That is $1.2 billion of new money, an additional $300 million per year to be provided to local authorities. Two-hundred million dollars will be provided on exactly the same formula that is used at the moment, with some minor variations where there have been shire boundary changes and to look after the interests of those unincorporated areas in the really remote parts of the country. We will also be allowing councils to bid for another $100 million on the basis that they use it for projects with strategic importance, such as timber roads, other industries' exporting roads and export performance. In other words, we are looking for councils to think strategically about their local region.</para><para>So I have been overwhelmed and I think government members have been overwhelmed—and I am sure members of the ALP have been overwhelmed too—by the great outpouring of popular enthusiasm, particularly from councils. Many of them were very relieved. They had been subjected to a scare campaign suggesting that the program would be finished, but that is not the case.</para><para>I was asked about alternative policies. I have to say on this one the Labor Party's position has been extraordinarily difficult to follow. Their initial reaction when we launched this package was that it was a `boondoggle'—do we all remember that word? It was a boondoggle. We all went scrambling for dictionaries, thesauruses and so forth to find out what a boondoggle was. It was not very nice. But it soon became clear that local councils thought the program was the best thing since sliced bread. And then we saw a bit of populist moving from the Labor Party. They decided that perhaps they would support the program, but they would not rule out changing it for their own ends.</para><para>Then the shadow spokesman, the member for Batman, said that what the program needed was—wait for it—a `strategic' element. So we said we would have a strategic element, and then the shadow spokesman attacked it because, he said, it would be a slush fund for use in the coming election. The only problem with that is that the strategic element does not appear until halfway through next term. So then Labor said that they would continue a Roads to Recovery `style' of program.</para><para>The member for Batman stated that the Labor Party's program would have strict criteria, to be determined by industry and all tiers of government. That means that the Labor Party intend that the program should no longer be untied. What do local governments most appreciate about the program? It is the fact that they can allocate it according to their priorities, because they know where they are. But there are those in the Labor Party making it plain that they are going to tell councils what they can build and what they cannot build. They are either going to tie it directly to themselves or, even worse, they are going to give it to the state governments—the very thing local governments most fear—so that they can set councils' schedules.</para><para>So I reckon the Labor Party ought to come clean on this. They ought to tell us what they intend to do with this program. Until they clarify their position, there will be real uncertainty, and local governments need certainty on this so that they can plan ahead. I challenge the Leader of the Opposition, in his newfound desire to rush out and please everyone, to tell local governments what he intends doing with this program so that local governments can plan with certainty.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Workplace Relations: Paid Maternity Leave</title><page.no>24769</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>24769</page.no><name role="metadata">Macklin, Jenny, MP</name><name role="display">Ms MACKLIN</name><name.id>PG6</name.id><electorate>Jagajaga</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Prime Minister.

We did not hear the Australian Labor Party standing up and saying, `You shouldn't have tax cuts; you should have paid maternity leave instead.' The Australian Labor Party were not saying that; they were perfectly happy to adopt our priority. As I indicated last week, policy in the area of work and family remains under consideration. But the member for Jagajaga ought to understand—she has been in this place long enough to know it—that if you spend your available resources and do not make proper provision for a surplus and financially prudent management, you will pretty quickly run this country back into the sorts of economic conditions that obtained under the former government.</para></talk.start></continue></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Medicare: Reform</title><page.no>24769</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>24769</page.no><name role="metadata">Elson, Kay, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs ELSON</name><name.id>6K6</name.id><electorate>Forde</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Ageing.

None of these services have ever been widely bulk-billed. For the 1,100 Australian families which have already incurred more than $500 in out-of-pocket doctor expenses in just one month of January, only five per cent of these are attributable to GP costs.

Not only will they continue to keep the burden of unfair dismissal laws on small business but they will abolish Australian workplace agreements and they will give a right of entry to bullying union leaders. They will make it a requirement of doing business with any future Labor government that companies disclose the identity of their subcontractors so that the union bovver boys can go along and exercise the appropriate amount of muscle if they are not doing the right thing by their comrades.

The Australian Labor Party intend to expand the definition of `employee' to include all those in so-called employment type contracts. In other words, independent contractors in Australia, some of those 800,000 small business operators in this country, would be dragged by the Labor Party into the industrial relations and workplace relations scheme in this country. If this sounds like rhetoric, let me explain it with a real example being imposed by the Australian Labor Party right at this time.

The damage to Australian agriculture has been put at about $100 million annually, but I contend that this figure is quite misleading. The impact on the environment could well be many times this figure in terms of restoration and repair, while the potential for the spread of disease could be catastrophic. The draft threat abatement plan on feral pigs prepared by the Department of the Environment and Heritage has been welcomed by the Cattle Council and the Australian Veterinary Association, but these organisations believe that the plan fails to include a vital eighth objective—namely, that there should be a coordinated removal of feral pig populations from areas of known low prevalence.</para><para>Feral pigs and the problems that they cause are usually associated with the western areas of New South Wales, Queensland and the Northern Territory. However, there is potential for a break-out of pigs in certain parts of my own electorate, particularly areas adjacent to state forests and national parks. A trapping program in the south-east portion of the Central Tablelands Rural Lands Protection Board area has regularly netted between 200 and 300 pigs per annum. At the moment this represents a major threat to water quality. Much of their roaming area covers both the Sydney water catchment and the upper reaches of the Lachlan catchment. Indeed, not that long ago on my way from Canberra, across the Abercrombie River towards the villages to the south of Bathurst, I saw a very healthy boar and sow and half a dozen litter crossing the road in front of me.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>849</name.id><name role="metadata">Sidebottom, Sid, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Sidebottom</name></talker><para>—Name him!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>KL6</name.id><name role="metadata">Andren, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDREN</name></talker><para>—I did not see a nose in the trough, but it was a very recognisable and healthy member of the porcine population. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The Kanimbla Valley to the east of my electorate has another significant feral pig problem, and control in these areas is described by the board as a `holding operation only'. Likewise, while a baiting program appears to have feral pigs under control in areas like Nangar National Park in the Forbes area, there is an ever present threat of the pig population multiplying if the conditions are right. There could be anywhere up to 23 million feral pigs in this country—that is one for every human inhabitant and several million left over. I am sure the member for Braddon would agree that that is quite a frightening prospect.</para><para>The Cattle Council and Australian Veterinary Association believe that, in order to progress control and eradication efforts, a national operational plan should be put in place to incorporate the current programs of the individual states and territories. If we have national programs for things like foot-and-mouth disease, then surely it makes sense that the potential for pigs to spread disease and to harbour exotic disease should be a national concern. Some diseases of concern, such as Japanese encephalitis, also affect humans. Apart from this, the impact of pigs on livestock—including newborn lambs and calves and the resulting production losses—on pasture, creeks and waterways also warrants a national research and control program. According to the Cattle Council and the Veterinary Association, such a program should include an assessment of the diverse state and territory programs, including aerial survey, aerial baiting, trapping strategies, population monitoring and scientific research.</para><para>Some communities, including Indigenous communities, regard feral pigs as a food source, while others export feral pig carcasses. These factors need to be examined in the context of any eradication program. All control methods have animal welfare implications, as do current pig shooting and hunting practices. These all need to be part of a national protocol.</para><para>Other members in this place can no doubt attest to the damage caused by feral pigs to delicate tropical forest areas, while the impact on native wildlife and plants in national parks and forests throughout the country has yet to be documented in any substantial way. A workshop in Cairns last June saw the Queensland Department of Natural Resources, Mines and Energy, the Australian Veterinary Association, the Cattle Council and rainforest and pest cooperative research councils come together with Environment Australia, state governments, chemical manufacturers, the livestock industry and other stakeholders in the biggest ever feral pig workshop.</para><para>The workshop sought an agreement that eradication of the threat from feral pigs is the long-term goal. It agreed it would be necessary to gain the support of the federal government for a nationally coordinated program. The Cattle Council and Veterinary Association do not see the Environment Australia draft threat abatement plan, welcome as it is, as an acceptable or adequate approach to the feral pig problem. This motion calls for the government to develop a nationally coordinated approach to the feral pig problem, and I commend it to the House.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Jenkins)</inline>—Is the motion seconded?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>009LP</name.id><name role="metadata">Windsor, Antony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Windsor</name></talker><para>—I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>24788</page.no><name role="metadata">Tollner, David, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TOLLNER</name><name.id>00AN4</name.id><electorate>Solomon</electorate><party>CLP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I support my good friend the member for Calare's motion. I agree that feral pigs are a threat to the environment; they are in ever-increasing numbers. But I believe this problem presents a big opportunity for Australia as a whole. I come from the Northern Territory, as most members in this place will know. Prior to being elected to this place, I lived on a buffalo holding yard about 65 kilometres out of Darwin. Every afternoon after work I would jump in a bull-catching vehicle, jaunt off through the scrub and get amongst the pigs, as they say in the North. There was no end to the line-up of people who wanted to come out with me. I took out `Crusher' Cleal, a famous rugby league player, and Gary Ablett, a now infamous Aussie Rules player. There was never any shortage of people wanting to go out with me. As a mate of mine the member for Goyder in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly informed me today, pig hunting is probably the principal pastime of the vast majority of people aged between 16 and 35 in his electorate.</para></talk.start><para>Feral pigs represent a great economic opportunity for Australia. The average pig caught in the Northern Territory is sold for around $1 per kilo to a chiller box operator, who then on-sells it. They dress the pig and then on-sell it to markets overseas. I am informed that feral pig meat goes for about $80 per kilo in the European market and there are not enough processing facilities in Australia to meet that demand. Additionally, a couple of years ago the Japanese wanted 500 pigs sent to them per week, for which they were prepared to pay $60 per kilo.</para><para>The big problem I see is not lack of initiative or concern to get rid of the feral pig population in Australia but access to some of the habitats in which feral pigs breed and their numbers increase. A classic example is Kakadu National Park. The government spends close to $1 million a year paying public servants to go out there and humanely shoot feral pigs. Those efforts have not reduced the number of feral pigs, and most Territorians will be able to tell you that the best hunting of pigs occurs on the boundary of Kakadu National Park. The national park is a breeding ground for pigs. We are spending, as I said, in the order of $1 million to eradicate these pigs, irrespective of the fact that there are a number of people who have offered to pay to do the job. Access is the main obstacle. Pastoralists in the Northern Territory found, when the live export markets for cattle decreased, that the only thing that kept them going—that kept them afloat—was their feral pig populations. But additional problems accessing Aboriginal land, involving permit systems, do not present the opportunity for people to get in there and clean up the pig populations.</para><para>With regard to hunting pigs, there are some people who have concerns about amateur or professional hunters going into national parks with rifles or the like. I remind the House that pigs can be trapped quite easily without the use of rifles, dogs or knives. Additionally, there are some good checks and balances in the system. Hunters are required to have accreditation so that they know how to properly dress a pig. They leave in vital organs so authorities can identify potential diseases. I commend this motion to the House. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>24789</page.no><name role="metadata">Windsor, Antony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr WINDSOR</name><name.id>009LP</name.id><electorate>New England</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It was with pleasure that I seconded the motion put forward by the member for Calare that promotes a national campaign in relation to feral pig control. If ever there were a need for the nation to take the lead on a particular domestic issue within the agricultural sector, it is on this issue, particularly in regional Australia. There is a need to have a national program, as is being promoted by the Cattle Council, the Australian Veterinary Association and many other groups. </para></talk.start><para>One of the great difficulties that people have in eradicating feral pigs is the coordination of strategies. I have not only been involved in the shooting of pigs and poisoning of pigs on our own property but have also been on quite a few helicopter shoots in the western parts of New South Wales. In some areas there are quite well coordinated strategies between groups of neighbours, rural lands protection boards and those sorts of organisations; but they are quite small and quite often there are problems with eradication on state boundaries, with different states and organisations having different ways of dealing with the problem. Often you will get a situation arising where one strategy is undertaken on one side of a border and that strategy does not embrace the other side of the border, for some particular reason. It may be due to access provisions, as the member for Solomon mentioned, it may be access to national parks, or it may be bordering a state boundary. There are all sorts of strategic problems with the way the system is set up at the moment.</para><para>If we are talking about border protection and the protection of our capacity to be involved in free trade—both very pertinent issues of the day—we really must start to talk about the potential of disease and the way in which it can be spread by feral pigs. That issue must be looked at on a national basis. You cannot leave it to the ad hoc processes that we have now. I do not think that we are doing enough in relation to feral pig control. I support a national program and, as I said, I think it is something that the states should have been looking at. I would take the motion before us one step forward, by calling on all those involved—the Cattle Council, the Australian Veterinary Association, the farming community generally and our trade people—with the federal government taking the lead, to come together in some form of national summit to organise a strategy for feral animal control. I do not just say `feral pig control', although it is probably the worst of the lot, but say `feral animal control'. In my electorate, for instance, there are feral pigs across a wide expanse, but there has also been an outbreak of the dingo population, particularly in the Tenterfield area. There, again, the problem that the member for Solomon commented on, about the breeding grounds within national parks and different strategies adopted for controlling feral animals within national parks, needs to be addressed.</para><para>If we are serious about the protection of internal Australia—and we seem to be very serious about our external protective mechanisms and allowing, or not allowing, people to come to our nation—we should be very serious about the threats within, particularly the spread of disease, the impacts on the environment that the member for Calare mentioned, and all the other economic disadvantages that are incurred by allowing these feral animals to go about their business as they are now, without a national approach to the problem.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>24790</page.no><name role="metadata">Cobb, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JOHN COBB</name><name.id>00AN1</name.id><electorate>Parkes</electorate><party>NATS</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As a farmer who has probably bred and harboured his fair share of pigs over the years, I guess I can sympathise in quite a large part with the member for Calare's motion. Without doubt, the pig is not an animal that is conducive to the Australian landscape—except to those who want to raise them; it certainly is conducive to them. The pig is probably one of the toughest animals you strike out in the bush, and it certainly does do a lot of damage in an environmental sense, but more particularly it does a lot of damage to our domestic livestock. It is a particularly harsh animal on lambing ewes. Anyone who has ever seen a pig attack a live sheep that is bogged in a dam will not have much sympathy for the pig. They are a pretty terrible animal for Australia's domestic livestock.</para></talk.start><para>Without doubt, if we should have an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, or any other exotic disease, the pig is probably one of the gravest risks we run—along with foxes and crows—as to what could be carried from one area to another, and pretty rapidly at that. There are, however, parts of this motion that I do have some contention with. One is that the feral pig population is 23 million. I think that is an absolute top figure, and I do not think there is any question that it is that high. If you look at the reports you will see that they say the population is somewhere between 2½ million, or three million, up to 23 million. We are probably looking at a figure of around 13 million or 14 million.</para><para>But that is not the main issue. It has been determined pretty strongly that it is almost impossible to eradicate pigs in Australia today. There are areas of concentrated pig population, and there is an enormous impact on not just the domestic farming situation but also the environmental situation. Those concentrations of pigs are what we have to deal with, and it can be done. One of the biggest problems is getting farmers—and I am a farmer, so I ought to know—in an area to agree about how to handle them. In New South Wales, for example, we have the rural lands protection boards, which are funded in large part by the Commonwealth government, to help eradicate them. My wife is a director of the rural lands protection board in our area, and every time they try to run a campaign it is very hard to get all the farmers in the area to combine to do it. If they did, this problem would be a lot easier.</para><para>But we do have two situations: we have regions where there are scattered populations of pigs but not a lot of them, and there are areas where pigs are concentrated and where they must, should and can be dealt with. As I said, we have to get cooperation from the farmers, and we also have the other problem referred to by the member for Solomon, which is state and national parks. People who could help us a lot are the pig hunters, who do one hell of a good job, but parks tend to not allow them in. They do baiting and other programs in some cases but, by and large, they do not let pig hunters in. Let me tell you something about pig hunters: they do a good job. I remember that the previous New South Wales Minister for Agriculture, Richard Amery, wanted to ban pig hunting with dogs and so on, but that is the wrong attitude. They are far better off keeping the pig population down than they are hanging around town drinking grog or smoking marijuana. Hunting pigs is what they do, and they do a damn good job. I think that, whether it is them and their dogs, or whatever it is, they are better off doing that than they are hanging around town on the weekends.</para><para>It is not true to say there are no programs. The Commonwealth is involved in quite a few programs including through the money we put into cooperative research centres, CRCs, which are involved in research into effective control measures the federal Department of the Environment and Heritage; the Australian government's $1 million animal management grants program; the Natural Heritage Trust grants for on-ground pest animal management and the National Feral Animal Control Program. The state governments have primary responsibility here, because they are the land managers. We can back them up with money—and in western New South Wales we put well over $700,000 into the Rural Lands Protection Board to help it to be done. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>24791</page.no><name role="metadata">Billson, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BILLSON</name><name.id>1K6</name.id><electorate>Dunkley</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to provide encouragement for the member for Calare on his motion on feral pigs and also to put on the record that there are things happening. We can be a little bit upbeat and a little bit positive about the fact that progress is being made. Perhaps his motion best reflects a bit of a `come on', a bit of encouragement to keep that work going. </para></talk.start><para>What I knew about feral pigs before being asked to speak on this I could have written on the back of a postage stamp, so my research has been quite thorough. I was encouraged to make a contribution. The best thing we can do at a national plan level is to not teach pigs how to swim. I am told, reliably, by my parliamentary colleagues in the north of Victoria that we do not have too many feral pigs there and that, as long as the Murray River flows, the feral pigs will stay mainly in New South Wales. That is the first part of our national plan—to not teach feral pigs to swim!</para><para>Feral pigs are a significant problem for farmers because they eat crops, pastures and lambs. The concern of conservation interests around feral pigs is their selective feeding, their trampling and their eating habit called `rooting', where they dig out the roots of plants. That can have a negative impact on native plants and animals, including invertebrates.</para><para>I am also grateful to Choquenot, McIlroy and Korn, who in their 1996 publication entitled <inline font-style="italic">Managing vertebrate pests: feral pigs,</inline> published by the Bureau of Resource Sciences, highlight the quarantine risk that feral pigs represent in respect of the breakout of exotic diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease. On the other hand I am told, and reliably assured by my colleague the member for Solomon, that feral pigs are quite a luxury in the EU. A feral pig hits the EU market at $80 a kilogram, and a feral pig into Japan is $60 a kilogram landed. That represents a substantial return on a natural resource that is causing problems for our farmers, for our environment and for our land managers. </para><para>The government recognises and understands the concern about the impact of feral pigs. As I mentioned earlier, it is not as if the government has been sitting on its hands on this. The livestock production values and the environmental values that are damaged by feral pig populations are a huge motive for federal government involvement. As my colleague Mr Cobb mentioned, nearly three-quarters of a million dollars is being spent this year on tackling feral pigs. But the responsibility rests primarily with the states, as they are the primary land managers and constitutionally the jurisdiction with responsibility for land and water management.</para><para>Notwithstanding that fact, it is known that there is a feral pig problem in Kakadu, and steps are being pursued to address that through the threat abatement plan for predation, habitat degradation, competition and disease transmission by feral pigs, known as TAPP. That plan sets the national framework to guide the coordinated implementation of these objectives and actions to contain the spread of feral pigs, which have been recognised as a threatening process. The impact of feral pigs on threatened species in ecological communities is an issue which has been recognised under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. For my colleagues on this side, that is a harmonious coming together of interests through the EPBC Act. The three-month public comment period for the threat abatement plan for predation, habitat degradation, competition and disease transmission by feral pigs is now nearing its end. The final version of that plan is currently being prepared for ministerial endorsement. So there are things going on.</para><para>There are seven key objectives for the prevention of the establishment of feral pigs in areas where they are not currently present. I draw people's attention to the relatively inconclusive research available about the extent of the problem. To give one example and point out why there is a need for the kinds of research my colleagues have spoken about, there is a thought that the typical density of feral pigs is about one to two animals per square kilometre, but up to 80 pigs per square kilometre have been recorded in the Macquarie Marshes in New South Wales. So you see there are very high concentrations of feral pig populations. As I said earlier, there is an integrated strategy being put in place. I would encourage all the stakeholders to get behind that strategy. </para><para>Feral pig management in national parks is an issue for the Commonwealth. The Kakadu National Park Plan of Management addresses these issues. There is clearly work to be done as we better understand the plight of land managers and the consequences of a pig population that we can only nail down to a range of 3½ million to 23½ million. That is a huge window of potential population and underscores the need for further research and investigation, which is at the heart of the Commonwealth's response.</para><para>There are other issues around quantifying the environmental impact on threatened species in ecological communities. An example is turtle eggs. There is evidence that a feral pig can have a devastating impact on the turtle community, and I would encourage cooperative efforts in that area. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>24792</page.no><name role="metadata">Hatton, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HATTON</name><name.id>LN6</name.id><electorate>Blaxland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to commend the member for Calare for bringing this motion on feral pigs before the House and congratulate the other speakers who have put their points of view with regard to an issue that is germane to all of us. Whether country, city, metropolitan, rural or regional members, everyone is impacted upon, in one way or another, by these measures. Most of the people who have spoken have been from rural electorates.

The second part is the question there has been some debate on: the question of numbers—a few million, 13 million or 14 million or up to 23 million. The numbers are not as important as the identification of the problem and of the need for this issue to be addressed nationally. It is not just a state issue; it is not just a local government problem; it is a national one.</para><para>Here I commend a past shadow minister for the environment from the Liberal Party, Ian McLachlan, who saw, quite clearly, that a national government should not walk away from national problems such as those concerned with feral pigs and other feral animals. He quite rightly put an environmental policy into place which put the emphasis on attacking these problems from a national point of view. Since his exit as the shadow minister for the environment and from this place, that fundamentally national focus has been lost. He was a key person, given that he used to be in the National Farmers Federation, who spoke to what the government had put forward: a central drive to try to get a coordinated approach across all levels of government.</para><para>It is important for everyone who lives in a city electorate to understand that Australia has been impacted upon adversely in terms of the environment and quality of life—not only for farmers but also for people in provincial towns and more broadly—because introduced populations that have gone feral have dramatically damaged our national environment.</para><para>There just is not the capacity for shire or state governments to act on their own to deal with the problem because of its immense scale. We know about cane toads, feral pigs and other introduced species where, if you do not have a national approach such as we have had in trying to deal with the rabbit problem and prickly pear, you do not get the appropriate coordination that the member for Calare has sought, and the member for New England argued for, in this motion. Without that fundamentally cooperative national approach the problem cannot be pinned down. All of the resources of our nation need to be brought to bear on this to radically reduce the problem to manageable proportions for farmers and people in rural Australia generally.</para><para>One part of the solution to this problem of feral pigs —and this applies to most of our wildlife problems—is to see what commercial benefit there could be in allowing professional hunters to deal with this. I commend the motion to the House. It is a sane and sensible one.

At the same time a local program, CIRYAR, set up to support young people at risk of self-harm, was threatened with closure due to lack of funding despite its proven record of assisting young people to find their way out of despair and into options—such as training and employment—that would give them a future.</para><para>Reading the family's story and working with local youth support workers to secure the survival of CIRYAR made me aware of the hurdles that many young people face on their path from childhood to adulthood and the responsibility that the government has to either remove those hurdles or at least give young people the tools and assistance to overcome them.</para><para>Figures from the Australian Institute of Health and Wellbeing show that in 2001 self-harm was second only to motor vehicle accidents as the most frequent cause of death for young people between the ages of 12 and 24. The incidence of suicide among young men is of particular concern, with the disaggregated figures indicating that in the 12 to 24 age group males account for 81 per cent of suicide deaths. International comparisons show that the rate of suicide among young men in Australia is one of the highest in the world. The historical comparisons also ring alarm bells. The rate of suicide as a cause of death for young people has almost doubled in the past 20 years. There has also been an increase in the number of attempted suicides over the same period.</para><para>No doubt for each troubled young person who takes that tragic step suicide masquerades as an answer. But for those who are left behind—their family, their friends and the community—there are only questions. We ask ourselves, `Why did this happen?' and `Could anything have been done to prevent the young person's death?' In each individual case of suicide or self-harm there may not be answers to those haunting questions. But at a government and community level answers are emerging as to why young people resort to self-harm.</para><para>When analysing youth suicide it is not correct to talk of causes because each situation is the result of a unique and complex mix of factors. The growing body of research, however, points to risk factors common to a significant proportion of completed suicides. These risk factors include: mental illness, physical and sexual abuse, unemployment, homelessness, family or other interpersonal problems and substance abuse. These problems tend to have a snowballing effect. Often, young people have suffered multiple sources of disadvantage in their lives that leave them with limited coping skills and hence vulnerable to self-harm when faced with a crisis.</para><para>As to the other question, `Could we have done something?' the answer is not a simple `Yes,' but rather, `Yes, we can try.' We now understand the link between these risk factors and suicidal behaviour. Studies also show that in an overwhelming number of suicide cases there are earlier incidents of self-harm that create opportunities for intervention by appropriately trained professionals. Armed with that knowledge we have the ability and the responsibility to develop early intervention programs so that young people at risk can be identified, supported through their immediate crisis and assisted to build up their resources and resilience as a path to the future.</para><para>Self-harm and suicide represent one extreme end of a spectrum of issues facing young people, many of which relate to the enormous changes in our society in recent years. Our progress through life is no longer smooth and linear, and more needs to be done to equip young people with the new skills demanded by an increasingly flexible and rapidly changing world. Particular attention needs to be given to those crucial transition phases between education and work, and youth and adulthood.</para><para>The need for multiple pathways for young people to take them through those difficult transition periods, as well as the absolute necessity for effective early intervention when problems arise, was a key finding of the Prime Minister's Youth Pathways Action Plan Task Force. Its report <inline font-style="italic">Footprints to the future</inline> also recognised the joined up nature of young people's problems. They do not fit neatly into the defined solutions that government programs tend to offer. We have to put the needs of young people first when programs to assist them are developed, and we need to promote collaboration between a range of services. </para><para>Thankfully, this is happening in Rockhampton, and that is thanks to the wonderful work of those associated with CIRYAR. I encourage the government to continue its support for CIRYAR and to use the work of that program as a model for other programs to make sure that we are doing all we can to prevent youth suicide in this country.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Jenkins)</inline>—Is the motion seconded?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AMP</name.id><name role="metadata">Grierson, Sharon, MP</name><name role="display">Ms Grierson</name></talker><para>—I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>24795</page.no><name role="metadata">Baird, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BAIRD</name><name.id>MP6</name.id><electorate>Cook</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish to thank the parliament for giving me the opportunity to speak on this difficult and challenging matter. I certainly congratulate the member for Capricornia for bringing before the House this motion on youth suicide. Youth suicide is a tragic phenomenon which affects Australia in particular. I would find it unlikely that any honourable member of this House has remained untouched by the tragic effects of suicide, with a friend, family member, partner or acquaintance likely to have taken their life.</para></talk.start><para>Suicide, and in particular the suicide of young people, is not a new problem in Australia. Since the 1920s, the suicide rate of all ages in Australia has been between 10 to 14 in every 100,000 people, although this rate spiked during periods such as the Depression in the 1930s and the Second World War. What has been tragic however is that the suicide rate of young men aged between 15 and 24 has tripled in the last four decades.</para><para>In 1995, following recommendations from the WHO and the United Nations, Australia was amongst the first nations in the world to implement a coordinated and multifaceted approach towards tackling the problem of youth suicide with the National Youth Suicide Prevention Strategy. This prevention strategy resulted in a decrease in 1999 in the number of suicides of young males, a rate that had been rising since the early 1970s. In 1999 there were 2,492 suicides compared with 2,683 in 1998. Over the same period the number of suicides for males aged between 15 and 24 fell from 446 to 380. In the year 2002 there were 2,320 suicides, or 11.8 suicides per 100,000 people—a significant reduction from 1997, when there were 14.7 suicides per 100,000 people.</para><para>Suicide is a phenomenon which is often linked to problems such as low employment rates and depression, and the corollary problems associated with depression such as drug abuse and homelessness. We are fortunate in Cook to have a very low unemployment rate—approximately 2.6 per cent in the last quarter. However, problems such as family breakdown, youth depression and, to some extent, drug use are as prevalent in my electorate as they are in other areas of Australia.</para><para>In my own case, I was particularly moved by an incident that occurred the first time I was campaigning for the seat of Cook. Just before I arrived at Woolooware Station to hand out brochures early one morning, a 19-year-old youth leapt in front of the train; he was killed instantly. The autopsy showed that he was drug affected. His parents were devastated. As I asked more regarding this issue, I found that this was not an isolated incident. A number of young people had taken their lives in my electorate. One had simply filled his jacket pockets with stones and walked into the water.</para><para>As a result of discussion with various people in the electorate, we decided to establish the Sutherland Shire Suicide Safety Network. The group started informally drawing on the experiences of the Central Coast Suicide Safety Network. We drew on the resources of local community representatives with some experience in the area. The group was initially chaired by Paul Malliate, who drew the group together into an effective organisation. The current chair of the organisation is Gail Kilby. This organisation is now comprised of representatives from the New South Wales Department of Health, the Sutherland Shire Council, the NSW Police, local church groups, the Department of Education, DOCS, private sector welfare groups and prominent members of the local community. I congratulate the Sutherland Shire Council for taking the initiative in funding; it has certainly made a difference to the organisation.</para><para>What is clear in dealing with a problem such as suicide is that there is no definitive solution that will resolve the angst and feelings of helplessness that people suffer before they suicide. The Sutherland Shire Suicide Safety Network was established to formalise links between organisations and individuals who are involved in reducing the incidence of suicide in the Sutherland Shire. It aims to ensure the provision of services and communication between these organisations is coordinated and unified to facilitate a better understanding of the local services available to those in crisis.</para><para>The National Suicide Prevention Strategy has been a wonderful initiative; it has allowed community initiatives to be established and adequately funded. Under this government initiative, some $10 million dollars is expended each year to develop and fund national and community based initiatives. This funding will be available until the program expires in 2006. The National Suicide Prevention Strategy has been effective in that it specifically targets groups that are at a higher risk than the general community, with particular regard to young males aged 25 to 44 and indigenous Australians. Some 60 per cent of this program's strategy is spent on community based initiatives, while the remaining 40 per cent is expended on national programs. It has been great to see significant reductions in suicide rates amongst young Australians since this program began, but even one preventable death is one too many.</para><para>There is more to be done. The government realises that while good advances have been made, particularly with young people, high rates of suicide continue amongst men aged 25 to 44 and people in rural and regional Australia. In conclusion, there is a limit as to how much government alone can achieve; but by continuing to work with the community we can achieve significant results. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>24796</page.no><name role="metadata">Grierson, Sharon, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GRIERSON</name><name.id>00AMP</name.id><electorate>Newcastle</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to support the private member's motion put forward by the member for Carpentaria, expressing our concern regarding the unacceptably high rates of youth suicide and the impact on young people and their families, and commending organisations in our own communities working to prevent youth suicide. The suicide rate in Australia is the second highest in OECD countries after New Zealand. It is a meaningless statistic until we relate that to our local communities and the lives of our friends and families. As the previous speakers have said, not one of us remains untouched, and to the too many of my friends who have experienced this first hand I express my support and ongoing love for them.</para></talk.start><para>At least one young Australian takes their life every day—and 10 per week on average. But, more alarmingly, over a thousand young Australians will attempt suicide every week of the year. My electorate of Newcastle is no exception, with 59 deaths recorded by the coroner in 2001 and 54 deaths in 2002. The figures for 2003 have not been finalised at this stage, but they are anticipated, fortunately, to have reduced to around 30—a downward movement we would all like to see continue.</para><para>Youth suicide and self-harm come with common indicators that have been mentioned in this debate but, more importantly, I think we all are concerned about the ever present impact of mental illness. We see depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and drug and alcohol abuse affecting our young people. The report, <inline font-style="italic">How young people are faring</inline>, issued last year by the Dusseldorp organisation, showed that at least one in four of our young people are not engaged in any studies or work. Obviously loneliness and isolation add to the picture of pressures on our youth's health and wellbeing.</para><para>Today, youth culture more than ever before faces the temptations of excessive alcohol use. Binge drinking has become easier, with over 900 ready-to-drink alcohol products, commonly referred to as alcopops, readily available. Yet I see some moves by our government to deregulate the industry and make liquor outlets more prevalent in our towns and cities. The Family Drug Support organisation informs us that 13 per cent of all calls last year to their advice and help line concerned alcohol abuse by teenagers. Fortunately, there are many community and non-government agencies who work tirelessly to save as many kids' lives as they possibly can, exhibiting a determination that we admire.</para><para>In my area, we do get in and do it ourselves without relying on government help. In fact, last year former children's magistrate and constant children's advocate Barbara Holborrow said of the Newcastle area, `Of all the places I've visited in Australia, Newcastle has the best community spirit.' We do have many community-spirited programs. The Kids Help Line operates there, as does the Newcastle and Hunter Lifeline's `Reach Out!' program. We also have in Muswellbrook in the Hunter Valley the Holborow House. All these organisations support young people and try to prevent suicide.</para><para>One program I would particularly like to recommend to the House is the Life Matters Suicide Prevention Program, which aims to increase the follow-up support for people after they have attempted suicide or have had thoughts of suicide. This program offers intensive community based support for up to three months in Newcastle and Maitland. It is run by Lifeline volunteers, face-to-face counsellors and telephone counsellors. They assist 50 clients in any year, a huge achievement by a program run by volunteers. The program follows up with three phone calls a week to their clients to give them hope that they have someone to speak to on the end of a phone. It is the only model of its kind operating in Australia to stop the cycle of readmittance to emergency services. I quote from some of their clients who have contacted them recently. One of those clients said:</para><quote><para>Lifeline are the only ones who do not get angry at me when I talk about my suicidal feelings.</para></quote><para>Another said:</para><quote><para>I have been feeling very low lately, but I remembered that I made a commitment to you not to hurt myself.</para></quote><para>We applaud these programs and hope that they will be assisted to continue.</para><para>In concluding, I must say that there is a need for these programs to be sustained, and there is certainly a need for funds to be provided. I particularly urge the government to increase their funding to mental health expenditure in Australia. We spend approximately 3.6 per cent of our health budget on mental health, which is much lower than in most countries. Certainly when you take away the Medicare rebates and the PBS amounts for medication, you are looking at something less than $14 per Australian. So, in concluding, I support my colleagues in their bipartisan support for our youth. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>24798</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Kerry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BARTLETT</name><name.id>0K6</name.id><electorate>Macquarie</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I suspect that everyone here has had dealings with constituents, and most of us with someone in our circle of friends or extended family, whose lives have been affected either directly or indirectly by the tragedy of youth suicide. Most would be acquainted with the unimaginable grief, confusion and self-examination experienced by loved ones. The death of a young person is always devastating, but when it is self-inflicted it is even more tragic. When a young person comes to the point that they feel life is not worth living, when the normal optimism, anticipation and aspiration of youth are so completely overwhelmed by depression, anxiety or despair that death is considered the only alternative, it is particularly inexplicable.</para></talk.start><para>The facts are fairly clear. In Australia, as in most other Western countries, suicide is the second most common cause of death for people aged between 12 and 24. A recent international study of 32 countries ranks Australia 13th in the world for male suicides and 18th for female suicides—comparable to Canada and the US, but much lower than New Zealand. In 2002, there were 2,320 deaths from suicide in Australia, and 317 of these were people between 15 and 24 years of age, with males outnumbering females by four to one. Tragically, in Australia from the sixties through to the mid-1990s the rate of youth suicide grew rapidly. In fact, it more than doubled during that time. Fortunately, the last few years have seen an encouraging reversal of that trend, with a decline in youth suicide rates since 1997 to a point where they are now the lowest since 1990. But there is still a very long way to go.</para><para>Clearly there is no single reason or certain cause for youth suicide, or indeed for suicide generally, but there are many risk factors that have been identified and generally agreed upon, not just within Australia but in international studies as well. These include: childhood and family discord and adversity; psychopathology; depression; mental health factors; social and educational disadvantage; parental separation and divorce; physical and/or sexual abuse in childhood; genetic and personality factors such as low self-esteem, anxiety, anger and social inadequacy; substance abuse; stressful or traumatic life events; suicide contagion and unhelpful publicity. There is a whole range of things, and in many cases I dare say suicide is due to a complex interaction of a number of those factors. The important question is: what can be done? It is encouraging to see that many groups within our community are doing their best and are working to reduce youth suicide rates, and they deserve all the assistance and commendation that can be given.</para><para>This government are committed to supporting suicide prevention initiatives. In the past few years we have committed some $10 million a year to funding national and community initiatives to try and address some of the causes of youth suicide. Since 1997 the government have committed $11 million to Lifeline, Kids Help Line and Reach Out! amongst others. Lifeline, for example, amazingly gets some 1,000 calls a day from people across the country who are desperate and need someone to talk to. I guess we will never know how many lives have been saved by the tremendous work of volunteers in organisations such as Lifeline and Kids Help Line. Those people do a tremendous job.</para><para>But it is important to realise that no government program and no community group can ultimately totally prevent youth suicide. The focus needs to be on investing in the mental health and wellbeing of our young people in a consistent and long-term way—in recognising that good mental health is not automatic; that we need to address the risk factors and build the confidence, self-esteem and purpose of our young people; and that we need to ensure the appropriate support mechanisms for those who are vulnerable. There is much at stake, so much that we cannot afford not to do everything we can to help.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>24799</page.no><name role="metadata">Vamvakinou, Maria, MP</name><name role="display">Ms VAMVAKINOU</name><name.id>00AMT</name.id><electorate>Calwell</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Youth suicide is a human tragedy affecting thousands of Australian families and communities every year. I know this because suicide has touched my life on three occasions—once as a university undergraduate and twice in the last year. On the first occasion, my friend was suffering emotional disorders that made her death easier to comprehend, although not easier to accept as we agonised over why someone so young and intelligent would choose to end her life at 18 by jumping off one of the university buildings. The other two, more recent, deaths were of older males, one I had known since I was 12 years of age and the other in recent years. Both men chose violent deaths, one by shotgun and the other by hanging, leaving their families and their communities stunned, traumatised and struggling with the hurt and, sadly, with the stigma that society stills attaches to suicide.</para></talk.start><para>Australia currently has the second highest rate of youth suicide amongst OECD nations, and suicide and self-harm are currently the second leading cause of death amongst young Australians between 12 and 24 years of age. They represent 19.2 per cent of deaths in this age group, and 56 per cent of young people rate depression and suicide as the most important issue in their lives. These figures increase in rural areas and suburban outskirts, such as in my own electorate in Melbourne's north-west.</para><para>This situation is worsening every year, as the rate of suicide amongst young Australians has been increasing steadily over the last three decades, with a 300 per cent increase amongst adolescent males. Most distressing, however—it is why it is important that we discuss this issue here today—is the fact that most of these deaths are preventable. Only one-quarter of juvenile suicide victims are said to be suffering from a diagnosed mental illness, which suggests that the remaining three-quarters are simply normal young people with inadequate coping skills and support structures.</para><para>Thankfully, there is some hope for youth at risk. A host of government and non-government associations and programs, such as CIRYAR in Rockhampton and Here for Life in Victoria, have achieved great success combating self-harming behaviour and depression. Youth suicide rates in communities where such mentoring programs and counselling services are available have all decreased significantly.</para><para>A recent survey by the Centre for Adolescent Health indicated that five per cent of young people engage in self-harming behaviour as a coping mechanism and that up to 49 per cent of teenagers have considered taking their own lives. Reasons why young people are at risk of self-harm range from breakdowns in family relationships to an inability to find relevance in and to connect with the education system, inadequate and insufficient life choices, mental illness and the alarming increase of alcohol and drug abuse amongst young people.</para><para>As a parent and as a politician I feel it is my responsibility to help bring attention to this situation—and so does the member for Capricornia, and I commend her on her efforts today. More needs be done to provide young people with the support and skills to cope in difficult situations. Education programs in schools are one such way of addressing the issue. Taught in the context of health and wellbeing classes, such programs would bring the issue out of the shadows, open up avenues of communication, highlight the dangers of self-harm and provide coping skills.</para><para>Despite critics of such education programs who claim that these programs might give kids ideas, statistics clearly show otherwise. Communities where education awareness programs have been established have all seen a decrease in self-harming behaviour and suicide attempts amongst 15- to 24-year-olds. Surely this is powerful evidence to encourage these education programs that aim to better equip teachers and peers with the skills to recognise the telltale signs displayed by 95 per cent of those considering suicide and the skills needed to intervene and save their lives.</para><para>It is worth noting that communities with strong family ties and community relations have significantly lower rates of suicide than other community groups. For example, when we compare the rate of adolescent male suicide in Australia of 23.1 per 100,000 to that of some southern European countries, we can see how the effect of the strong extended family, friends, neighbourhood and community is integral to successfully addressing youth suicide.</para><para>When I last spoke in the House about suicide I said that a new approach encompassing all government portfolios was needed to address this national issue, as all portfolios impact upon the aspirations and opportunities of young Australians. I am encouraged by the fact that the Leader of the Opposition has recognised that there is a link between depression and feelings of alienation and between the breakdown of relationships and the breakdown of community. Therefore, his decision to create a community relations portfolio and appoint the member for Melbourne to take up the challenge in this critical area is, I believe, one of the most significant initiatives taken by a politician to address a pressing social and human crisis. I certainly look forward—as I am sure everyone else in this House looks forward—to the development of the national mentoring program. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>24800</page.no><name role="metadata">Neville, Paul, MP</name><name role="display">Mr NEVILLE</name><name.id>KV5</name.id><electorate>Hinkler</electorate><party>NATS</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am pleased the member for Capricornia has raised the issue of youth suicide in the MPI today and I thank her for that. It is an issue which raised its head in Rockhampton, just north of my electorate, at the end of the last year with the looming closure of the Collaborative and Innovative Responses for Youth at Risk pilot program. This program is run by Queensland Baptist Care, whom I commend and who do a sterling job in filling a gap in youth mental health services in the Rockhampton area. Its existence was partially placed in jeopardy because of the Beattie government's neglect of vital mental health services in regional Queensland.</para></talk.start><para>As a bit of background, this particular pilot program got off the ground 12 months earlier with a $219,000 grant in Commonwealth funding to trial new ways of encouraging local youth services to work together, investigate models and achieve sustainability. Late last year, the member for Capricornia came to me for collegiate help in securing ongoing funding for this pilot program. I responded in a cooperative and bipartisan way so that we could reinforce this program. Despite our efforts, the Beattie government totally and utterly neglected the program with a token, meagre and last-minute contribution of $30,000 towards its costs. Compare this to the $70,000 raised by the Rockhampton community to ensure the service was available to youth. I have a good relationship with Robert Schwarten, a cabinet minister and state member for Rockhampton, but I am sure it must have been embarrassing for him to defend this paltry $30,000—quite plainly a neglect of his constituency.</para><para>I wonder how the Beattie government can defend its appalling record of funding mental health services in the regions when Queensland suicide rates are sitting at 24 per cent above the national average. Premier Beattie, who acknowledged that he was shocked and ashamed at the plight of Queensland's marginal youth, also said, `The government has a lot of work to do to fix the system and better protect Queensland children.' In fact, he called the recent state election on the basis of fixing up Queensland's appalling track record in protecting children. But his rhetoric does not seem to be followed through with action. As an example, <inline font-style="italic">Reducing suicide: the Queensland governme</inline><inline font-style="italic">nt's</inline><inline font-style="italic"> suicide prevention strategy </inline><inline font-style="italic">for </inline><inline font-style="italic">2003-2008</inline> unequivocally states:</para><quote><para>Young people in Queensland have the highest rates of youth suicide in Australia. </para></quote><para>It goes on to say:</para><quote><para>The importance of a focus upon access to services and ensuring appropriate and responsive care is provided in the ... findings.</para></quote><para>The report mentioned that 71 per cent of young Queenslanders who had attempted suicide did not receive medical help following the attempt and 67 per cent did not receive access to mental health professionals following such an attempt. The Australian Institute for Suicide Research and Prevention has backed this up with findings that, between 1996 and 1998, 45 per cent of all suicides in Queensland were by people aged under 34. These figures, from the Queensland government's own report, utterly condemn the state regime's attitude towards youth and mental health services in Central Queensland. Despite their attitude, on 28 January the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Larry Anthony, announced unmatched funding of $110,000 to keep Rockhampton's youth mental health service running for a further 12 months. We can only hope that through public pressure and with the Commonwealth leading by example the returned Beattie government will lift its act and fund this very vital service in Central Queensland.</para><para>In closing, I commend the member for Capricornia's concern for youth mental health services in Central Queensland, and I support the broad thrust of her initiative. I thank parliamentary secretary Trish Worth and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Larry Anthony, for their swift response in funding Rockhampton's Collaborative and Innovative Responses for Youth at Risk service and their proven commitment to providing better health services for young people in Central Queensland.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Jenkins)</inline>—Order!

The Howard government has engineered policies geared towards encouraging married and de facto women to reproduce. These include cuts to child-care budgets designed to make it difficult for women to work outside the home, conditions attached to the baby bonus and inaction in relation to paid maternity leave. These policies, coupled with the huge rise in house prices, are likely to result in an even further decrease in births. Rather than encouraging women to stay at home and reproduce, this government's policies are having exactly the opposite effect.</para></talk.start><para>For young women who have completed tertiary education and incurred a huge HECS debt before embarking upon a career, the decision to have a baby is huge and problematic. Currently, women have to decide between the extremes of full-time work and staying at home and putting their career on hold. Labor's plan to introduce a national 14-week paid maternity leave scheme would address this and give women the right to ask for part-time work upon their return from maternity leave. This work would have to be at the same level as the full-time position they had before taking leave. Labor has also promised to provide affordable and accessible child care, especially within disadvantaged areas. These timely policies would go a long way to reducing the interruption to the career path for women arising from their decision to have a baby.</para><para>The Howard government is sending a mixed message to women. On the one hand it is attempting to force married or de facto mothers out of employment whilst on the other hand it is trying to force single mothers into the work force via the extension of the mutual obligation provision of welfare reform to sole parents, which is heavily geared towards the welfare recipient. This policy forces single mothers into low paid and often casual jobs, which are usually their only employment options, with no provision for suitable education and training to assist them in accessing well paid positions. The result is that they will most likely be even worse off than before, with their talents and their abilities remaining untapped through a lack of education and training opportunities.</para><para>In spite of this, the conservative think tank, the Centre for Independent Studies, released a proposal in June 2003 to force sole parents whose children are at school off welfare and into employment. The irony in this report is that, according to the Centre for Independent Studies, these measures would save taxpayers over $1 billion a year, and they suggest that the money could be used to reduce taxes for low paid workers. Labor has plans to introduce training and support programs for parents re-entering the work force which, it is proposed, would be conducted through existing Job Network agencies, adult education colleges, TAFE colleges and even some large employers. These training programs would also be advantageous for women who wish to alter their career direction after having children.</para><para>There has been an alarming increase in the number of women who are totally dependent on welfare. There are almost 1½ times as many female headed sole-parent families with children as there were at the beginning of the 1990s, and two-thirds of them rely exclusively on support from the government. In my electorate of Shortland, 61.8 per cent of single-parent families with children under the age of 15 are not employed. The poverty levels experienced by sole parents are exemplified by the fact that they survive on about half the income of two-parent families where the woman is in the work force, even if only on a part-time basis.</para><para>In our rapidly changing society, there are now more divorced women and widows over 60 years of age. Many of these older divorced women have very limited funds because they do not have superannuation and are not eligible for the age pension. Consequently, there are now more women living on the verge of poverty, or in poverty, than ever before. Many of these women are on disability support pensions. This is a repercussion of the termination of class A and class B widows pensions, changes to the supporting parent benefit and the Howard government's failure to offer them viable alternatives. Ironically, these women had defined themselves as homemakers. These changes in welfare policy have had the most profound and life-altering consequences for these women. You would think that women calling themselves homemakers would be something that the Howard government would embrace. </para><para>For most of those women, whose life experiences have left them with limited and outdated work force skills, the requirement that they re-enter the work force places them at a severe disadvantage. Thrown unprepared into the work force at a time of high unemployment, these middle-aged women are often offered the survival strategy of being reclassified from `unemployed' to `disabled'. The repercussions of this are now being experienced, and they parallel the present policy of attempting to encourage young married and de facto women back into the home to reproduce, whilst forcing single women with inadequate work force skills into the work force without adequate training. The only difference is that the option of being placed onto the `too hard' scrapheap of a disability pension is now negated.</para><para>Australia is falling into the trap of becoming a country with low skills and low wages. This is caused by the increasing implementation of casual employment. There has been 30 per cent growth in this form of employment under the Howard government, compared with only 10 per cent growth in full-time employment. Labor has on its agenda consideration of the right of workers to request permanent part-time work after a long period of casual employment with one company. If more flexible working hours can be obtained, employees will be more likely to stay in the same job for a long period of time. The flow-on effect of this could be employers investing more in workers' skills, and this will benefit not only the workers but also the employers.</para><para>Another consequence of the Howard government's cutbacks is that, because of the scarcity and expense of child care, many older women are saddled with the responsibility of caring for their grandchildren. This is a repercussion of the Howard government's cuts to child-care budgets. As if this were not enough, because of the dismal lack of community care packages and affordable aged care facilities and the availability of beds in aged care facilities, many middle-aged women also face shouldering the care and responsibility of aged parents. So grandparents who should be enjoying this stage of their lives are shouldering the responsibility of caring for the very young and the very old in their extended families. All this is a result of the Howard government's policy of slashing funding in the areas of aged care and child care.</para><para>Women have much to contribute in all aspects of society. In the <inline font-style="italic">Newcastle Herald</inline> on 10 February, Bishop Roger Herft of the Newcastle Diocese of the Anglican Church noted:</para><quote><para>The church is a more wholesome community to belong to when women find their vocation in pulpit, sanctuary and in service. Transparency and accountability, particularly in the area of human relationships, has benefited from the presence of women in the ordained ministry.</para></quote><para>The consequences of the Howard government's misguided policies add up to a nation missing out on a valuable resource by not utilising the skills of women at all stages of their lives. If more flexible work situations and guaranteed access to part-time work were provided, young women would return to the work force after the birth of their baby. The government needs to provide adequate education and training to ensure that sole parents can re-enter the work force and gain well-paid and secure jobs. Training and education opportunities for middle-aged women would enable them to update their skills and so become a valuable part of the work force by tapping into their valuable talents and experience. It is a national tragedy that John Howard abandoned new work and family measures in order to increase spending on defence and security. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Surf-Lifesaving</title><page.no>24804</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>24804</page.no><name role="metadata">Lloyd, Jim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LLOYD</name><name.id>IK6</name.id><electorate>Robertson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Australia is blessed with an army of volunteers. In almost every activity and way of life, you see Australians quietly going about the work of volunteering. The Sydney Olympics showcased Australian volunteers to the world. Another volunteer organisation that also showcases what is great about Australia is Surf Life Saving Australia. The first official surf-lifesaving club in the world was founded almost 100 years ago at Bondi. In 1907 the Surf Bathing Association of New South Wales was formed. I know that 2007 will be a year of celebration to mark the centenary of surf-lifesaving in Australia.</para></talk.start><para>Since then, Surf Life Saving Australia has grown into a national organisation of some 106,633 members, including 20,042 active members and 38,656 junior members, known as `nippers'. They have conducted almost half a million rescues since the inception of surf lifesaving, and who knows how many countless lives have been saved by those almost half a million rescues on our beaches. In the 2002-03 season, 9,448 rescues were successfully undertaken, including 5,027 in my home state of New South Wales. The federal government strongly supports surf lifesaving in Australia. In the 2003-04 budget, the national recreation safety program was allocated $1,564,774 and the Australian Sports Commission grant allocation was $540,000. It is good to see that the federal government is supporting that national organisation.</para><para>Surf Life Saving Central Coast is responsible for the overall management, promotion and growth of surf lifesaving practices on the Central Coast of New South Wales. It has some 15 clubs with 8,000 members and, of those, 3,900 are nippers. Surf Life Saving Central Coast enjoys its position as one of Australia's most successful, dynamic and celebrated branches. They patrol the beaches from September to April, from The Lakes in the north to Umina in the south. Since recording began in 1938, lifesavers on the Central Coast had successfully completed an amazing 24,513 rescues. For the 2002-03 patrol season there was a total of 870 rescues and more than 50,000 voluntary surf patrol hours were performed by our local surf lifesaving members. Already in this season I believe there have been more than 600 rescues performed on Central Coast beaches, making them some of the safest beaches in the world.</para><para>But surf lifesaving is a lot more than just volunteers going down to their local beach and protecting the lives of people there. Whilst that of course is their primary objective, certainly Surf Life Saving Central Coast has had to broaden its charter beyond the realms of just water safety. The contemporary lifesaver on the Central Coast has now developed into a public relations officer, a resource for beach-goer information, an ambassador promoting our beach culture and the custodian of the Central Coast seaside playground and the safety of the people who enjoy our magnificent beaches. Surf Life Saving Central Coast has always received good support from the community and has received a lot of funds from regional businesses, such as NBN Television, SeaFM and the <inline font-style="italic">Express Advocate</inline>, and their major sponsor, of course, is EnergyAustralia. Central Coast tourism also supports them very strongly</para><para>I have always been supportive of Surf Life Saving Central Coast, but it was not until recently when I became personally involved that I realised how many valuable programs are run by Surf Life Saving Central Coast and what a challenge it is for them to secure continued funding support. I have recently joined the Terrigal Surf Club as an associate member, and last Sunday I helped out with the under 7 nippers at Terrigal Beach for about two hours. It really emphasised to me how important this is as part of the Australian way of life. Whilst the opposition might suggest that the government should get involved and provide every child with a book, I can assure the opposition that parents do know how to raise their families. Certainly on the Central Coast in New South Wales, where you see hundreds of parents taking their kids to the beach or to local sporting arenas on the weekends, just throwing a book at them when they are born is not the way to raise children. Whilst reading is important, parents do know what is best for their own children and certainly put a lot of time and effort into making sure that they have the best opportunities available. But I digress slightly.</para><para>At Surf Life Saving Central Coast, under the watchful eye of the chief executive officer, Mr Peter James—PJ, as he is known—and the president, Jim Meyers, many of these programs continue to grow at an unprecedented rate. Just one of the programs that Surf Life Saving Central Coast have undertaken and are seeking additional funding for is the school education program. Currently Surf Life Saving Central Coast employs an education officer who works in Central Coast schools delivering surf education, sun protection and environmental programs to some 10,900 schoolchildren. These programs are all designed to teach children how to enjoy our beaches in safety, and have the full endorsement of the department of education. I believe they recently won a high commendation at the 2003 New South Wales Water Safety Awards.</para><para>Until recently these programs have been funded by a range of commercial operators donating money, and resources have been received from the state government and from other areas, but this funding expires in 2004 and Surf Life Saving Central Coast will be forced to close this program unless other funding is sourced, as they do not have the funds to continue. I certainly will be making appeals to the federal government to see what can be done to continue this program and others that they are developing.</para><para>Another program of importance is the development of future leaders. This is to ensure that the Central Coast surf lifesaving organisation continues to exist with all of its activities in the future. It is imperative that they continue to develop future leaders within all fields of the organisation, including administrators, sports coaches, youth development officers, member protection advisers and senior club administrators. Obviously they need to conduct seminars, provide access to specialised courses and expand knowledge into areas of business and administration to continue to ensure Central Coast surf lifesaving expands as a professional operation. </para><para>They also need upgraded technology. Most of the clubs operate businesses in the form of kiosks and function rooms, and many of the members and many people listening to this broadcast today would have visited kiosks at their local surf club or been to a party, wedding or function at the surf club. This is all part of the business of surf lifesaving and helps the clubs to remain viable and raise additional resources. They do need the upgraded technology to run these businesses competently and efficiently. The Central Coast is a growth region and, with the growth being experienced by all of the 15 Central Coast surf lifesaving clubs, there are problems in coping with the large additional numbers of beach users, members who want to join their ranks and the other interest now being shown in our beaches. They need additional funding to develop that area as well.</para><para>In conclusion, Surf Life Saving Central Coast is not just volunteers going down to the beach on weekends; it is a professional organisation. It provides invaluable support to the Central Coast region. That is why Central Coast Tourism supports this organisation to such a great extent. I should also mention that both Wyong and Gosford councils are major supporters of the surf lifesaving movement on the Central Coast. Many of the clubs have been rebuilt or upgraded through a levy that is provided in the council rates. This is unique, I believe, in New South Wales, if not in Australia. We are ensuring that there is a continued viability for this valuable organisation.</para><para>This organisation promotes throughout the world, throughout New South Wales and throughout Australia a healthy and safe lifestyle for visitors who come to the Central Coast. Visitors know that the beaches are patrolled and safe and they can go to the lifesavers for advice. More importantly, it provides wonderful training and safety information for our children. I appeal to the federal government, the state government and local councils to increase funding so that this organisation does not have to go from hand to mouth from day to day from month to month. We need some certainty and continuation of long-term funding so that this organisation can plan for the future in an organised and constructive way and not have to seek additional funding every time their one-year or one-month funding runs out. It is important and I commend this to the House. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Centrelink</title><page.no>24806</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>24806</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Brendan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR</name><name.id>00AN3</name.id><electorate>Burke</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to raise a number of concerns I have about the way in which the government's Centrelink policy is applying to constituents within my electorate and no doubt beyond my electorate. There have been recent reports regarding Centrelink and the way in which Centrelink pays people benefits. Only last week it was reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> newspaper that there were 1.13 million mistakes made by Centrelink offices in relation to the payments that were to go to recipients of social security services. That is indicative of a government that really has not focused on what is clearly a very important area—that is, providing for the most vulnerable in the community.</para></talk.start><para>It concerns me that a proportion of those mistakes have been experienced by my own constituents. At least a proportion of those constituents in the electorate of Burke have come to my office or contacted my office and raised their concerns directly with me. It is also a concern to me that the President of the Australian Council of Social Service, Andrew McCallum, was quoted in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> today as suggesting that any error in the Centrelink payments could have huge consequences for vulnerable people. He went on to say:</para><quote><para>The Government has to get it right because the next step for these people is to non-government agencies for food parcels and food vouchers.</para></quote><para>I do not think that is an exaggeration. All members in this chamber would realise—if they have dealt with their constituents in the way I have—that the overpayments that had to be paid back by recipients have affected their quality of life and their capacity to provide properly for themselves and their families. There must be a better way to ensure that we properly defend and protect the most vulnerable in our community. I do not think the government has it right in this area. The member for Lilley, the shadow spokesperson on these matters, has quite clearly underlined that in comments made in the paper.</para><para>I also wish to raise a concern I have had in relation to Job Network and its interaction with Centrelink. A young man in my electorate, William Prosser, is a 16-year-old student who lives in Melton. William is currently in school in a full-time capacity but is actively looking to fulfil his ambition to become a chef. Melton, if you do not know, is a small town on the outskirts of Melbourne and there are limited transport opportunities for those who are not in a position to drive their own vehicle. As a 16-year-old, William cannot drive. Therefore, in order to seek employment opportunities, he has to look close to home.</para><para>Recently a job was advertised on the Australian JobSearch web site for an apprentice chef at an Italian restaurant in Melton. William and his family believed that was a perfect career opportunity for him to fulfil what has been a dream for him. However, when William rang the number of the Job Network agency listed on the web site, he was told he could not apply for the job because he did not have a Job Network card. This of course was of great concern to him. Here was an ambitious 16-year-old lad wanting to become an apprentice chef who saw an opportunity in his local community to fulfil his ambition to do so and he was told by the agency that he was not able to apply for the job because he did not have a Job Network card. William contacted Centrelink and he was told that he was not eligible for a Job Network card because he was a full-time student and that if he were to leave school in the future he would be eligible for a Job Network card.</para><para>This was brought to my attention only last week. It concerns me greatly that we are asking young, enthusiastic job applicants to choose to leave school—to leave a place of learning—and possibly be unemployed so that they can be an applicant for a job in the local community. I do not think anyone would think that was reasonable or decent policy. My concern is that this practice will induce students in my electorate—and indeed in other electorates—to leave their school so that they can be eligible for a Job Network card and be able to apply for a job that is on the Australian JobSearch web site.</para><para>There really has to be some scrutiny of the way in which this matter has been handled. Since the government privatised the CES and created Job Network—and, indeed, privatised the way in which the social security system operates—there have been a number of concerns about how people are treated. When I made contact with the Italian restaurant in Melton, I was told that they did not mind who applied for the job, that it would be given to the best applicant. I was also told that they had already advertised for an apprentice chef in the local newspaper. It just so happened that William Prosser, a young student, saw it on the web site. He spoke to the Job Network agency, which wanted to make a buck out of referring him to the prospective employer, and was advised to leave school before he was eligible for a Job Network card. Clearly, if this means that a student has to leave school to apply for an apprenticeship it is not a good policy.</para><para>I do not want to deny William the opportunity to become an apprentice chef. If I were to counsel him and tell him that to become eligible he would have to consider leaving school, my fear would be that he might miss out on the apprenticeship at the restaurant, resulting in him being unemployed and out of school. This policy is encouraging students to leave school and apply to Centrelink for a Job Network card in order for a Job Network agency to assist them—and that certainly cannot be good.</para><para>Further, we are advantaging students who are not in a place of learning. If they are in a place of learning, where they are trying to improve their skills and their knowledge, they are told to opt out of the system. However, if they are not in a place of learning—they may be at home and perhaps not fulfilling their potential—they are eligible for a Job Network card. I think there has to be a proper review of this by the government because I do not think it is acceptable that William Prosser or any young person looking for work should be leaving school in order to become eligible for a Job Network card under this new privatised system.</para><para>This underlines the fact that this government is motivated more by the ideological needs to privatise public services without looking at the effectiveness, efficiency and equity of the service to those who are most vulnerable in the community. This government has failed to consider the most vulnerable in our community and those most in need of a decent education, a decent job and, dare I say it, a long-term and fulfilling career.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Flinders Electorate: Point Nepean</title><page.no>24808</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>24808</page.no><name role="metadata">Hunt, Gregory, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HUNT</name><name.id>00AMV</name.id><electorate>Flinders</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak in support of the government's actions in relation to the preservation of Point Nepean within my electorate of Flinders and to raise my grievance about not only the proposals put forward by the state government for naked commercial activity in the area but also the hypocrisy of those proposals, given the false and scurrilous campaign that it has run over the last 18 months.</para></talk.start><para>Firstly, I want to talk about the people who should be thanked for the outcome that we have reached. Secondly, I want to talk about what will occur. Thirdly, I want to raise a grievance about naked commercial development which is being proposed by the state government, which should not occur. These are things that the state government pretended to avoid but secretly worked on.</para><para>Many community members of good faith gave of their time, energy and resources to help fight the campaign to ensure that this area of defence land is preserved and protected for all time. This area could be used for a national park and a marine education and community centre—an outstanding outcome. A world class oceanographic institute would enhance education and training of primary, secondary and tertiary students at modest levels for the foreseeable future about the need to protect and understand the marine environment. </para><para>The key people who need to be thanked are, firstly, the community reference group. This group has had many dedicated members. Its three leaders, David Stewart, Ian Haskins and Peter McNamara, who were representatives of the overall planning reference group, played an extraordinarily important role. They gave of their time to help to develop the overall concept. They were not backwards when it was time to be fearless—with the Commonwealth and the state. The second group that need to be thanked are all the other members of the community reference group: Jane Burke, Kevin McDonald, Paul Rice and Vivienne Massoni—and many others. I want to pay special tribute to Paul Rice who, perhaps more than anybody else, had the early and outstanding vision of a primary, secondary and tertiary marine education institution. The fact that he has held it and fought for it is a testament to his vision and to his spirit.</para><para>Beyond that, there were the environmental groups that supported this. I particularly wish to thank Environment Victoria, which played an extremely strong role. I thank Eric Noel and Marcus Godinho for their work and strength under extraordinary pressure and intimidation from the state government. They were strong and held their course with the Commonwealth, the state and environmental groups. They represent a truly independent group. In addition to that, there were many other environmental groups and individuals along the way who lent their support. There was also support at the Commonwealth level. Most notably, Fran Bailey from the federal government shouldered an extraordinary amount of work, pressure and heat to help produce this outcome. Those are the people to whom we should give gratitude.</para><para>What exactly will be occurring? It is very simple: a national park for all time will be created at Point Nepean. The land to create that national park will be transferred to the state within five years. Also, a world-class marine education centre run by four community groups—the Australian Maritime College, the Southern Peninsula Rescue Squad, the Boonerwrung Elders Land Council, and the Maritime Museum of Victoria—will be created. I am particularly excited about the role that the Boonerwrung Elders Land Council will play. They will be providing their people with genuine opportunities not just for training but also for management of the land. So they will have a meaningful role. They have not looked for a handout. They have worked to create a vision for themselves. I assure Caroline Briggs, Larry Steel and the others involved that there is room not just for this group but for all Indigenous people within Victoria to receive training and education and to have a role in practical land management in a way that gives them skills and responsibilities. That is a tremendous outcome.</para><para>In essence, there will be full public ownership and access. This will be guaranteed for the first five years by a community trust. At the end of those five years, if not earlier—and I am very happy for it to be transferred earlier—that land will be transferred to the state and become a national park. This is where we come to the state's role. There are some fundamental flaws in what they are proposing. They use the term `national park' as a front for a commercial development. On pages 6, 7, 8 and 11 of their written proposal of October 2004, the Victorian Premier and Deputy Premier, as the leaders of a government that endorses this proposal, are supporting four precincts of commercial accommodation.</para><para>Firstly, they propose a three star, cliff top hotel on the side of the old barracks; secondly, they propose backpacking accommodation; thirdly, they propose camping; and, fourthly, in the area which the Deputy Premier himself described as the most environmentally significant, they are proposing holiday homes. The words on page 8 of the state's document indicate that they are proposing holiday homes. This fact is almost unknown within Victoria, and that is the reason I bring it to the attention of this House in this grievance debate. A state which has acted as if it is working to preserve the area but has worked against marine education, against the Maritime Museum, against the Boonerwrung Elders Land Council, against the Southern Peninsula Rescue Squad and against the Dolphin Research Institute is arguing for holiday homes on Police Point. It is hard to credit except for the fact that it is there in writing.</para><para>They propose to bring this about through exactly the means which they decried as an outrage. They propose to bring this about through a privately leased commercial tender process. It is very interesting. On page 11 of the document they set out a privately leased commercial tender process for four precincts of commercial accommodation, not to mention the fact that they will throw in a conferencing centre, a restaurant and meeting facilities. That is the written proposal. It is not hearsay; it is not rumour; it is the written proposal in the state's document, which was reaffirmed at 4.20 p.m. on 18 December 2003 by the Deputy Premier after the Commonwealth had already pledged to make the land a national park and to create and use that area for marine education, community use and, hopefully, for other community groups who have not yet signed on. I welcome those other community groups aboard.</para><para>As to the question of the trust, that is a mechanism of setting up the initial management. In the longer term, it is one means of ensuring that the land is neither subdivided nor sold and that the funds—the $15 million comprising $5 million in Commonwealth contributions and $10 million in charitable donations—are preserved, rolled over and kept for the use of Point Nepean. Whether or not the trust is rolled over into some form for the state, I do not mind. I am concerned about the principles. I want to protect the land by ensuring that it is not subdivided, that there are no holiday homes on Police Point and that the hotel idea is dropped. Ultimately, I call upon the Premier to renounce and immediately drop this ridiculous notion of holiday homes on Police Point, of a hotel on the cliff top and of backpacking and camping facilities at Point Nepean. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Perth Airport</title><page.no>24810</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>24810</page.no><name role="metadata">Smith, Stephen, MP</name><name role="display">Mr STEPHEN SMITH</name><name.id>5V5</name.id><electorate>Perth</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Today I grieve for the residents of the City of Bayswater and for the residents of other suburbs in my electorate, including suburbs like Morley, Bayswater, Beechboro, Lockridge, Kiara, Bassendean, Eden Hill and Ashfield. I grieve for them this afternoon because of the dangers of aircraft noise. Other than in the suburb of Beechboro, aircraft noise has not in recent years been a problem for residents in the suburbs I have mentioned. It has not been a problem because there has been proper and appropriate planning for the future use of Perth airport. That proper planning was formally seen in the Perth airport master plan, which was adopted in 1999. It was approved by the Commonwealth Minister for Transport and Regional Development in May of 1999 and, in accordance with the provisions of the legislation, a new plan must be submitted to the minister by 18 May this year.</para></talk.start><para>Members would be aware that airport master plans last for a period of five years. As a consequence, the consultation period is currently underway for the preliminary draft master plan for Perth airport. The consultation opened in January of this year. There is a 90-day consultation period and consultation is open, so local residents are able to make submissions until early to middle April. The 2004 draft master plan is essentially a revision of the 1999 master plan, and it is described as retaining the fundamental concepts of that 1999 plan over a 20-year planning period.</para><para>I would like to quote some of the important provisions from the draft preliminary master plan. At page 2, it says:</para><quote><para>The Master Plan for Perth Airport is a revision of the 1999 master plan ... This revision retains the fundamental concepts of the 1999 Master Plan while incorporating various updates.</para><para>The Master Plan represents a framework within which the airport's future development can take place. It provides a plan for the airport's future for the next 20 years as well as recognising the need to protect and preserve the ultimate development potential of the airport.</para></quote><para>...	...	...</para><quote><para>The Master Plan recognises that it will not be necessary to construct new runways or extend existing runways over the next 20 years.</para></quote><para>At page 5, it goes on to say:</para><quote><para>The ultimate development of the airport will exceed the statutory 20-year planning period of the Master Plan. In the interim, non-aeronautical commercial uses consistent with uses permitted in adjacent precincts are permitted in areas designated for future aviation related development where the proposed commercial development does not impact on, or limit the future expansion of, aeronautical operations and subject to the proposed uses not contradicting the objectives of the Master Plan.</para></quote><para>At page 7, it says:</para><quote><para>This Master Plan is a review of the 1999 Master Plan ... This revision retains the fundamental concepts of the 1999 Master Plan incorporating the following updates:</para><para>	New aeronautical forecasts to 2025. The forecasts show a dramatic reduction from the previous Master Plan, resulting in a review of the infrastructure development needs for the airport during the next 20 years.</para></quote><para>At page 22, in respect of runways and taxiways, it says:</para><quote><para>The means of accommodating the future aviation demand in the long term is to extend Runway 06/24 to the northeast and to construct a new runway 03R/21L along the eastern boundary of the airport, parallel to the existing main runway 03/21.</para></quote><para>At page 26, in describing the north-east south-west runway, 06/24, it says:</para><quote><para>The existing northeast-southwest runway is currently 2,163 metres long and 45 metres wide contained within a 300 metre wide runway strip. The ultimate length of this runway is planned to be 3,000 metres sometime beyond the 20 year planning period. With suitable conditions, this runway will accommodate all aircraft including Code F.</para></quote><para>That highlights the essential attributes of the draft master plan, both for 1999 and for the revision in 2004. What it indicates, to those people who know the airport and who are aware of the master plan, is that the master plan proposes to extend the north-east south-west 06/24 runway, but it is not proposed that the need for that will occur within the planning period of the master plan.</para><para>What is important to understand, and what is disappointing to find absent from the preliminary draft master plan, is that there is no mention of the extensive debate that occurred in the run-up to the adoption of the 1999 master plan in respect of the use of that 06/24 east-west runway. Those local residents and interested parties who live around the airport will know that in the run-up to the adoption of the 1999 master plan there was considerable debate about the use of the 06/24 runway. In the end that debate concluded with the owners of the airport, Westralia Airports Corporation and the City of Bayswater, publicly agreeing as to restrictions on the use of runway 06/24. For example, it was expressly agreed that the Westralia Airports Corporation would adopt restrictions as to the future use of runway 06/24 as conditions precedent for approval of the master plan. Those restrictions were that take-offs and landings from the south-west would only occur in emergencies, in extreme weather conditions and through the loss of the use of the main airport runway or incidental to the planning and/or undertaking of essential works to the airport's main runway. In other words, it was expressly undertaken by Westralia Airports Corporation that the future use of an extended 06/24 runway would restrict take-offs and landings from the south-west and that these would only occur in emergencies, in extreme weather conditions or when other runways utilised at the airport were essentially out of commission because of essential works or other planning.</para><para>It was also the case—and this was made clear by the Westralia Airports Corporation at the time—that, if and when it came to seeking formal developmental approval for the extension of the runway, those conditions would be condition precedent to any future relevant major development plan for the extension of runway 06/24. Indeed, when the Westralia Airports Corporation presented the draft master plan to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development for approval in 1999, the covering letter which accompanied the application for approval of the master plan expressly gave those undertakings. So the context of the 1999 Perth airport master plan was that it was adopted and approved for adoption by the minister, with express undertakings by the owner and operator of the airport, Westralia Airports Corporation, that any extension to runway 06/24 would be subject to condition precedents which went to the future use and operation of that runway and which severely restricted take-offs and landings to the south-west—restricting them to times of emergency and to times of extreme weather conditions or to times when other runways were essentially out of commission.</para><para>The fact that none of this is mentioned in the preliminary draft master plan for 2004 is, I think, a serious and grave omission. The owners of the airport, in my view, need to make it expressly clear that those conditions remain ongoing. I think they should again, at the very least, when they make application to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services for approval of the draft master plan for 2004, make it expressly clear that the extension or any proposed future extension to runway 06/24 is expressly limited by the undertakings that they gave the local community in 1999. They formally agreed with the City of Bayswater in 1999—and formally undertook with the Minister for Transport and Regional Services when gaining his approval to the master plan—that any use of an extended 06/24 runway would be severely limited in that respect.</para><para>It is that restriction as to the future use of an extended 06/24 runway which provides protection for the people in respect of whom I raise this issue today: the residents of the City of Bayswater, particularly those who live in suburbs like Bayswater itself and Morley and those who live in suburbs which adjoin those areas and which are adjacent to the airport—in particular Beechboro, Lockridge, Kiara, Bassendean, Eden Hill and Ashfield. I will be urging residents in those particular suburbs to formally make submissions to the preliminary draft master plan to again secure those undertakings in an ongoing way both from the Westralia Airports Corporation and from the minister, if and when the minister comes to approve the draft master plan for 2004.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Forde Electorate: Health</title><page.no>24812</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>24812</page.no><name role="metadata">Elson, Kay, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs ELSON</name><name.id>6K6</name.id><electorate>Forde</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Today I rise to bring to the attention of this House several matters of great concern to my constituents. These are longstanding issues that I am sorry to say the Queensland state government has sadly neglected. We all know that Labor recently won a third term and that Premier Beattie has been declaring that he will work harder than ever to get on with the job. Let us hope that is the case, because his track record leaves a lot to be desired. I want to take this opportunity today to give Premier Peter Beattie a few pointers on where to start in getting on with his job.</para></talk.start><para>He can start by signing off on the Logan after-hours bulk-billing clinic, allowing the service to finally open. In the middle of last year I was thrilled to announce that our government—the Howard government—had committed $600,000 to fund this important service. The clinic will help reduce waiting times in the emergency department at the Logan hospital, which has some of the longest waiting times in Queensland. It will provide a vital practical service for local residents. But unfortunately the clinic has been stalled for six months, waiting for the Beattie government to sign off on this urgently needed service—six months!</para><para>It has been estimated that the clinic will see around 20,000 patients each year. So that is 10,000 people who, due to the Beattie government's procrastination, have been unable to access bulk-billing health care through this clinic; that is 10,000 local residents who have had to go elsewhere, wait longer or not receive any care, all because the state government cannot get its act together and fulfil its commitment to signing off on this clinic. All in this House would agree that that is not good enough, Mr Peter Beattie.</para><para>The thing to remember here is that it will not even cost the Beattie government anything. The federal government have refurbished these premises, which are already located in the hospital. These premises will be made available to the hospital's renal unit for use during the day and then operate as the after-hours service during the evening. It will not cost Mr Beattie anything, yet we are allowing those offices to be used through the day for the very important renal unit in the hospital.</para><para>Premier Beattie has claimed that the Queensland election stalled the process, because the government was in caretaking mode, but the fact is that this should have been resolved six months ago. The Logan Area Division of General Practice and Family Care Services are all set to go. This is a service our region desperately needs; this is a service the Howard government has been proud to support and fund; and this is a service that local residents should have access to right now. I urge Premier Beattie to get this bulk-billing clinic operational immediately and take some pressure off the Logan hospital dedicated staff.</para><para>Another point is that, as each month goes by, about $37,000 in federal resources is being wasted by Premier Beattie, whilst local residents are being denied an after-hours bulk-billing service. May I also take this opportunity to thank the federal health minister for visiting my electorate recently to highlight this important issue and to prompt Peter Beattie into signing this contract. I am sure his presence will assist in our efforts to get this vital service operational. The bottom line is that Labor make all sorts of noises about bulk-billing and health care, but here is a service that will help those most in need in our community and make a real difference to health services in our region—and what are they doing? They are holding up this service. It is shameful. If Premier Beattie is serious about getting back to work, he can certainly start with the Logan after-hours bulk-billing clinic.</para><para>Another priority on Mr Beattie's back-to-work list ought to be another area of public health services: dental health. The buck-passing on dental health by the Queensland government has been an absolute disgrace. The fact is that the planning, funding and delivery of public dental services have always been the responsibility of the state government. The Howard government will provide more than $7.9 billion to the Queensland government over the next five years for public health services under the Australian health care agreement. This is a whopping increase of $2.1 billion on the previous agreement. During this financial year they will receive more than $1.4 billion, and it is up to Premier Beattie and his team to decide how to spend it. Given the horror stories we hear about waiting lists at public dental clinics, it should not be a hard call to send some of that money into dental health services. I call on Premier Beattie to put some of that increased funding from the Howard government into making sure that we have a fair and effective dental health system. An elderly gentleman came into my office recently who had been waiting five years to get his dentures. It was affecting his diet and therefore his health. This is just not good enough, Mr Beattie.</para><para>Premier Beattie has admitted that this financial year he will get a $334 million windfall in GST revenue—that is on top of the $6 billion or so he was expecting to get under the system established by our government. That is a huge amount of extra money, and some of it ought to be going to make sure that pensioners and low-income earners have decent access to dental care. These are the people who need the help the most. In fact, the Labor state premier ought to stop playing politics on this issue.</para><para>They all like to point to the one-off scheme that was introduced by the federal government in 1994 to reduce waiting lists. That was never intended to be a permanent scheme, and the cost was just $254 million over four years. This year alone, all states will get a windfall of $575 million from the government in GST funding and, as I said before, Queensland gets a whopping $334 million of that. That is extra funding they were not expecting. Next year it is expected to be $859 million. The states ought to stop whingeing and buck-passing and get on with their responsibility to provide good, public, dental health care, and Mr Beattie should lead the way by improving Queensland's public dental system as part of his third-term agenda.</para><para>Finally—and I intend to pursue this matter further in the House when I have more time—I would ask the Premier to seriously and urgently look at the current levels of education and therapy support for children with disabilities. The Premier needs to look at the impact that the recent review of special needs funding by Education Queensland has had on children with disabilities and their families. Many disabled children have had their teaching support seriously cut, which has meant special needs children being placed in ordinary classrooms, with little or no assistance. Last year, Education Queensland dropped the `ascertainment level' of nearly 1,000 disabled children, which in turn meant that their teaching support was reduced or entirely dropped.</para><para>In my own electorate, parents who secure a place for their children in the special education development unit at Mount Warren Park State School are dismayed to find that vital services like speech therapy are virtually nonexistent. I have been contacted by several parents whose small children—and we are talking about ages three to six, a vital age for speech development—are being denied access to speech therapy for the whole semester. And, when they do have contact with a therapist, it is generally only for a very short period one day a week—and that is if they are lucky. Mainly, the therapist conducts assessments, rather than actually working with the children to make improvements to their speech. As a mother, I can only imagine how frustrating this situation is for parents of children with special needs. These parents are forced to fundraise like crazy to pay for an additional speech therapist to help their children. For a small unit, that is an enormous task to ask of them. After all, we are talking about the basics here. As one parent put it: `Communication is the essence of our society.' If we cannot give these children the opportunity to communicate to the very best of their ability, what chance do they have to overcome the difficulties that they have to face?</para><para>Premier Beattie needs to urgently review the level of support and assistance available to children with disabilities, including those with mild impairment, who are often left to slip through the cracks of our system. This is a shocking situation, made worse by the recent review conducted by Education Queensland, which reduced teacher support hours for a thousand children. More resources clearly need to be allocated to help special needs children.</para><para>At this point, I urge the state member for Albert and newly appointed tourism minister, Margaret Keech, to take up this very serious issue. It is right in the middle of her electorate, and she has been approached many times to talk to the Beattie government about this. I hope, if she is sitting around their cabinet round table, that the special education development unit at Mount Warren Park School is one of those very important issues she puts on top of the education list. A very small fraction of that $334 million surplus GST windfall that I mentioned earlier would make a huge difference for those children and their families. I will continue to lobby at both state and federal levels for more support for people—and especially children—with disabilities. I realise that there are always competing demands for the budget dollar, but the state government cannot continue to shirk its responsibilities in these matters, which are clearly its responsibility, and it cannot always blame the federal government for not providing these services.</para><para>I repeat that the three issues I have raised today—the Logan after-hours bulk-billing clinic, dental services and support for children with special needs within the education system—are clearly state responsibilities. These are three areas that affect most of the people needing support in my community. I implore Premier Beattie to put these things on top of the `to do' list in his third term. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Cooey, Mr Michael Patrick</title><page.no>24815</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>24815</page.no><name role="metadata">Hoare, Kelly, MP</name><name role="display">Ms HOARE</name><name.id>83Y</name.id><electorate>Charlton</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On 5 February this year I had the sad occasion to attend the funeral of a life member of the Australian Labor Party. I want to take this opportunity to send my condolences to Mick Cooey's family—his children Lynette, Suzanne and Stephen and their families. At the service, one of the eulogies was read out by Jessica Wood, who is, I think, the 20-year-old youngest granddaughter of Mick Cooey. I was so moved by her eulogy for her grandfather that I wanted to read it out in this parliament. I will now quote Jessica:</para></talk.start><quote><para>When I was asked to do this I really didn't know how to begin. How do you express and summarise a life into only a few minutes. Life has many complexities and which of these do you include. But I will try to the best of my abilities to include as much as possible to describe the life of Michael Patrick Cooey, my Pa-pa. Firstly, I should introduce myself, my name is Jessica Wood and I am Michael's youngest grandchild however, more likely or not if he was ever to refer to me I was his little Princess.</para><para>Mick was born on the 18th September 1924, at Lady Bowen Hospital, Brisbane to Annie Louisa Cooey with his father being unknown. Not much is known about his childhood, and he rarely spoke of this time. However, we do know that he was placed in an orphanage in Nudgee at the age of two years and was raised there until age of 15, when he was rented out to a local Catholic family as a jackeroo. It is incredible to think that a lot of information about his childhood and heritage only has become recently apparent with his family finally finding him.</para><para>At age 18, he signed himself up for the air force during WW2. It is my opinion this was one of many acts in his life to find a place where he truly belonged. This was the case in some ways as he was adopted by the family of a man he was in the forces with and he was able to maintain contact with this family all through out his life. Also by luck the forces were his passageway into NSW as he was later stationed at Rathmines with the Caterlena Flying boats.</para><para>Being stationed here also meant he had the fortune of meeting my grandmother, Mary Scott. It is fitting that they meet by chance at a St Patrick's Day dance, as he always assumed himself as quite an Irish man. I also say by chance as the story goes that he actually tossed a coin with a mate to see who would dance with Mary. Courting soon followed and they married in Sacred Heart Cathedral on 13th October 1945. In the year that followed he left the air force, moved to Hamilton and became a father for the first time, with Lynette Marree being born in August 1946. Being the man he was, he named his daughter, but not by paying respect to a family member but rather a racehorse.</para><para>Eighteen months later they were further blessed with another daughter Suzanne in March 1948. It was at this time that their family home was getting rather small and they moved to Cardiff. Also a change of jobs happened and he began working with Newcastle Buses, as a Conductor. I think that also this is the time that truly shaped the rest of his life as he became involved in the Unions, closely followed by joining the Australian Labor Party.</para><para>Fortunately enough for Birmingham Gardens, the Cooey family moved in the early fifties, as their family grew with the inclusion of two sons, Mark Anthony in December 1951 and Stephen Patrick following in October 1953. At this time his passion to make a difference and also to belong in something bigger than himself was commenced with him throwing himself 110% into the Party, the unions and local government.</para><para>Much of this time is difficult to imagine. I have only known Pa-pa for 20 years while many of you seated in front of me have wild and very interesting stories about my grandfather. One of these stories has been revealed to me of how my grandfather's passion and his ability to be as far left as possible got him into strife. While working at BHP, he attempted to hijack the ironworkers union and was hence sacked and black balled in Newcastle for an extremely long time. Thank God for Ken Booth. He was able to find work for him as a Storeman at the Tighes Hill Tech College and this was where he was when he retired.</para><para>My grandfather was a bit of a jack-of-all-trades and I think that as well as being involved in politics this was one of the reasons you could never go any where in Newcastle without finding somebody he knew. He worked in various hotels, the BHP, wood machinist, the buses, + a number of other jobs. Politics was the centre of Mick's life; that was until he had grandchildren. The man that many of you knew began to change and was much more family orientated. He was lucky enough to have four grandchildren, Darren, Jason, my late brother Damien and myself. I suppose he is really lucky because he gets to meet my brother before I do.</para><para>Most would think because I was born and brought up in another state that I would rarely ever see him or Ma-ma. However, Mum always said that every time she looked around Pa-pa would walk in the door, put down his luggage and put me in my pram and take me for a walk. My grandparents might well have lived in Melbourne because they came to visit me three times a year, Easter, my birthday in September and Christmas.</para><para>His trips were not necessary after a period of time as my family moved to Newcastle shortly after my grandmother was involved in a bad car accident. However I saw a lot more of him now I was living here. Mick's passion was slowly fading as my grandmother was diagnosed with cancer and died in December 1993. He found life particularly tough to lose his love of his life and was no longer willing to spend the rest of his life living alone. He soon moved into the St Martin de Porres Hostel. He was still involved with the party and with local problems. He settled in very well and began going to mass everyday. Five years later our family was rocked with another tragedy, with Uncle Mark dying of cancer in December 1998. Pa-pa found it very difficult losing a child and his health was rapidly deteriorating from that time on. Eventually, he no longer remembered the things that were most important to him and no one needed to give him gobstoppers for him to stop interrupting and talking. He moved from the hostel into St Catherine's Nursing Home and upon its closure lived the rest of his life in Garden Suburb Nursing Home where he received the best care available.</para><para>My grandfather and hence the Labor Party have had great influence over myself. I could say that I have definitely been indoctrinated with party platforms since word go. My first memory of Pa-pa was him taking me around doing letterbox drops about the Labor Party preferences around election times. How could anybody refuse to vote Labor with a cute three year old telling them to do so. I have lots of memories of my grandfather, how he taught me to colour in all the same way when I was sitting in the back room amongst the piles of Labor party minutes listening to the races or him taking me to the TAB and teaching me how to fill out the card. Or the fact he always wore his hat and a shirt with a pocket that contained his TAB card, his little black calendar and a biro. The fact it took him from breakfast to dinner to read a newspaper with only a break at lunch to watch Days. These are the things I will miss the most about him, his generosity, his kindness and his willingness to do anything for you. These are the qualities that make me love him so much.</para><para>It's sad to think that his great grandchildren will never get the opportunity to know the man that I knew growing up. It is also the same sadness that makes me think that it is only now that his family has found him, the fact it was only a few weeks ago that his niece met him for the first time, that his brother and sister never got to know him. But at least after nearly eighty years he finally was completed. His children and grandchildren loved him dearly and his own family finally began recognising him as an important family member. As an aside, he always assumed himself an Irishman through and through but even when he was sick it brought a smile to his face when we said he was Irish but also Chinese. A small detail that his family has brought with them, as well as a fountain of knowledge about his past.</para><para>Mick was a great man, not perfect but who is? I am sure he will be still looking over my shoulder making sure I vote right—of course always Labor—and I am sure that he will still be stubborn and argue with God about all things and that we will always love him.</para></quote><para>On very sad occasions we have all attended the funeral of someone who has had an influence on our lives and who has helped shape our direction, whatever movement we belong to. Mick Cooey was one of those people. I first met Mick in 1995, and I had the privilege and the honour of calling Mick Cooey a friend and calling his family friends. I congratulate Jessica on the eulogy that she delivered in the church. It was a great effort for a granddaughter who was so close to her grandfather and for somebody who is only 20 years old. Again, to Jessica and to Lynette, Suzanne, Stephen and all of your families, I offer my sincere condolences and sympathy and wish you all the very best. Mick Cooey was a great bloke. We all cared deeply for him. May he rest in peace.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Canning Electorate: Law and Order</title><page.no>24817</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>24817</page.no><name role="metadata">Randall, Don, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RANDALL</name><name.id>PK6</name.id><electorate>Canning</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish to speak this evening on the issue in my electorate of law and order. On Australia Day I was pleased to be a guest of the Armadale City Council at their fireworks night. As some people know, and others not from Perth may not know, Perth has a very big night on Australia Day around the Swan River where millions of dollars of fireworks are exploded in a great lavish display of national fervour that is sponsored by Western Australian Lotto. It brings the community out onto the foreshore and is generally a good family event. However, this year the Perth foreshore fireworks celebrations were terribly marred. On Australia Day, something like a quarter of a million people attend around the foreshore area in South Perth and Kings Park and parents try to enjoy themselves with their children. This year the event was marred because, although it is meant to be a no alcohol night, unfortunately the no alcohol night was disobeyed—and the rest is history. Many fights broke out around the foreshore causing grievous bodily damage to innocent bystanders, and children and families were traumatised. That, in itself, was quite a disgrace. In fact, a policeman wrote into the paper a few days later with the headline that he was ashamed to be an Australian. Generally, I am offended when somebody says that they are not proud to be an Australian, but when I read his letter to the paper I could understand why. Here was a policeman trying to do his job being spat on, having bottles thrown at him, being called everything under the sun and being involved in physical fights with his nightstick with a bunch of drunken youths. As he said, it was supposed to be Australia Day. We were celebrating the national day and this is what happened.</para></talk.start><para>I contrast that with what happened at the fireworks display near the chambers of Armadale City Council. Something like 45,000 local people gathered around Minawarra Park just near the city chambers in Armadale. Families, children and people from the community—all races, all creeds; a great mixture of the Australian quilt that makes up this great nation—conducted themselves very well. The local government authorities were there, including Gosnells City Council—lead by their mayor, Pat Morris—Serpentine Jarrahdale, as well as many of the significant organisations in the area. As I said, we were there as a result of being invited by the Armadale City Council and their fine mayor, Linton Reynolds.</para><para>I compare these two events because it says something about the work the Armadale City Council, the Gosnells City Council and the other councils in that area are doing for their local people. It is no accident that it went off without a hitch and that there were no dramas, no violence and no dysfunctional behaviour exhibited by the people watching because of the work that the Armadale City Council does in cooperation with the local police and other agencies in the area to reduce the incidence of lawlessness. As an aside, it is quite interesting that the fireworks display I attended at Armadale cost a fraction of the one that happens on the South Perth foreshore, yet it provides a most magnificent opportunity for people who live so far away from the city to see a great Australia Day event. I was listening to talkback radio the next day and it was interesting to listen to people ringing in and comparing the horrific displays of violence on the Perth foreshore with Armadale. One interesting and humorous comment was that someone had taken their dog down to watch the display and a firework had dropped, obviously not finished, and they looked down to notice the dog with its long coat half on fire and they did their best to put it out. Several grass fires ensued in the area, so it does have a few little areas to tidy up.</para><para>The Armadale City Council and the surrounding councils have taken a very positive attitude to law and order. They get little help from the state Labor government in policing the area. For example, the local police station is staffed by fine men and women of the police force, including detectives and their civilian support staff, but they are severely undermanned. Unfortunately, even though the fireworks night went off exceptionally well, there is a deal of drug trafficking in the area that keeps the police force quite busy. As a result, their numbers are down. Before the last state election, the Labor Party said they would boost police numbers by 250 over four years and that they would be deployed throughout the state. After their first year of government, they had recruited only an extra 38 police officers. They said that 115 new officers would be employed in flying squads. They said there would be five new flying squads established as a `strong proactive policing force to complement the existing area commands'. These would tackle criminal hotspots. There had not been any hotspots until recently when similar riotous behaviour happened down at the Scarborough beachfront.</para><para>Law and order is a topical issue in my area. Any polling or surveys we do come back with law and order as an issue that people feel very strongly about. There is nothing more debilitating than to go home in the evening and find that it has been broken into and ransacked and that everything has gone or been scattered everywhere. There is nothing more unsettling than to go back to where your car was parked and find that it is no longer there. There is nothing more unsettling than to walk down the street at night and feel worried about the people who are walking along behind you and the intimidating behaviour that goes on. That is why a strong police force is needed.</para><para>Some time ago, I was invited to the Armadale courthouse by Magistrate McIntyre. I would like to compliment him on the work that he is doing. He has been away but he is back now. Magistrate McIntyre showed me just how inadequate the police restraining cells at the courts were. In fact, they were so small that you could barely stand two women in the so-called women's area. If they got a violent prisoner, they were handcuffing them to railings. I highlighted this in the local media. Surprise, surprise; it took some time, but eventually the local member Alannah MacTiernan got some kudos for bringing the Attorney-General out. The Attorney-General committed to spending $300,000 on the courthouse and, eventually, the work was done. I am pleased to have played a role in exposing it. However, in these issues you seldom get much credit for actually bringing the action to bear.</para><para>I am very pleased that Magistrate McIntyre now has an adequate courthouse, because he is a strong magistrate. He finds innovative ways of dealing with offenders in the local area. He is a compassionate person but takes a no-nonsense approach to dealing with young offenders, particularly repeat offenders who are trying him on. So I congratulate him and ask him to keep up the very good work.</para><para>The City of Gosnells, too, is taking important steps to address the law and order issues in the area. Its efforts were recently recognised and put under the national spotlight at the 2003 Safer Communities Awards. The City of Gosnells, the Western Australia Police Service and FESA last year won a highly commended in the combination pre-disaster category for home safety audits for their attention to the safety of the elderly and disabled. They are to be congratulated. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

That is agreed. But what we also have to recognise is that both of these bills go to a critical area of economic policy. In essence, these bills are about the regulatory framework which governs our market system—the economic coordination of the market. Students of economics have long known the importance of the role of information as a founding pillar of the market system and the inherent problems of incomplete and imperfect information. In a market system, it is the role of government to provide a regulatory framework which ensures the efficient provision of information in the marketplace and also ensures that this information is reliable.</para></talk.start><para>Information lies at the heart of the efficient working of the market system. Firstly, it allows for more efficient decision making by buyers and sellers. Buyers and sellers in the marketplace use information to best align their preferences with their decisions to buy and sell. Rational decisions are best made when all the information is available. If that information is withheld or not required to be disclosed, bad decisions—wrong decisions—are the consequence. Secondly, more efficient decision making necessarily improves the efficiency of the resources allocation in the economy. The better the decisions people make, the less waste there is in the use of our scarce resources. Thirdly, and terribly importantly, the provision of reliable information reduces risk and uncertainty in the market which would otherwise give rise to ad hoc and corrupt market behaviour. When reliable information is available to all, there is increased transparency and accountability in the marketplace. Sweetheart deals and cosy arrangements are much harder to hide.</para><para>Protecting investments is also critical. Better provision of reliable information and the protection of investments are fundamentally about bolstering the core institution of the marketplace, trust. Our news bulletins all too often bring home the reality of corporate failures. Enron in the United States and HIH here at home are part of the seemingly unending list of unscrupulous corporate behaviours that have denied employees their hard-earned employee entitlements. It is their money. If these companies are not properly scrutinised, who pays the price? All too often it is not the chief executive, because he or she seems to hop from one corporation to another with a golden handshake. It is the thousands of shareholders who are left out to dry. Each of these failures erodes trust in the market system. But they also provide us, as policy makers, with the opportunity to get things right by understanding the consequences and being prepared to learn from them.</para><para>This is not some esoteric legislation affecting a small section of the community. Investment today is not an opportunity available only to the rich few in our society; economic mobility has opened it up to the vast bulk of Australians—especially through their superannuation. It is critical to the future that individuals and families want to build for themselves.</para><para>The requirement to mandate the provision of reliable and full information is also critical for Australian shareholders and the public at large. It gives rise to better decision making which reflects the preferences of buyers and sellers, such as those who wish to make investments based on ethical grounds and thus better protect their interests. A good case in point is Australia's superannuation system. Under Labor governments, the number of people covered by superannuation schemes expanded from the very few to the vast bulk of the work force—from less than 30 per cent of employed workers when Labor came to office prior to 1983 to nearly 90 per cent of workers today, all as a consequence of Labor initiatives. Superannuation in this country now covers nine million Australian workers who have their stake, their future, in the super funds.</para><para>Labor traditionally has been the party of the pensioner in this country; it is now the party of the superannuant because only under Labor initiatives, only under Labor legislation, and only under Labor governments has superannuation been spread across the whole of the community. It is not the preserve of the white-collar sector, executives and public servants; it is available to all in the work force through the initiatives that Labor governments introduced. Compulsory superannuation has seen the industry grow enormously, with over $550 billion in funds now under management. These super entitlements have to be protected; at stake is not only the amount of money involved but also the future of huge numbers of Australians. These super entitlements must be protected. Indeed, the compulsory nature of them puts an even greater onus on the protection of these entitlements.</para><para>The retirement incomes of most Australians depend on the performance of Australian companies. Every worker's retirement income is affected by corporate greed and unscrupulous corporate behaviour. That is why the issues raised in these bills are so important. They go to the heart of the market system. They ensure greater information provision, and they aim to crack down on corporate greed and empower shareholders to take on the boards.</para><para>The CLERP 9 bill represents the culmination of four major reviews. It follows on from the release of the original CLERP 9 discussion paper in September 2002, and it incorporates recommendations from the HIH royal commission. Labor supports the intention of the CLERP 9 bill and believes that it provides a solid framework for corporate reform. But it does not go far enough. It fails to sufficiently hold boards accountable and it fails to sufficiently empower shareholders. I want to foreshadow that Labor will be moving a number of amendments to the bill in the Senate. </para><para>Labor has not been a bystander on this issue. We have a proud record of reform in government and have contributed to the debate in recent times. More recently, in 1998, Labor and the Democrats inserted section 300A into the Corporations Act to require that companies disclose the remuneration paid to their directors and top executives. As far back as August 2002, and more recently in October 2003, Labor released policy papers setting out our agenda on corporate governance. That agenda dealt with a series of issues. It dealt with executive remuneration, the composition of boards, the empowering of shareholders, analyst independence, audits, penalties for corporate misconduct, accounting standards and whistleblowers. </para><para>These are not new issues to Labor. I recall raising these issues in discussions on corporate governance for some time now, including in Labor's budget reply speeches. They have been out in the public domain for some time, and it is good to see that some of the proposals that we have been putting forward have been included in the bills that we are debating today. For example, Labor welcomes the government's decision to adopt our policy to give shareholders a say on executive remuneration through a non-binding vote on remuneration reports. This is a measure designed to force the disclosure of the information and for shareholders to send management an important signal on this crucial topic.</para><para>I want briefly to outline some of the key amendments which Labor will propose when the bills are debated in the Senate and foreshadow the possibility of additional amendments following the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services. The CLERP 9 bill has been over 12 months in the making. The original policy paper was released in September 2002. In light of the fact that executive salaries have continued to skyrocket, it is incredible to think that the original CLERP 9 policy paper did not even mention executive remuneration. How out of touch has this government been? A recent <inline font-style="italic">Business Review Weekly</inline> survey of the 20 highest paid CEOs showed that only five had increased shareholder wealth in the last 12 months. This disconnection between performance and payment should be of great concern to all market participants. </para><para>In light of the recent spate of executive remuneration payments, we have to ask why it is that remuneration packages often do not coincide with shareholder value. The power of the board to set remuneration and the powerlessness of the shareholders to have input into that process results in this disconnect. To overcome the disconnect, we want to see checks and balances on the setting of executive remuneration and we want to empower shareholders. Accordingly, Labor will propose a number of amendments to the CLERP 9 bill, in relation to executive remuneration. Firstly, we will prohibit the payment of options, bonus payments and retirement benefits, other than statutory superannuation, to non-executive directors. We believe that remuneration for non-executives should be distinguished from remuneration for executives. According to <inline font-style="italic">Corporate Governance International</inline>, the role of the non-executive director is to monitor the strategy and performance of the executive arm of the company and to safeguard the interests of shareholders generally. Remuneration for non-executive directors should not provide any disincentive to independent action.</para><para>The Australian Stock Exchange corporate governance guidelines also say that companies should not provide options, bonus payments or retirement benefits to non-executives. In Labor's view, if it is good enough for the Australian Stock Exchange, it should be a requirement in the law. What is wrong with legislating for it? If that is the recommendation of the Stock Exchange, put it in the law as a requirement for disclosure.</para><para>Secondly, the disclosure requirements in the bill in relation to executive remuneration are not fully known, as much of the disclosure regime will be contained in the regulations, which have not yet been circulated for comment. In addition to the disclosures required under the accounting standard on remuneration and the CLERP 9 bill, in Labor's view comprehensive disclosure would also require disclosure of a board's policy on the duration of contracts, notice periods and termination payments; on golden hellos—we recognise the circumstances of golden handshakes; what about the new developments of golden hellos?—and on equity value protection schemes; and would require graphs plotting shareholder returns for the previous five financial years. The disclosure of this level of information will empower shareholders to make an informed vote on a company's remuneration report.</para><para>The bill also proposes that information to be disclosed in relation to remuneration paid, or payable, will be the same as that proposed to be disclosed under accounting standard AASB 1046, `Director and executive disclosures by disclosing entities'. Labor has a number of concerns with the accounting standards which it wants to explore during the joint parliamentary committee's inquiry.</para><para>The third amendment we will make is to prohibit non-recourse loans to directors and management by the company. The accounting standard requires disclosures of loans to directors and executives where they exceed $100,000. In our view, this does not go far enough. In these arrangements the nexus between risk and reward is severed. In our view, non-recourse loans to directors and senior managers to buy shares in the company should be prohibited. Directors should go to the bank, like everyone else who wants a loan.</para><para>The fourth area where Labor will move amendments relates to termination payments. Section 200B of the bill prevents a payment being made in connection with retirement from a board or managerial office unless shareholder approval is first obtained, while sections 200F, 200G and 200H provide exceptions to this rule. The changes proposed by this bill will insert an additional requirement on two of the current exemptions. In Labor's view, the threshold for approvals has been set too high.</para><para>The royal commission into Australia's largest corporate collapse, HIH, identified a number of deficiencies in Australia's regulatory framework and made a series of recommendations to improve the framework, especially audit reform. While these bills pick up some of Justice Owen's recommendations, Labor will go further and move amendments to, firstly, implement Justice Owen's recommendations that four years is an appropriate cooling-off period before audit partners can join their former clients and, secondly, prohibit the company's auditor from providing certain non-audit services which compromise the independence of the auditor. We also want to strengthen the role played by auditors, by requiring them to specifically report to shareholders and the audit committee on alternative treatments of financial information that had been discussed with management, on the ramifications of the use of such alternative treatments and on the treatment preferred by the auditor. Under our proposal, this would form part of the audit opinion included in the company's annual report.</para><para>The Australian Securities and Investment Commission's 2003 surveillance report on independence of research analysts found that research reports from investment banks are dodgy and that self-regulation of the investment banking industry has been a comprehensive failure. While some market players have already moved to improve their in-house activities, more needs to be done. Labor, accordingly, will move amendments to strengthen analyst independence and improve the disclosure requirement to restore trust in the market for investment advice.</para><para>One of the gaps in the CLERP 9 relates to shareholder empowerment. With shareholder activism in Australia lower than in the United States and the United Kingdom, more must be done to empower our shareholders. These reforms would increase disclosure in relation to executive remuneration policy, require companies to give shareholders a say on executive pay by putting a non-binding resolution on the company's executive remuneration policy to the annual general meeting—which the government has adopted in this bill—require companies to put a non-binding resolution to shareholders in relation to the appointment of a director as chair where the director is already the chair of another company, require the trustees of super funds to vote their proxies, and require funds managers to disclose their voting records and voting policy.</para><para>A far greater emphasis is needed on the role that shareholders can play in holding companies accountable. For this reason, Labor believes that institutional shareholders, such as trustees of super funds and funds managers, have a responsibility to take an active role in Australian companies. In addition to Labor's proposals to empower shareholders, we will oppose proposals which emasculate shareholder rights.</para><para>The present government have released a draft bill called the Corporations Amendment Bill 2002. This bill is listed to be introduced in the autumn sittings. Although we do not know the content of the final bill, we do know that the draft bill launched a direct attack on shareholder rights by shortening the notice period required for the calling of company meetings from 28 days to 21 days and by abolishing the right of a single director of a listed company to call a company meeting. I am astounded at the hypocrisy of the Howard government. On the one hand they agree with Labor that shareholders should vote on the remuneration report in the CLERP 9 bill; on the other hand they introduce a separate bill which reduces shareholder rights.</para><para>The bills being considered today are critical to the economic debate and the management of our economy. The period since the end of World War II is a story of major economic reforms—reforms which have made our economy modern and more dynamic. Most of all, they have made our economy more flexible. A more mature and dynamic economy has allowed our people to become more economically mobile. More than ever, these developments place a greater premium on the role of reliable information in the marketplace and the protection of people's investments.</para><para>The lack of information in the market economy is often associated with the literature on market failure. The simple fact is that not being informed undermines rational decision making. While these bills on balance are a step in the right direction, they could be better. The amendments that I have foreshadowed will lead to better management, better decision making, greater transparency and more accountability and will underpin greater economic flexibility in our economy.</para><para>There are things a government must do: protecting the integrity of the market is one of them. There are, of course, costs from increased regulation but on balance Labor's amendments will improve the functioning of the market. Labor's amendments are fundamentally pro-market. They are about protecting investments and greater disclosure and greater empowerment. In the end, they are about helping people make the right decisions which accord with their preferences and about protecting their investments. The price for not doing so is letting trust in the market system continue to erode. It will mean that the lessons of HIH and other collapses have not been learnt. We cannot let the lessons from those collapses go unheeded. These bills give us the opportunity to correct that.</para><para>The government have come some of the way—which we welcome—after an exhaustive period of discussion, consideration and public debate. But we are firmly of the view that as welcome as these changes are they do not go far enough. What I have attempted to do tonight is to indicate the direction Labor believes the changes should be taken further. We hope that the government sees merit in the proposed amendments. They will be introduced in the Senate and we will have the opportunity to further consider them in the joint parliamentary committee. I hope the government heed the warnings.</para><para>What we are about here is protecting people's investments and making the corporate sector accountable in the best interests of market transparency, openness and the better functioning of our market system. I urge the government to consider the amendments we are putting forward in good faith. We put them forward in that regard and I hope they are prepared to adopt them.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>24825</page.no><name role="metadata">Hunt, Gregory, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HUNT</name><name.id>00AMV</name.id><electorate>Flinders</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1959">Corporate Law Economic Reform Program (Audit Reform and Corporate Disclosure) Bill 2003</inline>, which is a critical part of the government's response to the CLERP 9 reform program, with great passion and energy for what this says about the process of shareholder participation in the economy and in the affairs of individual companies. There are two core concepts to this bill. The first is corporate governance and accountability. Sadly, the names Enron, WorldCom, Global Crossing, Arthur Andersen and HIH have become familiar to us in recent years—not as examples of great corporate triumphs but as failures of the processes of corporate scrutiny and corporate governance and, ultimately, accountability to shareholders.</para></talk.start><para>There are two fundamental flaws which need to be corrected. Firstly, there is oversight of some of the excesses which occur behind closed doors or in ledgers which are not open and, secondly, there can be greater shareholder participation—the American examples in particular show that, but we have had a foretaste within the Australian context. So there must be oversight and there must be participation.</para><para>The corporate collapses I have mentioned represent, individually and collectively, not just the loss of jobs but the loss of wealth by individual shareholders, whether they are mum and dad shareholders, are people who have invested their life savings or institutions that have invested collectively on behalf of the different participating members of the economy. In the end it is about people in their homes whose assets are being lost and employees relying upon good corporate governance whose jobs are being lost.</para><para>The second great concept within this bill is the notion of asset wealth. Asset wealth is about spreading the base of participation in the economy. It is about giving people a leg-up so that they are not dependent but independent. If there is one thing that we as a government represent, it is the notion of giving people the opportunity to choose their own lives, whether in a social sense or at an economic level. By broadening the shareholder base, the capacity to participate in the economy and the ability of individuals to participate in the ownership of shareholding assets, we increase people's capacity to have control over their own lives and to have security over their own futures. To that extent, this government has an extraordinary record.</para><para>Firstly, this government has helped not only to produce the greatest level of shareholding in Australian history but also to make Australia the greatest shareholding democracy in the Western world. That is a measure of the extent to which wealth has been spread across Australia. Whether this has occurred through the distribution of Telstra's assets—to mums and dads, young families, singles, workers, people who otherwise had not participated in the economy—or any of the other broad based distributions of shares through the demutualisation which has occurred within insurance companies, all of them have contributed to shareholder wealth.</para><para>Secondly, we see a very simple thing in terms of the asset base: the reduction of capital gains tax by effectively 50 per cent for many shareholders has contributed to the attractiveness of basic shares. Thirdly, only last week we saw the establishment of the basis of a free trade agreement with the United States. That also includes important provisions for US investment into Australia, for building up the wealth of Australian companies which, in the end, impacts on shareholders and employees: jobs and wealth are the outcomes. </para><para>All of this is about corporate law reform but we also see microeconomic reform on the waterfront and through the transportation system, which improves the health—in effect, cleaning the arteries—of the nation's economy and creates the efficiencies which have led Australia to be at the forefront of world economic growth over the last seven years. In the developed world, no other country has maintained such a level of economic growth. There has also been macroeconomic reform of the entire tax system. So the packaging together of corporate reforms for individual companies, microeconomic reforms—which effectively clean and clear the entire transportation systems of the country—and macroeconomic reforms has led to the four core developments: high levels of growth, high levels of employment with commensurately low levels of unemployment, low interest rates and low inflation. It is an unprecedented quadruplet of effects, which has a practical impact on individual lives. This leads to the current CLERP 9 reforms, which build on the previous eight groups of reforms which began in 1997 with CLERP 1.</para><para>The four core actions which this bill will take are these. Firstly, the bill will improve company disclosure and overall transparency to the market; it will improve what we know about companies so that the market can make real choices. There are three ways in which it will do that. Firstly, it will impose more stringent auditing requirements; secondly, it will ensure better visibility of executive remuneration; and, thirdly, it will lead to greater accountability for business activities. These three steps lead to the first great reform, which is improving company disclosure and overall transparency to the market. This is an important step forward because it means that the market will be able to see whether there are flaws in a company's practice and that individual shareholders will have transparency and be protected from any untoward actions, whether through an Enron, a WorldCom, a Global Crossing, an HIH or an Arthur Andersen.</para><para>The second great wave of reforms contained within this bill mean there will be an enhancement in the reliability and credibility of company financial statements. The bill does this by ensuring that there will be statements to include more, instead of less, information across a range of different areas. Thirdly, the bill will lead to great reforms occurring within the area of enhancing shareholder participation and involvement in key decisions. It will do this by ensuring that there is greater voting privilege and involvement by shareholders at a range of levels; it will also encourage shareholder participation and influence at general meetings. These are real reforms aimed at enhancing the capacity of ordinary mum-and-dad shareholders—of whom there are now more than at any other time in Australian history—to influence, understand and participate in the workings of corporate governance. It is the essence of democracy as well as being the essence of economic democracy.</para><para>The fourth great measure within this bill is that it will provide for better enforcement mechanisms for breaches of continuous disclosure requirements in corporations legislation. It provides the teeth to go with the basic principles. In particular, it will increase penalties for breaches in disclosure and actions by corporate leaders where they breach their faith and responsibilities, and it will also ensure that there is an extension of provisions to drill down to individual involvement in wrongdoing by a contravening entity. In essence, there are important provisions such as CFO and CEO sign off of auditing provisions.</para><para>Those are the four great waves of reform. They have a real impact, and they go back to where I began. Firstly, they go to the notion of corporate governance and accountability. They enhance corporate governance and accountability so we limit the chance of seeing an Enron, a WorldCom, a Global Crossing, an Arthur Anderson or an HIH. Secondly, and above all else, what we believe in as a government and a political party and what I believe in as an individual is the notion of enhancing asset wealth across as broad a base in the economy as possible. The Corporate Law Economic Reform Program (Audit Reform and Corporate Disclosure) Bill 2003 is ultimately about enhancing and broadening asset wealth, about giving shareholders confidence and about giving shareholders the capacity to participate in the governance and control of their own investments and, ultimately, to protect and enhance their wealth. On that basis, I commend the bills to the House and I urge all members of the House to support the CLERP 9 reforms.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>24827</page.no><name role="metadata">Cox, David, MP</name><name role="display">Mr COX</name><name.id>83U</name.id><electorate>Kingston</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1959">Corporate Law Economic Reform Program (Audit Reform and Corporate Disclosure) Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1962">Corporations (Fees) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2003</inline> are being presented in this cognate debate. The Corporations (Fees) Amendment Bill will allow companies to be charged a fee for referring a matter to the newly established Financial Reporting Panel. However, I will focus on the CLERP 9 bill. Labor supports the intention of the CLERP 9 bill and believes that it provides a solid framework for corporate reform. However, it does not go far enough. Labor is concerned that the CLERP 9 bill fails to sufficiently hold boards accountable and to sufficiently empower shareholders. Accordingly, Labor will move a number of amendments to the bill in the Senate.</para></talk.start><para>The CLERP 9 bill represents the culmination of four major reviews, follows on from the release of the original CLERP 9 discussion paper and incorporates recommendations from the HIH royal commission. The CLERP 9 bill covers a variety of areas of reform, including remuneration, continuous disclosure, shareholder participation, conflicts of interest, audit reform, financial reporting, proportionate liability and enforcement. The bill amends a number of acts, including the Corporations Act 2001 and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001. Labor has a proud history in relation to ensuing that shareholders are aware of the salaries of corporate executives. In 1998, Labor and the Democrats inserted section 300A in the Corporations Act. This provision required that companies disclose the remuneration paid to their directors and top executives.</para><para>In August 2002, Labor released a directions statement called <inline font-style="italic">Improving corporate governance</inline>. This paper was the first stage in implementing Labor's corporate governance agenda through legislative change. The paper outlined Labor's policy position on a range of corporate governance issues, including executive remuneration. In October 2003, Labor released another paper which set out the second stage of Labor's corporate governance agenda. The paper set out the reforms which Labor believes should form part of the CLERP 9 bill. The paper proposed a range of reforms to executive remuneration, the composition of boards, empowering shareholders, analysts' independence, audit, penalties for misconduct, accounting standards and whistleblower protection. Some of Labor's proposals have been included in the bill we are debating today. In particular, Labor welcomes the government's decision to adopt Labor's policy to give shareholders a say on executive remuneration through a nonbinding vote on the remuneration report.</para><para>Today I will outline some of the key amendments which Labor will propose when the bill is debated in the Senate. I will not be outlining all of Labor's amendments, as the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services has not yet conducted the inquiry in relation to the CLERP 9 bill. Further amendments may arise as a result of that examination. This bill and Labor's amendments are part of Labor's microeconomic reform agenda, because the performance and relative competitiveness of Australian companies are influenced by good corporate governance. With most workers having an interest in shares via their superannuation fund, almost every Australian worker has an interest in the performance of Australian companies. These reforms therefore have implications for the success of our retirement incomes policy.</para><para>The CLERP 9 bill has been more than 12 months in the making. The original CLERP 9 policy paper was released in September 2002. In light of how executive salaries have escalated, it is amazing to think that the original CLERP 9 policy paper did not even mention executive remuneration. A recent <inline font-style="italic">BRW </inline>survey of the 20 highest paid CEOs showed that only five have increased shareholder wealth in the last 12 months. A director on a number of boards, Charles Macek, said:</para><quote><para>Business needs to recognise that it is part of the community. It needs to engage with the community, and reflect community attitudes. It's a cop-out to justify the process by which we have got here....It is delivering outcomes that clearly are unacceptable to the community.</para></quote><para>In light of the recent spate of excessive executive remuneration payments, we have to ask why it is that remuneration packages often do not coincide with shareholder value. The power of the board to set remuneration and the powerlessness of the shareholders to have input into that process too often results in this disconnect. To overcome this disconnect, Labor wants to put checks and balances on the setting of executive remuneration and to empower shareholders.</para><para>Labor will propose a number of amendments to executive remuneration provisions in the CLERP 9 bill. Firstly, Labor will prohibit the payment of options, bonus payments and retirement benefits other than statutory superannuation to non-executive directors. Labor believes that remuneration for non-executives should be distinguished from remuneration for executives. According to Corporate Governance International, the role of the non-executive director is to monitor the strategy and performance of the executive arm of the company and to safeguard the interests of shareholders generally. Remuneration for non-executive directors should not provide any disincentive to independent action. The ASX corporate governance guidelines also say that companies should not provide options, bonus payments or retirement benefits to non-executives. In Labor's view this should be a requirement in law.</para><para>Secondly, the disclosure requirements for executive remuneration in the bill are not fully known, as much disclosure will be required in the regulations, which have not yet been circulated for comment. The explanatory memorandum notes that regulations will require disclosure of information such as performance hurdles relating to the exercise of options and the payment of short-term and long-term incentives. In Labor's view these disclosures are welcome but do not go far enough. The explanatory memorandum also notes that details of the remuneration to be disclosed will be prescribed in regulations and that companies should provide shareholders with comprehensive disclosure.</para><para>In Labor's view comprehensive disclosure would at least require disclosure of the board's policy on duration of contracts, notice periods and termination payments, golden hellos and equity value protection schemes, and require graphs plotting shareholder return for the previous five financial years. The disclosure of this level of information will empower shareholders to make an informed vote on the company's remuneration report. The bill also proposes that information to be disclosed about remuneration paid or payable be the same as that proposed to be disclosed under accounting standard AASB 1046, entitled `Director and executive disclosures by disclosing entities'. Labor has a number of concerns with the accounting standard which will be explored during the joint parliamentary committee's inquiry.</para><para>Thirdly, another amendment that Labor will make will be to prohibit non-recourse loans by a company to directors and management. The accounting standard requires disclosure of loans to directors and executives where they exceed $100,000. In Labor's view this does not go far enough. In November last year, Challenger provided a loan to its CEO of $21.2 million to finance his acquisition of 40 million shares in that company. The loan was a non-recourse loan; in other words, if the value of Challenger shares fell below the loan amount outstanding then the company—that is, the shareholders—would wear the loss. This meant that the CEO had all the upside and none of the downside. In Labor's view non-recourse loans to directors and senior managers to buy shares in the company should be prohibited; directors can go to a bank like anyone else.</para><para>Fourthly, Labor will move amendments relating to termination payments. The CLERP 9 bill amends the operation of section 200F. Section 200B prevents a payment from being made in connection with retirement from a board or managerial office unless shareholder approval is first obtained. Sections 200F, 200G and 200H provide exceptions to this rule. The changes proposed by this bill will insert an additional requirement on two of the current exemptions. The effect is that, where a payment is made pursuant to one of these exemptions, shareholder approval will be required where the payment exceeds an amount calculated in accordance with the formula specified in proposed section 200F(a)(iii) of the bill or where it exceeds the value of one year's remuneration, whichever is the greatest. Accordingly, payments that do not exceed either amount do not require shareholder approval. In Labor's view the formula sets the threshold for approval too high.</para><para>The HIH royal commission identified a number of deficiencies in Australia's regulatory framework and made a series of recommendations to improve the framework. Some of the key recommendations relate to audit reform. The implementation of Justice Owen's recommendations through this bill, such as those requiring rotation of audit partners, cooling-off periods before former audit partners can be employed by their clients and new rules relating to auditor independence, will improve the reliability and credibility of financial statements. Labor will move an amendment to implement Justice Owen's recommendation that four years is an appropriate cooling-off period before audit partners can join their former clients. In Labor's view Justice Owen was correct when he said:</para><quote><para>... in my opinion, the proposed mandatory `waiting period' of two years might not be sufficient to arrest a reasonable apprehension that former partners retain an influence over members of the audit team. This is particularly so if those with whom they may have worked for a number of years (and in respect of whom they may have acted as mentor) are members of the audit team. In my opinion, an appropriate `waiting period' would be four years.</para></quote><para>In addition, Labor will move an amendment which prohibits the company's auditor from providing certain non-audit services which compromise the independence of the auditor, such as accounting and bookkeeping services, valuation services, resolution of legal disputes, actuarial services and internal audit services.</para><para>Labor will also move an amendment to strengthen the role played by auditors. Labor welcomes the CLERP 9 requirement that auditors will be required to attend annual general meetings and answer questions. However, Labor has a proposal to go further, by requiring auditors to specifically report to shareholders and the audit committee on alternative treatments of financial information that had been discussed with management, the ramifications of the use of such alternative treatments and the treatment preferred by the auditor. These would form part of the audit opinion included in the company's annual report. I want to specifically draw the attention of peak accounting bodies to this particular proposal because it is something that they may wish to give their opinions on when the bill is in front of the relevant Senate committee.</para><para>The Australian Securities and Investments Commission's 2003 surveillance report on the independence of research analysts found that self-regulation of research reports from investment banks has been a comprehensive failure. In relation to conflicts of interest ASIC said:</para><quote><para>We did observe some systemic weaknesses in the ability of entities to adequately identify, manage and disclose conflicts of interest.</para></quote><para>ASIC also found that investment banks had ignored industry guidelines. The report found:</para><quote><para>... the industry guidelines developed by the Securities and Derivatives Industry Association (SDIA) and the Securities Industry of Australia (SIA) have not been adopted as closely as intended and that there is still significant room for conflicts of interest to occur and to remain unmanaged.</para></quote><para>As a result of ASIC's findings, Labor believes that the proposals in this bill to insert a general requirement for a financial services licensee to manage conflicts of interest and for ASIC to produce guidelines on managing conflicts of interest will not be sufficient. Labor will move amendments to prohibit trading by an analyst or researcher in products that are the subject of a current research report within a set time frame; trading by an analyst or researcher against a recommendation or opinion contained in a current research report; the publishing of any reports for a period after the analyst firm has acted in an initial public offer for the company that is the subject of the report; and `spinning', the practice whereby investment banks allocate shares in company floats to clients or potential clients as an inducement for business. Labor will also move amendments to require analysts to disclose in their reports any relevant interest of their own and companies to disclose information provided during briefings to analysts.</para><para>One of the key areas where the CLERP 9 bill is lacking is empowering shareholders. Labor believes that a number of other reforms are needed to empower shareholders: first, the requirement that companies put a non-binding resolution to shareholders in relation to the appointment of a director as chair where the director is already the chair of another company; second, the requirement that trustees of super funds vote their proxies; and, third, the requirement that fund managers disclose their voting records and voting policy. Here we have a slight variation from the first discussion paper that the shadow minister put out in which he suggested that fund managers be required to disclose why they voted on particular matters before annual general meetings. This simply requires them to provide information as to what their general voting policy is.</para><para>A far greater emphasis is needed on the role that shareholders can play in holding companies accountable. It is important that shareholders, both large and small, take an active interest in how Australian companies are being governed. The old response of simply selling out, known as the `Wall Street walk', is the easy way out. Labor believes that institutional shareholders such as trustees of super funds and funds managers have a responsibility to take an active role in Australian companies.</para><para>In addition to Labor's proposals to empower shareholders, Labor will oppose proposals which emasculate shareholders' rights. The Howard government has released a draft bill which attacks shareholders' rights by shortening the notice period required for the calling of company meetings from 28 days to 21 days and by abolishing the right of a single director of a listed company to call a company meeting. Labor will oppose these two proposals contained in the Corporations (Fees) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2003. Today I have outlined some of the amendments that Labor will propose in the Senate to the CLERP 9 bill. There will be further amendments following the committee's deliberations, including amendments to double penalties for serious breaches of the Corporations Act.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>24831</page.no><name role="metadata">Cadman, Alan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CADMAN</name><name.id>SD4</name.id><electorate>Mitchell</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1959">Corporate Law Economic Reform Program (Audit Reform and Corporate Disclosure) Bill 2003</inline> and the cognate bill, the <inline ref="R1962">Corporations (Fees) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2003</inline>. The housing boom in Australia at the moment is due to the confidence of investors. But it is also in part due to a lack of confidence by investors in forms of investment other than real estate. We have a very high level of share ownership in Australia. Some have said that it is as high as anywhere in the world. But the preference of most Australians still remains to invest in real estate. It does not go away, it can be found at any time and it does not depend on secret deals or takeovers that nobody—certainly not the investor—understands.</para></talk.start><para>These proposals seek to bring to light some of the decision-making processes of companies and corporations. Basically, many of the changes have been brought about because of some of the malpractices that have been identified in Australia and, in fact, worldwide. Australia is not the only country that has had an HIH type disaster. Confidence in decisions made by corporations really goes to the way boards operate, the way boards are supervised and the way decisions are implemented. The auditor is pivotal in providing confidence to anybody making decisions about investment.</para><para>Much of the discussion today in regard to these corporate law reform measures goes back to the role of the auditors. The House will remember the role of auditors in the HIH affair—the question of whether or not auditors should be board members, the information they had and the favoured treatment they may or may not have been able to give. Everything that could be done to destroy confidence in investment seemed to be done in that instance. The royal commissioner, Mr Justice Owen, certainly identified many of those areas.</para><para>Is Australia worse than any other country? No. Is Australia better? Yes, it is somewhat, compared to some of the failures in Britain, the United States and similar countries. But that should not give us any reason for complacency. This legislation, this corporate law reform, is timely and it flows in part from the royal commission into HIH. The role of overview by government was certainly lacking in the case of HIH. The problems that the various firms that were subsumed by HIH had were certainly known by the Superannuation Insurance Commission long before the company actually went down.</para><para>It seems strange to me that members of the Australian Labor Party come here today saying that these changes are not strong enough. They did not choose to implement changes, even though during their period in office some of the difficulties were known and some of the activities of friends of the Australian Labor Party—whether they were the Warren Andersons or the Laurie Connells—were well known. The Australian Labor Party chose to take no action whatsoever. Members of the Labor Party come to the House today claiming clean hands and new insight into the way in which these matters should be managed.</para><para>I think the government has moved solidly to put some really strong legislation in place but in a way that allows for companies to make decisions and move ahead and that provides for shareholders to take a view, express an opinion and be more proactive in companies. That is needed. Supervision by shareholders is needed. In any family company, supervision by shareholders is present at all times. The principle is reasonable enough; it is the shareholders' funds that are being used or abused by any corporation.</para><para>The role of the auditor—that pivotal person who supplies the information and has done so for some years now—has been extended into areas other than those financial. That is very significant. When reading about the proposals for change, I noticed that nothing could be more revealing than the changes that KPMG have had to make in the way they operate. There are also some factors that will limit government's role in bringing in some of the proposals suggested by the Australian Labor Party. There was an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> on 22 November about Deborah Smithers, a corporate governance expert at KPMG, which outlines her role as a lawyer working in a company that provides audits. As a lawyer by training, she provides advice and mentoring to directors of KPMG clients, as well as dealing with internal clients of the firm. The article states:</para><quote><para>Her work is unrelated to the job undertaken by audit teams, but she says that may not matter to those who see only that she works at KPMG.</para></quote><para>That is a fair comment, because audit firms and companies providing financial services to companies, whether they be accounting services, bookkeeping services, audit services or general advice-giving on corporate strategy, employ people with a wide range of interests. Not all of them have expert knowledge about the balance sheet and the financial affairs of the company, because it is not their charter to give advice on those matters.</para><para>The government has been able to strike an understandable balance between the need for expert advice-giving and the role of the auditor. The government has established the Financial Reporting Council and will expand its role to include an oversight of audit-setting arrangements. The government also believes that the Auditing and Assurance Standards Board will be reconstituted, with a government-appointed chairman, to oversight the role and functioning of the Financial Reporting Council. These are activities that go to the supervision of auditors alone. This government considers that the measure to give auditing standards the force of law will enhance the rigour of the standards applying to the auditing profession and will improve ASIC's enforcement capabilities, because people will know precisely the expectations of the various players in the assessment of the financial health and status of a company.</para><para>The government has consulted significantly and widely across the industry on this, and I am aware of some of the people who have been involved in consultations, and their comments. There was a fear at one point that it was going to be so difficult for accounting firms to retain an audit section that they would close their audit sections and hive off the audit companies, and that the audit companies would become specialists in their own right and be able to charge very large sums to do auditing, because of the restrictions and limitations that would be placed on any company that claimed to provide audits. So the accounting firms of Australia, with lots of expertise and capacity to provide information and to do auditing, at one point were looking at whether or not they would subdivide their operations so that the difficulties being imposed by some of these corporate law changes would not affect their capacity to provide proper accounting processes. I am pleased to say that that has not happened. The government has been able to draw a balance that will allow proper accounting and auditing procedures to exist within the same advice-giving group.</para><para>During the period of consultation, the industry noted that the existing body of professional standards was not sufficiently robust—and I think that is an understatement. There is no doubt about it: there is hardly an Aussie who believes that what happened in HIH demonstrated a robust, professional standard, because it appeared that auditors in that situation were allowed to very easily move between their official roles as auditors and into the decision-making process on the board. During the consultation, the industry also noted that the standards were not in a suitable form to be immediately given the force of law as part of the transition to the new arrangements. So the force of law needed a refinement of the process of what the standards should be. It is intended that the bill will retain transitional provisions that will bring the existing standards within the legislative framework at the earliest opportunity—and rightly so.</para><para>As I have already said, the Financial Reporting Council will have an oversight and monitoring function. This role will include advising the minister on how things are going. The council will advise the minister on the processes used by auditors to ensure compliance with the independence requirements and it will advise the professional accounting bodies on planning and performing quality assurance reviews of audit work. There is an assurance process in this legislation for the independence of the auditor. It provides that auditors must provide directors with an annual independence declaration. They must be able to say to the boards, `Here is a statement of my independence and freedom from outside interference that would jeopardise my continuance as auditor.'</para><para>It also proposes restrictions in the way the audit will allow partners to join an audit client as a director or in taking a senior management position. There is a waiting period of two years, and this will apply to people working for companies. Deborah Smithers of KPMG is a classic example of somebody working for an audit company who could be affected by the decision to make it a longer period. She is not involved in any way in the financial decision making process, so it is my view that a waiting period of two years to apply to partners of an audit firm or directors of an audit company who are becoming directly involved in a directorship is an adequate period of time and ensures the separation.</para><para>The bill requires an audit rotation of five years. This is presently a shorter period. I think the Australian Labor Party is proposing four years, but five years is considered too short by some. In circumstances where there may be difficulties in acquiring auditors, such as in country areas, a period of seven consecutive years may be given by ASIC. The description of the service provided by auditors is also required to be presented in the directors' annual reports so that the fees paid to auditors can be equated against the service they provide. There cannot be any hidden advantage given to auditors for faulty advice or for advice that goes beyond what is proper. I guess what I am saying is that an auditor should receive just reward and not extraordinary reward for not presenting a full and detailed report. Disclosure is required of the work that is done for the fees paid, and I think that is fair enough.</para><para>As proposed by Justice Owen, there will also be certainty for auditors, which will assist them in discharging their obligations and will take into account the nature of the Australian market. The government intends to support the policies recommended by Mr Justice Owen in retaining independence, but it is also necessary to ensure that regulatory requirements are appropriate for the Australian market. Continuous disclosure is another part of the process. This continuous disclosure regime is one way of making sure that the public are aware of all changes in companies' circumstances and that the marketplace, the stock exchanges and those involved in the process are always aware of what the changes may be. There is a change in the maximum civil penalty that the courts can apply. In the case of a corporation it will be raised from $200,000 to $1 million, but for an individual it will remain at $200,000.</para><para>There is a need for remuneration disclosures, and this is something that seems to get right up the noses of the Australian Labor Party because they want it to go even further. In fact, I think many of them would prefer to vote in the parliament about what the remuneration should be for directors and senior executives. I know that some of the payments and payouts—the golden handshakes—are extraordinary and are, in my view, absolutely wrong. People should not be paid for failures; people should be paid for success and results. The details of directors' and executives' remuneration will need to be disclosed clearly in marked sections of the annual directors' report. This section will be known as the remuneration report. Shareholders will be given the opportunity to comment on the contents of the report and to vote. At an annual meeting shareholders will be able to inform the chairman whether or not they approve of the proposed package for senior executives and directors and whether or not the shareholders think they are worth it. It is a non-binding expression but, I tell you what, it will be reported pretty widely.</para><para>That will affect the market standing and status of that particular company. You can imagine headlines in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline>, the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> or the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> about what people are doing for what they have been paid. I think this is a very worthy innovation and something that will have a salutary effect on the way companies and corporations operate. It is for shareholders to be told what a person is supposed to be doing, whether they are achieving the results that are set out in the terms of their employment and how much they are going to be paid for it. I think that is completely appropriate.</para><para>We have had a discussion in this place over the last little while about how much MPs are paid. The country can make its own judgment about those things, but details of directors' remuneration should be open and known to investors who are putting in their hard-saved cash to get a return to build their families' wealth and security. There will be a voting mechanism for shareholders to directly and clearly communicate their views of the board and the company so that they can indicate to the directors what they want without detracting from the authority of directors.</para><para>The committee that will examine this proposed legislation is the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, chaired by a friend and a fine parliamentarian Senator Grant Chapman. In his media release about the committee's inquiry, Senator Chapman says the committee understands that the government, Treasury and others have consulted widely and it will be looking with enthusiasm to consulting more widely during the inquiry process. I think that the Treasurer, Mr Peter Costello, has found a balance in putting a check on failing to keep people informed. In this legislation there is a proposal to keep auditors very closely under supervision and constantly reporting what they are up to and to supervise directors and chief executive officers and what they are paid.</para><para>According to a report in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> dated 5 September, chief executives reject the provisions of CLERP 9, as it is known, giving investors the right to register a non-binding vote. Well, tough cheddar—I believe that investors should have that say. I notice that some of the aspects of the legislation have been rejected by Hugh Morgan. But I am sure that Hugh Morgan, like anybody else who wants the best for Australian business, will understand the reasons for it. ASIC's Executive Director of Policy and Marketing, Malcolm Rogers, said that the final policy statements that are dealt with in CLERP 9 will ensure that the people affected will be able to plan ahead. They will be given a two-year transitory program and they will be able to plan ahead for the changes necessary. What Australia is looking for is a better result for shareholders and for the Australian public. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>24835</page.no><name role="metadata">Hull, Kay, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs HULL</name><name.id>83O</name.id><electorate>Riverina</electorate><party>NATS</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise this evening to speak in support of the <inline ref="R1959">Corporate Law Economic Reform Program (Audit Reform and Corporate Disclosure) Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1962">Corporations (Fees) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2003</inline>. As the previous speaker indicated, this legislation is about implementing measures to address financial reporting and corporate disclosures. The introduction of these measures will achieve better disclosure outcomes, enhance auditor independence and improve enforcement arrangements for corporate misbehaviour.</para></talk.start><para>This legislation builds on the government's previous reform measures in the areas of accounting standards, directors' duties, fundraising, takeovers and financial services reform—and this certainly is not before time. The program of reform known as the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program was initiated in 1997 to review and reform Australia's corporate and business regulation to ensure that it continues to maintain and promote more transparent business activity. By implementing this reform, this government is ensuring its economic objectives of increasing employment and growth and, keeping the regulatory structures strong, modern and flexible without burdening business with unnecessary regulation.</para><para>Recent media attention concerning corporate salaries and what the chief executive officers of our top companies take home has sparked a great deal of outrage and discussion within the community. The Prime Minister of Australia earns an annual salary of around $267,000. Those of us in the House are more than aware of what commitment and responsibility this position entails, whether it is a coalition Prime Minister or a Labor Prime Minister. And I am sure the vast majority of Australians have an understanding of the responsibility the role of Prime Minister of Australia brings with it. Yet 70 executives of leading Australian companies earned 10 times more than the Prime Minister in 2002-03, with packages of at least $2.67 million.</para><para>Ordinary Australians, often shareholders in these companies, are no doubt shocked by the huge amounts executives earn and by the bonuses they receive. Ordinary Australians work hard to buy a home, to save for the future and to live a comfortable existence if possible. Many of these people, in order to achieve these simple goals, work two and more jobs, yet will never see in a lifetime the sort of money that some corporate executives are able to achieve. These ordinary Australians invest their hard-earned savings and their superannuation into companies and depend on these companies to grow and utilise their money wisely. But a highly paid executive and highly paid board members can make poor decisions and lose the hard-earned savings of the man on the street and yet get paid an obscene amount of money prior to any dividend going to the person who saved the money in the first instance. This just does not seem fair.</para><para>As a partner in a small business before entering politics, I applaud hard work and rewards for commitment and success. Business owners throughout my electorate and Australia dedicate untold hours and sacrifice a great deal in order to run their small business and provide a service, yet in many instances they reap little financially at the end of the day. The stress of running a business and the many decisions involved can have an enormous impact on any individual, their family and their friends. Everybody involved has a significant amount of responsibility. It is not just high-paid executives in corporates who have the stress and the concern of running a business, yet the enormous salaries enjoyed by CEOs are in stark contrast to those earned by small business owners and ordinary workers.</para><para>Key measures of this legislation include the expansion of the Financial Reporting Council's role to include oversight of the audit standard-setting arrangements and enhancement of auditor independence, including restrictions on specific employment and financial relationships between auditors and their clients. As I have indicated before, that is something that has been crucially lacking in the past. A waiting period of two years will be required for partners of an audit firm or directors of an audit company directly involved in an audit before they are able to begin to act in a role as a director or in senior management with an audit client. The HIH royal commission—everyone knows about the HIH demise—recommended that any changes made should include a restriction on more than one audit partner joining an audit client as a director or taking a senior management position. In addition, this legislation requires auditor rotation after five consecutive years. In rural and regional areas, ASIC will be able to extend these periods of service to up to seven consecutive years to assist smaller audit firms. </para><para>This legislation requires the annual directors' report to include an operating and financial review. The review will contain information that members of the company would reasonably require to make an informed assessment of the operations, financial position and future strategies of the company. Directors need to be more concerned with looking after the cents of our investors, and then the dollars will definitely look after themselves. Too often we hear that people who regularly deal in hundreds or thousands of millions believe that the cents of the small investor are not worth while having responsibility for. Yet it is these cents that turn into very important dollars for the small investor to be able to prepare for his future.</para><para>A financial reporting panel will be established to resolve disputes between the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and companies. This panel will determine whether a company's financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting standards and that they represent a true and fair view.</para><para>Funding of $4 million was announced in the 2003-04 budget to support the role of this financial reporting panel, which will be responsible for the oversight of audit standard setting and auditor independence issues. Under this legislation, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission will be given the power to issue an infringement notice containing a financial penalty to a disclosing entity where ASIC has grounds to believe the entity has breached its continuous disclosure obligations. We are hoping that ASIC takes this very seriously, because this is part of the problem that has existed in the major downfall of companies in the very recent past.</para><para>Members and shareholders will be informed of the details of directors' and executives' remuneration in the annual directors' report, as this legislation requires. The disclosure will be contained in a clearly marked section of the report, not hidden at the back of the report somewhere in the fine print that nobody can see or understand. Under the changes, shareholders will be able to comment on the content of the report and vote on a non-binding resolution to adopt the remuneration disclosures. The opportunity for shareholders to vote on issues surrounding directors' and executives' remuneration enables the voices of shareholders to be communicated to the board of directors at a general meeting. It will assist directors to assess in a more accurate manner the opinion of shareholders. </para><para>Shareholders have a right to an opinion. After all, it is their money that is in management and caretaker mode. The vote is advisory only, and it still recognises the responsibility of directors to determine their executive remuneration. As is the current situation under the Corporations Act, directors and senior managers will be required to disclose information on their remuneration. These disclosure requirements will be extended to apply to the corporate group, and in this respect disclosure of the top five senior managers in the group will also be required.</para><para>There is widespread support within the community for the changes outlined in this legislation. I do not know how many people have come through my office and put papers on my desk. They have been really concerned about how their money is being dealt with and the major issues that have confronted corporations, particularly in the last two to three years. There is an enormous amount of support, which would ensure better information for shareholders and the general public. It will also mean better accountability for directors and executives, whose roles within public companies will be closely examined.</para><para>One of the earlier speakers said that Australia is now leading the world in having mum and dad shareholders. The economic climate has changed, expectations have changed and, perhaps, the amount of knowledge has changed. Smaller shareholders need to gain better knowledge, and reporting procedures from corporations must be in a commonsense form to ensure that investors read and understand the obligations of the company and understand how their money is being looked after and distributed. By monitoring companies' financial statements, those monitoring the market can be assured that these statements are reliable and credible. It will help avoid a repeat of the corporate collapses we have witnessed in recent years.</para><para>While some sectors of the business community may object to the changes, it is important to be aware that this legislation incorporates recommendations from the HIH and Cole royal commissions. The intent of these commissions was to investigate what had occurred within these companies and to recommend ways in which past, present and future governments, and the business community, could prevent such events occurring again. By implementing these changes, which reflect community sentiment, the government will bring Australia's regulatory framework into line with world best practice.</para><para>We all want Australia's economy to continue to develop, which brings great benefit to all Australians. The growth and development of our biggest companies, which employ hundreds of thousands of everyday Australians, makes an important contribution to our entire economy—and I am certainly not underrating that at all. However, we should make sure that we are receiving correct and true information about the state of our publicly listed companies and about the people who are in charge of the money of the Australian people. I sincerely support this legislation and I commend it to those on the other side of the House. With their support we will ensure that the small mums and dads of Australia are protected.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>24838</page.no><name role="metadata">Georgiou, Petro, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GEORGIOU</name><name.id>HM5</name.id><electorate>Kooyong</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I speak in support of the <inline ref="R1959">Corporate Law Economic Reform Program (Audit Reform and Corporate Disclosure) Bill 2003 </inline>and the<inline ref="R1959"></inline><inline ref="R1711">Corporations (Fees) Amendment Bill 2003.</inline> This is the ninth instalment in the government's comprehensive program of corporate and business regulation reform that began in 1997. By strengthening the financial reporting and corporate disclosure processes and responsibilities, the provisions in this legislation seek to increase confidence in the framework that governs the operation and conduct of Australian markets and those involved in them. This legislation will amend the Corporations Act 2001 and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001. Its underlying objective is to promote transparency, accountability and shareholder involvement. These are the three main themes that I will concentrate on today because they are basic to sound, progressive corporate and business regulation.</para></talk.start><para>This legislation reflects the government's commitment and ability to find solutions to existing difficulties, to be flexible, to adjust to emerging problems and to provide leadership in establishing legislative frameworks to stimulate growth and employment. It is also a reflection of the government's consultative approach to reform in this area.</para><para>With input from the Business Regulation Advisory Group and more than 50 submissions responding to the draft legislation released for public consultation last October, the legislation now before the House has taken into account many views. As a consequence, regulatory structures will be made more modern, stronger and more flexible, without burdening business with unnecessary regulation. Significantly, the reforms being proposed in this legislation incorporate recommendations of the Ramsay report, <inline font-style="italic">Independence of Australian company auditors</inline>, as well as a number of recommendations from both the HIH and Cole royal commissions. Without traversing the details of those commissions, in large part they form the context of the need to address concerns about transparency and accountability—concerns which can undermine confidence in the information being provided to the markets.</para><para>I would like to turn my attention to elements of the legislation which can be categorised as dealing with transparency, accountability and shareholder involvement. Audited financial statements are an important part of the financial information available to capital markets and an essential element of effective corporate governance. The sound operation of Australia's financial markets is dependent upon parties such as auditors providing information or services to investors free from any bias, undue influence or conflict of interest. If shareholders and investors lose confidence in the market because the people they rely upon do not act independently, this will have a detrimental impact on investment levels and the efficient operation of the market.</para><para>Major corporate collapses, most notably HIH here in Australia and, of course, Enron in the United States, have created widespread concern about the efficacy of the audit function, including about the independence of auditors. This legislation introduces a number of measures to enhance auditor independence, which is fundamental to accountability and transparency. These measures will serve to improve both actual independence and—no less importantly—the perception of independence. This will promote confidence in the efficacy of information upon which investors and shareholders make decisions.</para><para>Importantly, the measures in the legislation include, but are not limited to, the introduction of a general requirement of auditor independence as a legal obligation in the Corporations Act; the introduction of restrictions on specific employment and financial relationships between auditors and their clients; the imposition of waiting periods before auditors may join an audit client as a director or a senior manager; the requirement for listed companies to disclose in their annual directors' report the fees paid to the auditor for non-audit services and a description of those services; and the requirement that chief executive officers and chief financial officers each certify to the board of directors that financial statements are in accordance with the Corporations Act and accounting standards. In relation to the restrictions on specific employment and financial relationships between auditors and their clients, the legislation draws on recommendations from the HIH royal commission. Overlying these initiatives is a compliance and oversight regime to ensure the self-regulatory mechanism of the audit profession is both appropriate and adequate.</para><para>There are concerns across the community that minimal oversight of the profession by government authorities does not promote independence or the perception of independence. To address these concerns, the government is acting to expand the role of the Financial Reporting Council to oversee and monitor auditor independence. The government's commitment to the implementation of the reforms is evidenced by a $16.3 million allocation to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the Financial Reporting Council. Of this, $12.3 million will be provided to ASIC over four years to enable it to conduct surveillance, investigate and take enforcement action in relation to alleged contraventions of the CLERP 9 provisions. The Financial Reporting Council will receive $4 million over four years so it can expand its role to include the oversight of audit standard setting and auditor independence, as outlined in the legislation.</para><para>Community concerns also extend to the extent to which shareholders have the opportunity to question auditors and those to whom the auditors are responsible. Allowing investors to have the opportunity to ask questions enhances investor confidence through accountability and transparency. Accordingly, the legislation requires the auditors of listed companies or their representatives to attend company annual general meetings. Members of a listed company will have the right to ask questions of auditors from the floor of an annual general meeting. Shareholders will also have the right to submit written questions to the auditors about the content of an audit report or the conduct of an audit. The auditor will be required to prepare a list of questions submitted and provide the list to the company for the company to make available to shareholders attending the annual general meeting.</para><para>The importance of these reforms and the need for confidence in the operation of the markets is underscored by the fact that more Australians than ever before have a financial interest in the share market. Australia now has one of the highest share market participation rates per capita of any country in the developed world. A flood of so-called mum and dad investors have bought into companies, predominantly through initial public offerings and via the growth in financial services generally and managed investment funds in particular. There is no doubt that each and every one of these investors should have access to relevant information that is timely and usable, as well as the ability to assess and influence the performance of a company board at general meetings of corporations. To that end, this legislation requires the annual directors' report to include an operating and financial review containing information that members of a company would reasonably require in order to make an informed judgment about the operations, financial position and future strategies of the company involved.</para><para>Having said that, it is important to ensure that the right balance is struck between transparency and overprescription. In particular, in relation to the future strategies of a company, consideration must be given to the competitive environment in which listed companies operate. Accordingly, companies will be allowed to omit information about their business strategies for the future and prospects for future financial years if the material would result in unreasonable prejudice to the company. However, the fact that omissions had been made would have to be disclosed. This is important because we need to ensure that flexible arrangements are in place to take account of potential changes in the corporate environment in the future.</para><para>Remuneration policy has been the subject of much community debate across a number of areas. In some notable cases, there has been community anger in recent years. This legislation will require that executives' and directors' remuneration becomes a mandatory and clearly dedicated inclusion in the annual directors' report. Shareholders will be given the opportunity to comment on this at the annual general meeting and to vote on a non-binding resolution regarding remuneration policy. It is important that shareholders be in a position to actively participate in an informed manner in order to make boards accountable for their decisions. Consequently, the reforms being proposed will extend the requirements for directors' and senior managers' remuneration disclosure to include consolidated entities as well as listed companies. This is directed at providing a better picture of remuneration practices across the corporate group and preventing corporate structures from being used to circumvent reporting requirements.</para><para>Under this legislation, the remuneration of the five most highly paid senior managers and all directors of a listed company will have to be disclosed. Similarly, the remuneration of the top five senior managers in a consolidated entity will have to be disclosed. This is not just about nominal disclosure but to ensure that disclosure is relevant, comprehensive and meaningful. As a minimum, remuneration disclosures must include primary benefits including cash and other incentive and base payments, post-employment benefits including retirement benefits, and equity compensation and other compensation benefits.</para><para>The other significant issue that has raised the ire of the community on several occasions over the past few years is the size of termination payments and the manner in which they have been made. As a general rule, this legislation will prevent a payment being made in connection with retirement from a board or managerial office until shareholder approval is obtained.</para><para>Together, the changes that I have spoken about will enable shareholders to have greater access to relevant information about the operations and policies of the companies in which they have invested and will give them greater voice in influencing the decisions of these companies. I believe that shareholders and the community at large will be reassured about the operations of the markets in Australia as a consequence of the measures contained in these bills. I commend the bills to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>24841</page.no><name role="metadata">Costello, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr COSTELLO</name><name.id>CT4</name.id><electorate>Higgins</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—in reply—In winding up debate on the <inline ref="R1959">Corporate Law Economic Reform Program (Audit Reform and Corporate Disclosure) Bill 2003</inline> and the <inline ref="R1962">Corporations (Fees) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2003</inline>, I thank all honourable members who have participated in the debate for their contribution. I believe the debate has been of a high standard and it is one of those areas where, although it is quite technical, the public has a vital interest. I appreciate the comments that members have made in relation to this legislation.</para></talk.start><para>This is significant legislation. As I indicated in the second reading speech, it is the ninth stage in our Corporate Law Economic Reform Program, and it builds on previous reform measures in areas of accounting standards, directors' duties, fundraising, takeovers and financial services reform. The legislation contains significant measures covering financial reporting and corporate disclosure, and its provisions will achieve better disclosure outcomes, enhance auditor independence and improve enforcement arrangements in the event of corporate misbehaviour. The legislation generally implements the reforms proposed in the CLERP 9 policy proposal paper, which included the government's response to the recommendations of the Ramsay report, <inline font-style="italic">Independence of Australian company auditors</inline>, and it also reflects the outcome of subsequent consultations. In addition, the legislation takes account of relevant recommendations of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit Report 391: <inline font-style="italic">Review of independent auditing by registered company auditors</inline> and the HIH and Cole royal commissions.</para><para>The reforms in this legislation will see the Financial Reporting Council assume responsibility for oversight of setting Australia's auditing standards and the monitoring of auditor independence. As part of these reforms, Australia's auditing standards will be given force of law. To facilitate the implementation of this policy, the legislation contains transitional arrangements whereby auditing standards that have been issued by or on behalf of Australia's professional accounting bodies will be given immediate legal backing. The objective of this provision is to provide a seamless transfer from the existing regime under which standards are enforced through the professional codes of accounting bodies and the new arrangements. </para><para>The requirements for independence of auditors from the entities they audit are being strengthened in line with recent initiatives in Europe and North America. These reforms include a general standard of independence and a requirement that auditors provide directors with an annual independence declaration; a prohibition on a number of specific employment and financial relationships between auditors and their clients which are considered to compromise independence; a waiting period of two years, which will apply to partners of an audit firm or directors of an audit company directly involved in an audit before they can take up a directorship or senior management position with the audit client; and a requirement for auditor rotation after five consecutive years.</para><para>The purpose of the continuous disclosure requirements is to ensure that investors have timely and equal access to materially price sensitive information about securities traded on secondary markets. This should ensure that the price of securities reflects their underlying value. While the continuous disclosure framework is basically sound and working well, we believe a number of changes are needed to enhance its effectiveness. The amendments included in the legislation will empower ASIC to issue infringement notices to disclosing entities for breach of the continuous disclosure requirements. In addition, people involved in a contravention of those requirements will be subject to a civil penalty, and the civil penalty which can be imposed on bodies corporate for contravention of the market misconduct provisions will be increased.</para><para>The legislation also introduces a number of measures designed to enhance transparency and accountability in relation to decisions surrounding directors' and executives' remuneration. Under one of these measures, details of directors' and executives' remuneration will need to be disclosed clearly in a marked section of the annual directors report. Shareholders will be given an opportunity to comment on the content of the report and vote on a non-binding resolution to adopt the remuneration disclosures.</para><para>The concept of a non-binding shareholder vote is new in the Corporations Act; as such, there are no legal precedents for the consequences where directors do not act in accordance with a non-binding resolution. Prior to proceeding with this proposal, the government sought legal advice from the Australian Government Solicitor. The Australian Government Solicitor advised that the failure of directors to abide by a non-binding resolution of shareholders could not, of itself, constitute a breach of directors' duties. This is consistent with the government's intention that a non-binding vote be advisory only. A provision to make it clear that the vote is not binding on the directors or the company has also been included in the legislation.</para><para>The introduction of proportionate liability in schedule 3 of the legislation fulfils the Commonwealth's commitment in relation to one of the key measures on which all governments in Australia have agreed, in order to improve the availability and affordability of professional indemnity insurance. A financial reporting panel will be established to provide an alternative, non-binding dispute resolution mechanism where a company and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission differ on the application of accounting standards and the true and fair requirement in the Corporations Act. The <inline ref="R1962">Corporations (Fees) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2003</inline> has also been introduced into this House to allow fees to be charged where companies refer matters to the financial reporting panel.</para><para>I would like to take this opportunity to respond to a number of remarks made by speakers during the debate. I am pleased that the opposition appreciates the importance of accurate and timely disclosure to the market. This is fundamental to the objectives of the CLERP 9 legislation. Let me make some observations on some other matters which have arisen during the debate—first, in relation to executive remuneration. Regulations specifying the remuneration disclosure requirements will be available to interested stakeholders prior to being finalised. The regulation-making power under the legislation is broad enough to cover many of the opposition proposals.</para><para>The government has, on many occasions, noted the importance of a co-regulatory approach and has looked to the ASX Corporate Governance Council as a source of best practice guidance. The council has put in place strong requirements that can more quickly adapt to changes in shareholder expectations than legislation would otherwise be able to do. The government will examine the amendments to the legislation foreshadowed by the opposition but, as its starting point, the government will pursue its objectives—the objectives of achieving an appropriate balance between directors' and the executives' ability to exercise judgment and due process for shareholders, a balance which we believe this legislation has obtained.</para><para>I turn now to audit reform. The opposition has foreshadowed that it will move amendments to the legislation to prohibit auditors providing non-audit services. The legislation requires disclosure of non-audit services, rather than imposing a prohibition on these services. This recognises that there are circumstances in which non-audit services may be beneficially provided by a company auditor. Given the small size of the Australian accounting services market, a prohibition on auditor provided non-audit services may have negative competitive consequences for access to legitimate non-audit services. I note the opposition's intention to insert the HIH recommendation that a four-year cooling off period apply before an auditor directly involved in the audit can join the audit company as a director or in a senior management position. The government included such a requirement in the CLERP 9 bill, released for consultation in October 2003. It was in the light of significant concerns raised in submissions to the government that we implemented the original CLERP proposal. In particular, the four-year cooling-off period was considered to go far beyond international best practice and had the potential to shrink the pool of experts with accounting experience able to serve on company boards.</para><para>I note the opposition has foreshadowed a number of amendments relating to shareholder participation. The government considers that informed participation by shareholders is a key plank of corporate governance. However, the government does not consider that the best way of encouraging informed participation is to introduce a raft of new mandatory requirements. Some of the ground sought to be covered by the opposition proposal on shareholder participation is covered by accepted industry standards such as the corporate governance guidelines released by the Australian Stock Exchange. A legislative approach introduces unnecessary legal complexity and uncertainty.</para><para>The opposition's proposal to introduce a law providing for a non-binding vote by shareholders in relation to persons holding more than one share position will not necessarily address the problem. It is an issue of commitment, and is not resolved by an arbitrary rule. Further, mandatory voting by a superannuation fund does not guarantee informed participation; it may just encourage arbitrary uninformed voting.</para><para>This legislation provides that a person who is involved in a disclosing entity's contravention of the continuous disclosure provisions contravenes the Corporations Act. This is a civil penalty provision. It is not the government's intention that a person who has taken all reasonable steps to comply with their individual responsibility should be liable for contravening the act. It is the government's intention that the showing of due diligence by persons in relation to this responsibility should be a defence. I indicate to the House that the government will ensure—if necessary, by amendment in the Senate—that that is the outcome of these provisions. The defence would operate so that an individual would not be personally liable where a breach of the continuous disclosure obligation occurs where the person took all reasonable steps to ensure that the disclosing entity complied with its continuous disclosure obligations and, after doing so, believed on reasonable grounds that the disclosing entity had complied with its obligations. The approach is modelled on a similar defence applying in relation to the prospectus provisions of the act.</para><para>I would like to thank the various bodies and organisations that contributed to the development of the legislation we have been debating today, both in terms of their input during the refining of the government's policy proposals and their comments on the detail of the draft legislation. I would like to thank my parliamentary secretary, the member for Parramatta, who is in the House today, for the assistance he has given in relation to this. I would also like to pay tribute to my former parliamentary secretary, now the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads, Senator Ian Campbell, who was so involved in the drawing and consultation in relation to this legislation.</para><para>Finally, I would like to acknowledge the invaluable guidance and advice that has been provided by members of the government's Business Regulation Advisory Group during the formulation of the CLERP 9 proposals and the subsequent drafting of the legislation. I believe that this legislation represents world's best practice in relation to corporate governance. We are recognised as leaders in this field and we will continue to be path breakers. We will make sure that Australia has a system of corporate governance and corporate law which compares favourably with that of all the other jurisdictions of the world.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>24844</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Mr COSTELLO (Higgins—Treasurer) (7.37 p.m.)—by leave—I move:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a third time.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a third time.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>CORPORATIONS (FEES) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>24844</page.no><id.no>R1962</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>24844</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 4 December 2003, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ross Cameron</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>24844</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Mr COSTELLO (Higgins—Treasurer) (7.38 p.m.)—by leave—I move:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a third time.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a third time.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (BETTER BARGAINING) BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>24844</page.no><id.no>R1921</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>24844</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 6 November 2003, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Andrews</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>24844</page.no><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Dr EMERSON</name><name.id>83V</name.id><electorate>Rankin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The government's favoured consultant, George Orwell, is at it again. He has advised the government to call a bill which is designed effectively to remove the capacity of working Australians to take industrial action the <inline ref="R1921">Workplace Relations Amendment (Better Bargaining) Bill 2003</inline>. It in fact should be called the `no bargaining bill' but if this legislation was called by its proper name then all Australians would understand the agenda of this government: to remove any capacity of working Australians to withdraw their labour. The bill has one aim and one aim only: that is, to remove the remaining bargaining power of working Australians in their negotiations with their employers—to take industrial action.</para></talk.start><para>It is the most vicious bill since 1996, when the government introduced its first wave of industrial relations legislation. But this vicious bill is not sponsored by Peter Reith, the former minister of balaclava and Rottweiler notoriety, nor is this bill sponsored by that right wing extremist, the current Minister for Health and Ageing. No, this is the work of the present workplace relations minister; all his own work.

One of the precepts of the Catholic Church is that working Australians and working people around the world should have the right to withdraw their labour in the event of protracted disputes with their employer. But that is not the case as far as this particular minister is concerned. The fact is this minister is just as extreme and just as vicious as his predecessors in relation to the industrial relations framework of this country.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The fact of the matter is in the vast majority of cases industrial action is taken because employees have reached an impasse in negotiation with their employer and they feel so strongly about an issue that they are prepared to sacrifice wages and withdraw their labour. This has been a right of working Australians for more than 100 years. Rarely does anyone take industrial action because they enjoy it. It is normally taken as a last resort. They sacrifice pay; they take great risks. This government is seeking to withdraw that basic right, which is enjoyed as a right in all countries of the Western world.</para><para>The fact that working Australians do not take industrial action lightly is borne out by the government's own statistics, which show that industrial disputation in this country is at very low levels. Under the previous Labor government it fell year after year; under this government it has remained at low levels. So why introduce a bill that seeks to withdraw the right of working Australians to take industrial action? The answer does not lie in the realities of workplaces and the industrial relations environment in this country; the answer lies in this government's philosophy.</para><para>The philosophy of this government is to pit a single employee with weak bargaining power against powerful employers with strong bargaining power. That is what this government means when it talks about deregulation of the labour market. It puts deregulation of the labour market forward as some virtue. But when you ask the government what it means by deregulation of the labour market, you find it means removing the right of working Australians to be able to withdraw their labour in the event of a very difficult and protracted disagreement with their employer. An essential part of modern collective bargaining systems around the Western world is the right to take legally protected industrial action in specified circumstances. But if this bill were enacted it would almost entirely remove that right.</para><para>Similar provisions have been proposed before and defeated in the Senate. I cite, by way of example, the 1999 second wave of industrial relations legislation. That legislation was rejected by the Senate because it was regarded as unfair to working Australians. But this government will never relent. The legislation will come back in one guise or another as the government seeks continually to erode the capacity of working Australians to bargain collectively and to withdraw their labour if they consider that the employer is treating them unfairly.</para><para>I want to summarise certain aspects of this legislation. The bill gives third parties who might be affected by industrial action unprecedented power to apply to end that action—not parties who will be affected but parties who might be affected; and we are not talking about parties to the dispute but third parties. Under this legislation anyone who might be affected by actual or proposed industrial action would be able to apply to the Industrial Relations Commission for a suspension of the bargaining period, therefore making the withdrawing of labour unlawful. </para><para>We have heard from the previous minister for workplace relations that we must always be honest and uphold the rule of law. This is the minister who created a secret slush fund called Australians for Honest Politics and lied about it. He says that we must always uphold the rule of law, but this government wants to create a law where essentially it is impossible for an employee to withdraw his or her labour.

This legislation does not allow any industrial action during the life of an agreement or where the subject matter of the dispute is not covered by the agreement; this is designed to override Federal Court decisions which allow such protected action. The legislation also introduces cooling-off periods. By that, I mean that the bill gives the Industrial Relations Commission new power to suspend bargaining periods in a wide range of circumstances.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The fact is that the bill does not help to resolve disputes. The bill does nothing to assist parties who are seeking to resolve a dispute; it simply makes it almost impossible to take protected industrial action. The bill takes away the right to take industrial action and does not resolve any outstanding issues between the employer and employees. It does not give the commission greater power to conciliate and arbitrate in disputes to resolve matters. Of course it does not give the commission that power, because that power was removed in the first wave of industrial relations legislation in 1996. If this government were fair dinkum about seeking to reduce the incidence of industrial disput-ation, it would re-empower the inde-pendent umpire, the Industrial Relations Commis-sion, to resolve disputes where the parties cannot resolve them. Instead, this govern-ment through this legislation seeks to inflame disputes.</para><para>It is worth this parliament considering what sort of reforms would help to resolve disputes. The bargaining system contained in the Workplace Relations Act could be improved by a couple of measures: first, by restoring a requirement on the parties to bargain in good faith; and, second, by giving the commission greater power to resolve industrial disputes that are intractable. Both of these are Labor policies. A requirement to bargain in good faith is contained in a private member's bill that has been introduced in this parliament but opposed by this government. You have to question the sincerity of this government when Labor introduces a requirement on the parties to bargain in good faith and the government indicates it will not support such a provision. We know that this government is completely hostile to the idea of re-empowering the independent umpire, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, to resolve intractable industrial disputes. These are Labor policies that are totally opposed by this government.</para><para>Let us examine the genesis of this bill. Why did the government decide, through the current minister for workplace relations, to come up with legislation that makes it virtually impossible to take industrial action? All workplaces relying on the federal Workplace Relations Act for their bargaining framework would be affected by this bill. But, astonishingly, in his second reading speech the minister specifically targets caring professions such as health, community services and education. The minister in his speech said:</para><quote><para>This bill also seeks to address the harm that some industrial action causes third parties. Industrial action by negotiating parties can impact upon, or aim to harm, third parties who are not directly involved in the dispute—for example the clients of health, community services and education systems and other businesses. </para></quote><para>So, although this legislation applies to all working Australians who are in the federal industrial relations system, the government has gone to the length of identifying its specific targets—they are nurses, hospital workers, school teachers, university academics, child-care workers and aged-care workers. I ask: why would the government seek to attack the caring professions in this country? Why would the government seek to attack nurses, teachers, academics, child-care workers and aged-care workers? This is an astonishing piece of legislation—but that is what this minister is doing.</para><para>Last year the then workplace relations minister, now the health minister, suggested at a conference that rural nurses should be paid less than city nurses. I am sure the member for Hunter would have a view about the idea that nurses in the Hunter Valley should be paid less than nurses in Sydney. But that is what the then workplace relations minister said—that there is an argument for workers in rural and regional Australia to be paid less than their city counterparts. The member for Dawson is sitting at the table opposite. I wonder whether the member for Dawson has a view and whether she shares the view of the current health minister and then minister for workplace relations as to whether nurses in her own electorate should be paid less than nurses in Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne. You would think that the member for Dawson would stand up for nurses in her own area.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>FK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Kelly, De-Anne, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs De-Anne Kelly</name></talker><para>—I did!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83V</name.id><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Dr EMERSON</name></talker><para>—She said that she did stand up for nurses in her own area. I hope she speaks on this legislation, because nurses in rural and regional Australia should be defended, as should nurses all around this country, instead of being attacked by the present health minister—the previous minister for workplace relations—and by the current minister for workplace relations, who specifically identified nurses and other hospital workers as the targets of this legislation. The current workplace relations minister is specifically targeting the caring professions. This is the only bill out of the 14 industrial relations bills that have been sloshing around in this parliament that this current minister did not inherit. The other 13 were introduced either by Peter Reith, the former minister, or more recently by the former workplace relations minister who is now the health minister. But this bill is all his own work—that is, the present minister for workplace relations introduced this legislation.</para></talk.start></continue><para>But just as this government is targeting nurses, so too it is targeting teachers. We know that the Howard government thinks that government teachers are wrong and are being politically correct in teaching values such as tolerance. The current minister for health condemned teachers in Australia for teaching tolerance. He said a few weeks ago in defending the Prime Minister's attack on government schools that teachers are being politically correct in teaching such values as tolerance. When the interviewer said, `But isn't tolerance a good value?' he said, `Well, it might be a good value, but sometimes teachers are trying to get the students to tolerate the intolerable.' So we know one of the values that the Liberal Party does not support is tolerance in this country, and to them it does make sense, when you now look at this legislation, that the legislation is targeted at teachers in government schools—because the government regards it as wrong for teachers to inculcate in their students the value of tolerance.</para><para>Let us examine for the moment how this bill would work. Legally protected industrial action generally occurs when a union takes a number of procedural steps on behalf of the employees at a workplace. First, it has to initiate a bargaining period by giving seven days written notice to an employer. If negotiations reach an impasse and employees want to take industrial action, the union or the employees then give written notice of their intention to take protected industrial action. This notice must be given at least three days before the action takes place. There are no surprises in any of this. These restrictions are meant to balance the competing interests of giving employers enough notice of industrial action but not so much notice that the action becomes totally ineffectual. It seems like a pretty fair system. But the government regards it as unfair because it still contains the right of working Australians to withdraw their labour.</para><para>Whether or not industrial action occurs, a bargaining period usually continues until an agreement is reached. A bargaining period can also be suspended or terminated by the Industrial Relations Commission in certain specified circumstances. If a bargaining period is suspended or terminated, protected industrial action can no longer occur. What is wrong with that system? What is unfair about those arrangements? This government considers that it is wrong for working Australians to even have the capacity to withdraw their labour. This bill would substantially expand the power of the commission to suspend a bargaining period by allowing anyone directly affected by the action to apply for a suspension, and that in turn would take away any capacity for employees to take protected industrial action. These third parties who could apply for a suspension of the bargaining period could potentially include businesses such as suppliers or individuals such as patients, students, clients, customers or passengers in a public transport system.</para><para>In considering whether to suspend a bargaining period, the commission would then consider whether the action is threatening to cause significant harm to any person, taking account of the following sorts of matters: the extent to which the person is particularly vulnerable to the effects of the action; the damage to various aspects of the viability of a business, including contractual arrangements; and economic loss. This bill would greatly extend the current provisions, which allow a bargaining period to be suspended only in limited circumstances. These circumstances are: first, if parties are not genuinely trying to reach agreement or have failed to comply with directions; and, second, if the industrial action endangers the life, health or welfare of the population or part of the population or if it would cause significant damage to the economy. The current provisions are, by any reasonable standard, fair. The government has said time and time again that industrial disputation in this country has fallen since it was elected. It fell in each and every year of the previous Labor government, so what is the problem? What is it that the government is seeking to achieve here? It is seeking to achieve the removal of the capacity of working Australians to withdraw their labour in the event of a true disagreement with their employer.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>8K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Fitzgibbon</name></talker><para>—If you are locked out are you counted as taking industrial action?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83V</name.id><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Dr EMERSON</name></talker><para>—The member for Hunter has asked whether you are counted as taking industrial action if you are locked out. The answer, of course, is no. But in relation to Geelong Wool Combing, which had one of the many nasty lockouts that have occurred in this country over the last few months—and I know a bad lockout has occurred in the Hunter Valley—the Treasurer said that the workers were taking industrial action. They were locked out of the premises where they worked, and the Treasurer of this country said that they were taking industrial action. They were basically minding their own business, but they were locked out with no pay and were being starved into submission, which is a standard tactic in lockouts. I know the member for Hunter has direct experience of this. But of course the government regards an employer refusing to let his or her employees through the gate to do their work as the employees taking industrial action. That is the perspective of this government.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This is a nasty and vicious piece of legislation. Labor will oppose it with every capacity that we can and with every power of persuasion in the Senate, because this is a watershed in the industrial relations environment of this country. Here we are in 2004 with a government in a modern Australian economy trying to legislate to withdraw the right of working Australians to take industrial action. It is the most vicious piece of industrial relations legislation introduced by the Howard government since the 1996 first wave of industrial relations legislation. It seeks to achieve the Prime Minister's dream of pitting a single powerless employee against a powerful employer—a powerless employee with no bargaining power against a powerful employer with strong bargaining power. This is the Prime Minister's dream; this is what the Prime Minister means by labour market deregulation.</para><para>In parliament today the Prime Minister attacked the Labor Party for sticking up for the right of working Australians to seek a better life, better wages and better working conditions. If that capacity had never been given to working Australians, they would be working eight, 10 or 12 hours a day, there would be no sick pay, there would be no holiday pay and there would be no parental leave—and, if this Prime Minister had his way, there would be no maternity leave. The fact of the matter is that the Prime Minister is trying to realise his dream through this legislation.</para><para>And who has he got supporting him, taking this legislation through the parliament? A man who owes his parliamentary career to the Prime Minister—that is, the current Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, a man who owes his promotion to the Prime Minister. This minister has never for a moment stopped and thought, `What about the working poor? What about the vulnerable in this country?' He has persisted with great energy and zealotry in pursuing each and every one of the 13 bills that were introduced by his predecessors, and now he has his chance to impress the Prime Minister with his very own bill, a bill that would withdraw the right of working Australians to take industrial action. It is all the minister's own work, and he is seeking every day to impress the Prime Minister and outmuscle his two nasty predecessors.</para><para>It is legislation that specifically targets nurses, teachers, child-care workers and aged-care workers. What has this government got against nurses, teachers, child-care workers and aged-care workers? Why did the government specifically identify members of the caring professions as the targets of this legislation? The legislation applies to each and every working Australian in this country, but the government is targeting nurses. We know that nurses are regarded as angels—and so they should be. In our country, nurses perform a marvellous role, often for not great pay and for working conditions that are very onerous. They do it because they are called to the profession and they believe in and value the work that they do.</para><para>But this government does not value the work of nurses. We know that because the current health minister believes that nurses in rural and regional Australia should be paid less than nurses in metropolitan Australia. We know that because the Treasurer of this country has indicated that he believes that everyone working in rural and regional Australia should be paid less than those working in metropolitan Australia. This government refuses to recognise the wonderful work that our caring professions do. Instead, it wants to vilify them, for reasons best known to it. I would certainly urge members of the nursing profession in this country to make clear to the government just how it feels about a government that has specifically targeted them in this the most vicious industrial relations legislation since 1996.</para><para>The Labor Party will strenuously oppose this bill. We will use every persuasive capacity that we have at our disposal to convince the Democrats, the Greens and the Independents in the Senate that this bill must be rejected. The government has put it forward under the banner of labour market deregulation, but all Australians should understand what this government means by that. It means that working Australians would have no bargaining power whatsoever; under this legislation they would not have the capacity, in the event of a disagreement with the employer that they could not resolve, to withdraw their labour. Surely that is the inalienable right of every working Australian. Are they going to be conscripted to the workplace by this government, conscripted to accept each and every condition that the employer imposes upon them and conscripted to accept the removal of basic working conditions that have been built up in this country—in a decent, civilised society—over 100 years?</para><para>Why is this government so ideologically obsessed with stripping away the wages and conditions of working Australians? The answer is that the government is seeking to enter vulnerable working Australians into a race to the bottom, competing on wage costs against the countries of East Asia. This is a race that we should never have entered. It is a race that we should never want to win. But I can assure everyone who would be affected by this bill that Labor will enter them into a new race—a race to the top, a race on the high road of high skills and high wages—because it is only on the basis of our skills and our ideas that we will be able to compete with other countries. We should never seek to compete with the countries of East Asia on wage costs and by stripping away working conditions that have been built up over 100 years. We should never seek to compete against the countries of East Asia by tearing away the safety net that protects vulnerable Australians from falling to the floor.</para><para>The government talks about a safety net in relation to Medicare, but of course it does not support a safety net in relation to vulnerable Australians. What it wants to do is make sure that working Australians do not have the skills or the bargaining capacity to stand up in a negotiation with their employer to seek the maintenance—and, over time, the improvement—of their wages and working conditions. This is a basic precept of the Catholic Church, it is a basic precept of every religion that I know of, and it is certainly the basic precept of a civilised society, yet this government has introduced the most vicious piece of industrial relations legislation since 1996.</para><para>It seems that the government introduced this legislation when it felt that it was on a roll. But I can tell this government that the working men and women of Australia, when they fully appreciate the dimensions of this legislation, will rise up against this government for introducing this legislation. The nurses of Australia will certainly become acutely aware of this government targeting them in the most vicious and venal way. Labor will use every resource at its disposal to oppose this bill and convince everyone in the Senate that it is un-Australian, uncivilised and completely unacceptable.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>24851</page.no><name role="metadata">Randall, Don, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RANDALL</name><name.id>PK6</name.id><electorate>Canning</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1921">Workplace Relations Amendment (Better Bargaining) Bill 2003</inline>. What a vitriolic set of weasel words was delivered in this House a moment ago. It is unbelievable that somebody could stand there and say what the member for Rankin said with a straight face, trying to pretend that what he said was somehow moral and right. He is here because his bosses have put him here to come out with that sort of mantra, which is garbage, quite frankly. What he said in this House today is largely untrue, as I will illustrate shortly. He filibustered towards the end of his speech because he wanted to pad out the time, but the core of his whole argument was that the right to strike is being removed. That is not true at all. The right to strike is not being removed under the provisions of the agreements made. If somebody makes an agreement for their employment, they sign on to the agreement for its duration. They cannot then vary the terms and conditions. But the member for Rankin wants to go halfway through the exercise and then say, `No, we want to change our minds.' How do you run a workplace like that? He would not run a workplace like that, because he has probably never had a real job in his life.</para></talk.start><para>The member for Rankin's personal attacks are unbelievable. Every time he comes in here he attacks Peter Reith and Tony Abbott, former workplace relations ministers. Now he is attacking the current workplace relations minister, Kevin Andrews—for some reason, his Catholicism is a problem to the member for Rankin. It is unbelievable. He mentions the fact that the minister is a Catholic every time. Catholics of Australia, please believe that the member for Rankin has some problem. The minister that we are talking about is one of the most decent men in this country, and he is at home. I have to tell you that he is one of the most decent men you will find in this parliament. To attack him personally, as the member for Rankin has done, is a disgrace. At the end of the day, you really should attack the arguments, not the people. Every time the member for Rankin comes in here he gets stuck into those three people personally and gets off the argument, generally because he has run out of arguments and he is filibustering. That is what happened again in this place today.</para><para>I look forward to the debate on the next bill on the program, when the member for Rankin will stand up and do the same thing. He rolls out the same old thing every time. I will also roll out the same thing every time—the fact is that this man is here because he has been put here by the union bosses. His preselection was organised that way. As a result, he has to kowtow to them. He got this job because he is the biggest forelock tugger for the unions in this place. As a result, he has to do what they tell him to do, and that is to oppose every workplace relations reform in this country. He has already said that any bills that come into this House, particularly from the former minister, Tony Abbott, will be opposed. He had not seen half of them, but he said, `We are going to oppose them.' What sort of debate and argument is that—to have that as the basis on which you come into this House and oppose something?</para><para>The current Leader of the Opposition, the member for Werriwa, has said: `We are going to cut that out. We are going to look at these things on their issues; we're not just going to oppose for opportunism's sake.' That is all out the window. The Leader of the Opposition has forgotten that. He certainly has not instructed the member for Rankin not to oppose for opportunism's sake, because he does it every time he stands up. His currency and his legitimacy on this basis is diluted, because he has pre-empted what he is going to say every time he gets up and opposes these things. I say to the member for Rankin: you are a disgrace when it comes to workplace relations, because you are a puppet of the unions in this House, and everybody knows it. Everybody knows that you are the biggest forelock tugger to the union movement in this country. You got here because they put you here. So of course you have to earn your keep, and that is what you are going to do every time you get to your feet.</para><para>Removing strikes only happens in this current legislation when you have signed an award. Once an agreement has been negotiated, the parties are expected to stick to it. It is bad form in any sort of business to sign an agreement and then try to walk away from it in the middle of it. The member for Rankin went on about the toothless Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Some time later he said, `But the Industrial Relations Commission can do this.' On the one hand he said they were strong and good enough and on the other hand he said they had been neutered. You cannot have it both ways. If you have a dispute resolution and you want to take it to the AIRC, you can have it negotiated and arbitrated on. All the mixed messages, verbalising and base untruths that were delivered by the shadow minister in this House today have to be examined for what they are. They are not true.</para><para>As I said, strikes during the period of the agreement are unprotected, so they are illegal. If you strike an agreement, it is good form to stick to the agreement. These people want long-term agreements because long-term agreements give certainty in your employment. Let us face it, under federal awards, people have been voting with their feet; it is no secret that, since the introduction of enterprise workplace agreements in this country, they have gone there in droves. When I spoke in this House the other day, I used the example of the current state government in Western Australia, which has torn up the previous good agreements and produced its own EEAs—employee-employer arrangements. Only 142 have been registered in Western Australia. In the same period, how many have been registered under the federal jurisdiction? There have been 98,000—compared with 142.</para><para>That says to me that they are pretty happy with these sorts of agreements—they are very keen to see them nurtured and fostered, and they want to be part of them. In fact, employers tell me that their workers come to them and say: `How can we get onto these agreements? We want to shift across to the federal jurisdiction because we are not happy with the way the state agreements are going.' This is because, under the state regime, the Labor Party in Western Australia has totally rolled over to the union movement and become a prisoner of it again—particularly of the CFMEU. The employees say: `We do not feel safe here. We are vulnerable and we want to go somewhere where we are protected'—that is, under the federal jurisdiction.</para><para>You cannot take the member for Rankin seriously on this, because we know that every time he comes in here he has his riding instructions from his union bosses. At the end of the day, this is where they want to take us. They want to go away from individual agreements back to the old, collective, one-size-fits-all union agreement that does not do any better for the workers of this country. What has happened under Australian workplace agreements is a better deal—better wages and conditions for workers. I ask the Labor Party: what is the matter with that? What is the matter with better work conditions and wages for people on the work sites? I would have thought the Labor Party would think that that is good. But, no, it is not good, because they do not control them through their union mates. It is not good because, at the end of the day, losing control means you lose control of the money that flows from union dues and you lose control of the work site. So, ultimately, losing control is what this is all about—taking away the individual freedoms and rights of workers in this country. That is the difference between the Labor Party and us.</para><para>The fact is that, by putting flexibility back into the Australian work force, we have grown this country into one of the model economies of the world. There is no doubt that, amongst the OECD countries, Australia is the model economy. We have unemployment at 5.7 per cent. We have inflation below three per cent. Investment in this country is high. All the fundamentals are right, and that is because we have a very productive work force. Having a productive work force means you can get a better outcome not only for business but also for the workers who work in those businesses, who get to share in the benefits of the businesses. The people I talk to that employ workers on plumbing sites and building sites say they pay all those guys well above the award rate, and they are happy to do so because the workers are far more productive. There is incentive in this arrangement. As I have previously said, these are not rigid, one-size-fits all agreements. If workers work hard or are skilled in another area, they get paid more—and what is the matter with that? I am sure their families are happy. I am sure the bank is happy that they can pay more off their mortgage or buy a house of their choosing.</para><para>I cannot see what is wrong with trying to get a better deal for workers. The Labor Party seems to have a problem, because their union mates have told them it is no good and they have to come in here and oppose it. In the words of the member for Rankin, it is the worst piece of legislation brought into this House. What an absolute joke to say something as ridiculous as that in the Parliament of Australia. We will leave that to others to judge.</para><para>Why can third parties register their opposition to strikes? In the terms of the agreement, they can register opposition to striking because of the knock-on effect it will have on them. Let us take teachers as an example. I was a school teacher previously, so I know a bit about school teaching; my wife is a school teacher—in a state government school, by the way—so we know the system well. The Western Australian government went through a horrible period just recently in trying to strike an agreement with teachers, who went on strike. It was disgraceful. But the parents were concerned and they registered an objection, because of the safety aspects for some of their children. The fact is that some working parents—and I am sure the warm and cuddlies on the other side will understand this—do not have the opportunity to allow their children not to go school on a normal school day, because they have an agreement with their bosses that they will be at work, and the fact is that if their kids are at school they know where they are. But, if there is a strike and the teachers are not there, there is a safety aspect in these kids being out on the street. So why wouldn't they register an objection when they feel that the safety of their children is at risk?</para><para>Again, the AIRC can look at this on its merits and say: `We think this is a bit spurious. There is after-school child care and there are enough teachers turning up that have agreed to work et cetera. So, no, we will not agree to it.' So there is a dispute mechanism in all this. This is the whole thing about these agreements: you do not go on strike for the life of the agreement, because, built into the agreement, there is a dispute resolution mechanism. Otherwise, you would not sign it. If you got halfway through the agreement and had a blue with your boss and could not find a way through the argument, what sort of agreement would that be? So it is carefully crafted and put together so that, if there is a dispute in the lifetime of the agreement, there is an opportunity to work through it, as per the mechanism that is written into the agreement. I think it is quite reasonable. If you can get an agreement like that, which you are happy with, why would you essentially try to tear it apart halfway through?</para><para>The member for Rankin wandered off before. If I can have some slight latitude, Mr Deputy Speaker, about this government's attitude towards teachers, I was a primary school teacher, my wife is a primary school teacher, my brother is a high school teacher and my sister is a high school teacher—I know a bit about the teaching profession. You are right: you do not find that many coalition voters in staffrooms around Australia in government schools. For some reason there is a cultural mentality, and I used to find it quite interesting debating with my colleagues on these issues. It is probably because often a lot of them do not leave school; they go straight from primary school and high school through teachers college and straight back to school, so they do not necessarily see as widely as others. At the end of the day that is their right if they have a particular political view. </para><para>Ultimately, as we know, there are schools in this country where they do strange things—for example, in Western Australia it caused a lot of problems not so long ago, before Christmas, when some schools said they would not allow the singing of Christmas carols in the schools. How bizarre, how unAustralian is that? It was going to offend the cultural and religious rights of another group. This is Australia, after all. We are not doing what France is doing and outlawing headwear for Jews and Muslims and crosses for Catholics et cetera. Surely in Australia we can be celebrate Easter and Anzac Day and not be that politically correct. That was the whole genesis of what the Prime Minister said.</para><para>The minister for education today pointed out quite clearly that the government funding to non-government schools is nowhere near the funding to government schools. Then, when you consider the people who are actually responsible for government schools—that is, the state governments—you see that their allocation is far more than for non-government schools. It is the parents of Australia who put $4 billion into the private school system because they have a choice. I thought in a democracy like Australia we were allowed to have a choice. If you want to send your children to a government school or a non-government school or to Tresillian or some other alternative school, as long as it is legal you can send your child to whatever school you like. Yet the member for Rankin wandered off and said, `The government hates teachers.' What a load of garbage—we love teachers. I married one, so I rest my case. </para><para>He said something about nurses as well. We talk about the caring industry because, when carers go on strike, it affects a lot of vulnerable people: old people in nursing homes, sick people recovering in intensive care wards et cetera. Of course you are going to mention industries like that. What is the matter with doing that? He talks about nurses being angels. I think they are angels. Nurses are delightful people, but in Western Australia the state Labor government did not think they were delightful, because they had a protracted industrial blue with them, again about wages and conditions. And guess what? They are all pulling out of these pattern agreements; they are going onto awards where they can get a better deal, whether it be through agencies or through other means. They actually like the individual agreements they strike because they get more pay and more flexibility in their work hours.</para><para>One of the sad things about being a nurse is that your social life is absolutely gone because of the hours you work, and there is very little recognition of that. To say that country nurses were going to be paid less is just not true. They have somehow manipulated the truth on that side to come up with that conclusion. My sister-in-law—my brother's wife—is a nurse in a country area: she is a sister in the Kununoppin Hospital in Western Australia. She gets paid more because she can negotiate a better deal for herself. I think that is admirable and is what should happen in this industry.</para><para>Another element of the bill I must go to before I finish is that this legislation certainly does address cooling-off periods. The opposition have a problem with cooling-off periods. What a joke. You can have a cooling-off period if you buy a car. You can have a cooling-off period if you sign an agreement for a lease. What is the matter with that? It protects the uneducated, the vulnerable or those who do not understand some of these commercial realities. It protects them because sometimes after signing they can suddenly get further and better advice. I would have thought that it was very Australian to have a cooling-off period. But not for the Labor Party: they do not like all those little things you can do that are right, like secret ballots, for example. They do not like them in industrial relations because that might give the workers the right to say no without being intimidated by the bloke standing there watching them vote. What is the matter with that?</para><para>We have secret ballots in this place when we appoint Speakers and others, but they will not allow a secret ballot on the work site. It is because you want to eyeball those who are not voting as you want, and if they do not you will give them a good slap because they did not vote your way or they will be victimised afterwards and not get any work on that building site. We do know there is a huge amount of intimidation on building sites. The Cole royal commission gave chapter and verse of all that. Let us not be shy about why they do not do these things. Cooling-off periods are just the right thing to do. </para><para>At the end of the day we need proper legislation like this because, as I said, Australia has benefited enormously from the limited amount of workplace relations reform that we have brought through this place. Generally the Labor Party, in concert with the minor parties in the Senate, eventually either blocks or stops most of or makes so unworkable any legislation that comes through from the elected government of this country that very little in the way of proper reform has gone through. But enough has gone through to have made a better deal not only for the workers of Australia but also for the people who employ them.</para><para>There is a strange mentality on the other side that anyone who makes a profit and does better is a bit evil. I have got to tell you: people do not start a business to go broke, people do not start a business to get into trouble; they start a business because they actually want to provide themselves with some form of employment, and they employ others to assist in that. The better they do, the more people they can employ, and we know the knock-on effect there. The other side think that people who make a lot of money are a bit evil and should be dealt with. That is just not correct.</para><para>The fact is that the benefits that have been brought to the Australian economy are more jobs, better wages, higher productivity, increased competitiveness and fewer strikes. There have been fewer strikes under this government because we have got the fundamentals right. People are actually happier in their work. Ultimately this sort of legislation not only needs to pass this House, it needs to pass the Senate, because it is good for Australian workers and it is good for Australia. I recommend this bill to the House. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>24856</page.no><name role="metadata">Albanese, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ALBANESE</name><name.id>R36</name.id><electorate>Grayndler</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It was the Australian Industrial Relations Commission—originally called the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration—which way back in 1907 established the principle of the basic wage. For the first time, the wages of workers were to be determined not only by the marketplace but also by social standards. Workers were no longer to be viewed simply as another commodity in the production process. The creation of the AIRC was also recognition of the unequal bargaining power of employers when compared to that of their workers. That is the basis of our opposition to the government's so-called better bargaining bill which is before us today.</para></talk.start><para>The <inline ref="R1921">Workplace Relations Amendment (Better Bargaining) Bill 2003</inline> bill is an attempt to redistribute power from organised labour to employers—power that is already extraordinarily unequal in that individual workers do not have a great deal of options in bargaining their position when compared with the power of the employer who employs them. What historically has occurred as a result of that inequality is that workers have gathered together in trade unions and they have bargained collectively. Part of that bargaining collectively must be the right of workers to withdraw their labour. There must obviously be constraints on that, and one of the constraints is that, where agreements are struck, they should be honoured. It seems to me perverse that those on the other side of the House, who allegedly stress the rights of the individual, essentially argue that individuals should be forced and coerced to work regardless of what changes are occurring in the conditions of that employment.</para><para>Since this government came into office, the AIRC and fair bargaining have been constantly under attack from some sections of the business sector but particularly by those opposite, who believe that if the labour market is deregulated, with the wages and conditions of workers determined not according to social standards but by the profitability and needs of the individual workplace, that will be an appropriate outcome. The Howard government has pursued the dismantling of the AIRC with particular zeal. Collective approaches to wage setting have been replaced where possible by individual contracts. After a century of progress, with the development of a labour market, this government essentially believes in winding the clock back and returning Australian workers to the labour market of the 1880s. This bill has as its objective the removal of the remaining bargaining power of working Australians.</para><para>There is some suggestion here that somehow workers take industrial action lightly. Of course, when employees withdraw their labour they at the same time are withdrawing their opportunity to get paid. They do it only as a last resort, when there is an impasse in negotiations with their employer and the issues are so significant that they are prepared to sacrifice the wages that they were being paid. That is why industrial action figures are quite low. The government boasts that official figures on industrial action are extremely low. If that is that case, why is it necessary to introduce legislation such as this bill? It is necessary because of the ideological zeal of this government.</para><para>I want to go to the impacts that this bill will have. The first thing that it will do is give third parties who might be affected—not definitely be affected but just might be affected—by industrial action the right to intervene and stop that industrial action taking place. Depending upon how you define `third party', that could be the consumer of a product produced by a particular employer. It could certainly be broad enough to suggest that almost anyone in the community could argue that they would be affected and therefore have a right to apply for that industrial action to not take place. It is not as if the industrial action can take place lightly. There is already a process established whereby there must be an initial bargaining period, with seven days written notice to the employer. Then, if negotiations reach an impasse, the union or employees must give written notice of at least three days of their intention to take industrial action. These restrictions are meant to balance the interests of employers and employees—but that is not enough for this government.</para><para>The other thing that this legislation proposes is not to allow any industrial action during the life of an agreement. That is simply designed to override Federal Court decisions which do allow such protected action. This bill will also introduce cooling-off periods—that is, it will give the commission an extraordinary new power to suspend bargaining periods.</para><para>All of this power to intervene is aimed, as the previous speaker, the member for Canning, said, at some of the most important workers in our community. The government has been pretty explicit about it. In his speech, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations mentioned, for example, the caring professions such as health, community services and education, as if people in essential services, such as nurses, take industrial action at the drop of a hat. I find it quite offensive that this government continues to attack workers in our health and education systems. We know that the current health minister suggested that rural nurses should be paid less than city nurses whilst he had the position of workplace relations minister. We know that the Prime Minister has specifically targeted for insult and denigration those who teach in public schools. He purported that public schoolteachers, who teach more than 70 per cent of Australia's children, are somehow out there pushing an ideological case every day trying to indoctrinate students into a particular way of thinking.</para><para>That is the nature of the government and how out of touch they are. They are prepared to attack the very people who, because of the work they do, are showing their commitment to the community. There are massive shortages of teachers and nurses. Perhaps there is a link between pay and conditions and the lack of teachers and nurses. I would have thought that the government would have realised that. If you reduce the industrial bargaining power of people in those professions by specifically singling them out and targeting them with legislation, in the long run you will increase the shortages that there are in areas like health, education and child care.</para><para>I will give a practical example of this government's vision of fair bargaining and how it is occurring in practice. Morris McMahon is a company located in Arncliffe, New South Wales, close to my electorate. Australian Manufacturing Workers Union members were on strike from 13 March 2003 for 16 weeks. In some instances, both husband and wife work at Morris McMahon and both were on strike, so they had no money at all coming into their household. Most of the workers have children. Many of the workers live in my electorate and are of non-English-speaking background. There was a 24-hour, seven-day a week picket in place since the beginning of the dispute. The company manufactures cans and employs around 100 workers. The owner of the company also had her own legal firm, Beswick Solicitors, in Clarence Street, Sydney. The company refused to negotiate a certified agreement with the employees and tried to force its workers to sign individual contracts. Until the final days, the company refused to negotiate with the union and, when forced to speak with them, refused to discuss anything other than individual contracts. The company offered striking workers an upfront cash payment of $1,000 to return to work on individual contracts. Think about this: both parents were out on strike on a picket line. They are battlers, people who were being paid less than $12 an hour—and the bleating in the coalition party room over their super entitlements showed the comparisons that they were on about—yet there was systematic intimidation of these employees, with hired security outside the picket line.</para><para>I am a member of the Australian Labor Party and I was proud to be on the picket line for two mornings with the workers who were `salt of the earth' people. They showed great courage. The company threatened to terminate the union delegate's employment. It sought damages of $700,000 against the AMWU. Workers were being forced to accept a roster of hours that they were not employed to work—five days work instead of four days work per week—the employer would not tell employees about the security of their entitlement and the company bussed in scabs using a professional strike-breaking company.</para><para>What did the workers want? They wanted, firstly, an end to six years of unregistered agreements; secondly, respect as workers and decent wages and conditions, as contained in the union agreement; and, thirdly, the right to be represented by their union. They were resolute in their commitment to achieve a collective agreement.</para><para>During the dispute Doug Cameron, the National Secretary of the AMWU, had a debate with the then minister, the member for Warringah, Tony Abbott, at Sydney University. Doug challenged the minister to come and talk to the workers. This is a minister who spoke all about choice—`We are all about choice and giving workers the right to choose.' He went to that workplace and had to acknowledge that what they wanted was their right to bargain collectively. Yet they were not able to do so because of this government's legislation.</para><para>The Hon. Justice Munro of the AIRC told the commission that he no longer had the power to assist in the resolution of the dispute but wished that he did. He said that the employer did not bargain in good faith. Eventually the matter was resolved and the employees went back to work. There are no individual contracts, the workers have a registered agreement and the union has been recognised. The employer won the worst boss for 2003 award from the New South Wales Labor Council. That dispute should not have occurred; there should have been proper and fair bargaining. That is not what this government is about. It is about taking away the rights of workers and handing all power to employers. That is why the Labor Party rejects the government's industrial relations approach. We do not back away from our connections with the trade union movement. I have been a proud trade union member all my working life and will continue to be.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>24859</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Brendan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR</name><name.id>00AN3</name.id><electorate>Burke</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to agree with the contributions of the member for Grayndler and the member for Rankin to the debate on the <inline ref="R1921">Workplace Relations Amendment (Better Bargaining) Bill 2003</inline>. In particular, I rise to raise my concern about the government's continual attacks upon an industrial relations system that requires fairness to all, both the employers and the employees. Since 1996, I think it is fair to say there has been no regard by this government for many employees.</para></talk.start><para>This bill flies in the face of the most basic conventions determined by the International Labour Organisation. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, that international body comprises employers, employee organisations and government representation. The ILO conventions in relation to bargaining have always meant that there would be the capacity for workers in any democracy to bargain collectively in order to reach a settlement with their employer. Equally, the employer is afforded protection in that they also have the right to bargain for what they want. Clearly, there are different agendas by parties to industrial negotiations, but the basic plank of genuine bargaining is to allow those parties to bargain equally and to provide the capacity so that one party is not favoured over the other. Unfortunately, this bill is just another element of the strategy by this government to diminish the capacity of employees to bargain equally.</para><para>As the member for Rankin indicated—and this was reinforced by the member for Grayndler's comments—it is quite extraordinary that the focus of this bill is those people in what I would like to describe as the care industry. In particular, it focuses on those occupational groups that are made up predominantly of women employees—who, against any comparisons, suffer disadvantages in their employment conditions. It is rather concerning to me and others in this place that have we a bill introduced into the House that would not only diminish the capacity to bargain equally but also diminish the entitlements or the capacity of a particular group of employees to bargain in such a way. Therefore, I think we have a major problem, and this is of course why the Labor Party cannot support this bill.</para><para>There has also been some misinformation about this matter. There is no doubt that the ILO conventions have from time to time limited the capacity of essential service employees to negotiate their employment conditions. However, on the occasions on which those capacities have been diminished, there has always been a recognition that that would be done in lieu of the powers of a third party to arbitrate a settlement. In other words, if there were a group of employees who were required to work without stoppage because stoppage would bring the state into some state of chaos or cause potential concerns to the community on a fundamental level, there has always been an acceptance that their employment conditions would be negotiated by an industrial tribunal.</para><para>This legislation does not have that capacity. In this legislation, the government are seeking to diminish the entitlements of those employees that work with and look after children, that look after people with disabilities, that look after the elderly in our community. The government are looking to diminish their rights to bargain effectively but are not providing the wherewithal for the Industrial Relations Commission to arbitrate a settlement of any dispute that might arise. In other words, we have one plank from the government that only protects the interests of the employers and, in this instance, diminishes the bargaining capacity of hardworking employees in what are, of course, very difficult occupations. These workers are in an increasingly difficult set of circumstances. As we know, the people that are looking after our children—our future, if you like—our elderly and our infirm are not doing it on a great deal of money. You would not be drawn to those occupations on the basis of making a quid, because they are some of the lowest paid employees in this country. So this really does underline how pernicious and hostile this government—in particular, the Prime Minister and the L-plated minister—are when it comes to attacking Australian working families.</para><para>I do have some great concerns about this bill, and I think it is important to note that there has been a procession of instruments introduced into this place for which the government has been seeking enactment. I was asked recently why it is that I have had the opportunity to speak so often on these matters, and I say that it is not that I think that they are the most important things but that they seem to be the most important things to this government. There is no doubt that tearing away basic entitlements of Australian working families, diminishing the capacity of the Industrial Relations Commission, and making it more difficult for employee organisations to represent their members have been primary considerations of this government in this term. There have been 12—if not 13 or, possibly, 14—of these bills, all of which, bar one, have been rejected by the Senate. But the government have continued to introduce these bills in order to target the most vulnerable in our community.</para><para>I suppose I would not have such a view of the government if I were able to look at a bill on workplace relations and say, `They're looking to provide greater flexibility in the workplace, but it is flexibility from employers and employees that they are seeking.' There never is a fair-handed approach by this government in relation to the Australian work force, and it will not be forgotten at election time. It will not be forgotten that this Prime Minister, in following the Labor leader in introducing changes to the entitlements of politicians, refused to accept those changes that should go to the Prime Minister's office. It will not be forgotten that the Prime Minister was quick to succumb to the view of the Labor leader and the opposition in relation to superannuation but resisted any change to his own entitlements. Again we see a Prime Minister thinking of himself first and thinking of employers always over employees in workplaces.</para><para>I think this is a worrying sign for Australian workplaces, because the government should be focusing positively on the need to balance work and family. As we heard this week, from a confidential cabinet paper that was leaked to the newspapers, this government has deferred any proper consideration of the work and family policies that were being discussed in cabinet last year. In other words, although the Prime Minister has said that the most important thing on his domestic agenda—along with health and education—is finding the right balance between people's need to work and their need to have a decent family life, this government has failed to properly consider, and then introduce into this place, decent policies that would attend to some of the concerns that the Australian work force have.</para><para>It is already apparent that the Prime Minister has not accepted the need to introduce paid maternity leave for women; he has been scathing of Labor's proposal to provide enabling provisions for women, in particular, to return to the workplace in a part-time capacity; and he has, indeed, misrepresented our views on allowing the conversion of a long-term casual employee to permanent employee status. I think it is important that I put on the record the Labor Party's proposal in relation to the conversion of casual employees to permanent employee status, and that is: if a casual employee were employed for 12 months, they could request that they be determined to be a permanent employee. I think the phrase used by the member for Rankin was that there would be some `light touch' legislation, in that it would allow for the employer, in circumstances where such a conversion is unreasonable, to argue that the conversion should not take place. Labor's proposal anticipated that many employees would not necessarily wish to change from casual to permanent status, but the plan was about allowing employees the right to assume that they would have an arguable case to move from precarious employment to permanent employment, and it could be resisted only if there were a compelling argument to oppose the conversion.</para><para>Those are the sorts of things that the Australian work force are seeking from us, because there has been a gradual shift over the last 20 years or so from a small proportion to a much larger proportion of the Australian work force in precarious employment. People who are precariously employed—people who have casual, part-time jobs but full-time families—want us to consider and attempt to solve that problem. There are too many families under strain because of these difficulties. Instead, since the beginning of this term, and no doubt since 1996 with the election of the Howard government, the government have been blindly in pursuit of diminishing the rights of employees. This bill is just another example of their belligerence and their blind hatred towards employee organisations and those they represent in the Australian work force.</para><para>I would certainly encourage the parliament to oppose this bill. As the member for Rankin did, I too seek the support of the Greens, the Democrats and Independents to join with the Labor Party in the Senate and oppose this bill for being anti-worker and for undermining the Australian work force.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

I first raised this matter publicly some four years ago and, to date, we are still no closer to the Howard government announcing a decision to allow a Medicare licence for an MRI service in Bendigo. Magnetic resonance imaging provides an unparalleled view inside the human body; it is non-invasive, with none of the known effects associated with X-ray examinations. The level of detail that can be seen is extraordinary when compared with any other X-ray equipment. This is obviously of enormous benefit in diagnosing a wide range of illnesses very early in their development. Therefore, MRI services have the potential to save many lives.</para></talk.start><para>Bendigo, in central Victoria, represents one of the major health care regions in Australia—it is certainly the largest in Victoria—without MRI services. As a result, patients requiring MRI services must travel to a major health facility elsewhere in the state, usually Melbourne but possibly Ballarat, to access this service. The Bracks state government has committed $3 million for the building and equipping of an MRI unit, but only on the basis that it is licensed by the Commonwealth. A Commonwealth licence will allow for the bulk of the cost of consultations to be claimed from Medicare. A non-licensed MRI facility would mean that those requiring the service would pay in excess of $600 per consultation. Labor believes that an MRI service should be available to all who need it, not just to those who can afford it. The Howard government has so far not demonstrated any interest in providing a licence for the equipment proposed by the Bracks state government. It is essential that central Victorians have access to this vital life-saving service.</para><para>I note that Victoria has 16 of the 73 licensed MRI services available in Australia and all but one of those licences are located in the metropolitan and Geelong areas. The only licence in regional Victoria is located in Ballarat. This shows a definite bias against the rest of regional Victoria. People could be forgiven for thinking that the Howard government is continuing to deny regional Victoria the same access to important health services that people in the larger metropolitan areas take for granted.</para><para>What makes the government's lack of concern over providing a Medicare licence for Bendigo and central Victoria even more puzzling is the fact that it would not cost the Howard government one extra dollar to have this service in Bendigo. The federal government would incur no capital or running costs with the proposed MRI service, as the Bracks government has already committed to fund the establishment of the building and equipment and the Bendigo Health Care Group would staff and operate the unit.</para><para>People do not have MRI scans just for fun; they have to be referred by their doctor to a service in Ballarat or Melbourne. It makes no difference whatsoever to the federal government where that service is provided. The federal government, through Medicare, already pays most of the costs for Medicare card holders from Bendigo and central Victoria when they access MRI services in those other health regions. The Howard government would not have to pay one extra dollar to provide a licence for the Bendigo Health Care Group to operate an MRI service. All that is happening at present is that Bendigo region people are suffering stress and footing extra bills to travel to Melbourne or Ballarat to get MRI services that should be located in regional Victoria. In fact, the federal government would save money by not having to pay travel expenses for cardholders to travel to Melbourne or Ballarat.</para><para>Yet again I find I am having to argue and browbeat this government into providing a service that metropolitan areas take for granted. It raises the question yet again: what has Bendigo done to this government to receive this terrible treatment? The state government is showing yet again that it is in tune with the needs of central Victoria by providing the funding for the building and equipment; the Bendigo Health Care Group will staff and run the service—so what is the problem?</para><para>We have the highest-taxing government in our history; it is awash with money. We have hardworking central Victorians being bled dry with an ever-increasing tax burden, paying more than their share, and the Howard government continues to ignore them by refusing to provide infrastructure and services that people in metropolitan areas take for granted.</para><para>Come the election on 16 October, I am sure the regional Victorian community, not to mention the rest of regional Australia, will deal a harsh blow to this government for ignoring their wishes and ignoring their need for infrastructure and for much-needed services like MRI. We have seen the situation where the Treasurer has refused to acknowledge his promise to fund the Calder Highway. It is now three years since those famous words were spoken, and there is no likelihood of that happening. That is the sort of problem we are experiencing with the Howard government in Bendigo. Bendigo people are very sick of it, and I am sure most people in the Victoria region are also sick of it. As I said, come the election on 16 October, we will have our chance to let this government know, in no uncertain terms, how we feel about being treated this way.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Dunkley Electorate: Queen's Scout Award</title><page.no>24863</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>24863</page.no><name role="metadata">Billson, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BILLSON</name><name.id>1K6</name.id><electorate>Dunkley</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight to celebrate the work of two outstanding young people from the Dunkley community. On the weekend, Scott Poulton and Brian Witherspoon received their Queen's Scout Award at a ceremony at the Frankston scouting facility in Quality Street, Frankston. The ceremony was a terrific celebration of their work for and commitment to the scouting movement and their many years of selfless pursuit of community service as well as an opportunity for personal growth and to learn more about themselves whilst developing new skills. The Queen's Scout Award is a prestigious award, and the 1st Langwarrin Scout Group must be very proud to have two of its members honoured in such a way. It is an honour that usually only two or three from the Langwarrin Scout Group receive each year and is a great credit to those who make the commitment.</para></talk.start><para>The Queen's Scout Award is a very prestigious award and is designed as a challenge, allowing for fun, variety and personal choice. The award has outstanding status within the scouting community and the broader community. As a recipient of the award, these young men will be classed amongst the elite of the scouting movement.</para><para>The award entails a combination of four separate fields of endeavour. There is some community involvement—these two young men were involved in rehabilitation of the Sweetwater Creek Nature Reserve. There is some kind of adventurous activity required, aimed at challenging the individual's initiative. That might involve expeditions or some other outdoor activity. I think caving was one of the activities undertaken, which was quite a challenge for one of the young men. There is personal growth, which is aimed at the individual finding out more about themselves through the expression of their ideas, the ideals they subscribe to, mental pursuits and issues of lifestyle. There is also development of leadership qualities, preparing the young people to make a very active and full contribution to adult responsibilities in a democratic society, looking not only at management but at leadership and employment prospects.</para><para>Scott began his scouting life at eight years of age at the 1st Langwarrin's Nurumbi cub pack, before transferring to another pack. He began scouting in T-Troop and acquired both the Pioneer and Explorer badges. He and his family have had a long commitment to scouting. It takes quite an amount of family support for a scout to achieve the honour of the Queen's Scout Award. That was symbolised at the presentation by pins being made available to both the young men's parents as part of the ceremony.</para><para>It is certainly not an easy award to achieve. I guess I am bringing it to the House's attention tonight for two purposes. Scott, as I mentioned, has been involved in the scouting movement since he was eight and Brian Witherspoon started scouting at about 9½. So the award was a culmination of many years of commitment to the scouting ideal, with these young people putting a lot of their own energy and own ideas back into the scouting movement.</para><para>Our young people could do a whole lot worse than be involved in the scouting movement. It provides opportunities for citizenship activities in the environment area and for service in supporting Cuborees and St Vincent de Paul on weekends. Those activities were part of Brian's journey for the Queen's Scout Award. His adventurous activities were a rovers course at Mt Disappointment, the Hepburn Springs hike, caving at the Bucchan Caves and attending flight training school for a week. He achieved in the area of personal growth through art and folio work and debating. He gave softball a bit of a go and learnt to be an umpire and a coach. He organised lectures on the effects of drugs and alcohol, attended the Deep Thought 2002 conference and has also been involved in the multimedia crew in his school community. They are remarkable achievements for Brian.</para><para>If you look into Scott's journey it is similarly rich. Citizenship achievements included attending court sessions, arranging visits to the crematorium and a political awareness investigation. He was involved in revegetation in Baden Powell Park and helping out with the Cranbourne Lions Club. He also did a first aid course. He ran a program for rovers at Mt Disappointment and also attended the caves. He completed a scuba diving course. What a great start for young men finding their way in the world, learning about themselves, being involved in team activities and learning that really worthwhile things rarely come from one individual but through the joint efforts of many people with shared purposes, shared commitments and shared ideals.</para><para>It was a really moving ceremony. I had never been to a Queen's Scout Award presentation before. But it was great to see significant people in the young men's lives presenting them to the audience, to see their parents involved and to see the whole scouting community paying tribute to these young men for their commitment. Tonight, I say to Scott Poulton and Brian Witherspoon congratulations on your Queen's Scout Awards. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Ballarat Electorate: Prisoner of War Memorial</title><page.no>24864</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>24864</page.no><name role="metadata">King, Catherine, MP</name><name role="display">Ms KING</name><name.id>00AMR</name.id><electorate>Ballarat</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The ex-prisoner of war memorial dedication ceremony on 6 February was a moving tribute to those Australian men and women who over the course of all wars experienced unimaginable incarceration, many for several years under intolerable conditions. Equally moving was the small ceremony held the following day to remember those prisoners of war and civilians who perished with the sinking of the <inline font-style="italic">Montevideo Maru</inline> on 1 July 1942. There were over 10,000 people attending the ceremony and almost 1,300 ex-prisoners of war also in attendance. The memorial provides long needed recognition of the more than 35,000 men and women who were captured while serving our country.</para></talk.start><para>Every name on the memorial represents a multitude of stories, stories that are woven throughout this country and contained within the thousands of families who had a husband, wife, boyfriend, girlfriend, brother, sister, father, mother, son or daughter taken and held captive in the course of war. Over 8,000 never made it home. Many have since passed away. It is a fitting tribute and right that their names and stories are remembered.</para><para>On the day of the dedication I was touched by many of these stories. For my own part, my brother-in-law, who I have known since I was 13, rang me in the morning to say he was on the way to Ballarat with his sisters to pay tribute to their dad, who was a POW in Japan. I am ashamed to say it was not a part of his family history that I had previously known about. The member for Rankin, in Ballarat that day for another purpose, strolled down late that evening to have a look at the war memorial and was very touched to find his own father's name on the memorial. The member for Brand was there for the <inline font-style="italic">Montevideo</inline><inline font-style="italic">Maru</inline> memorial, having lost an uncle in that terrible tragedy.</para><para>The Ballarat ex-prisoner of war memorial is a place where people can reach out and touch the names engraved on granite and feel for a brief moment the spirit of the person whose name will for evermore be remembered in the surrounds of the Ballarat Botanical Gardens.</para><para>In Canberra last week members of parliament from across the country commented on the memorial and the publicity surrounding it, asking me how this wonderful memorial came to be in Ballarat. It is certainly not a mystery for people who live there, such as me. Like many in the community, I want to congratulate the hard work and dedication of the many men and women who made the Ballarat ex-prisoner of war memorial a possibility. This mammoth task took over 10 years of steadfast determination and belief in the rightness of the project.</para><para>I want to highlight the contribution in particular of the memorial project manager, Les Kennedy, and of memorial appeals project manager David Baird, the unbelievable work of sculptor Peter Blizzard and the organisational work of the City of Ballarat, along with the contribution of former member for Ballarat Michael Ronaldson and the many others who helped in obtaining the funding for the memorial and recording over 35,000 names never previously recorded on a single list. I could not have been prouder of Ballarat on Friday</para><para>I would also like to congratulate the local media—the <inline font-style="italic">Ballarat Courier</inline>, Win TV, ABC Ballarat and Radio 3BA—for their terrific coverage on the day. In particular, I want to commend the <inline font-style="italic">Courier</inline> for the many moving stories of ex-POWs that continue to be carried through the pages of the paper.</para><para>Finally I would like to join with Ballarat City Mayor, David Vendy, in inviting the Prime Minister to come to Ballarat and see and experience our memorial. The government has made it clear that it does not consider the ex-prisoner of war memorial as the national memorial for prisoners of war. But in time our memorial will naturally progress to become the national memorial, a transition that will not seek to take away the significance of the Changi Chapel here in Canberra. In my view, the transition will naturally occur as people like my brother-in-law make the pilgrimage to the memorial in Ballarat seeking the names of people they have loved.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Queensland Election: Lockyer Nationals</title><title>Recycled Water Project</title><page.no>24866</page.no></subdebateinfo><title>Recycled Water Project</title><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>24866</page.no><name role="metadata">Thompson, Cameron, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CAMERON THOMPSON</name><name.id>84C</name.id><electorate>Blair</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>— I rise this evening to comment on the recent state election campaign in Queensland and to congratulate the coalition candidates in the Blair area. Ian Rickuss, in particular, was successful in defeating the leader of One Nation, Bill Flynn. That I think is a great milestone for the Lockyer Nationals. Ian and Ann Rickuss are well known in the Lockyer Valley and it is good to see them being successful. I know that Ian will go on to represent the area very ably. I look forward to conducting a long-running campaign with him for better standards of service and infrastructure in that area.</para></talk.start><para>I would also like to congratulate Nina Temperton, the National Party candidate for Nanango. She took on the former One Nation member, now Independent, Dorothy Pratt. That was a very difficult seat to take on. But Nina was a quality candidate and did an excellent job, batting on a very sticky wicket. I think we can expect big things in the future from Nina. She certainly highlighted all the right issues and ran a very strong campaign.</para><para>What I really want to highlight though are the efforts of Jean Bray, the Liberal Party candidate for Ipswich West and well respected former Mayor of the Esk Shire. I think her campaign deserves particular recognition. The campaign was run by the federal electorate chairman, Peter Clarke, and all members of the Blair FEC acquitted themselves well in staging a professional campaign. Above everything else, it was a local campaign. It was a campaign that drew all its strengths from the candidate and the local issues. We were going up against the state Labor machine, and most of the effort being put in on behalf of the sitting member, Don Livingstone, I think you could rightly characterise as being state based; he had a lot of support coming from the state level. It was like a tiny local David versus a big state Goliath. I think Jean did very well in getting an eight per cent swing—that is according to Antony Green of the ABC's commentary team. He said that it was a bad result for Labor, and so I think that definitely puts it down as a strong result for Jean Bray. </para><para>Congratulations go to all members of the Blair FEC, as I said before—people like the Treasurer, David Hewitt; Juneau Limpus; and Don and Ronda Herrmann. At the state level I would also like to congratulate Bob Quinn. It is a very difficult thing to be going in as the only Liberal member to return after the campaign. As a one-man band he did a very good job in supporting the coalition effort. </para><para>I have to say that for my area the highlight of the entire campaign was the commitment from the coalition to the recycled water project. I think that project has tremendous value for the future of the south-east Queensland region but, more importantly, for Australia nationally. This recycled water project, which takes water out of the waste water system in Brisbane and turns it out into the Lockyer Valley and the Darling Downs, can also make a great contribution to the solution of the ongoing problem in the MurrayDarling system. Given the growth of the Brisbane conurbation, with potentially something like 500,000 megalitres of water coming out of that area in the future, a project like that is something that really could make a great contribution to the MurrayDarling system in the future.</para><para>I raise that project because it was highlighted. The coalition firmly committed to it at the state level and I know the Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson, has expressed a great deal of interest in it in the past. I know that, with support around the place increasing, we will find down the track the opportunity to develop this important recycled water project and to provide a triple bottom line outcome in terms of assisting the economy, assisting the environment and definitely assisting Australia to progress.</para><para>This was a good election campaign; it highlighted all of the important local issues. I congratulate all of those candidates who were involved in it.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Small Business: Taxation</title><page.no>24867</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>24867</page.no><name role="metadata">McMullan, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McMULLAN</name><name.id>5I4</name.id><electorate>Fraser</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Tonight I want to highlight some of the blatant double standards of the Howard government in its treatment of small business. Let us examine first what it promised and what has been delivered. Who could ever forget the promise to reduce red tape for small business by 50 per cent? The government even commissioned a special report, the Bell report, to look into the implications. But noone told poor old Charlie Bell that this was a non-core promise. What in fact has been the biggest change in the administrative burden imposed on small business to meet government legislative requirements is the business activity statement and the burden imposed on small business to comply with the GST. Everybody knows that is true; it is in fact self-evident.</para></talk.start><para>But let us look at the most recent evidence.

That issue has not crossed the lips of any minister for small business for years. </para><para>You do not hear anything about some of the other big issues facing small businesses because in this, as in other areas, the government has no agenda—nothing new to say; no third term agenda, let alone a fourth. In recent years the Howard government's approach to small business issues has been marked more by what it has not done than by anything positive. It has not acted on the massive issue of late payments, or on the BAS processing issues which affect the cash flow and viability of thousands upon thousands of small businesses each day. </para><para>Most glaring of all, the government has refused to confront big business by amending the Trade Practices Act to address legitimate concerns of small business, particularly with regard to predatory pricing—and now we know why: because big business will not let it. The Business Council of Australia today made that clear with its rather extraordinary press release where it has pre-empted the report of the Senate Economic References Committee. That committee has yet to report; the BCA has called on the government to ignore the committee's recommendations before they have even been made. The BCA may well be privy to those recommendations, but I am not.</para><para>The BCA assumes—and I hope—that the committee will recommend strengthening section 46 of the Trade Practices Act to protect small business against predatory pricing. The BCA makes it clear that it will fight that tooth and nail, as it did before the Dawson inquiry, to protect its interests—which I suppose it is entitled to do. But it is the government's job to protect the national interest, and that is not being protected by allowing predatory pricing. Alan Fels and the government's own selected chairman of the ACCC, Graeme Samuel, are both correct when they say that section 46 needs to be strengthened and small business needs to be protected. But the government will not act; the Treasurer will not act.</para><para>In contrast, Labor has already given its commitment to fix key areas identified by small businesses themselves as being critical improvements to their business environment. Labor will reduce the compliance burden, especially the time taken to complete the quarterly and annual GST reconciliations. We introduced the <inline ref="R1873">Taxation Laws Amendment (A Simpler Business Activity Statement) Bill 2003</inline> to give the option of a simpler method of calculating GST payments. In government we will enact that bill. Labor will help small businesses get their big business suppliers to pay on time and to pay interest if they do not. We have introduced a bill to that effect, and in government we will enact that bill. We have already announced that in government Labor will amend the Trade Practices Act—especially section 46—to give the ACCC the teeth it needs to prevent big business from exploiting their uneven power against small business. In government we will enact those changes. The question is: why will the government that purports to represent the interests of small business not take any of those measures?</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Trade: Live Sheep Exports</title><page.no>24868</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>24868</page.no><name role="metadata">McArthur, Stewart, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McARTHUR</name><name.id>VH4</name.id><electorate>Corangamite</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish to raise the issue of live sheep exports, particularly those out of Portland and Adelaide, arising out of the public concern that has been raised in this parliament about the <inline font-style="italic">Cormo Express</inline> and the difficulty that faced the government and the live sheep export trade with the 57,000 live sheep that were stranded in the Indian Ocean. Over 350 farmers attended a recent public meeting in Portland, where they were strongly of the view that Portland and Adelaide should not be closed to live sheep exports, which is a recommendation of the Keniry report. At that meeting a wellknown grazier, Mr Stuart Cumming, moved a motion that Portland and Adelaide be left open for the full year. The key question is: should the recommendation of the Keniry report that Portland be closed for a short time in the interests of the industry be accepted? The local people think that, if that takes place, then the live sheep industry will not be able to export from Portland or Adelaide. The VFF and Simon Ramsay put their point of view, and David Peddy, who has been operating the Portland live sheep export depot for the last 29 years, supported that very strongly. Livecorp have also challenged the Keniry report's recommendations on the basis of fact and rich assessment.</para></talk.start><para>The live animal industry is a billion dollar industry supplying cattle, sheep and goats to more than 30 destinations throughout the world. There are 9,000 jobs in this industry, and in the last year there were live cattle exports amounting to 712,000 head, with over 4.4 million head of sheep also being exported. The key question facing this parliament and the minister involves the risk management associated with live sheep export and what to do about animal disease, heat stress, animal husbandry techniques, weather conditions and their effect on risk, and other factors that have been identified by ongoing risk management assessment. Unfortunately for those people exporting out of Portland and Adelaide, the mortality rates in recent times have not been as desirable as they should have been. However, the encouraging thing is that the mortality rates have been reduced by some changes in technique and some further research that tries to ensure that animal husbandry techniques and feeding arrangements have been improved. So those people who export out of the Portland feedlots are saying that there has been a dramatic reduction in the figures from 2002 to 2003. In fact, the reality is that the mortality rates in the feedlots and on the trip to the Middle East are no more than would be the case in open paddock conditions in Australia. Thus, some of these myths that have been perpetrated about the live sheep trade really need addressing.</para><para>Mr Peddy, who has been running the feedlot operation, is going to meet the minister in the next 48 hours to argue his case that the industry is very important for the local producers, the feedlot operators and, more particularly, the farmers who provide the sheep. Fundamentally, the argument is that, if the government and the industry recommend a closure of three months, that could sound the death knell for both Portland and Adelaide and for the live sheep export industry in south-east Australia. I bring to the attentionof the minister and the government that if this recommendation is brought into effect it could mean that the operators who control these feedlots and export operations will not recover from the economic impact.</para><para>Whilst everyone appreciates the difficulties both in a public relations sense and in terms of some of the problems facing the live sheep industry, I urge the government, and the minister particularly, to take into account the recent improvements. Fundamentally, it is vitally important for the live sheep trade from New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia that the outlets at Portland and Adelaide be maintained and that the changes in attitude, the improvements in technology and some of the newer knowledge in handling livestock in these areas be implemented. I think the live sheep export trade in terms of the actual boats and the ventilation has reached a stage where the sheep that are loaded, provided they are acclimatised, are well looked after on their journey from Adelaide to the Middle East. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question agreed to.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">House adjourned at 9.29 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate></chamber.xscript><answers.to.questions><debate><debateinfo><type>Answers to Questions in Writing</type><title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title><page.no>24870</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following answers to questions were circulated:</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Aviation: Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport</title><page.no>24870</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2154)</subtitle><id.no>2154</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>24870</page.no><name role="metadata">McClelland, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McClelland</name><name.id>JK6</name.id><electorate>Barton</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 11 August 2003:</para></talk.start><para>Would the Minister update the information provided in his answer to Question No. 864 of 28 August 2002.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>24870</page.no><name role="metadata">Anderson, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Anderson</name><name.id>4K4</name.id><electorate>Gwydir</electorate><party>NATS</party><role>Minister for Transport and Regional Services</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable member's questions is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>Airservices Australia has advised that operations over the west between 2200 to 2300 followed the next day by operations between 0600 and 0700 occurred on 144 occasions between 1 September 2002 and 30 November 2003.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Social Welfare: Health Cards</title><page.no>24870</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2260 and 2261)</subtitle><id.no>2260 and 2261</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>24870</page.no><name role="metadata">Danby, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Danby</name><name.id>WF6</name.id><electorate>Melbourne Ports</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services, upon notice, on 14 August 2003:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	What are the eligibility rules for the Commonwealth Seniors Health Cards.</para><para>(2)	How many (a) people, (b) men, and (c) women currently hold Seniors Health Care Cards (i) in total, (ii) in each State and Territory, and (iii) in each Federal electoral division.</para><para>(3)	How many (a) people, (b) men, and (c) women does the Government estimate are eligible for Commonwealth Seniors Health Cards (i) in total, (ii) in each State and Territory, and (iii) in each Federal electoral division.</para><para>(4)	What is the total cost to the Commonwealth of Commonwealth Seniors Health Cards.</para><para>(5)	When the cost of the Commonwealth Seniors Health Cards was estimated for the budget was an assumption made about the proportion of people eligible to hold the card who would actually apply for and use the card;

Customs uses an intelligence based risk management approach to the deployment of its resources so as to maximise its coverage of areas assessed as posing a high risk.  In response to September 11 Customs has increased its focus on national security related issues in a range of areas and works closely with other law enforcement and security agencies. </para><para>Coordinating Counter-Terrorism Activity</para><para>Following September 11, Customs formed a Counter-Terrorism Section to coordinate the planning and inter-agency liaison activity associated with the increased priority of national security issues. The section is an internal and external focal point for counter-terrorism representations, liaison and operational response preparedness.  </para><para>Legislation</para><para>The Border Security Legislation Amendment Act 2002 further enhanced the powers of Customs to patrol at airports, to establish and prohibit unauthorised entry to customs controlled areas at airports and to collect information about passengers, crew, and goods entering Australia and airport workers for the purpose of assessing possible risks to the border.  </para><para>Powers to seize in-transit cargo under warrant where a terrorist threat is identified have also been established.</para><para>Passengers</para><para>Within the passenger environment, Customs comes into direct contact with every air and sea passenger arriving or departing Australia. Customs risk assesses these passengers during the inwards and outwards clearance processes. If a person is assessed as posing a threat during this process they are referred to a Customs enforcement officer for further examination. </para><para>Customs deploys a range of technology within the airport environment to assist in the identification of high risk cross border movements. The technology includes ionscan particle detection technology; static x-ray machines; mobile x-ray vans; and monitored closed circuit television coverage of inwards and outwards Customs controlled areas and airside baggage and tarmac areas. This technology is deployed so as to maximise border integrity in relation to passengers and persons employed within the airport environment with access to aircraft and to airside and restricted areas. </para><para>Customs has also deployed three new relocatable, under-airport x-rays for baggage examination in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane international airports. In light of the new security environment Customs has also provided explosive awareness training to its x-ray operators. Radiation pagers to be worn by officers to detect radiological threats within the air passenger environment have also been deployed.</para><para>Customs has received additional Government funding to undertake a program to progressively access the computerised reservation and departure control systems of all airlines operating scheduled passenger flights to and from Australia. These systems contain flight and passenger information, which can assist in the identification of high-risk passengers, thereby allowing the vast majority of law-abiding travellers to complete their Customs formalities with minimum delay.</para><para>Customs has also received funding for the purchase of 400 new document readers. The new readers are able to assess passports for fraudulent features and process traveller information from machine-readable passports. The use of these document readers will assist Customs to identify fraudulent or altered passports by identifying faults that are not visible to a human operator.  </para><para>Air Cargo</para><para>Customs requires facilities receiving air cargo to be licensed under the Customs Act. Licenses are only issued to fit and proper persons who are in management and control of the goods, and physical security arrangements must be place. The facilities are licensed specifically for the holding of import or export goods that are subject to Customs control, the unpacking of import or the packing of export goods, and the examination of those goods by Customs officers. Records of the goods arriving at and leaving these facilities must be retained. </para><para>Customs undertakes compliance monitoring and enforcement activities in relation to the reporting and movement of cargo. This involves audits of licensees' activities, systems based risk assessment on reported cargo, and physical intervention. </para><para>Since July 2002 Customs has significantly increased its level of intervention in air cargo (including 100 per cent of reportable documents in the High-Volume-Low-Value (HVLV) stream). Customs examines air cargo using x-ray, detector dogs, ion scan or physical inspection. Customs also examines 100 per cent of incoming postal articles. Customs has deployed radiation pagers to be worn by officers involved in examining air cargo to detect radiological threats.</para><para>Customs has been working in conjunction with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) to develop technology to inspect air cargo. The Government has recently announced additional funding to conduct a field trial of this new freight screening technology to assess its suitability for use within the Australian aviation sector.</para><para>Customs will construct a facility in Brisbane to trial world-first neutron technology developed by CSIRO that promises rapid detection of explosives and other threats in air cargo more effectively than conventional x-ray systems. The technology is non-intrusive, minimising the impact of security on the rapid movement demanded by the air freight industry. It is estimated the technology will scan an air freight container in less than two minutes. Import and export air cargo containers in Brisbane are to be screened at the facility.</para><para>Sea Cargo</para><para>All inwards sea cargo is screened and risk assessed by Customs. This includes assessment in relation to potential terrorist threats. The risk assessment process identifies cargo posing a higher risk that is then sent for examination.</para><para>Customs has established Container Examination Facilities (CEFs) in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Fremantle to assist in the examination of sea cargo. CEFs utilise advanced x-ray technology to scan the contents of shipping containers in a few minutes. Once all facilities are operating at full capacity, Customs examination of shipping containers will have increased twenty-fold to a minimum of 80,000 containers annually. </para><para>After a container is x-rayed in a CEF, it may undergo further examination using other x-ray technology, ion scanning equipment, drug detector dogs, or be fully unpacked and physically inspected. These methods of examination are also used to examine sea cargo containers in those ports that do not have a CEF.</para><para>Customs Coastwatch and the National Marine Unit</para><para>Coastwatch Dash-8 aircraft patrol and facilitate rapid responses to threats to the border. The Government has provided additional funding to increase the Dash 8 fleet flying hours by twenty percent or 1600 hours per year. This funding has enabled Coastwatch to resume the most critical parts of the standing strategic surveillance program, foregone as a result of the need to provide increased coverage of high risk areas in the north and north-west of Australia. </para><para>Australian Customs also operates a fleet of eight hi-tech, purpose-built Bay Class vessels, which patrol Australian waters in conjunction with the Navy's Fremantle Class Patrol Boats and the Airforces' P3 Orion. Increased Government funding has allowed Customs to double the number of seagoing crew on these vessels, leading to a potential 2,400 sea days per annum.</para><para>Additional funding was also received to enhance the communications capability of Customs Coastwatch using the Inmarsat (international maritime satellite) system. In addition to voice transfer, the Inmarsat satellite system allows reliable, high-speed transmission of data and imagery between the fitted surveillance aircraft, the Coastwatch National Surveillance Centre, the Department of Defence and client agencies. This capability assists in analysis of situations and supports operational decision making. The provision of a common communications capability also allows for the exchange of surveillance information, particularly between Customs Coastwatch aircraft and those similarly fitted surface assets that respond to a sighting.</para><para>Investigation of current and emerging technology options and their application has long been a part of the Customs Coastwatch approach. A Development Section has been set up to focus in this area, with an officer being seconded from the Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO) to assist in this task.  </para><para>Customs Coastwatch and Defence have common interests in maritime surveillance and work together in relevant trials and analyses. Examples of recent Defence trials where Customs Coastwatch has been involved include:</para><para>	the Global Hawk unmanned aerial vehicle</para><para>	the High Frequency Surface Wave Radar trials off Darwin; and</para><para>	the trial of unmanned aerial vehicle off the Northern Territory.</para><para>Customs Coastwatch is planning to undertake additional trials of new technology. These trials will evaluate a number of satellite surveillance options, acoustic sensors and improved electro-optic systems. In addition, with funding provided in the 2002 Budget, Customs, with the Department of Defence, is conducting a three-year operational evaluation of High Frequency Surface Wave Radar technology that can detect targets beyond the horizon. The system will be trialled in the Torres Strait. </para><para>Sea Ports and Shipping</para><para>Customs has stepped up its surveillance at sea ports by initiating a program of 24-hour ports patrols, increased use of closed-circuit television and pursuing pre-arrival information about vessels and crew. </para><para>Customs now monitors 56 port areas and 88 separate wharves around Australia 24 hours a day, seven days a week, using a sophisticated national closed circuit television networks.</para><para>Customs has significantly increased its boarding of first port of arrival vessels from 44 per cent in 2001-2002 to 68 per cent in 2002-2003. In the first quarter of this year, Customs first port of arrival boarding reached a high of 72 per cent. This increased level of boarding is in response to the changed security environment and the recognition that some vessels and crew could pose a greater risk than they did in the past. Crew lists for all vessels arriving in Australia are screened and risk assessed.</para><para>On-going Assessment of New Technology</para><para>Customs actively monitors developments in technology through links with suppliers, research and development agencies and academic experts. Customs is currently evaluating several technologies capable of detecting explosives, chemical or biological warfare agents. These include portable and mobile gas chromatograph-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) systems, specialised ion mobility spectrometers (IMS) systems, based on antibody reaction, and Raman spectrometers. </para><para>The IMS equipment for chemical agent detection is undergoing testing and programming. It is anticipated that some of this equipment will be deployed in early 2004. IMS equipment capable of simultaneously detecting drugs and explosives is undergoing field trial. If successful, they will be acquired for deployment in early 2004. An antibody-based explosive and drug detection desktop system is scheduled for trial in January 2004.</para><para>The availability of the GC-MS systems has been delayed by product development issues at the manufacturers.

The official `on-air' date for the transmission of SBS' digital television service to Bendigo on UHF channel 28 was 1 November 2003, however, test transmissions of this service commenced from 1 October 2003. It is standard practice to test broadcasting services in advance of their official `on-air' date.</para><para>(2)	No. The potential for co-channel interference between the Bendigo SBS digital service and the Melbourne SBS analog service was not identified in the Australian Broadcasting Authority's relevant Digital Channel Plan as an expected phenomenon. As such, I am advised that SBS did not advise the previous Minister of this potential when it submitted its implementation plan for the extension of its digital service to Bendigo to him for approval.</para><para>(3)	I was not aware of any SBS reception problems in the Romsey area prior to the Member for Burke raising the matter in Parliament. Subsequent investigations have revealed that, as at 11 December 2003, neither the Department of Commun-ications, Information Technology and the Arts, the Australian Broadcasting Authority nor SBS have received any written complaints from Romsey residents (who, I understand, number about 3000) regarding this matter. SBS did, however, indicate that it had received two telephone complaints that appeared to be directly related to the situation the Member for Burke has described.</para><para>(4) 	I am advised by SBS that no changes are planned in relation to SBS' current television transmission arrangements for Bendigo and Melbourne.</para><para>While the Australian Broadcasting Authority has suggested SBS could consider reducing the power of its Bendigo digital service towards Romsey or seek a new channel for the service, the disadvantages associated with these options would appear to significantly outweigh any benefit the two known complainants would derive. The Bendigo digital service is intended to serve in excess of 68,000 people. A reduction in power or channel change for this service is likely to result in a reduced number of people being able to access SBS' digital service. SBS believes that channel 28 represents the best channel available for its digital service from a coverage perspective.</para><para>In Victoria, available channels are limited because of the number of television services throughout the populated areas. While every effort has been made by the Australian Broadcasting Authority to minimise interference, it has not been possible to remove all potential for interference to occur during the simulcast period due to spectrum scarcity. (The simulcast period is the period in which both analog and digital television services are transmitted within a market (and, potentially, adjacent markets) prior to the analog service being eventually switched off.) The co-channel interference some Romsey residents are currently experiencing will not be present when the conversion to digital television transmission is completed and SBS' Melbourne analog service is switched off.</para><para>SBS has suggested that affected residents should consult a local antenna technician about what options are available for restoring their SBS reception. It has further suggested that such residents might wish to consider purchasing or renting a receiver that would enable them to watch SBS' Melbourne digital television service on channel 29. Should the Member for Burke's constituents have any queries in relation to this advice, I would suggest that they contact SBS on 1800 500 727 (freecall - asking for Transmission Services) between 9am and 5pm AEST Monday to Friday.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Aviation: Airport Noise Levels</title><page.no>24889</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2839)</subtitle><id.no>2839</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>24889</page.no><name role="metadata">Organ, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Organ</name><name.id>BNL</name.id><electorate>Cunningham</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 3 December 2003:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Is he aware of a recent article in New Scientist which reported that if aircraft line up with the runway as far as 17 kilometres away and descend from an altitude of 4000 feet at a steady 3 angle of descent they can more than halve the acoustic energy that reaches the ground.</para><para>(2)	Would a similar regime be an appropriate noise reduction strategy for Australian airports; if not, why not.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>24889</page.no><name role="metadata">Anderson, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Anderson</name><name.id>4K4</name.id><electorate>Gwydir</electorate><party>NATS</party><role>Minister for Transport and Regional Services</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Yes, I am aware of the article and the related approach procedures. </para><para>(2)	In Australia we already use a similar but modified Continuous Decent Approach (CDA) procedure at suitable airports, when conditions permit.
