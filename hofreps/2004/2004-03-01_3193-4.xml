In particular, the final report of Dr David Kay to the President of the United States and the United States Congress consolidates the committee's conclusion that there was unlikely to be large stocks of weapons of mass destruction—certainly none readily deployable. At one level, the accuracy of the prewar intelligence on Iraq must be judged against this reality.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The committee's terms of reference asked it to examine the nature, accuracy and independence of prewar intelligence and the accuracy and completeness of the government's presentation of that information to this parliament and to the people of Australia. In the course of its inquiry, the committee held one public hearing and a number of private hearings with the intelligence agencies. Twenty-four submissions were received. The submissions from the intelligence agencies outlined, by way of extracts, the assessments that were made on Iraq prior to the war. The Director-General of ONA assured the committee that these extracts were representative—`a reasonable reflection of what was said to government'. Chapter 2 of the report quotes the assessments at length so that readers can get a clear sense of what was being said in the agencies' own words, because assessments are very specifically worded and cannot be easily summarised.</para><para>On the question of independence, the committee was unable to make definitive pronouncements. Most of the intelligence relating to Iraq came from overseas sources, particularly our major intelligence-sharing partners—the US and the UK. The Australian agencies said that they saw all the intelligence, both raw and assessed, and were therefore able to make their own judgments. They also assured the committee that the intelligence-sharing arrangements were good. However, they claimed not to know until very late about the dissenting views within the US agencies on issues such as the claims about uranium from Africa, because the classified US National Intelligence Estimate was not supplied to them for four months after its US `release' in October 2002. Moreover, agencies did not appear to be completely clear about what was happening inside the British Joint Intelligence Committee as the September dossier was being developed. This may not be surprising.</para><para>The volume of material on Iraq coming to the agencies from all sources was increasing—a tenfold increase in reports just prior to the war—although it is notable that the actual number of reports underpinning this percentage was small. Only two in 10 reports came from tested sources, and it was not clear how many actual sources were involved in this increased reporting. The committee was unable to examine the quality and clarity of this information received from overseas. Nevertheless, it was clear from the assessments received that the Australian agencies, particularly the DIO, remained more cautious than their larger overseas counterparts.</para><para>Both Australian agencies reported directly to ministers and the Prime Minister. As far as independence from internal political pressure is concerned, the Australian agencies denied any political pressure. The committee noted this and accepted it. However, the committee was aware of a sudden and as yet unexplained change in the assessments provided by ONA between 12 and 13 September 2002. The assessment of 13 September was made at the request of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and was the basis of government speeches. The change marks a divergence in assessments between ONA and DIO, and DIO commented in their submission that `the final product was not formally cleared by the contributing agencies'. This was the only hint the committee received of any dispute between the agencies.</para><para>With respect to accuracy, hindsight is, of course, a wonderful thing. Assessing the accuracy of the intelligence was complicated by the moving feast of revelations that has been occurring during the past 12 months. The committee looked at as much information as it could. It considered the evidence and reports of the British Intelligence and Security Committee and the British parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee. It examined all the evidence made public by the Hutton inquiry, although that report was not issued until well after the committee had finalised and adopted its own report. It followed the wealth of public commentary by news organisations from around the world. Our conclusion was that the assessments of the Australian intelligence community were more moderate and cautious than those of the partner agencies in the US and the UK. However, despite their caution, insofar as they thought there were any weapons of mass destruction left in Iraq, it is possible they overstated their case.</para><para>It should be noted that up to 13 September 2002 both Australian analytical agencies had similar views. They both spoke of small stocks of WMD, degraded and declining capacity, inconclusive and patchy evidence, and disputes overseas regarding aluminium tubes. As the war approached, the Defence Intelligence Organisation continued to be sceptical and in hindsight provided the most accurate assessments. These are summarised in chapter 4 of the report. The DIO argued that Iraqi possession of WMD was `possible' and the rebuilding of capacity was `likely'; however, right up to the war they assessed that there were no nuclear weapons and there was no evidence of production of chemical or biological weapons, no intelligence on the location of WMD and no reliable intelligence that Saddam had delegated authority to use chemical or biological weapons in the event of war. It appeared that the ONA, particularly after 13 September, was more ready to extrapolate a threatening scenario from historical experience, more ready to accept the new and mostly untested intelligence and more ready to see the rebuilding of dual-use infrastructure and mobile facilities as indicating the concealment of new production and the consequent possession by Iraq of WMD.</para><para>It seemed to the committee that the judgments made about the strategic circumstances in Iraq—factors underpinning many of the assessments—did not take full account of Iraq's recent history; namely, the 1991 Gulf War and its extensive bombing, the sanctions, the inspections and the further bombing in 1998. I am reminded of a previous so-called intelligence failure: the failure of Western intelligence to recognise the potential for collapse in the Soviet Union. To paraphrase some famous lines, Iraq in 2002, like the Soviet Union then, was like `a broken spring in the factory yard, rust clinging to a form that strength had left, hard and curled and ready to snap'. Much credence was given to the prevailing view that UNSCOM inspections, despite their being determined, meticulous and intrusive, had not been effective. While these matters might underpin assessments, they are, of course, also matters for advice to government from the broader policy departments. The committee did not pursue this issue as it fell outside its terms of reference. The committee also concluded that assessments that suggested there was a continuing interest in WMD—and this was the view of both Australian agencies—were valid.</para><para>On the accuracy and completeness of the government's presentation, the committee found that the presentation by the Australian government was more moderate and more measured than that of its alliance partners. The government did not rely entirely on the intelligence from the Australian intelligence agencies for the speeches it made prior to the war. Information came from a number of sources: directly from the US National Intelligence Estimate and the UK dossiers, and from UNSCOM and UNMOVIC reports. The Office of National Assessments checked speeches for accuracy but, where the speeches relied on direct overseas sources, they were checked for the accuracy of the transcription, not the content itself. It was not clear to the committee whether the government had questioned the obvious change in ONA assessments in late 2002. Clearly, problems with intelligence-sharing arrangements and intelligence handling have become apparent as a result of this experience. Correcting those problems will be an important challenge for the future. Good intelligence is too important.</para><para>The committee would like to reiterate the view that there are limits to which intelligence can and should be used. Intelligence is not an exact science and never provides a complete picture. It is fragmentary, indicative and speculative, suggestive rather than definitive. When the ONA was established in 1977, it was envisaged that there had to be a protective barrier between the assessments of agencies and the political process. This needs to be reaffirmed. Broader issues of Australia's intelligence-sharing arrangements with partner agencies also need to be re-examined in the light of the apparent failure of, or the potential for possible interference with, intelligence in these domains.</para><para>In the light of its findings, and noting the inherent limitations on any parliamentary inquiry, the committee has recommended that there should be an independent assessment of the performance of the intelligence agencies, conducted by an experienced former intelligence expert with full access to all the material, which will report to the National Security Committee of cabinet and which, in the light of the matters raised— <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>25369</page.no><name role="metadata">Beazley, Kim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEAZLEY</name><name.id>PE4</name.id><electorate>Brand</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—There is a great deal in the chairman's tabling statement with which I agree. He was not able to get out the remainder of that recommendation for an inquiry, but it will be obvious from the report. It is also obvious from what has appeared in the press. As he would no doubt have done had he had an extra couple of minutes, I express the thanks of the Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD to Margaret Swieringa and Charles Vagi, who did the bulk of the work on the report and assembled it all for us. We are indeed very grateful for their efforts, as we are grateful for the efforts of Tiana Di Iulio and Daniel Miletic, who also assisted.</para></talk.start><para>Australia did not go to war because intelligence made available to the Australian government through its agencies suggested a clear and immediate danger was posed by Iraqi WMD either directly or through passage to terrorist organisations. However, Australians were entitled to think that those were the reasons we went to war, given the cases presented by the Prime Minister and his ministers. Well before such intelligence hardened up in the latter part of 2002—and even then it did not harden sufficiently to present a clear and compelling case—the Prime Minister had declared his support for American action if it occurred. By the middle of 2002 the Prime Minister had gone clearly to a domestic political pitch that sought to box any critical comments by his domestic political opponents to a war course as anti-American and a danger to the alliance. Having thus positioned himself he placed his government and his country on the coat-tails of any actions our allies undertook. To have abandoned that course would not have killed the US alliance; it has more substance to it than that. The US, however, would have lost his address as firmly as it lost David Lange's back in the 1980s. That was what was at stake. We can all make our judgments on the value of that.</para><para>Though our intelligence community may well have got some judgments wrong—and, as this report points out, there is a need for close analysis of its interpretative capabilities and the way it advises government—it is innocent of any responsibility for a determination to go to war. That responsibility lies with politicians. Another more important responsibility lies with politicians: they must not shift blame to agencies which are vital to the struggle with international terrorism. That struggle is an intelligence and police struggle. To discredit them where they do not deserve it is to weaken us in that struggle.</para><para>What this report makes amply clear is that there were deficiencies in intelligence and in our intelligence structures. There was never, however—particularly from the Defence Intelligence Organisation but also the Office of National Assessments—emphatically delivered hard advice without some form of qualification attached. The exaggeration and the sense of immediacy was the work of politicians, outside the intelligence advice they were being presented with—at least from the Australian agencies and, I would suggest, their American and British counterparts. Insofar as that internal intelligence reporting came close on rare occasions to government presentation, it can be seen, at least in part, as a response to unusual pressures placed on them by the atmosphere created by the political leadership—not direct pressure by the political leadership—which was determined on a course to war.</para><para>Given the self-interested leaking that has occurred of committee findings and conclusions, I would suggest, as a counter to that, diligent attention to chapter 5. It analyses the relevant speeches of ministers against the background of the intelligence they received from our intelligence community. In those speeches a case was presented that suggested the continued existence of a `massive program' of WMD, that quantities unaccounted for were `large' and that, rather than increasing the terrorist threat, action in Iraq would `make it less likely that a devastating terrorist attack will be carried out against Australia'. As the committee finds in paragraph 5.16:</para><quote><para>Therefore, the case made by the government was that Iraq possessed WMD in large quantities and posed a grave and unacceptable threat to the region and the world, particularly as there was a danger that Iraq's WMD might be passed to terrorist organisations.</para></quote><para>But as the committee says in paragraph 5.17:</para><quote><para>This is not the picture that emerges from an examination of all the assessments provided to the Committee by Australia's two analytical agencies.</para></quote><para>The committee also says:</para><quote><para>... accuracy must also encompass whether the picture being presented is complete. Ignoring significant elements of fact or opinion when citing intelligence assessments can have a distorting effect.</para></quote><para>Completely excluded from any minister's presentation were intelligence assessments that war might provoke the circumstances in which WMD might be used or passed on to terrorists. The government, however, in fact received such advice from the intelligence community. Ignoring it was a very big call indeed, given the circumstances of September 11.</para><para>A typical example of distorting effects is shown in paragraph 5.22, where it says that the Prime Minister used materials provided by Saddam Hussein's son-in-law in 1995 as evidence of `a massive program for developing offensive biological weapons—one of the largest and most advanced in the world'. As the committee points out, the bulk of the debriefing of Saddam Hussein's son-in-law pointed to a repeated failure of these programs and the destruction of them in the wake of successful UNSCOM inspections. Rather than being a current assessment of the state of affairs, it was what Saddam Hussein's son-in-law said was the state of affairs, until things were effectively dealt with by UNSCOM inspections.</para><para>The PM now relies on the capture of Hussein and the end of his bloody tyranny as a justification for war. As the committee points out, in the lead-up to war he specifically disclaimed this as an adequate case for war. `The world,' says the Prime Minister, `is a better and safer place without him.' Certainly the world is a better place; whether it is safer is yet to be determined. On the positive side, the Iraqi people do have the chance to develop a democratic and kindly form of government. Countries such as Libya have clearly become more accommodating. It has proved possible for the United States to exit Saudi Arabia and reduce a sense of offence in the worldwide Islamic community. On the negative side, the war has clearly energised reactionary elements in Iran who see new possibilities for influence in Iraq and, more broadly, in the gulf. Taking the focus off Afghanistan, as the war did, has seen the revival of the Taliban and the emergence of war lords prominent in the international drug trade. In Iraq itself new opportunities have been opened up for al-Qaeda. If Iraq becomes a bloody mess of three or more warring groups, with untold innocent casualties, a heavy burden will fall on all of us.</para><para>In a world difficult to understand and where it is hard to determine who our friends and allies will truly be, two things stand out as absolute necessities: firstly, politicians who tell the truth, with an eye to our real national security interests and not to the politically usable; and, secondly, effective intelligence services unpressured by politicians but capable of providing accurate information on our situation. The circumstances of this conflict have not advanced us on either front.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>25371</page.no><name role="metadata">McArthur, Stewart, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McARTHUR</name><name.id>VH4</name.id><electorate>Corangamite</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The member for Fadden ran out of time and, for the record, quoting from the chairman's speech, I would like to read out the final recommendation. He says:</para></talk.start><quote><para>... there should be an independent assessment of the performance of the intelligence agencies, conducted by an experienced former intelligence expert with full access to all the material, which will report to the National Security Committee of Cabinet and which, in the light of the matters raised by the consideration of the pre-war intelligence on Iraq, will recommend any changes that need to take place for the better functioning of the agencies.</para></quote><para>The report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD on <inline font-style="italic">Intelligence on Iraq</inline><inline font-style="italic">'s weapons of mass destruction</inline> is a very important report in that it brings a parliamentary assessment of Australia's intelligence services and their role in the lead-up to the Iraq war. Given the nature of intelligence services in Australia, the UK and the USA, and the desirability of a democracy to demand open and politically accountable answers of their intelligence services on the one hand and the importance of maintaining the integrity and ability to function covertly on the other, this process is fraught with difficulties. On this occasion the committee has worked conscientiously to achieve a balance between these two competing objectives. Along with other members, I express my dismay that contents of the report have apparently reached the public domain prior to its tabling in the House today.</para><para>The references given to the committee were to inquire into the basis of the prewar assessments undertaken by Australia's intelligence agencies and its partner agencies in the USA and the UK prior to 19 March 2003. The key element of the inquiry was addressing the issues of the existence of WMD in Iraq and the capacity and willingness of Iraq to use these weapons.</para><para>The United Nations agency known as UNSCOM undertook inspections of WMD between the 1991 Gulf War and 1998. These inspections did not find definitive evidence of WMD programs. However, it would appear that the chemical weapons program was by far the most extensive and advanced of all Iraq's WMD programs. The biological weapons program of Iraq was the most secretive of its programs and its existence was not acknowledged until July 1995. The report identifies the small quantities of biological agents required to develop lethal WMD which could be used in both military and civilian circumstances. It becomes clear from all the evidence, in particular the UK dossier on Iraq's WMD dated 24 September 2002 and the CIA document of 2002, that Iraq possessed mobile facilities for biological weapons agent production. Given that scenario, in my view it was always going to be difficult to find biological weapons and their production facilities after the war in Iraq.</para><para>The key question facing the USA, the UK and Australia was the assessment by these countries as to whether Iraq would use WMD. The leaders of these countries had to make the difficult judgment of going to war against Iraq based on intelligence reports supplied to the military and political leaders. The report notes that command, control, training and logistics support for deployment and use of biological and chemical weapons was a key component of Iraq's military doctrine.</para><para>In developing an assessment of the Australian intelligence agencies, the parliament should have very much in mind that the Australian agencies depended upon source material from their counterparts in the UK and the USA. The Office of National Assessments and the Defence Intelligence Organisation provided unclassified information to the inquiry which allowed the committee to develop an understanding of their approach and their capacity to reassess foreign intelligence sources. It appeared to the committee that the ONA was cautious in its assessments of information supplied to it from other sources.</para><para>The key element of the report to the parliament is the question of the independence of these intelligence assessments to the Australian government. The committee noted the assurance from the ONA and DIO on the question of their objectivity and independence. It accepts their declaration that there was no overt pressure from the government to change the assessments. In my judgment, this is a key finding of the committee. In assessing the accuracy of the assessments, the report says:</para><quote><para>The Committee is acutely aware that intelligence is not an exact science, that it is often speculative and should be judged in those terms. Intelligence is not evidence. The parts of the jigsaw are never completely there and the information is often suggestive rather than definitive.</para></quote><para>This is a very good description of the way in which intelligence works, unlike that of many of the post-Iraq war commentators, who have the value of hindsight in reaching their conclusions.</para><para>The controversy about the British dossier as published by the British government on 24 September 2002 is well known. In discussing the presentation of prewar intelligence, I support the committee's conclusion that the presentation by the Australian government was more moderate and more measured than either of its alliance partners. The government did not make the claim that Iraq's WMD were deployable in 45 minutes. In the light of the worldwide debate about the effectiveness and functioning of intelligence agencies, I support the recommendation that an independent former intelligence expert with full access to the material should report to the National Security Committee of cabinet. In this way a frank assessment could be made of the Australian agencies, knowing that these recommendations will remain confidential. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>25373</page.no><name role="metadata">McLeay, Leo, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LEO McLEAY</name><name.id>4I4</name.id><electorate>Watson</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—At the beginning of March last year, this House debated the issue of going to war in Iraq as part of the coalition of the willing. In that debate I said I was opposed to the war and that I had never seen so wide a cross-section of the Australian community so opposed to a war—for example, a former President of the Liberal Party, former ADF commanders and former secretaries to the Department of Defence and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Twelve months later, the Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD, of which I am a member, is tabling a report on the intelligence assessments received by the government in the lead-up to that war.</para></talk.start><para>Given that the role of the intelligence agencies has already been widely canvassed, it might be useful to concentrate on the last of the terms of reference given to the committee—that is, the accuracy and completeness of the government's presentation—and on chapter 5 of the report. That term of reference reads:</para><para>d) whether Australia's pre-conflict assessments of Iraq's WMD capability were as accurate and comprehensive as should be expected of information relied on in decisions regarding the participation of the Australian Defence Forces in military conflict.</para><para>The evidence given to the committee by the intelligence agencies, in my opinion, shows that the government's presentation was neither complete nor accurate. The analysis undertaken by Australian agencies provided inconclusive intelligence to support the proposition that Saddam Hussein was a `grave and unacceptable threat'; so, on the government's part, there was a careful process of selection that avoided, in the most part, the agencies' assessments. It was not so much that the Australian intelligence agencies got it wrong but that they were largely ignored by the government except where they could bolster the case for war. Where they could not, other sources were found—for example, the infamous British document and a reliance on gung-ho US documents.</para><para>The committee says in chapter 5 that the government based its argument for going to war not just on intelligence but also on `historical experience, first principle hypotheses, deductive logic, assumption and assertion, as well as specific intelligence'. The government's arguments were carefully crafted—and were faulty. They were based on false historical analysis, false logic, false assumptions and assertions without tested evidence. Senator Hill's reported concern that Australian intelligence agencies were not gung-ho enough suggests that this was a conscious government position.</para><para>In chapter 4, there is a discussion of the problems with the approach that the government adopted. The view that Saddam Hussein had weapons in 1991, had used them and therefore still had them did not take account of the reality in Iraq since 1991—the bombing of Iraqi installations on a number of occasions, the sanctions and the inspections. The government implied that Saddam Hussein would supply al-Qaeda with weapons of mass destruction, the implication being that because the Iraqis were supporting the Palestinians it therefore followed that terrorist groups would get their hands on these weapons. The government did not take account of UK intelligence assessments made before the war that an attack on Iraq would actually increase the al-Qaeda threat.</para><para>The government misused UN information. The fact that UNSCOM and UNMOVIC could not find material led to the idea of massive hidden stockpiles. The government quoted very selectively from the agencies' reports. When UNMOVIC talked about progress, this was ignored. When UNMOVIC inspectors inspected sites and found nothing, this was ignored. Where UNMOVIC questioned or doubted the sourcing of uranium from Africa and the use of aluminium tubes for a nuclear program, it was ignored. When UN debriefs of Saddam Hussein's son-in-law, Kamil Hussein, reported that all weapons had been destroyed in 1991, they were ignored.</para><para>The Prime Minister's speeches talked about compelling evidence and made unequivocal statements about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. This so-called evidence must have come from sources other than Australian agencies, as they were saying pretty much the opposite. The Australian agencies had found stocks to be small and capacity to be degraded. They had found no evidence of any new production after 1991. When asked about the unequivocal statements in the Prime Minister's speeches, the agencies told the committee that they were not necessarily judgments they would have made. The unanimous report of the committee says:</para><quote><para>5.16 Therefore, the case made by the government was that Iraq possessed WMD in large quantities and posed a grave and unacceptable threat to the region and the world, particularly as there was a danger that Iraq's WMD might be passed to terrorist organisations.</para><para>5.17 This is not the picture that emerges from an examination of all the assessments provided to the Committee by Australia's two analytical agencies—</para></quote><para>ONA and DIO.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—The time allotted for statements on this report has expired.

Firstly, it is about the democratisation of wealth: it is about sharing wealth and it is about ensuring that the productivity of our society is shared across the full base of that society, so that those who participate in the creation share in the benefit—and it is about doing so in a way which is different to that provided by just salaries and wages. Secondly, it is about productivity. It is about improving the nation's productivity as a whole, contributing to the sum of wealth for the future and ensuring that people throughout Australia benefit from developments in not just one industry but in all. Thirdly, it is about improving social and industrial harmony. It is about ensuring that people have a stake in their firms—in the places in which they work—and ensuring that the old-style divides some still hanker for between capital and labour cease to exist.

It is clear eyed in its recognition that the conditions available need to be extended over time in order for these programs to take root, to take effect and to have a real impact on the way in which both our microeconomic firms work and the macroeconomic benefits flow as a result of that.</para><para>In looking at this motion, which encourages reforms to improve employee share ownership programs throughout Australia, I want to proceed in three stages.

Thirdly, I want to look at the reforms that are still necessary: what will be the next wave of steps we can take that will show how we can encourage, expand and develop employee share ownership programs further within Australia?</para><para>I mentioned at the outset that there are three main reasons for fostering employee share ownership, but perhaps a little anecdote might illustrate them best. I recently met with Mr David Simmons, the Managing Director of Hills Industries. Hills Industries is a South Australian company which makes, amongst other things, the Hills hoist. It has a highly developed employee share ownership program. Mr Simmons pointed out the benefits of that. What that does is a very simple thing: it allows people to develop their own savings plans, in addition to—not in place of, but in addition to—the superannuation system. So it is about providing workers and participants with the benefits. This is not some highfalutin notion of options for the senior executive but a base for people throughout the firm to participate in the benefits of that firm. It is a simple, very Australian concept in its nature.</para><para>When we look at this notion of democratisation of wealth, we see that under the current government 2.9 million Australians have been introduced to share ownership for the first time, some of them through employee share ownership programs. But more should be introduced through that very scheme. The broadening of the ownership of shares has been one of the great achievements of this government, but the next wave and the next frontier in that process must be, I believe, the broadening of the opportunities for employees to participate in share ownership programs within their own firms.</para><para>The second great reason why you would encourage employee share ownership is, of course, productivity. As David Simmons from Hills Industries mentioned to me, people are interested in the value of their shares. People are interested in the performance of their own company. There is a sense of seeking to participate so as to improve the outcome for the individual, for all employees and for all shareholders. There is a sense of a common purpose which comes from it. I would like to quote on the productivity benefit which the Employee Ownership Group outlines in its recent document, <inline font-style="italic">Employee share ownership in Australia: the future</inline>. In relation to productivity, the Employee Ownership Group states:</para><quote><para>Companies with high levels of employee ownership demonstrate higher measures of commitment to the interests of the business by their employees and, consequently, higher productivity and profit levels, than their peers with lower levels of employee ownership, or none at all.</para></quote><para>Significant evidence is provided to back that up on a statistical, empirical, hard factual basis. </para><para>The third reason for supporting employee share ownership is the question of industrial and social harmony. This is a long-term process; this is a generational process. It is about making the change from some of the old-style confrontation that I used to see in Huntingdale in Victoria when I worked as a storeman and packer on the floor of a warehouse where there was conflict between the two sides and people on one side saw those on the other as the enemy. Employee share ownership programs are part of the long-term process of change; they are part of giving each a stake in the other, and that is what is important here. Employee share ownership is about breaking down the ridiculous 19th century—not even 20th century—notion of a divide between capital and labour. That is old-style thinking, and employee share ownership is a new style way of breaking away from that old-style thinking.</para><para>What are the steps to date that we have taken to try and encourage employee share ownership? The government has done a number of things. What you see is an increase in the rise of employee shares over the course of this government. But, as I say, where there has been a dramatic increase in the total level of shareholders within our society, there have been modest increases in employee share ownership participation. Diversification of shares and broadening the base of shares are the areas which most need to be developed within our society. In particular, the government has developed a number of reforms to help on that front. Firstly, and perhaps most importantly, was the doubling of the tax concessions on qualifying employee share plans—from $500 to $1,000 tax free per year. I state clearly before this House that I believe that threshold has now reached the point where it needs to be raised—and raised significantly. I stand squarely before the House and clearly state that the threshold should be lifted. I make that claim because I believe it is a critical step—perhaps the critical step—in expanding employee share ownership programs.</para><para>There are other things that we also need to look at in terms of steps to be taken as we go forward. I think that there are three important steps above all else which flow from this motion. Firstly, there need to be targeted reforms of tax and corporate law to ensure that employee share ownership programs can more easily spread to all employees in all companies and provide these employees with a mechanism capable of delivering them substantial ownership of the companies in which they work. There are additional steps on both the taxation and corporate law reform front which do need to be considered, and with a group of others we are working to that exact end.</para><para>The second of the great reforms that I believe needs to be undertaken is the development of practical legislation to ensure adequate disclosure and investor protection measures for all employee share ownership programs. If you are going to have these programs, investors and existing shareholders need to be protected. Thirdly, we need to look at the introduction of a new pre-retirement savings vehicle, modelled on the United Kingdom individual savings account, to provide a comparable means of making medium-term savings for those employees who cannot benefit from an employee share ownership program. We saw the beginnings of that with the announcements from the Treasurer last week. He is developing the notion of a lifetime superannuation approach for people with or without work. That is very much in line with what this motion is talking about. Above all else, the vision we have is of people being able to participate, own and contribute. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

I remember beginning that inquiry with probably a similar view to that of the member for Flinders—and the member for Rankin, who will speak later in this debate. But as the committee got into the nitty-gritty of the inquiry, it became clear that encouraging employees to participate in employee share ownership in family, private or unlisted companies was fraught with danger and was very poor financial and investment advice. There are very sound financial reasons why this is the case. In private unlisted companies, employee share ownership can be attractive to company owners, directors and executives, limiting their taxation liabilities, but as far as employees on the floor are concerned, it has little to offer. Commonsense tells us that, if an employee receives the major part of their income from wages and salaries, it would be foolish to invest savings in the same company. No financial adviser would advise a client to put all their eggs in one basket.</para></talk.start><para>The aim of share ownership is to supplement income from wages and salaries. What is likely to occur with employee share ownership in private unlisted companies is income substitution rather than income supplementation. If share ownership is the goal—and there is nothing wrong with that—workers would be wiser to invest in the top 50 or 100 Australian companies. That would be safer. There is little or no flexibility in the transportability of shares when employees, as many do these days, shift their employment 10 or 15 times during their working lifetimes. The same employee share ownership in publicly listed companies causes no such difficulty. During the parliamentary inquiry, the enthusiasts for employee share ownership were overwhelmingly marketers of the schemes. Certainly there were enthusiastic company owners and executives, but not as many as you might think. As far as employees were concerned, I detected almost no genuine enthusiasm at all; in fact, they displayed sound commonsense. If they were interested in a share portfolio, they wanted their investment to be varied and to be in the top publicly listed companies—and, of course, they were right to want that.</para><para>In part 2 of his motion, the member for Flinders notes the failure of Corporations Law in this country. That is a far more complex issue, requiring more than merely noting that the existing legislative and regulatory regime is inhibiting the spread of ESOPs. In part 3 of the motion, the member acknowledges that tax provisions favour only token employee ownership. Again, he is correct, but have we asked the wrong question? The question should be: who is advantaged by the current provisions? Clearly, it is the marketers of schemes and executives, not employees. Part 4 of the motion encourages the partnership in business between owners and employees. That is good, but ESOPs are not necessarily the right or the only mechanism. The most effective incentives are related to income and time, not investment policy.</para><para>In parts 5 and 6, the member's motion encourages the spread of ESOPs and states that they belong to a spectrum of pre-retirement vehicles largely undeveloped in Australia. The member's enthusiasm for employee share ownership is admirable. However, any financial adviser worth their salt would steer employees interested in share ownership away from investment in a company in which they work. Sensible advice would be to vary the portfolio, not limit it, and to invest in the top 50 or top 100 publicly listed companies rather than private concerns. You do not have to be a rocket scientist to be involved in the stock market.</para><para>Part 8 of the member's motion, which calls for adequate disclosures and investor protection, is fine. But it is difficult enough to achieve that in the public arena, let alone in private companies. Part 9 of the motion, calling for the introduction of new pre-retirement savings vehicles for employees who cannot benefit from ESOPs, has considerable merit and is worthy of further investigation by a parliamentary committee. As to whether that vehicle should be modelled on Britain's Individual Savings Account, I have not yet developed a view. Although I have a very negative view of ESOPs in private listed companies, I congratulate the member for Flinders for bringing it forward in private members' business. It is an important debate and it needs to be further explored. Perhaps it could be explored by asking the Treasurer about it instead of the nonsense he trotted out last week.</para><para>There is a lack of savings in the country. You could just raise that superannuation levy up to 15 or 20 per cent. That would be a good move. You could legislate to stop those sharks in superannuation funds taking a third of the growth of an investment in superannuation in fees and legislate to cut that down to 0.2 per cent instead of the current two per cent. That would then protect workers' entitlements and workers' pre-retirement savings. There should be none of this nonsense about fiddling at the edges. Let us get to the guts of the issue, which is to increase the superannuation levy to at least 15 and maybe 20 per cent and stop the rorting of superannuation funds. <inline font-style="italic">(T</inline><inline font-style="italic">ime expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>25379</page.no><name role="metadata">Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP</name><name role="display">Dr SOUTHCOTT</name><name.id>TK6</name.id><electorate>Boothby</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The previous speaker, the member for Port Adelaide, has missed one of the important points of employee share ownership plans, which is that they provide a very important motivating force for employees. If you asked employees, `Is it better to have some personal stake in the company that you work for?' most employees would say yes. I am pleased to support the motion.</para></talk.start><para>I want to speak about how employee ownership plans have benefited a firm in my own electorate—Hills. As many members will know, Hills was the creator of the innovative Hills rotary hoist, back in 1946. Hills was able to take advantage of the changes that this government made to the tax concessions for employee share ownership plans and introduce a very generous employee share ownership plan, which is available to all its workers. Most of the well-known employee share ownership plans are in the banks and large public companies. Hills is a little bit different. It is principally a manufacturing company and is not typical of many of the companies where we see employee ownership plans.</para><para>Recently, a large number of the workers wrote to me, highlighting concerns about the future of the scheme. One writer from North Brighton said:</para><quote><para>... the Hills plan offers shares in Hills at no cost to all employees up to a maximum value of $1,000 per year. The value of shares issued is linked to the profitability of Hills, which I believe is a good message.</para></quote><para>The writer then urged support for an exemption to changes to proposed international accounting standards. The changes are apparently aimed principally at moderating what are considered to be excessive executive benefits. The problem is that most of the employees at Hills would be on modest incomes. They are not receiving large executive benefits or anything of that sort. They do value their employee share ownership plan. Most of these people were not shareholders before. They now at least have some shares, and that has enabled them to take an interest in what is going on in the stock market and so on.</para><para>The concern is that some of the changes may have unintended consequences of impacting on share ownership plans, such as those at Hills. It is an issue I have taken up with the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, and I am pleased that his officers are now talking with Treasury on this matter. Employee share ownership plans are to be encouraged. I was interested to read that the Leader of the Opposition is a great supporter of them. Most people would think it is odd that a man who has opposed every tranche of the privatisation of Telstra, and opposes any further privatisation of Telstra, would be so committed to widespread share ownership, but then contradictions like this are nothing new for the member for Werriwa.</para><para>The previous speaker mentioned that back in 2000 the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Workplace Relations released its report called entitled <inline font-style="italic">Shared endeavours: an inquiry into employee share ownership in </inline><inline font-style="italic">Australia</inline>.

Its recommendations included taxation changes, improved monitoring arrangements and greater promotion of employee share ownership. In last year's budget, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations announced the formation of an employee share ownership development unit, committing $1.7 million of funding over four years for the project. The unit will work with employers and employees to help with the design and implementation of employee share schemes and carry out related promotional work. It will also collect information about the barriers to participation in share ownership. Therefore, its role in responding to the concerns of employees at Hills will be extremely important. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Preserving, boosting and widening the coverage of employee share ownership will be vital as part of the investment strategies for Australian workers in the years ahead. No, of course we do not want everyone to put all their eggs in one basket; they should have diversified investments. But I think it is important for employees to have the opportunity to have at least a very small stake in the enterprise in which they work. I welcome the motion. I urge members of the cabinet and my parliamentary colleagues to take appropriate steps to support the continued growth of employee share ownership schemes. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>25380</page.no><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Dr EMERSON</name><name.id>83V</name.id><electorate>Rankin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There is nothing wrong with employee share ownership. It is a good idea and a good concept. But why do taxpayers have to foot the bill all the time? Why can't we just have Liberal Party members standing up saying, `We don't need to call on the taxpayer every time we come up with a scheme'? Is there anything remotely like the integrity of the income tax base? Does that ring a bell for members opposite at all? The fact is that we looked at this through the <inline font-style="italic">Shared endeavours: </inline><inline font-style="italic">an i</inline><inline font-style="italic">nquiry into employee share ownership in Australian enterprises</inline> report<inline font-style="italic">. </inline>Labor produced a dissenting report because so much that is peddled about employee share ownership plans insofar as tax concessions are concerned is snake oil or worse: blatant contrived tax avoidance schemes. That is why Labor members dissented from this report. It was not unanimous at all—we dissented.</para></talk.start><para>There have been many spurious arguments. We heard from the member for Flinders about productivity. When we were producing this report, it was embarrassing. We were sitting through day after day of deliberation, trying to find some link between productivity and employee share ownership plans. People were twiddling their thumbs and looking at their shoes because we could not find any links. Of course, the only people who can are those who are promoting the schemes—they find these links, but when they are subjected to a bit of parliamentary scrutiny there are no such links at all. </para><para>In relation to the member's third claimed benefit—industrial harmony—imagine the workers at Mount Isa Mines when they come into one of the schemes at $1.40 a share and the share price falls to 90c or 80c. There is not much industrial harmony there. I wonder how much industrial harmony there was at Ansett, which had a large employee share ownership plan, but of course went belly up.</para><para>This report is full of recommendations to promote blatant tax avoidance. Most appallingly, recommendation 31 recommends that liability for taxation occur at the time of disposal, not after 10 years. This would send out the cessation event to the never-never so that company executives would be able to get in on these rorts and defer their tax liability indefinitely. That is what government members, led by the current Minister for Education, Science and Training, wanted. Fortunately, Treasury prevailed.</para><para>The member for Flinders said, `There have been these great government responses to this report.' Do you know what the government's response to the report was? They set up a web site. That is what they did. They did not even increase the concession from $1,000 to $2,000 as the current minister for education had wanted—the government did not even do that. So I say to the member for Flinders: do not come into this parliament saying, `The government has done all these things.' If you think setting up a web site is a great achievement, then go for your life—I suppose at least it has not cost the sort of revenue that would have been at risk because of recommendation 31, peddled by snake oil merchants on the government side. The member for Flinders has not been in parliament that long, but if he had he would have gone through this and known this—but, no, they have to keep reinventing it.</para><para>I wonder where the member for Flinders got the nine parts of this motion. I am sure that he did not write them. I am sure one of those peddlers of employee share ownership plans did. I have here a <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record of the hearings. We asked the Taxation Office during the hearings whether they were aware of any more aggressively marketed schemes. They said, `No; we are right on top of that.' One of our members then tabled one and said, `What do you think about that?' They said, `That is very good information. We'll have a look at it.' From that time onwards, the tax office has been trying to clamp down on these aggressively marketed tax rorts. The recommendations in this document—the government report—would keep those rorts going and in fact extend them.</para><para>At no time in his speech did the member for Flinders mention a concern of the Managing Director of Hills Industries, Mr David Simmons, that the government's proposal to adopt the new international accounting standard requiring the expensing of shares given by a company to employees would result in Hills abandoning their employee share scheme. This is because the Hills board fears that their results will be downgraded by analysts when compared to the results of similar companies which do not have employee share schemes. The question is: what are the government doing to address the concerns of David Simmons and the employees at Hills? The answer is: not very much, just as they have done nothing to address the recommendations of this inquiry. You do not hear me say it too often, but I say good on the government for not picking up the shonky recommendations in this shonky report that would just mean that more taxpayers' money would go down the drain, lining the pockets of company executives instead of doing what ought to be done—that is, spreading employee share ownership among genuine working people but not at extra expense to taxpayers.

The recommendation—which I think is a sensible one—would, rather than allowing either a $1,000 exemption from taxation or a deferral proposal, wed the two together so that the first $1,000 is exempt and any amount above $1,000 can be deferred until realisation, at which point the tax should apply. I think these are realistic suggestions that ensure that, rather than being tied down to a deferred or an exempt program, through a mixture of the two people have more flexibility to both defer and be exempt from taxation. It would be a significant advance on the current arrangements. I see a lot of commonsense in it. It would spread it to firms which need to be more flexible.</para><para>The percentage of Australians currently owning shares directly increased from nine per cent in 1996 under the Labor Party to 20 per cent in 1997 and then to 37 per cent in 2002, with a further 13 per cent owning shares indirectly through superannuation. These are great records. Apart from the family home, Australians have become the greatest owners of their own industries and their own businesses. That is what we need.

He only needed to go to the <inline font-style="italic">Adelaide Review</inline> of March 2001 to read some very insightful comments about how employee share ownership plans are working within the country. The article cites the submission from BHP to the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Workplace Relations. Their submission states:</para></talk.start><quote><para>It needs to be recognised that, even though the nature of their equity participation may be similar in some respects, employees can be in quite different circumstances from the non employee shareholders as co-owners in a company. In some ways, employees may be classed as disadvantaged investors.</para><para>Unlike the outside shareholder, employees do not have the same choices in terms of type of investment, timing of the investment, freedom from restriction in trading nor an entirely uninfluenced context for making their investment decisions under an employer sponsored equity plan. The employee is offered an investment opportunity only in the employer company, at a time and on conditions that generally are set by the employer. Further, the employee may face restrictions in terms of both minimum and maximum holding periods as well as ... restrictions on trading to limited windows following periodic profit announcement. The employees may also feel influenced positively or negatively by the options of their colleagues and by their attitudes to their work situation.</para></quote><para>That is BHP's own submission to the committee inquiry that has been referred to. BHP recognise the shortfalls with employee share ownership plans. And they were not even making recommendations or contradictions about taxation; they were making comments about the restrictions employers place on these funds. Nobody on this side of the fence is saying that employees should be restricted from investing in their own corporations. We have been in support of it.</para><para>The majority of these employee share ownership plans have been instigated by unions. Very few have come about through employers alone. I have been involved in negotiating four or five of them at the major banks. We got the banks to give to each employee $1,000 worth of shares for free. It was gratis. It was a very good idea. We proposed and supported it. Why $1,000? Surprise, surprise! Because of the taxation benefit. But that did not give the bank employee with $1,000 worth of shares any more advantage over the company's direction or decision making. I have been to enough AGMs of shareholders. I am not sure whether any of you have sat through them. They are as boring as all get out. I have seen about 500 people on the floor vote down a motion. There is nothing more dispiriting when sitting in an AGM fought out by shareholders and employees—and the union is there too because we are shareholders in these companies too—than seeing all these people voting down bad policy by directors and then seeing these policies still get up. They always get up because the institutional investors hold all the cards.</para><para>If you want to talk about ensuring greater participation in the work force, listen to employees. Do things that employees say and do things that the mum and dad shareholders say that might turn around some of these companies. It has not stopped the thousands of employees losing their jobs within the banks that I represented before entering this place from owning shares in those companies. Most of them said: `The only thing I will walk away with is the shares. I'll keep the shares because they're still going up, but they are going up at the expense of my job.' Every time a job was lost, the share price went up. You need to sit here and think about what that means to an employee. They do not have the ability to say, `Please, don't go to the boards and the investment community and say that we are rationalising by losing jobs.'

Some of the debate we are hearing from those on the other side of the floor is on the premise that the glass that is half full is actually half empty. Sure, there are some problems and difficulties to overcome in these schemes, but it does not mean that it is not worth while pushing to improve them.</para></talk.start><para>I fully support the nine elements of this motion and the proposition that all reasonable steps should be taken to remove legislative and regulatory inhibitors to this scheme being fully utilised across a wider spread of businesses, including unlisted and private corporations, where the appropriate safeguards can be employed. In particular, if corporate owners and managers are to offer employee share ownership plans to employees then tax measures should encourage rather than discourage acquisitions of larger shareholdings. I listened to the member for Port Adelaide, who spoke at the beginning of this debate. I think that there is no suggestion that this would become the sole means of saving. He would perhaps have people listening think that that is what the motion is about. It is simply another vehicle.</para><para>Talking about the savings aspect of this, there are two very substantial reasons why we should do more to encourage investment in employee share ownership plans. Appropriately designed plans do offer employees an opportunity to become co-owners of the business they work for. I hear all of this carry-on about the fact that there was no link in the report to ownership and productivity. But there was nothing to refute it either. The previous speaker, the member for Chisholm, was arguing against herself there. She said there was no evidence provided in the report that linked those two things, yet she said that no definitive study had been done in Australia that could demonstrate a link between ownership and productivity. So I think that is an argument against them.</para><para>This proposition provides incentives for employees to take a keener interest in the business in which they work. It also has the potential, I think, to lift productivity. That argument has not been satisfactorily refuted, so I think we can continue to put that proposition. It stands to reason. Now that Australia does have very strong productivity—and there have certainly been great gains in that area—this could certainly be another way to further improve productivity in this country.</para><para>Lifting productivity is important. It is important to demonstrate the benefits of a free enterprise system of wealth creation and distribution. My colleague the member for Flinders expressed to me, while we were sitting here, his surprise at Labor members' vehement opposition to his motion. I am not surprised at all. I think that many of the unions would probably not want to improve labour relations between employees and employers because they might be out of a job if that were the case. I cannot imagine that they would be going for it in a big way.</para><para>This motion highlights the importance of the employee share ownership plan as a way of providing a pre-retirement savings vehicle. I think that is an important part of this. The motion also recognises that employee share ownership plans as pre-retirement savings vehicles remain undeveloped in Australia. Given that the recently released paper entitled <inline font-style="italic">Australia's demographic challenges</inline> highlighted both the economic and social challenges facing an ageing population, we need a scheme that vigorously encourages savings and other schemes—not just one, but probably a number of different options. This could be one of them.</para><para>The second reason for ensuring that these schemes work efficiently and effectively is that they can be an important source of capital for business. I note that a Western Australian company was built up on this basis. Small businesses have a hard time getting access to capital and this is one way they could do that. From an employee and employer perspective, it is important that the schemes go beyond token schemes. Building up these schemes to become substantial vehicles for saving will require carefully targeted reforms of taxation and corporations legislation as well as regulations to ensure adequate disclosure and investor protection measures. No-one would suggest them on any other basis. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>25385</page.no><name role="metadata">Edwards, Graham, MP</name><name role="display">Mr EDWARDS</name><name.id>83R</name.id><electorate>Cowan</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Like the member for Port Adelaide, I congratulate the member for Flinders on bringing forward this motion on employee share ownership and initiating this debate. It is indeed, as the member for Port Adelaide said, a very important debate.

This is exactly what unions have been arguing for and endeavouring to initiate over a very long period of time.

The reason I would like to talk about this today is that that dinner on Saturday night marked quite a remarkable achievement. It saw the 20th annual presentation of sports awards made by the club to the local community through their 55 affiliated sporting and social clubs. Through those clubs in the Tuggeranong area in my electorate, 5,800 junior and 4,000 senior athletes, in 600 teams, participate in the sporting community.</para></talk.start><para>On the same night the club also gave out sporting scholarships. These have been running for 17 years and have totalled over half a million dollars in assistance to 370 young local athletes over that time. Each year the club gives out these scholarships, which amount to $1,000 per university student and $500 per college student, with the aim of assisting them in their chosen sport whilst they continue their college and tertiary studies. In both cases this is a very good and clear demonstration of a local licensed club—the Tuggeranong Valley Vikings Club—being very much involved in its local community and in supporting younger people.

The proposed new Jetstar services will add to the diverse range of low-cost air travel options that are emerging in Australia. Low-cost airfares do make Tasmania more accessible to more Australians, which surely must be beneficial to the state in the long run. There are concerns with the Jetstar implementation plans. I am not, however, going to quickly jump up and push the hysterical button, like Senator Barnett in the other place, who was reported as saying that Qantas is treating Tasmanians as `second-class citizens'. There would appear to be several flaws in the Jetstar arrangements that create concern, such as ticketing and connectivity. However, we must have sensible discussions with airline providers to fully understand proposed arrangements. Inflammatory comments, such as the senator's, do little to help matters.</para></talk.start><para>The talk of travellers facing long drives across Melbourne with their bags to catch connecting flights at Avalon appears to be exaggerated. Connecting flights would surely be available from Melbourne airport through Qantas, and a quick look at the web site shows that. It would appear that the principal flaw so far in the Jetstar implementation for Tasmania has been the failure to properly consult with key industry and community stakeholders. Tasmanian Labor MPs will again meet with Qantas and Jetstar this week to discuss issues surrounding the Jetstar implementation.

The full details of AusLink are expected to be announced in May. Just last week, the federal Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads, Senator Ian Campbell, confirmed that the government is no longer prepared to accept full responsibility for the funding of the national highway system. This came as a bit of a shock to me and to other people who were watching very closely the government's decisions on the national road transport plan. That has confirmed what I have feared for a quite a number of years, and that is that the federal government has been delaying any funding commitment to the Ipswich Motorway. This is the evidence. Now we know what the government's intentions are. It has now stated in print that it no longer wants to be 100 per cent responsible for our national road transport plan. While this affects my electorate directly, I know that this effect will flow on to every electorate right across Australia.</para></talk.start><para>The government has walked away from its responsibilities to the communities not only in my electorate but right across Australia. It no longer believes that it is responsible for our national roads. These roads have always been funded by the federal government and should be funded by the federal government. Instead, what we are seeing is the minister now admitting why the government has not been making commitments to national roads, and that is because it no longer wants to pay for them. The government has walked away from its commitment to the people of Oxley and it has certainly walked away from its commitment to the Ipswich Motorway. Now I understand why it is looking for alternatives: it never had any intention of paying for the road in the first place.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Dobell Electorate: Environmental Groups</title><page.no>25388</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>25388</page.no><name role="metadata">Ticehurst, Kenneth, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TICEHURST</name><name.id>00ANF</name.id><electorate>Dobell</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to congratulate the Wyong Shire's environmental groups.

The committee found that the statements that I and my colleagues had made were very moderate, particularly compared with statements made elsewhere.

As to the terms of reference and the timing, I will announce those very shortly. Self-evidently, I was not in a position to initiate any discussions with anybody about constituting the inquiry until the report had been tabled. Naturally, I have to consult the person who is going to constitute the inquiry about its duration and its terms of reference. Let me say to the Leader of the Opposition: we will follow what was recommended by the committee. We will follow the advice to have a former intelligence expert constitute the inquiry, and I can assure the House the terms of reference will broadly reflect what was recommended by the committee.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Intelligence: Weapons of Mass Destruction</title><page.no>25391</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>25391</page.no><name role="metadata">Hawker, David, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HAWKER</name><name.id>8H4</name.id><electorate>Wannon</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question follows on from the answer from the Prime Minister and is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.

There is no doubt that this report vindicates the government's use of intelligence in making the case for action against Iraq. This report confirms there is `no evidence that political pressure was applied to the agencies'—that is a quote from the report—and there was `no overt pressure from the government to change assessments'. There would be no point in the government applying overt or covert pressure to get intelligence agencies to change assessments. The government just would not do that.</para></talk.start><para>The report also shows that the government's presentation of the case for war was consistent, moderate and measured. It has been demonstrated once more through this report, as it has been through other reports that have been produced, that the government did not sex up intelligence or sex up the story about Iraq in order to justify the overthrow of the regime of Saddam Hussein. The government cooperated fully with the inquiry. We facilitated evidence by ONA and DIO, and neither of those organisations was covered formally by the committee's terms of reference. And, as the Prime Minister said, we accept the recommendations.</para><para>But, to follow on from the honourable member's question, this government is in no doubt: we were right to join coalition action against the regime of Saddam Hussein and to overthrow that regime. Prewar intelligence assessments of Saddam's pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and his concealment efforts have been borne out by the Iraq Survey Group's findings.

There are similarities and differences between the government's and the opposition's position on this.

I am sure all members of the House will be aware that last week the government released a paper on Australia's demographic challenges which set out the nature of the demographic challenge which Australia will be facing over the next 30 to 40 years. That has largely been set by the birthrates of the last 30 years and by the advances in medical science. We will have an ageing demographic in our population. In 40 years time something like 25 per cent of Australians will be aged 65 or over. Today there are five people of workplace age to support every person of retirement age. In 40 years time there are going to be 2½ people to support every Australian of retirement age. What that means is that the people in the work force are going to have a call on them for greater taxes or fewer services unless we can grow the Australian economy faster and better, and unless we start making provision now.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>UK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Thomson, Kelvin, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>CT4</name.id><name role="display">Mr COSTELLO</name></talker><para>—My message at the moment to the people of Australia is this: we know these demographic changes are occurring.

Twelve and a half billion dollars of additional money will be provided to Catholic education over the next four years, beginning in 2005, and, importantly, $362 million of real increase in funding to Catholic schools will be delivered for those 607,000 students in Catholic systemic schools throughout Australia.</para></talk.start><para>The announcement also heralds a strengthening of the integrity of the socioeconomic status funding formula, which has been used by the government for almost four years now to provide resources for non-government schools. His Eminence Cardinal George Pell made a significant statement yesterday, and I will quote it in part. He said:</para><quote><para>The bulk of government funding for Catholic schools comes from the Federal government, although state governments also make a significant contribution. For government schools the opposite is the case, with the bulk of funding coming from state governments. Recognising the importance of parental choice in education means that we all need to work for the best possible government and non-government schools, all well-resourced, especially in areas which are socially and economically disadvantaged.</para></quote><para>The fact is that in this country 68 per cent of Australia's schoolchildren receive some 76 per cent of all of the public funding. In contrast, the 32 per cent of Australian students who attend Catholic and independent schools receive 24 per cent of all the public funding. So you have 2.2 million students in state schools who receive $20 billion and almost 1.1 million in Catholic and independent schools who receive not $10 billion but $6.2 billion. It is parents, through hard work and sacrifices for their children, who pay almost $4 billion in school fees to provide the education they think is best for them.</para><para>I am asked about alternative policies. It is a bit like <inline font-style="italic">Possum Magic</inline>—they are a bit hard to find. On 2 February I opened the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> newspaper and found on the front page `Labor plan for needy schools'. Referring to the Leader of the Opposition, the story said that his vision `is to integrate for the first time the two separate funding streams, where the Commonwealth now largely funds non-government schools, and the states fund the government schools'. On the same day the shadow minister for finance, who no doubt was working diligently on this plan and seeing that it was well costed, said on Sky News:</para><quote><para>Well, I think Australians would welcome that. They are sick of the argy-bargy of everyone blaming everybody else. What you need is a Federal Government with the capacity to agree with the State Governments about a pooling arrangement for funding.</para></quote><para>So obviously we had a well-developed policy, one can only assume, but then the following day, on 3 February, I opened the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>. It said:</para><quote><para>Labor's Education spokeswoman, Jenny Macklin, yesterday denied reports that a Labor government would collapse all federal and state funding for schools into one pool ...</para></quote><para>So here we have the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister for finance beavering away on this so-called new plan and, in the same building, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the education spokeswoman is denying it is even happening. In fact, the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> went on to say:</para><quote><para>Federal funding for public schools would continue to be channelled through state governments.</para></quote><para>I thought, goodness knows—as a parent, apart from anything else—where is all this going?

Was this somebody who misinterpreted what the Leader of the Opposition said?' I went back and I had a look: Paul Kelly, Editor-at-large. Obviously, the Leader of the Opposition must have been misreported! The fact is that it is all very well for the Labor Party to base policy on the latest neuronal synapse that has gone through the head of the Leader of the Opposition, but the families of this country are budgeting for almost 12 years of Catholic schooling, of independent schooling, and are struggling with their mortgages, their car loans and their financial commitments.

The role of the Office of National Assessments is to assess that material and deliver those assessments to the government.

Our Asia-Pacific neighbours are strengthening their transport security regimes in order to meet increasingly tight, but I think very desirable, international standards. But it is the case that some of them need support in meeting those standards. To that end I would like the House to be aware that Australia has taken, and will continue to take, quite a wide leadership role in assisting other countries in their endeavours—it has to be said, perhaps self-evidently—for their sakes as well as for our own.</para></talk.start><para>For example, we are working very closely with the Papua New Guinean government on key security challenges. This package includes the placement of Australian transport security experts into the PNG bureaucracy and a senior official into the PNG civil aviation authority later this year. Shortly a couple of my officers will travel to Papua New Guinea to provide immediate assistance in relation to shipping and the international shipping convention security arrangements. These measures are designed to aid Papua New Guinea in improving its ability to tackle transport security and safety issues. I am pleased with the development of the cooperative relationship thus far.</para><para>In addition to that, we have successfully delivered maritime security workshops in the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia. These have been in recognition in part of Australia's expertise in these areas, but they have helped very considerably each country move towards compliance with the international maritime standards, which are due to come into force on 1 July this year. We will be providing a second round of workshops and additional technical assistance in the Philippines as part of the $5 million Philippines counterterrorism assistance package. We are working too with Indonesia to enhance their aviation capacities as part of the $10 million four-year counterterrorism initiative. We will also be placing transport security officers in embassies in Jakarta and Manila as part of our regional approach, and we will continue to take seriously further requests for our assistance. Our security at home will of course be enhanced by these actions, just as will the security of the affected nations. I think Australia is playing an important leadership role and will continue to do so.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Intelligence: Weapons of Mass Destruction</title><page.no>25399</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>25399</page.no><name role="metadata">Rudd, Kevin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDD</name><name.id>83T</name.id><electorate>Griffith</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.

One set of sources we quoted were British and American documents—publicly available documents. For example, we quoted extensively from the September dossier of the Blair government. We also quoted the 1999 final report of UNSCOM, the United Nations Special Commission. The UNSCOM report had a long inventory of weapons of mass destruction materials which Iraq had not accounted for. We quoted this on many occasions, and so did other people. So it was the combination of the quotations from the British and American documents, the quotation from UNSCOM—which of course was headed by none other than the Governor of Tasmania, His Excellency Mr Richard Butler—and we quoted from our intelligence sources and other sources beyond that.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It is perfectly clear from the conclusions of the committee report, a bipartisan committee, that the government did not sex up the intelligence or sex up the story about Iraq.

They had briefings on three or four occasions by our intelligence agencies, particularly by the Office of National Assessments. So they cannot come into this House and claim that the Office of National Assessments or somebody else had been telling them Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction. They themselves were saying that Iraq did have weapons of mass destruction without of course being subject to the charge of sexing up.

I think you are right about that. The Prime Minister and I met this morning with the Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands, Sir Allan Kemakeza. Obviously, the discussion focused predominantly on the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands, RAMSI. I do not think this House would be surprised to hear that Sir Allan expressed very strong appreciation for the significant help Australia is providing to overcome the problems of the Solomon Islands. He thanked the Australian government for the leadership it has shown in helping to restore law and order and some semblance of an economy in his country.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We have been working very successfully through RAMSI with the Solomon Islands government. Law and order across the Solomon Islands has been restored. Over 3,700 weapons have been collected, and ordinary Solomon Islanders are able to go about their lives, free from violence and intimidation. The police have arrested 940 people, and in some cases lengthy jail terms have been handed down. Jail terms have been handed down to an ex-minister and senior Royal Solomon Islands Police Force members, as well as members of the broader Solomon Islands community. As I said to Sir Allan this morning, this has sent a very strong message to the community about the need for law and order and of course, very importantly, to ensure that the practice of corruption, which has been fairly common in the Solomon Islands over the years, comes to an end.</para><para>These are modest beginnings; there is a long way to go in the Solomon Islands. But I think the government and, more broadly, the Australian Federal Police, the officers of a number of departments—the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and AusAID—and, importantly, members of the Australian Defence Force can be very proud of the role they have played in cooperation with regional governments in restoring the Solomon Islands to the level of stability that it has now achieved. We have a long way to go; there is much more to be done, and it is going to take a good deal of time. But it is all part of a pattern of what the government is doing in the Pacific to try to strengthen the countries of the Pacific: RAMSI, the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands; the enhanced cooperation program in Papua New Guinea; and the work we are doing in countries like Samoa, Fiji and Tonga to help those countries achieve a more stable and fruitful future.

In answer to the specifics of the question, we expect that hopefully tomorrow we will be able to release publicly the full text of the FTA.

Accompanying that, we will release a user guide so that people can navigate their way through the legal text, particularly to assist some of those members opposite to find their way through some of the legalese in the agreement. I can also inform the House that the government proposes to call tenders for some economic analysis to be done of the agreement as it is structured.

It was done on a hypothetical basis, and we will now be able to have modelling undertaken on the actual outcome of the negotiations.</para></talk.start><para>With regard to the second part of the member's question, I have noticed on a number of occasions in recent months criticism of the government's position in pursuing a free trade agreement with America, using as the basis or reason for that criticism the fact that it will impact upon our relationships in Asia. There is nothing further from the truth. They have been proven to be wrong. Our relationships in East Asia have not been affected by our negotiations with the United States, and the successful conclusion of this agreement will not affect those relationships. I instance some of the undertakings we have been involved in in recent times: the conclusion of free trade agreements with Singapore and Thailand and the just concluded negotiations with the United States; and we are now actively engaged in discussions and a scoping study for a free trade agreement with China. The Chinese government is certainly very keen to move that process along as quickly as possible.</para><para>During the time that we have been negotiating with the United States there have been some significant announcements. We had the $25 billion gas deal from the North West Shelf and, today, BHP Billiton have announced a joint venture to supply $11.7 billion worth of iron ore over 25 years from Jimblebar mine at Mount Newman in Western Australia to steel companies in four different provinces in China. I know that the member for Kalgoorlie will be quite excited about this outcome for his electorate and the jobs that that will mean. That is a deal that has been done with China.</para><para>In answer to the member for Maranoa's question, the free trade agreement is obviously having a positive impact. These deals demonstrate the confidence that Chinese businesses have in going into partnership arrangements over a longer period of time with Australian exporters. They obviously have confidence in the Australian government and the way we are managing not only the economy in Australia but also the relationship between us and China. Our government is always looking for new opportunities to assist business both at home and abroad—unlike the Labor Party, who are always looking for reasons to get in their way.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Education: Funding</title><page.no>25402</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>25402</page.no><name role="metadata">Macklin, Jenny, MP</name><name role="display">Ms MACKLIN</name><name.id>PG6</name.id><electorate>Jagajaga</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Minister for Education, Science and Training.

As His Eminence Cardinal George Pell pointed out yesterday, the majority of funding in this country for schools goes to state government schools. The reality is that 68 per cent of the students in the school system in this country are in state schools and they receive 76 per cent of all the public funding.

It is seeking to instil fear and uncertainty into the budgets and lives of everyday Australians. The fact is that the Labor Party is trying to get the average Australian to wrongly believe that a school like King's receives more money than a public school does. The reality in that fact sheet—which I invite the member for Jagajaga to table, so it can receive much broader distribution—is that the 1,320 students at the King's School receive $3.6 million in public funding. Fairvale High School in New South Wales, with 1,370 students—so it basically has got about 50 more students—does not get $3.6 million, it does not get $10 million; it gets $16 million.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In other words, the message that Cardinal Pell, the Prime Minister and I seek to honestly put across to Australians is that they need to understand that every single child in a Catholic, independent or—I say to the member for Melbourne Ports—Jewish day school receives less public money than they would if they were being educated in a state school. And yet the parents of those children have paid their taxes. They paid for a place in a state school. They have then forgone that place, often at an expense of several thousand dollars—the average fee paid last year was $2,850—and at great expense to themselves, with four jobs between two parents, without ever having a holiday, driving a 15-year-old car and living in the far outer suburbs of large cities. They make those sacrifices to send their kids to those schools, and they will be supported by this government according to the needs of the families. The one thing the Labor Party has got to do—talk about a bunch of slow learners—is start to understand that the aspirations of working everyday Australians, one in five of whom earn less than $73 a day and have got their kids in Catholic and independent schools, are no different from those of many on the frontbench who have got their kids in the best schools in the country.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Labor Party: Centenary House</title><page.no>25403</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>25403</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Bronwyn, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP</name><name.id>SE4</name.id><electorate>Mackellar</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Ageing, representing the Special Minister of State.

The indications are there. The Labor Party will not support this government's actions to clean up the building and construction industry.

move:</para></talk.start><para>That this House:</para><para>(1)	calls on the Leader of the Opposition to renegotiate the lease in relation to Centenary House; and</para><para>(2)	calls on the Australian Labor Party to return to the Australian people the moneys paid in respect of rent income on Centenary House over and above the market rate since 1993.</para><para>The Centenary House lease, as it has become known, is a public scandal. It can be fixed now by the Leader of the Opposition lifting a pen and writing a letter to the Special Minister of State, Minister Abetz, offering to renegotiate the lease on what is now known to be a commercial basis. The reasons the lease is a public scandal are threefold. Firstly, it is a long lease without a fixed market review provision. The reason that that is scandalous in the current circumstances is as follows: it was entered into in 1993, as a 15-year lease with a five-year option. The fact that there is no market review provision is highly unusual. In a long lease of this type—and any lease of more than six years is usually considered to be a long lease—there would be, in almost every case, a market review provision of 12 months, two years or possibly three years at the most. The reason for that is that nobody is able to anticipate market movements beyond that period of time. That is considered to be a reasonable period for market review.</para><para>The fact that the lease in this case has a nine per cent escalation clause is another very cogent reason it has become a scandalous commercial document. The reason for that is that the nine per cent is cumulative. At the end of the 15-year period—that is assuming the five-year option has not been exercised, which it has not—it leads to a gross amount far in excess of any proper rental basis. That is easily observed by the following fact. When the lease was entered into, the per square metre basis was $367.94 over a 6,000-odd square metre lease. The current rental is $871 per square metre and will escalate again in September this year. But last year, because of the scandalous public waste, the ANAO—which is rather ironically the body that ended up leasing the premises—leased out the prime part of the premises at $314.65. So when an offset was sought against the incredible costs to the community last year, the best part of the premises—the prime area, the top floor—was only leased at $314.65, which is less than the rate when it was negotiated back in 1993.</para><para>The third scandalous aspect of this is that over the 15-year period it will be a cost, over and above what is an acceptable market return, of $36 million to the taxpayers of Australia. There is another aspect of this, which I know my friend the member for Cowper will take up. It is a very important aspect. The valuation on the premises, because of the nature of the rental provisions, will mean that its value is far in excess of that of any other property in the area or indeed in Canberra as a whole.</para><para>This whole issue gives rise to a test for the Leader of the Opposition. He says—and he has been saying this since his election—that there is more to life than economics. He says that issues other than economics should prevail in determining the test of mettle of leadership in this country. He has talked about MPs' superannuation; he has gallantly offered up his own superannuation and that of the opposition as a test. Then he has spoken about the crisis in masculinity and about Read Aloud Australia and other issues such as this, which, when they are really examined, look to be populist tosh. What he is really saying is that he is putting people before the economy. He is saying, `Let's not have alienation within our community, because that's what has happened under the Howard government.'</para><para>With the greatest respect to the Leader of the Opposition, the very question now is before him. The test for new Labor, the test for the Leader of the Opposition, is staring him in the face. If he wants to show that the Labor Party is not seeking to alienate the public from the political process, from Labor and from what they are doing, then he can pick up the pen, write the letter to the Special Minister of State and show that the Labor Party means business, that it is not alienated from the people and that it is a party that cares about the responsibilities of government. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Jenkins)</inline>—Is the motion seconded?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>SE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Bishop, Bronwyn, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs Bronwyn Bishop</name></talker><para>—I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>25417</page.no><name role="metadata">Albanese, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ALBANESE</name><name.id>R36</name.id><electorate>Grayndler</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The king is dead!

It also said it was:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>... a fair market rental for accommodation in a building such as Centenary House ... This was supported by extensive market evidence and there is nothing to suggest that it was excessive. </para></quote><para>Indeed, it is not a unique lease. It was based upon the AUSLIG lease of the Scrivener Building in Bruce between Lend Lease and the Commonwealth in 1991.</para><para>This is a party room that shed tears for the super scheme when they thought reform meant retrospectivity. Now they want the ALP to pay back years of rent. Even more galling is that the Howard government has real form when it comes to spending taxpayer dollars. I remind the House that the PM has spent almost $5 million on 21 taxpayer funded overseas trips, including one European trip which cost the taxpayer $1.35 million and included a four-night stay at the St Regis Grand in Italy worth $180,000. The government has wine and gift consultants costing $15,000 and $34,000 respectively. There is the $2 million spent on commuting flights between Sydney and Canberra. Promotion through government advertising, which goes up every time there is an election, has cost $650 million. The government spent $30 million just prior to the 1998 election, including $15 million in three weeks on the tax information campaign. In just three weeks it spent half of what this entire lease is going to cost. There was a spike of $117 million in government advertising costs in the six months prior to the 2001 election.</para><para>Then there is the 10-member government members secretariat, a taxpayer funded continuous campaign unit which prepares material for government senators and members. It costs around $1.5 million every year to run. Costs over the past eight years have totalled at least $12 million, not counting the massive TA claims during the election campaigns when they all move to Melbourne. The printing bills of the coalition members of the House of Representatives came to $10.5 million in 2001, which means that, per head, $128,000 of taxpayers' money was used on their political party campaigning. The Liberal Party consistently want to raise the tax deductibility of political donations of $100 to $10,000. This would mean $30 million a year, every year, of taxpayers' money going to Liberal Party donations.

I would be delighted to table those reports. Paragraph 1 of the Morling report raises the question of a $50,000 fee offered by one Ms Penny Morris, who was a representative of the proposed lessor—that is, John Curtin House Ltd. Note it: they offered $50,000 to the Australian Property Group to accept the lease. That is a finding of the Morling report. It said that the $50,000 was offered to the Commonwealth agency charged with the responsibility of finding accommodation for Commonwealth agencies.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It is also to be noted, although it is not in the findings of the Morling report, that that same Miss Penny Morris was employed previously by the Australian Property Group. There is something very foul in the smell of this whole deal. It was never investigated fully by the Morling report and it should be looked at now. Furthermore, what people forget is that the original lease—and I had it tabled in the Senate on 1 June 1992—curiously omitted all the details of how much was to be paid. Not only did the then government of the day omit to lay a copy of the lease before both houses of parliament, as required by the Lands Acquisition Act, but in fact they deliberately withheld the information. This aspect has never been looked at.</para><para>There are many questions to be answered. It was originally a 15-year lease, plus another five-year option. The option had to be exercised in the 10th year of the lease. We did not do that. However, should this lot get re-elected for the next two terms and be able to renegotiate in 2008, they will be able to keep the Australian Audit Office there on the rent that applies—that is, $8.8 million a year—for perpetuity on a monthly lease. There is a lot at stake in this lot winning the election.

But what I am talking about is the intent of this motion, about why this motion was put on paper and brought into this House. I will tell you what it is about: it is a knee-jerk reaction, a panic move from this government, in terms of superannuation. It is about their own super and their own pockets. That is what it is about. When we raised the superannuation issue, they were worried about retrospectivity and what was going to happen to their superannuation. It is always the case with this government. We have a prime minister who for nearly 30 years defended the superannuation entitlements of members of parliament. But in 48 hours, when he thought his political hide was on the line, he did the greatest backflip of all time and managed to do a complete reversal.</para></talk.start></continue><para>That is what this motion is about: it is trying to attack us on something that we have raised in this place, and that is what I am going to talk about. Let us talk about waste. Government members have talked about $36 million. Let us look at some of their consultancies. Senator McGauran spent $40,000 on getting a speechwriter because he could not employ one through normal means, and he had to go out and get a specialised consultant. We have the cost of spin doctors. There has never been such a cost before. We are talking about paying $500 million for specialised spin doctors to put some sort of a gloss on what the government do. That is unacceptable; that is a waste of taxpayers' money. No matter which way you look at it, if you start making comparisons about the waste of money, it is never ending. It is never ending in terms of what this government spend. They have spent $2 billion more on consultancies and paying for spin doctors than any other government before them. Since 1996, they have spent $2 billion—I am not talking $36 million. So, if we are talking about a waste of money, you should look at your own side first. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>25421</page.no><name role="metadata">Hartsuyker, Luke, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HARTSUYKER</name><name.id>00AMM</name.id><electorate>Cowper</electorate><party>NATS</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The matter of Centenary House raises the question of what is fair and just and what is totally unreasonable. It raises the question of why the Leader of the Opposition defends an arrangement which is totally outside commercial practice—an arrangement which may be barely legal, but it certainly is not right. Any reasonable analysis of the Centenary House lease shows that it is rotten to the core.</para></talk.start><para>It is standard real estate valuation practice that, in order to assess the value of a property offered for lease, a valuer examine comparable properties with regard to the features of the building and the terms and conditions offered by the lessor. In 1992 a report on this matter prepared by Price Waterhouse made some interesting observations. In preparing their report they carried out a survey of leasing activity with particular regard to five new quality buildings in the vicinity of Centenary House. The critically important rent review clause for Centenary House was far more generous to the owner than commercial standards of the day. Under the lease, the rent had to increase by at least nine per cent per annum and could not fall during the term—a review to the greater of market or nine per cent. This compared unfavourably with other comparable leases, which generally had reviews to market every two years or had increases far less generous than those of Centenary House.</para><para>Price Waterhouse found that the `arrangement is extremely generous to the owner and we have difficulty, unless there are facts of which we are not aware, concluding that the arrangement is a good position for the government'. It was a rort then; it is a rort today. Why would the department of finance enter into such an arrangement when the evidence is clear that it is outside sound commercial terms? The only conclusion which a reasonable person could draw from these facts is that the department was unduly pressured by the Australian Labor Party in government.</para><para>If I were to seek to lease space in Sydney, I could get a short-term lease over a floor in Chifley Square for $378 per square metre, a long-term lease over a floor in Macquarie Place for $550 per square metre or even level 21 of the prestigious Grosvenor Place overlooking Sydney Harbour for $830 per square metre. But how much does the Australian taxpayer pay for Centenary House? It is $871 now, going up to $949 in September—and the figure just keeps increasing.</para><para>It is obvious from the comparable evidence that the department of finance was pressured into signing an agreement to lease on unconscionable terms by the Australian Labor Party.

They are clearly not true. I think it is more important for us to talk about the substantive part of the motion moved by the member for Wentworth. There is no doubt that the member for Wentworth has been asked by his party to lead us down a path of diversion and distraction, away from the substantial issues that confront this nation. That is what the Liberal Party has asked of the current member for Wentworth. I could almost feel somewhat sympathetic for the member, given that he has been a victim of one of the largest, if not the largest, branch-stacked preselections since Federation. It is somewhat ironic that the current member—the mover of the motion—has, although complicit in that process, become a victim of a branch stack of some 3,000 members into that electorate. Because he is complicit, I do not feel totally sympathetic. However, clearly the bigger branch stacker won on the day.</para></talk.start><para>It is really important to appreciate some of the comments that have already been made on the motion by members on this side.

But that will not stop this government from continuing to divert the attention of the Australian public away from its deficiencies.</para><para>What we do not need in this place is this government lecturing us on ethics or morality. This morally bankrupt government should refrain from chastising anybody for improper conduct, because the fact is that it has no ethical construct in which it works; it has no moral compass when it comes to clinging to power.

It was addressed by many, including the patron, Thomas Keneally, and Bishop Cremin. The full re-enactment of this event will take place at the same location next Sunday, 7 March. This event commemorates the 200th anniversary of the first civil uprising on Australian soil, which took place on 4 and 5 March 1804. This was the first time in Australia that Europeans took up arms against other Europeans.</para><para>From the point of view of a military battle, the uprising was a failure. Nine rebels were killed outright and six were left to die of their injuries under the hot Australian sun. Prior to the battle and under a flag of truce—and against all military protocol—the civil authorities arrested the rebel leaders, Phillip Cunningham and William Johnston. No mercy was shown. Cunningham was executed at Windsor without a trial. Johnston was executed at Castle Hill and his body was transported to Parramatta, where it hung in chains as a warning to other would-be rebels. Thirty captured rebels were sent to the Coal River chain gang near Newcastle. You can see how wide the implications of this event were. Other rebels were flogged unmercifully.</para><para>The bulk of the 338 convicts involved in the uprising were united Irishman, both Catholic and Protestant. The large number of convicts transported to Australia for their part in the Irish Rebellion of 1798 in Wexford County, Ireland, aroused fear and suspicion among the English establishment. They were described at the time by Governor King as ruthless, violent and turbulent characters with diabolical schemes for the destruction of all industry, public and private property, order and regularity. With this background and the harsh penal conditions of the colony, it is surprising that the Irish took so long to rebel. But when the rebellion did take place it was badly planned.</para><para>The idea was to take the relatively poorly guarded and remote settlement of Castle Hill, seize what weapons they could from the surrounding settlers, link up with the Irish convicts at Parramatta and then march on Sydney. Unfortunately an Irish informant named Keogh took the news back to Parramatta barracks, from where an appropriate military response from both Parramatta and Sydney was ordered by Governor King. Troops under the command of Major Johnston met the rebels along Windsor Road on the morning of 4 March. The leaders were arrested under the flag of truce. Lynette Ramsey Silver's book <inline font-style="italic">The Battle of Vinegar Hill</inline> records:</para><quote><para>With machine like precision and the economy of movement that comes with practice and military training, the red-coated soldiers formed ranks and for 15 minutes carried out their duty precisely as ordered. Leaderless, caught completely unawares and totally unprepared, the rebels weakly returned the fire before fleeing in all directions.</para></quote><para>There is now conjecture that the battle may have lasted longer than originally thought. Instead of the short single battle that is recorded in official documents, the battle may have lasted a few days with running skirmishes throughout the Castle Hill area. Nevertheless, these events are a very important part of Australian history. They helped shape our national culture. Our mateship grew from this battle. As such, these events should be remembered and commemorated appropriately by a coin or a stamp in the way that other major events in our history have been.</para><para>This request has been made to the government by many organisations in Western Sydney. It is a shame that at this particular stage the government has not responded to those requests. This was one of the first major battles on Australia's soil, and we find that the government is totally ignoring it. I call on the government to support the motion standing in my name and being debated in the parliament today, and to honour the memory of those rebels who stood up for themselves and demanded a better life away from the tyranny and injustice that we so abhor today. Members opposite will be speaking in this debate: the member for Macquarie and the member for Mitchell, whose electorates are in parts of Western Sydney. I know they each have a keen sense of history, so I am looking rather optimistically to their support. I am sure that, with their support, the government will act on a subsequent resolution. Finally, I thank the Friends of Vinegar Hill, the Blacktown and District Historical Society and all those involved in organising this marvellous event. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Jenkins)</inline>—Is the motion seconded?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>QI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Price, Roger, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Price</name></talker><para>—I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>25426</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Kerry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BARTLETT</name><name.id>0K6</name.id><electorate>Macquarie</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In the relatively short period of European history in Australia there are some significant events we have all heard of. However, the Battle of Vinegar Hill is relatively obscure to most Australians. I am pleased to speak on this motion today, as this battle deserves to be better known and its commemoration is important to our community, particularly to our local Hawkesbury community. We are a very different country today than we were in 1804. However, the Battle of Vinegar Hill did have an impact on the early colony and indirectly it has had an influence on who we are today. This battle was the first armed conflict between groups of Europeans to take place on Australian soil. Early on the morning of 5 March 1804 around 230 rebels, mostly escaped convicts, moved through the trees in an unsettled area not far from Rouse Hill. They were on their way to Sydney and hopefully to freedom.</para></talk.start><para>The plan had been hatched by convicts and Irish patriots working at the Castle Hill government farm. Many of the convicts were Irish political prisoners driven by a sense of justice, burning patriotism and an unquenchable thirst for freedom, even if that thirst meant death. A breakout from the barracks was to be followed by a trek to Sydney, joined by other popular uprisings along the way. Once in Sydney, they would steal a number of ships and sail to freedom. But their dreams were cut short well before they reached Parramatta. Governor King had been notified of the breakout the night before and the New South Wales Corps, led by Major George Johnston, completed the forced march from Sydney through the night. The bloody clash, at what was later named Vinegar Hill after a rebellion six years previously in Wexford County in Ireland, ended their dreams and, for some, their lives.</para><para>While the rebels had the advantage of numbers, their motley collection of guns, pitchforks and poles was combined with a significant lack of coordination and was exacerbated by quantities of liquor consumed since their breakout, all of which ensured that they were no match for the organised and better armed New South Wales Corps. Fifteen rebels died in the main battle, while other minor skirmishes erupted throughout the day. The search for fleeing rebels lasted several days. Nine rebels were later executed, including the two leaders, Phillip Cunningham and William Johnston. Most of the others received severe floggings with others exiled to the Coal River in Newcastle. There were no government casualties.</para><para>Much is read into the motives, messages and significance of past events, including this one, with a temptation at times to overstate the case. I do not wish to do that, but perhaps three simple things can be said about the Battle of Vinegar Hill. Firstly, it demonstrated the strength of the innate desire for freedom, even if that desire means a very real chance of death. Secondly, the discipline and effectiveness of the New South Wales Corps were much more effective than their much maligned reputation might have suggested. Thirdly, and most importantly, the descendants of those from opposing sides with such different backgrounds, different perspectives on life and with so much passion, united later to be pioneers and free settlers in the early decades of the colony. That unity paved the way for its survival, its growth and ultimately its prosperity.</para><para>Five councils were involved in organising the bicentennial celebrations: Blacktown, Holroyd, Parramatta, Baulkham Hills and Hawkesbury. Congratulations go to each of these councils on helping to remember an important event in our history, particularly in our local history. The culmination of the celebrations in the Hawkesbury will be the Ghost of Green Hills concert at Windsor on Sunday—Green Hills being the former name of the town of Windsor. It will be supported by a number of local choirs: the Song Company, Macquarie Towns Choral Society, Chemella Inc., Windsor Public School, Richmond High School and Windsor High School. Thanks go to those groups for their participation. Recognition of the significant events in our past is vital in appreciating our roots and our shared heritage. In doing so, it helps strengthen bonds and our sense of community. Best wishes and thanks go to all those involved in organising celebrations which started yesterday. I trust that the special events over the next week will be enjoyed by many in our community.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>25427</page.no><name role="metadata">Price, Roger, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PRICE</name><name.id>QI4</name.id><electorate>Chifley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Firstly, I want to commend my colleague and friend the honourable member for Greenway on bringing this motion before the House. Sadly, notice was given last year to the Selection Committee and it was not given precedence until today, but I am grateful for that. A number of speakers have already referred to the Castle Hill rebellion, more commonly known as the Battle of Vinegar Hill. This was the first major instance of white-on-white violence in Australia. Of course there had been numerous scuffles between newly arrived British settlers and the indigenous Aboriginal population. The Battle of Vinegar Hill was the first time white Europeans, in this case predominantly Irish political convicts, had risen up against the tyranny of the British oppressors. It was of course a precursor to the Eureka Stockade, which took place near Ballarat in Victoria some 50 years later. Sadly, while most Australians are well aware of the history of Eureka, far fewer are familiar with the Battle of Vinegar Hill—more is the pity. Many histories of Australian settlement downplay the events at Vinegar Hill whilst others admit it entirely. Many list Eureka Stockade as the only white rebellion in our nation's history. </para></talk.start><para>In his motion, the honourable member for Greenway has sought to have the event commemorated by a stamp. I was enormously disappointed by Australia Post's refusal to acknowledge the national significance of the 200th anniversary of the battle with the issue of a commemorative stamp. I wrote to the then communications minister, Senator Alston, last September requesting that Australia Post review its decision. I was told that Australia Post felt that a commemorative stamp could not be justified on two fronts: firstly, because it had already finalised its stamp issue program for 2004 and could not alter it; and, secondly, and perhaps most insultingly, because of its policy excluding depictions on its stamps of subjects that are of interest only to a narrow section of the community or to a region, single state or territory. One-tenth of Australia's population lives in Western Sydney. We are a massive region; the third greatest economic region in Australia. However, the government and Australia Post have refused to acknowledge this event. It is very disappointing.</para><para>I am grateful to the honourable member for Mitchell and the honourable member for Macquarie for expressing their disappointment in Australia Post's decision. It is disappointing that this 200th anniversary will not have a special stamp to commemorate it but, as the honourable member for Greenway has indicated in his contribution, perhaps that can be rectified in the future. I hope we will not again have Australia Post declining on the basis of its policy excluding depictions on its stamps of subjects that are of interest only to a narrow section of the community or to a region or to a single state or territory. It is about time the Battle of Vinegar Hill took its rightful place in Australian history. I would like to particularly commend the Battle of Vinegar Hill Steering Committee; councils in Western Sydney have a great history of cooperation and this case is no exception. I congratulate Blacktown, Holroyd, Baulkham Hills, Hawkesbury and Parramatta councils. Last but not least, I say to the Carr government: we need to preserve and protect the site of the Battle of Vinegar Hill, where the commemoration will take place on Sunday. It should not go to developers for redevelopment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>25428</page.no><name role="metadata">Cadman, Alan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CADMAN</name><name.id>SD4</name.id><electorate>Mitchell</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Hills district is known for its battles. I have recently just come through one—it was nothing like the Battle of Vinegar Hill, though. The wild Irish scheme to capture the barracks at Windsor, break open the armoury, go to Parramatta, capture the barracks, break open that armoury, then march to Sydney and take a boat off to Ireland again was full of bravado, full of excitement, full of dreams and visions. It is typical of the attitude that started the early colony that, as I understand it, when they stood on Constitution Hill down near Wentworthville—the member for Reid would know it—and looked west to the Blue Mountains they would have thought China lay beyond the Blue Mountains, and if not China then a population of Europeans that they needed only to visit and they would be free. So it was cross the Blue Mountains or go to Ireland, and they chose to go to Ireland.</para></talk.start><para>The Castle Hill convict uprising, according to Robert Murray, was the biggest civil disturbance ever on Australian soil and the only major convict rebellion in 80 years of felon transportation. It took place before the divisions of the states were in place, and so it was a truly national event. The local people and five councils involved in the celebration of this battle have really set out to make this a very special occasion in our district. There has been much dispute among historians about where the battle actually took place. My colleague from Greenway will assert that it was in his electorate and I, as a strong supporter of the historical societies in the Mitchell electorate, claim that it took place within the Mitchell electorate. This has been a matter that has been debated for many years by historians either side of Windsor Road.</para><para>The celebrations are going to take place in such a way that the whole area will benefit. If there are listeners interested in this event, I would like to encourage them to visit the Hills district as well as the Windsor and Greenway districts. There will even be a bicentennial event related to the rebellion held in Wentworthville over the next week. On Thursday, 4 March there will be an official opening of the Heritage Park at Castle Hill, which is a historical landmark and where it began. Many of the settlers there were involved in this, and some of the settlers' names are still in the district: we have Thomas Bradley, James Bean and George Sutter, a well-known name, and the Joyce family still live in the district. From that period 200 years ago there are people with those names still living in the Hills district. That event begins at 9.30 a.m. down at Heritage Park, Castle Hill and runs through the rest of the day. There is a rebellion discovery walk and school tours, with the final celebration taking place at 7.45 p.m. with the Governor of New South Wales, Professor Marie Bashir.</para><para>The outline of that period is captured in part by the writings of Elizabeth Macarthur when she speaks of William Joyce, who arrived at her Seven Hills farm, Bella Vista. He was `pale and in violent agitation', Mrs Macarthur recalled. Mr Marsden had been visiting Mrs Macarthur:</para><quote><para>`Sir,' says he, looking wildly at Mr Marsden, `Come with me. And you, too, madam.' Then, half shutting the door, he told us the Croppies [as the convicts were called] had risen, that they were at my Seven Hills farm, and that numbers were approaching Parramatta.</para></quote><para>The local newspapers have celebrated this occasion and they have tried on their front page to depict the occasion. I think the involvement of the whole community, including the re-enactments, is something that the whole district is proud of. I am disappointed with the attitude of Australia Post also, who tend to want to just show frogs and crickets on their stamps rather than things that are really important.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Honourable members</inline>—Ha, ha!</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>SD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cadman, Alan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CADMAN</name></talker><para>—Well, the current issue is frogs and crickets, for goodness sake.

It is also noteworthy, when talking about Australian history, that in the same region Holroyd City Council has named a new suburb after Pemulwy, one of the leaders of Aboriginal resistance to the white invasion. The Battle of Vinegar Hill obviously centred around the question of religious freedom and equality before the law. It is worth noting that in the aftermath the Governor decided to withdraw the salary of the Catholic priest, James Dixon, for `improper conduct' and said that `seditious meetings had taken place in consequence of the indulgence and protection Dixon had received'. Thomas Campion, the Australian writer, said in his 1987 book, <inline font-style="italic">Australian Catholics</inline>:</para></talk.start><quote><para>... after the Castle Hill rebellion Catholic convicts were returned to the spiritual care of the Anglican chaplains.</para></quote><para>I join other speakers in condemning the decision of Australia Post, on very technical grounds, not to commemorate this very significant historical event. This event unfolded throughout the areas of a number of Western Sydney councils—the five that have joined in this effort—and a number of federal electorates. It is interesting to note that the dispatches of Major Johnston to Lieutenant-Colonel Paterson at the time mention Toongabbie, Castle Hill, Green Hills—the former name of Windsor—and Parramatta. I especially congratulate the committee of the five councils, chaired by Blacktown's Councillor Barbara Gapps.</para><para>On a more local front, although my electorate does not have any sites of historical importance in this matter, Councillor Paul Barber, who is organising these activities for Parramatta council, has organised an important series of recognition activities next Saturday at Caloola Reserve at Wentworthville. There will be tree planting and a number of pipe bands, and the consul-general will be in attendance. I salute the regional committee, which typifies the cooperation in this region which we see through WSROC and a variety of other organisations. It was noted earlier that the region essentially includes one-tenth of Australia. I think one in every 60 Australians lives in the Blacktown City Council area. This is indeed a very significant region.</para><para>In 1998, we started to get off our backsides with regard to recognition of the Battle of Vinegar Hill when the memorial was constructed at the Castlebrook Cemetery. That stems from 1984, when the first initiatives were taken. This battle is very significant nationally. It was an attempt by convicts, some of whom had been involved in events six years previously in Ireland, to fight for their rights. As noted earlier, the plan was to seize a boat and return to Ireland. In the aftermath a number of people, including Phillip Cunningham and William Johnston, were executed. Many sentences of 500 lashes were meted out, and many were exiled to Newcastle. Fifteen were killed in the actual battle itself.</para><para>This is an important event not only locally but also nationally. There has been much focus over the years on the Eureka Stockade, but the Battle of Vinegar Hill did alarm colonial Sydney. One of the things that the Governor recognised very much afterwards was not only the support of the established armed forces but the way in which the Loyal Association of Sydney arose quickly and came to the defence of what they saw as order. The battle had important local repercussions. I again congratulate the member for Greenway. Both the call to have a stamp issued and the call on the government to as much as possible facilitate the celebrations in recognition of these important historical events are worth while.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>25430</page.no><name role="metadata">Hartsuyker, Luke, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HARTSUYKER</name><name.id>00AMM</name.id><electorate>Cowper</electorate><party>NATS</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank the member for Greenway for raising this motion and for the opportunity for the parliament to note the 1804 Battle of Vinegar Hill. It is unfortunately an event which is not as widely known about as it should be. It was Australia's first rebellion. It occurred during a rich period of our nation's history, and the years leading up to the battle are filled with interesting events.</para></talk.start><para>Unrest amongst Irish convicts had been running for some years before the battle. Governor Hunter wrote in 1796 that the `turbulent and worthless characters called Irish Defenders' had been threatening to resist orders to carry out convict labour. He formed a committee of inquiry which reported back that plans of an insurrection amongst the Irish had been developed. Governor Philip King came into office in 1800, and it would seem that the threats continued to loom. There was clearly a great sense of a real threat to the colony being posed by the possibility of convict insurgency, and this led to the formation of the Sydney Loyal Association and the Parramatta Loyal Association—groups of citizens which had banded together to meet any such danger.</para><para>The level of fear continued in 1801, when 135 convicts arrived from Ireland. The number of United Irishmen in the colony was then 600. Governor King wrote he believed they were `only waiting to put their diabolical plan into action'. Professor Manning Clark tells us in his book <inline font-style="italic">A History of Australia: </inline><inline font-style="italic">From the Earliest Times to the Age of Macquarie</inline><inline font-style="italic">,</inline><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Volume </inline><inline font-style="italic">1</inline> that 1,414 convicts were deported from Ireland to the colony between 1791 and 1800; 710 between 1801 and 1802; and 546 between 1803 and 1810. Irish convicts made up about 28 per cent of the colony's population.</para><para>The convicts involved in the 1804 rebellion were convict labour being used in a government farm at Castle Hill. The rebellion took place in March of that year. In February, Governor King ordered the strengthening of the guard at Castle Hill in response to concerns about the `daring behaviour' of the 200-odd convicts there. On 3 March, the commandant at Parramatta had received intelligence that there would be an uprising the following day. History records that intelligence to be correct, and at around 8 p.m. on Sunday, 4 March 1804 some 200 convicts rose up, set a house on fire and began their rebellion under the cry, `Death or liberty.' Military troops and loyalists set out from Sydney, marching through the night. The forces—about 230 rebels and around 80 soldiers and armed civilians—met mid-morning on the 5th. Not all of the rebels were convicts and not all were Irish. There were 15 killed in the ensuing Battle of Vinegar Hill. The immediate aftermath saw a declaration of martial law in the Parramatta area. Nine rebels were hung, and several others were flogged severely and exiled to what was then Coal River, now Newcastle.</para><para>It is interesting to note the years subsequent to the battle. In February 1806, Governor King reported that there had been `no seditious appearance of any consequence' since the March 1804 rebellion. However, Bligh, who succeeded King as Governor, stated in March 1807 that an attempt at insurrection had been in preparation for some 18 months. Of course, Governor Bligh's later concerns are another matter and are well recorded. It is befitting that that history and the rebellion be marked 200 years on. I understand that the Blacktown, Parramatta, Holroyd, Baulkham Hills and Hawkesbury councils have arranged, together with countless members of the community, to mark the occasion and recreate the 200-year-old battle this week.</para><para>Many of those involved in the rebellion were transported to the colony as punishment for their role in the failed 1798 uprising in Ireland. Volumes have been written about the deplorable living conditions in Ireland at that time and the harshness of life as a convict on the colonial frontiers. They had been sent—exiled—to the farthest corner of the earth as punishment for political, social and other crimes, where they endured some of the harshest of conditions. Their desire was a natural one—to improve their lives. Perhaps the following quote from a book written by Lynette Ramsay Silver titled <inline font-style="italic">The Battle of Vinegar Hill</inline> sums it up:</para><quote><para>Possibly, for those who faced the reality of a future devoid of all that they held dear, the choice was one of simple idealism. They may have been prepared to make the choice and in so doing sacrifice their lives to the cause ...

This is an issue I have been following since 1994 when an argument arose on the quarantining of salmon. In 1997 I introduced a private member's bill which addressed the risks associated with allowing the importation of apples from countries that had been affected by fire blight. In particular, we were looking at New Zealand because of the incidence of blight over there and I was urging the government not to risk the Tasmanian industry in the interests of some sort of trade deal. These arguments have not changed.</para></talk.start><para>I would like to question the latest recommendations of Biosecurity Australia to allow imports into Australia from apple-growing countries and in particular from New Zealand where there is deemed to be a risk to the phytosanitisation of the local industry. In Australia trade interests seem to override quarantine interests, and those who are part of the quarantine assessment do not seem to be batting for their own country. I will put some facts on the record. My source is the Tasmanian Apple and Pear Growers Association, who spend an awful lot of money and time ensuring their product is at the top end of the range of products and environmentally clean and green—a principle that is vital to the survival of the industry.</para><para>Let us have a look at what has happened in the past. The quarantine measures since Federation have been effective in protecting apples and pears from a large number of pests and diseases being imported into the Australian environment. In 1990 Australian apple and pear producers complemented the quarantine action by being the first major commercial group to join forces with consumer and environmental groups, including the National Association for Sustainable Agriculture Australia, the Australian Conservation Foundation, Greenpeace and the Australian Consumers Association, to examine issues concerning pesticide uses.</para><para>The industry took the initiative to sign a pesticide charter in 1992, committing to a program to reduce pesticide use. The original target was a 50 per cent reduction by 1996. This was surpassed, and a 75 per cent reduction has now been achieved by the industry through being responsible and adopting integrated pest management programs and the development of biological control, breeding interruption programs and predatory control with beneficial insects. This industry puts great emphasis on food safety issues.</para><para>All Tasmanian growers operate under an accredited quality assurance program which contains a high level of traceability, including regular residue testing. The industry's opposition to Biosecurity's latest recommendation is based on scientific evidence relating to Biosecurity's own risk assessment identification of seven insects, one bacterium and two funguses directly associated with the importation of apples from New Zealand. In fact, all the Tasmanian industry and national industry responses to Biosecurity's import risk assessments over the past three years have been based on well-researched scientific information at great personal cost to industry members.</para><para>Australia does not have fire blight. Should it be introduced, the devastating effect will not be limited to the apple and pear producers. The adjacent bushland will also be affected. Some other groups will also be affected, including beekeepers, wholesale and retail nurseries, home and public gardens, fruit-processing companies, distributors, transport businesses and packaging companies. The New Zealand industry has compromised the health of its industry and associated environment over the years in favour of trade. This has resulted in a large problem with pests and diseases. I spelt this out quite clearly in earlier speeches, and I have no further information to tell me that things have changed over there.</para><para>In order to sustain an apple industry at all, chemical control by routine spraying is practised freely. In New Zealand, antibiotic sprays have been used since the early 1950s, including streptomycin. Australia does not have antibiotic sprays registered for use in the apple and pear industry. The question must be asked: does the Tasmanian consumer want to purchase fruit that has been subject to such high levels of chemical control and, in particular, antibiotic sprays?</para><para>Should fire blight become established in the Tasmanian environment, there will be an economic impact on the communities located in the growing region. These regions employ around 3,500 people, the industry has a gross value of around $70 million and Tasmania accounts for 18 per cent of total Australian production—about three million cartons annually and 65 per cent of total Australian apple exports. Tasmania exports to about 20 countries. The major markets are Singapore, Malaysia, India, Sri Lanka and Taiwan. Japan is one of the developing markets for Tasmanian Fuji apples. A lot of work has been done to establish that market and to open it up further in the longer term. Another market being pursued in Japan is for the Jonathon gold apple variety, and other developments are being considered along those lines.</para><para>Australia is one of only a few countries in the world free of fire blight. There is no method of eradication. If this disease were introduced, it is estimated that one in three growers could be forced out of the industry. Altogether, the estimated cost to Tasmania could run to millions of dollars and it would cause enormous problems for the other groups who would be affected, as I mentioned before. Tasmania is the largest exporting state for apples in Australia. The effect on access to existing and new markets—particularly those in Japan, which have a very high quality standard to overcome for exports—could be devastating. Getting into the Japanese market is very difficult. It took the apple and pear growers of Tasmania many years and a lot of hard work to do so. We have been able to reach there now, but there would be no way we could do it if fire blight became established. Our credibility would be completely shot.</para><para>We have to question these so-called free trade agreements when they threaten a local specific industry for some apparent greater good that is not specified. I believe that, as with the salmon argument, if we are to be threatened with a lowering of standards for some trade deals, Tasmania should go it alone and ban imports of apples from fire blight countries. It is not sound and reasonable trade if it threatens an established and growing industry in this way. I will be one of the first to stand up for the apple and pear industry should these imports ever be considered.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Fisher Electorate: Former HMAS Brisbane</title><page.no>25433</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>25433</page.no><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SLIPPER</name><name.id>0V5</name.id><electorate>Fisher</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am particularly pleased this afternoon to stand in the House to talk about a very important initiative—namely, the proposed sinking of the ex-HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline><inline font-style="italic"></inline>as a dive wreck off the Sunshine Coast. Sadly, it is now more than two years and seven months since the federal government announced that the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane </inline>would be gifted to the Queensland state government with the proviso that it be sunk as a dive wreck off the Sunshine Coast. This occurred following the decommissioning of the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> in October 2001. It is unfortunate, however, that the state government has since that time used every possible stalling tactic to refuse to sign the deed of gift. So far, the ship has therefore not been sunk off the Sunshine Coast as an artificial reef and dive site. The Premier has been guilty of stalling tactic after stalling tactic. I am particularly keen to see the state government come to the party and sign the deed of gift so that the ship is able to be sunk off the Sunshine Coast as a dive wreck.</para></talk.start><para>As soon as the decommissioning of the ship was mooted, I worked at securing the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane </inline>for a dive site off the Sunshine Coast because of the tremendous boost to our local economy, particularly our tourism and dive industries. I do find it frustrating that the Premier continues to perform backflip after backflip on the issue, agreeing and later reneging on his commitment to sign the deed of gift. Premier Beattie first agreed to accept the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane </inline>in October 2001 before later rejecting it and finally accepting it in February 2003. I had to go to the federal minister and we had to secure the $3 million cost of preparing, transporting and sinking the ship off the Sunshine Coast. Usually state governments pick up that expense, but we were able to persuade the federal government to do so in this particular situation.</para><para>In fact, the Premier, acting on his own Crown law advice, announced at that time—that is, February 2003—that the Queensland government would accept the gift, but there was an issue of public liability. I do not think it was a genuine concern, but I accept that it was a concern that the Premier had. He worked through those issues. Regrettably, the deed of gift has still not been signed. The issues of public liability raised by the Premier were resolved and he himself said, in an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Courier-</inline><inline font-style="italic">Mail </inline>on 4 February 2003, that, while the Queensland government was not prepared to pay the cost of having the vessel sunk, the insurance cost, negotiated through the Queensland Government Insurance Fund, was a tiny fraction of previous estimates of $250,000 a year and was therefore acceptable.</para><para>However, another year on, the Premier has still not signed the deed of gift. Once again, he is resurrecting the issue of public liability as one of the major reasons for failing to sign the deed of gift—an issue that he himself had said was resolved in February 2003. There have not been problems of public liability on other dive wreck sites around the nation, and I am perplexed as to why the Premier continues to prevaricate and delay. Until the deed of gift is signed and the ship is sunk, the tourists and extra benefits will not flow to our Sunshine Coast economy.</para><para>The Premier also raised concerns about the proposed site for the sinking of the ex-HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> off Point Cartwright near Mooloolaba and Kawana Waters. He originally agreed to that, but he then said that, because of its proximity to commercial shipping lanes and issues of safety in poor weather, this was a worry. But these issues had already been addressed in a preliminary study, commissioned by the Premier's own department in 2000, which recommended the Point Cartwright site as the preferred site ahead of the announcement of the location by then federal defence minister, Peter Reith.</para><para>As late as October 2003, the Commonwealth has allowed for these concerns. In fact, the defence minister wrote to the Premier agreeing to allow the concurrent evaluation of candidate sites off the Sunshine Coast, including the preferred site of Point Cartwright and the Premier's alternative site off Mudjimba Island, so that the project would not be held up. One would have thought that the whole thing could have then proceeded. In fact, the federal minister even said that, if both of these sites were unsuitable, we would look at a third site off the Sunshine Coast. But it was important that the ship be sunk off the Sunshine Coast. It was a commitment given by the federal government prior to the last election. The Premier himself from time to time says that it is a good idea. But, regrettably, we simply cannot seem to get the Premier's signature on the deed of gift.</para><para>The Premier agreed that there was no further impediment to the transfer of the HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline>, so the question is: why has this not taken place? Throughout this whole sad and sorry saga I have been working closely with the defence minister, Senator Hill, and his staff and with the former defence minister Peter Reith. Both ministers have been prompt, thorough and courteous in their dealings in relation to this matter. If only the Queensland government and the Queensland Premier could see the obvious benefits of the site and the damage that is being caused through continual and unnecessary delays. On a number of occasions, I have contacted the Premier's office in an attempt to expedite the matter and break the log jam. I have spoken to the Premier himself and to some of his senior officers. Whenever I speak to them, I am treated courteously. Everyone accepts that the project is important. But we simply cannot seem to get progress on the signature on the deed of gift so that the actual sinking can proceed. It is a matter of concern to Australian taxpayers, including those on the Sunshine Coast, that it is still costing thousands of dollars to store the ship prior to it being sunk. Mr Deputy Speaker, you might find it hard to believe that the ship is costing $11,000 each week while it remains in dry dock prior to being sunk.</para><para>The Beattie government has spent millions upon millions of dollars on projects in Brisbane—and we heard a lot about those in the run-up to the recent state election—including the Goodwill Bridge and the Suncorp Stadium redevelopment, which are two particularly voracious consumers of state government revenue, but it seems unfortunate that the state government is unwilling to spend state money on projects that would be of benefit to areas outside Brisbane. The Premier needs to remember that there was significant interest from other states, including New South Wales which wanted the ship for its own dive site, estimating that it would generate $10 million a year in tourism revenue. The Sunshine Coast attracts over 2.2 million long-stay visitors and over three million day trippers each year. In 1999 visitor expenditure in the region was $1.3 billion. I am told that there is demand for a dive site of such quality and significance, with more than 150,000 people in Australia holding scuba diving qualifications. In Queensland alone, more than 40,000 people dive for recreation fortnightly.</para><para>Once it is sunk, the ex-HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> will create 70 new jobs on the Sunshine Coast and will bring some 10,000 to 12,000 tourists to the coast—and, of course, the Sunshine Coast is the most desirable tourist destination anywhere in the country. Add to this the flow-on effects to other industries, including accommodation houses, restaurants and other tourist attractions in the region, and there can be no doubt as to the value of the project. It is also interesting to note that the life of the ship as a dive wreck would be more than 500 years, so it will be of long-term benefit to the coast. It would also benefit the marine environment by encouraging fish preservation and the growth of fish stocks. Surely the Premier can see the tourism and employment benefits for the Sunshine Coast and Queensland that the sinking of the ex-HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> would bring. It would even bring more visitors to Brisbane as tourists made their way from right across the nation and throughout the world to the Sunshine Coast.</para><para>The sinking of the ex-HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> off the Sunshine Coast as a dive site would also serve as a fitting memorial to the servicemen and women who have lost their lives fighting for Australia. The destroyer, commissioned in 1967, served in both the Vietnam and Gulf wars and is therefore an important part of Australia's naval history. In fact, a number of service personnel who served on the ship have contacted me expressing their desire for the ex-HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> to be put to rest off the coast. However, even after representations by a number of key Sunshine Coast bodies—including SunROC, which represents the councils of Noosa, Maroochy and Caloundra; and the Sunshine Coast Artificial Reef Group—the project remains stalled. The Maroochy Shire Council has also appealed to the member for Kawana, Chris Cummins, but it appears he has been unable to move the project forward. Surely the Premier and Mr Cummins can see no benefit in having the project stalled any longer and, therefore, preventing the flow-on of benefits to the Sunshine Coast economy.</para><para>Through this House, I again pledge to continue my work to ensure that the ex-HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> is sunk off the Sunshine Coast. I appeal to the Premier to sign the deed of gift and get this project moving. I also appeal to the new state Minister for Emergency Services, Chris Cummins, to look after his own backyard and assist in ensuring that this very important project comes to fruition as soon as possible. This is an important issue and I call on the Queensland Premier for action. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment: Private Forest Reserve Program</title><page.no>25436</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>25436</page.no><name role="metadata">Sidebottom, Sid, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SIDEBOTTOM</name><name.id>849</name.id><electorate>Braddon</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to raise a couple of issues relevant not only to my electorate of Braddon but also to Tasmania. Any comments made on the family tax benefits system overhaul are relevant, of course, Australia wide. The state and Commonwealth governments struck an agreement in 1997 to protect 15 per cent of all Tasmanian forest types as part of what is known as the Regional Forest Agreement. The Private Forest Reserve Program, or PFRP, forms part of the Tasmanian RFA. The PFRP aims to protect around 100,000 hectares of forest types and habitats for threatened plants and animals that are not well protected on public land but exist on private land. The federal government committed $30 million to establish the PFRP in Tasmania, $20 million of which was made available from Tasmania's share of the Natural Heritage Trust. The Tasmanian Department of Primary Industries, Water and Environment initially took responsibility for the management of this program, but under the recent ministerial reshuffle in Tasmania this has changed to the minister responsible for the environment and planning.</para></talk.start><para>Perpetual conservation covenants are negotiated with private land holders and are registered on the title to the land. They exist in perpetuity. Land-holders receive an upfront payment on signing the covenant to compensate for the depreciation of land value upon future sales. When the PFRP was initially implemented, there was a major tax anomaly affecting Tasmanian landowners who agreed to sign the perpetual conservation covenant. The moneys they gained from taking up the PFRP were included as taxable capital proceeds and, as such, incurred capital gains tax. The Labor opposition fought for changes to the tax act to ensure the moneys paid were not included as taxable capital proceeds. Finally, and rightly so, in June of 2001 the tax act was changed to include landowners who acquired their land prior to 20 September 1985 as being capital gains tax exempt. On the other hand, for those landowners who acquired their land after this time the conservation covenant is treated as part of the disposal of their property and, as such, the cost base of the original asset is apportioned between the covenant and the remaining asset. In short, they still receive a dramatic decrease in the capital gains tax.</para><para>In 2002, a constituent brought to my attention a major problem facing landowners who wished to sign up for the PFRP. If these landowners or their children received any type of Centrelink benefit, they may have jeopardised their entitlements. Why? Because the federal government had failed to bind all departments of the Commonwealth to the tax exemption ruling. In short, Centrelink was still classing this as taxable income. </para><para>To give an example: a family who lives in my electorate of Braddon was keen to sign up for this important environmental program. They went through the entire process of enrolling in the PFRP and, just as they were about to sign the documents, they checked with Centrelink as to the effect the moneys granted for signing the perpetual conservation covenant would have on their family benefits. To their amazement, they were informed they would lose twofold: firstly, they would lose their family tax benefit; and, secondly, their child who was going to university, and who was dependent, would lose their Youth Allowance because the money they received was considered income. The federal government was giving with one hand and taking with the other. This has in the main resulted in a slow uptake of the PFRP offer and, as such, an important environmental program has not been given sufficient wind for its sails. </para><para>Back in November 2002, I campaigned for the federal government and the Department of Family and Community Services to amend the Social Security Act or, at minimum, to exempt the PFRP payment under section 4.3.2.30 to enable moneys gained when signing up for this important project to be exempt from income in regard to Centrelink assessments. I was disappointed but probably not surprised when local Tasmanian Liberal senator Richard Colbeck issued a media release on 20 November 2002 stating:</para><quote><para>It is important to note that the payment system administered by Centrelink is designed to provide income support on an individual basis and in those circumstances, payments of the nature provided under the program are best assessed on an individual basis. </para></quote><para>I said `disappointed' because, instead of lobbying and arguing for this important environmental program being successfully implemented and unnecessary obstacles being removed, Senator Colbeck trotted out the government line and criticised my suggestions for change. </para><para>A significant obstacle to be overcome in implementing this very worthwhile scheme is to ensure Centrelink exempts participants from income assessment for moneys gained when signing a perpetual conservation covenant. Generally, this covenant will reduce the value of their land. However, landowners are to be congratulated for seeing the long-term environmental benefits they will achieve by signing this covenant. It is of benefit to us all. The federal government in turn should recognise this across all its departments. It is good to know the federal government did not listen to Senator Colbeck but has taken on board the anomaly which I raised on behalf of my constituents and has overturned the ruling. Payments now made from signing a perpetual conservation covenant are deemed as a return of asset and not as income. This will now encourage more people to sign up for this important environmental project.</para><para>The PFRP was initiated in 1998 with the aim of protecting 100,000 hectares of underreserved private forests by July 2002. I understand that, due to the slow and disappointing take-up created by the landowners being financially disadvantaged by the federal government's offer, the date has now been extended. At present, and after almost two years extension, the PFRP has still only secured 27,641 hectares of underreserved forests, which in any calculation falls a long way short of the 100,000-hectare target. </para><para>I ask the federal government to rise to the challenge and revitalise this very important environmental program by removing any disadvantages to landowners. More specifically, two significant disadvantages now remaining are the Family and Community Services ruling on liquid assets and the deeming on the income for family tax benefits. Let me explain. If a landowner signs up for the PFRP and gains a payment, this is deemed as a liquid asset and, if this landowner was unfortunate enough to require a Centrelink pension due to illness or job loss after they have accepted payment for signing a perpetual covenant, they would have to wait 13 weeks for a social security payment. Landowners could also in turn be hit with a hefty family tax benefit bill at the end of the financial year. So in actual fact there is a double whammy when the point of this was to introduce an important environmental practice.</para><para>I know that is the spirit and the aim of the federal government's support of the Private Forest Reserve Program, but unfortunately these anomalies exist and act as a deterrent to people taking up this important program. So, again, I call on the federal government to fix these two barriers to an important environmental protection scheme. I also seek the support of Senator Colbeck this time to lobby his colleagues for a successful outcome. I would like to reiterate that the Private Forest Reserve Program is an important program and is supported by the federal government. The problem is that, like many programs, anomalies can occur. When we point these anomalies out, it is important that we get equity of treatment and access across all government departments. I have pointed these out in correspondence and I point them out again in this place and ask the federal government to tackle these anomalies so that the full benefits of this excellent scheme, the Private Forest Reserve Program, can be met.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second World War Memorial</title><title>Mackay Rugby League Match</title><title>World Expo in Aichi</title><page.no>25438</page.no></subdebateinfo><title>Mackay Rugby League Match</title><title>World Expo in Aichi</title><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>25438</page.no><name role="metadata">Kelly, De-Anne, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs DE-ANNE KELLY</name><name.id>FK6</name.id><electorate>Dawson</electorate><party>NATS</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to refer to a number of topics in my address. The first is the crash of an American B-17C Flying Fortress during the Second World War. That occurred regrettably on 14 June 1943 outside Mackay, my hometown in North Queensland. It remains Australia's worst aviation disaster. There were 41 American GIs aboard the flight to return to Papua New Guinea after R and R in Mackay. Only one of those survived, a corporal by the name of Foye Kenneth Roberts.</para></talk.start><para>However, I would like to place on the record that the people of Mackay have ensured that the loss of those brave soldiers is remembered. In the 1990s, a permanent memorial was established to honour them. The memorial exhibits the Australian and American flags, and a local couple, Bob and Vivienne Deakin, who live near the memorial ensure that those flags are flown daily. Last year, an American GI who lost a coin toss and was not on that fateful flight, Mr Del Sparrowe, crafted a replica of the plane, which was eventually turned into a significant part of the memorial. During a ceremony marking the 60th anniversary of the crash, the bronze model was mounted above and through the aeroplane propeller. I would also like to acknowledge a local RSL historian, Col Benson, who has organised annual commemorative services in his capacity as chairman of the Bakers Creek Memorial Committee. The largest service, as I have said, was the 60th anniversary that involved local Army, Navy and Air Force cadets, a parade using equipment loaned by Jim Frederickson and the Mackay military museum, and a traditional Aussie breakfast.</para><para>There are many quiet achievers in the community of Mackay who work very hard to ensure that the bonzer friendship achieved through the tragedy of this crash is maintained between Australia and the United States. However, Mr Benson's tireless efforts certainly would rank above many others. In recognition of his efforts, he was commissioned a Kentucky Colonel in 2001 and appointed an honorary colonel of the US 5th Air Force by its commander in 2002. In the following year, Col received a US House of Representatives Certificate of Congressional Recognition for his dedication and work. He also met the chairman of the joint chiefs, General Richard Myers.</para><para>It is not just been left to Mr Benson and others. Students have also played a significant role in remembering those who perished in this tragedy. The Dundula State School and Mackay State High School have researched the event. I particularly acknowledge Rae Baldwin from Dundula for her efforts. I also acknowledge the history teacher, Bruce Litte, and the Mackay State High School students. It is significant that, even after such a passage of time, the citizens of Mackay remember those from another country who perished in this tragedy and ensure that their families back in the United States can take some comfort from the fact that the memorial and the memory of those who died are guarded and respected in the city of Mackay.</para><para>I now move to another achievement of Mackay. Last weekend, the North Queensland Cowboys played the Newcastle Knights. Regrettably, the Cowboys did not get home on this occasion, but the Mackay Region Area Consultative Committee, with chairman Colin Meng and our CEO Greg Sutherland, who is also the chairman of Mackay rugby league, put in a tremendous effort with the support of many good people around the community to ensure that this very interesting match was played in Mackay. Many thanks to CHR, Rod Cunningham, Mackay Toyota, John Glanville and others who supported this footy game.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83R</name.id><name role="metadata">Edwards, Graham, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Edwards</name></talker><para>—Tell us about the cricket.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>FK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Kelly, De-Anne, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs DE-ANNE KELLY</name></talker><para>—I will stick to the Cowboys and the Knights if you do not mind. We had over 12,500 visitors at the showground that night, and millions of dollars were brought into Mackay. More important, though, was the joy and interest it brought. I walked around in my Cowboys jersey on Saturday night, and there were evidently lots of families there—there was grandad, dad and the kids. It was a great family night. I was particularly pleased that they also took the opportunity to raise money for charity. Thousands of dollars were raised for local charities, and none was more important than Katrina Auld, who is a local young lady who has contracted a very serious virus and finds herself completely paralysed. Her mum, a single mum, is trying very hard to look after Katrina at home, and it was just great to see the community rallied around, raising money for Katrina and her family. So it was a splendid evening, with a great charity event to support those in Mackay, Katrina included. I want to thank the Mackay Region Area Consultative Committee, which is totally funded by the federal government. They really do outreach and some wonderful things in our local community.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I now move to the world at large and our participation in the World Expo 2005, known commonly as the Aichi expo. Australia, through Prime Minister John Howard, has committed $35 million to see Australia represented at the Aichi expo from 25 March to 25 September 2005. It is a great way of commemorating the importance of our relationship with Japan and, of course, our bilateral arrangements over the last 30 years. The pavilion will showcase our unique lifestyle, our diverse culture and our attractiveness as a business, tourism and education destination. It will draw on not only our history as one of the most ancient continents on earth but also modern Australia as a smart, innovative and forward looking nation. The pavilion's design—and we are presently letting tenders for aspects of the pavilion—will be linked to the expo theme, which is `nature's wisdom'. In fact, visitors will be taken on a uniquely Australian journey, starting millions of years ago and leading through to what will be a data forest, showing contemporary Australia and our achievements in biotechnology, science, environmental resource management and so on. We are going to draw on a pavilion mascot, and there could be nothing better for that than the platypus. They are wonderful little creatures which are very adaptive, although they have not changed a lot in millions of years. I am particularly pleased, because the platypus is the mascot of the Mirani shire, which is adjacent to my city of Mackay.</para><para>I am very proud to oversee the expo preparations. I would particularly like to pay tribute to our Australian Commissioner-General for the Aichi expo, Ms Glenda Gauci, a senior diplomat with extensive Japanese experience. Other contributors include Australian business envoy Mr Ian Grigg, who will develop the business program. We already have two major sponsors in Toyota Australia and Qantas. No doubt there will be other companies joining to support our expo participation. We also welcome involvement from the states and territories. In 2005 Victoria and the Aichi prefecture will celebrate the 25th anniversary of their sister state relationship.</para><para>A lot of exciting things will happen at Aichi. As I said, we have let some tenders—one is to the Australian Pavilion designer, Think! OTS, a young Melbourne-based production company. There is also Jack Morton Worldwide, who will be taking charge of arts and entertainment. This is a tremendous opportunity to showcase Australia not only as we are fondly known overseas—as one of the ancient continents renowned for our unique wildlife and wonderful scenery—but also the modern contemporary Australia with our scientific, engineering and medical achievements. I commend to the House the work that the Australian government is doing in what we trust will be a great success for Australia at the World Expo 2005 in Aichi, Japan.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health: Diabetes</title><page.no>25440</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>25440</page.no><name role="metadata">Bevis, Arch, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEVIS</name><name.id>ET4</name.id><electorate>Brisbane</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In the middle of last year I was visited by a couple of constituents and their young children—seven-year-old Nicholas Casey, and Gareth Eldershaw, a 14-year-old lad—both of whom have diabetes type 1. Nick was diagnosed with diabetes when he was three and Gareth when he was seven. Many members will be familiar with similar stories because I know that, throughout the country, sufferers of diabetes approached local members of parliament in a program that culminated on 20 August last year in Canberra with Kids in the House, when many members of parliament met local constituents' children who suffered from type 1 diabetes.</para></talk.start><para>After that visit, Gareth wrote me a letter. He was obviously happy with the way things had gone but made a couple of comments that are worth recalling. He said:</para><quote><para>The whole day was pretty neat for me but sad as well. As you know I am 14 years old so I really understand the significance of the long term complications of diabetes. I get really distressed talking about going blind and maybe having my foot amputated. The needles are bad enough!</para></quote><para>Gareth wrote to me again just last week, wondering what was happening with the goodwill that had been so much on show here last August. He said in that letter:</para><quote><para>When we were in Canberra in August, the best thing I noticed was that all of the politicians were in agreement, even though they came from different parties. It was great that you all saw how important an issue this is. Please speak to Mr Abbott, the Federal Health Minister on behalf of all the kids. Please speak to Alan Pettigrew, CEO of the National Health and Medical Research Council. Please speak to Wendy Edmond, our State Health Minister. Please ask them all to support our efforts for a cure. </para></quote><para>Mr Deputy Speaker, I am only too happy to do just that.</para><para>Gareth is one of few young lads who are able and fortunate enough to have an insulin pump. The pump provides an automatic dose of insulin and means that, instead of having regular needles, it just needs to be changed every two or three days. But the pumps cost about $6,500 and about $300 a month to run. That is a cost that the parents bear with little support from the Commonwealth health system. They pay that out of their own pockets. Very few parents can afford to pay that money. Gareth does have one, and he has shown me the pump and spoken about how it gives him greater freedom so that he can play football and do all sorts of other things that 14-year-old boys want to do, but it is a major challenge to the family to finance that and too big a challenge for many other families, who are unable to. But the pump does not cure the problem. One of the things that has surprised me since Gareth and Nick came to see me, and in my reading about this, is the advances that have occurred that give hope for a cure. I am amazed at why we as a community and the government are not keen to fund that research that has been so promising and, indeed, quite successful.</para><para>To put things into context, we should appreciate just how significant diabetes is. There are over 100,000 children and adults who have diabetes type 1. The incidence is increasing in Australia by over three per cent a year. This is a growing problem. Diabetes is the No. 1 cause of blindness. It is the No. 1 cause of amputations not resulting from an accident. Diabetes causes a fourfold increase in the likelihood of a stroke. It causes over 40 per cent of cases of kidney failure. It is the sixth leading cause of death. Indeed, in cold hard dollar terms, it has been estimated to cost $5 billion a year. But this is not just about cold hard dollars; this is about human beings and their quality of life.</para><para>One of the things that medical science has managed to do in recent years is develop techniques to enable sufferers of diabetes type 1 to be free of the symptoms. Research overseas and in Australia has had remarkably good results. Some members of parliament will be familiar with this because we all received this publication, <inline font-style="italic">Promise to remember me</inline><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">...</inline><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Kids in the House</inline>. It was the publication done after the visit of these young kids to parliament on 20 August.</para><para>There was no shortage of politicians from both sides of this chamber, keen to get in there for the photo opportunities—to be on the steps at the entrance of Parliament House with the kids and to have their photo taken in their rooms and in gatherings that occurred during those couple of days. But now, my friends, is the time for us to put up or shut up. It was all good and well to be there for the photo opportunity, but now is the time to deliver. We have a budget in a couple of months time, and that is when we should deliver. If we are fair dinkum about this, the government will actually allocate funds for this research that has proven so promising. I will quote from one part of this document. I wonder how many of the members whose photos appear in the document have actually read it. If you do read about the work that has been done, I fail to see how you could be anything other than moved to do something about this urgently. The document says:</para><quote><para>Researchers have spent 30 years trying to cure type 1 diabetes by replacing the insulin producing islet cell that has been destroyed by the immune system. Prior to 1999, these attempts were only successful in eight per cent of people. However, in 2000, Dr Lakey and colleague Professor James Shapiro developed a new set of procedures for conducting an islet transplant, which has increased the success rate to over 80 per cent.</para></quote><para>An 80 per cent success rate for a procedure to cure diabetes—I would have thought that that was a pretty compelling argument for public funds and investment.</para><para>The information in this publication that was sent to us by the Juvenile Diabetes Research people tells us that since that time Dr Lakey has performed over 55 islet transplants—personally accounting for about a quarter of all such transplants in the world—with 87 per cent of his patients living free of insulin injections a year after the procedure. That is a major breakthrough in the treatment of an illness that is one of the most debilitating in our community.</para><para>There is work being done in Australia which is at the leading edge of these developments around the world. In the past year, researchers at Westmead Hospital have performed three successful islet transplants. They have had a success rate that has earned them global respect for the work that our Australian researchers and medical profession are doing. Globally, the majority of those islet transplant recipients—as I just mentioned, 87 per cent of Dr Lakey's patients—have remained insulin free, prompting many people to talk about this procedure under the new techniques as a cure for diabetes.</para><para>Surely it is time that we did something about this. For my part, after August, I put a question on notice to the Minister for Health and Ageing, asking what research the federal government is currently funding in the possible cures, treatment or prevention of type 1 diabetes; how much the government has invested in research of these matters in each of the last 10 years; and what the government was doing about things like insulin pumps. That was four months ago and I still do not have an answer to that question. It is four months later and I cannot even get an answer as to how much money the government has spent in the past—let alone get some result for the future.</para><para>The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation propose that we set up a national research facility of global excellence, funded over a five-year period to the tune of $25 million. Twenty-five million dollars over five years is not a big outlay in the health budget; it is not a big outlay for the Commonwealth. Let me put that $25 million into some perspective. We as taxpayers are spending $2 million to fly the Prime Minister from Sydney to Canberra because he will not stay at the Lodge. The Howard government spent $30 million—more than the entire budget required for this research—in the government advertising campaign just prior to the 1998 election, including the well-remembered $15 million so-called tax information campaign, which ran over three weeks. The Howard government had no trouble spending $15 million on ads in the three weeks before the 1998 election.</para><para>My plea today in this grievance debate is that the Howard government finds a fraction of that to fund the research being done here in Australia into a cure for diabetes. It is not just the right public policy; it is the decent thing to do. Every member of this parliament who met one of those young children on 20 August 2003 should be obliged to stand up and put their money where their photo opportunity was last year. It is not a lot of money and we should fix it in this budget. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Nuclear Waste: Storage</title><page.no>25442</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>25442</page.no><name role="metadata">Wakelin, Barry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr WAKELIN</name><name.id>HV5</name.id><electorate>Grey</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Over the last 10 years in South Australia there has been an issue regarding the placement of radioactive waste, particularly low-level radioactive waste.

That is what Premier Rann and Minister Hill have been doing for many years now. It is a highly regrettable state of affairs.</para><para>I will move on to the state of politics and offer a view about the public perception of politicians. Another article stated:</para><quote><para>I believe that politics is the most important and responsible civil activity to which a man may devote his character, his talents, and his energy. We must, in our own interests, elevate politics into statesmanship and statecraft. We must aim at a condition of affairs in which we shall no longer reserve the dignified name of statesman for a Churchill or a Roosevelt but extend it to lesser men who give honourable and patriotic service in public affairs. It is true that most men of ability prefer objective work of science, the law, literature, scholarship, or the immediately stimulating and profitable work of manufacturing, commerce or finance.</para><para>The result is that our legislative assemblies are a fair popular cross-section not a corps d'elite. The first class mind is comparatively rare. We disadvantage young men of parts by confronting them with poor material benefits, precariousness of tenure, an open public cynicism about their motives, and cheap sneers about their real or supposed search for publicity. The reason for this wrong-headedness, so damaging to ourselves, is that we have treated democracy as an end and not a means. It is almost as if we had said, when legislatures, freely elected by the votes of all adult citizens, come into being, “Well thank heaven we have achieved democracy. Let us now devote our attention to something new.” Yet the true last of the democrat only begins when he is put in possession of the instruments by which the popular will may be translated into authoritative action. In brief we cannot sensibly devote only one percent of our time to something which affects ninety-nine percent of our living.</para></quote><para>I wonder who wrote that. It was none other than the Rt Hon. R.G. Menzies, in the <inline font-style="italic">New York Times Magazine </inline>of 28 November 1948. That leads me to the debate about superannuation, particularly for MPs. It is quite interesting to me that the current member for Werriwa, in triggering, you could say, the abolition of the old scheme, actually triggered the abolition of a scheme which his mentor—a former member for Werriwa—introduced in 1973. Much has been said, and the media have been quite vocal, about the generosity or otherwise of members' benefits. I am sure the irony would not be lost on the Leader of the Opposition, who had a strong association with a former member for Werriwa, former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam.</para><para>In endeavouring to relate that back to the statements of R.G. Menzies, whatever the new scheme is, I for one am happy to put it on the record that I prefer the market approach. I do not know whether that will get up in the current debate. But when I consider that the ABC, particularly the ABC in Adelaide, and one Dean Jaensch in Adelaide have been very vocal about this, I hope that the generosity of superannuation packages—particularly within the Public Service, the ABC and other corporate bodies—will receive the same scrutiny. Those of us in this place who have responsibility for coming up with a fair package that is in the best interests of the nation should remember the words of R.G. Menzies and remember that Ben Chifley introduced the superannuation scheme in 1948, that Gough Whitlam reformed it in 1973 and that the member for Werriwa, Mr Latham, triggered the events which saw the end of it here in recent weeks. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Defence: Australian Army</title><page.no>25444</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>25444</page.no><name role="metadata">Edwards, Graham, MP</name><name role="display">Mr EDWARDS</name><name.id>83R</name.id><electorate>Cowan</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Twelve months ago I came into this place and raised an issue relating to an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Times</inline> about the Special Air Service. Indeed, on 18 March 2003, I had the following to say: </para></talk.start><quote><para>I was absolutely appalled to pick up the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Times</inline> on Sunday and read a banner headline, `Prisoners tortured'. I was further appalled when I then read on to the body of the article to find that members of the Special Air Service are being accused, via the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Times</inline> and via ABC journalist Liam Bartlett, of torturing Indonesian soldiers who were captured in East Timor. I find the article to be one which lacks credibility. I must say, for a journalist like Liam Bartlett, who has a lot of credibility and a big following in Western Australia, I am very disappointed in what I consider to be a piece of junkyard journalism. This article comes on the eve of the Australian troops being deployed to war in Iraq. It is an article and a piece of journalism which impacts on the very high standing that they have within the military nations of this world. I think it is a very unfair piece of journalism because it lacks any evidence at all. The interesting thing is that there were some matters that have been investigated by at least two authorities, one of them being the Australian Federal Police and the other the United Nations body which has responsibility for these matters. Both of those bodies found that there were no cases to answer. And there is an ongoing investigation—a very inept investigation—being conducted, under which a particular member of the SAS is being charged.</para><para>This person has had justice denied—because justice delayed is justice denied—for some two and a half years. Not only does this article, in my view, breach what I would consider to be sub judice rules but it does not give this person, who is facing some charges and who I believe will ultimately be exonerated, a fair go. But most importantly it does not give those members of the Special Air Service who cannot speak for themselves—some because they are on deployment—an opportunity to respond to this sort of stuff. I find it very unfair, and I wonder how much damage it does to the reputation of the Special Air Service and to the very fine reputation of the members of our Australian Defence Force. I wonder how much damage it might do to their wellbeing should they, in turn, ever have the unfortunate circumstance of being captured.</para><para>I call on this government to bring to a close this inept investigation carried out by incompetent people and to let the soldier who is facing these charges have his day in court.

I am going to read it for the record because I believe it vindicates my raising the issue that I did some 12 months ago—an issue which I was criticised in some military circles for raising. A Defence press release of 17 February, which is headed `Army acknowledges errors in East Timor investigation', states:</para><quote><para>The Army acknowledged that errors had been made during the investigation and prosecution of an Australian Interfet soldier charged with kicking two dead bodies in East Timor in 1999, LTGEN Peter Leahy, Chief of Army said today.</para><para>`Following a complaint to the Inspector General ... by the soldier concerned, the CDF appointed a senior Naval Reserve legal officer, who in civilian life is a Victorian County Court judge, to conduct an independent inquiry.' The inquiry has provided a report which Army has accepted. `I acknowledge there were errors in the process and I have provided an unreserved apology to the soldier involved,' LTGEN Leahy said. </para><para>`These were serious allegations that needed to be pursued vigorously. The soldier was found not guilty on all charges.</para><para>`I acknowledge there were organisational failures such as the length of the investigation. I also acknowledge problems with the quality of statements taken from witnesses and with Army press releases,' LTGEN Leahy said. </para><para>The Inquiry Officer found that the soldier's complaints were substantiated. He concluded that the military police investigation was deficient in a number of respects and had taken too long. The administrative action taken against the soldier, of which he was also found not guilty, while possible under current policy, in this case, on reflection would have been best not taken. </para><para>`Throughout the lengthy investigation the soldier in question continued to perform his duty in the service of the nation despite the additional stress and scrutiny placed on him and his family. I thank him for his professionalism and his family for their patience and understanding during an enormously difficult and stressful time.' LTGEN Leahy also said, `I very much appreciate the constructive and open manner in which the soldier is now working with Army authorities to ensure that the deficiencies shown in Army procedures are rectified and that no one else has to go through an experience like this.'</para><para>`The soldier was unable to deploy on operations earlier this year as he was required to be available to assist the investigation and during the subsequent prosecution. I am pleased that he is now able to deploy,' `The newly established office of Inspector General ADF has demonstrated that as a means of review and audit of the military justice system independent of the ordinary chain of command it is effective and can help to correct errors,' LTGEN Leahy said.</para></quote><para>I congratulate Lieutenant General Leahy on the release and on the things he said in it, because, indeed, the soldier and his family were put under a great degree of stress. I think that personally for the soldier involved—a very professional, dedicated and courageous soldier—the most stressful time, apart from the impact on his family, must have been when he was taken off deployment and unable to accompany his troops, many of whom he had trained, when they left to go to Iraq. Knowing the strength of the leadership of this man, it must indeed have been a very difficult time.</para><para>I want to compliment Senator Chris Evans, the ALP spokesperson on defence matters, on the way he took up this matter in the Senate. I also want to congratulate Senator Johnston, from Western Australia, on the very forceful way in which he too took up this issue with Senator Hill in the Senate. I think both senators saw the incredible injustice that was delivered to this soldier, and I feel that both of them well and truly earned their money when they went in to bat for him. It is for that reason that Senator Evans has caused the Senate to refer some matters to the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee. The terms of reference for inquiry and report are, in part:</para><quote><para>... the effectiveness of the Australian military justice system in providing impartial, rigorous and fair outcomes, and mechanisms to improve the transparency and public accountability of military justice procedures; and</para><para>(2) Without limiting the scope of its inquiry, the committee shall consider the process and handling of the following investigations by the ADF into ...</para></quote><para>and there are a number of them, but one of them is `allegations about misconduct by members of the Special Air Service in East Timor'. I am very pleased that this matter has been referred to the Senate committee, because for too long there have been too many inept inquiries behind closed doors which have done nothing to instil in the public of this nation any confidence that military justice is being carried out in an effective, fair and reasonable manner. I hope that this committee will come forward with recommendations which will ensure that, in the future, soldiers like this SAS soldier and others who have been treated unfairly by the system are given some long-term justice.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Education: Funding</title><page.no>25446</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>25446</page.no><name role="metadata">Pyne, Chris, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PYNE</name><name.id>9V5</name.id><electorate>Sturt</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Family and Community Services</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This evening I grieve for public and private education funding. After parents and siblings, schools have arguably the greatest influence on our children. During their most formative years children spend more of their waking time at school than anywhere else. It stands to reason that most people in our community take an interest in school funding, and it stands to reason that any policy that impacts on school funding is approached with caution. The opposition has shamelessly played on this interest and caution by lying about this government's policies in school funding, distorting the truth in the process and presenting lies as facts at every turn.</para></talk.start><para>The coalition is committed to both public and private schools. It is committed to implementing policies that provide people with greater choice. The coalition wants higher standards for all children and greater choice for parents in the schooling options available. But, most critically, it believes that students in both public and private schools should be supported and provided with the resources to provide the best education possible for our future contributors—our children. All schools, whether public or private, receive funding from the Commonwealth government. In every one of this government's budgets, funding for schools has increased.</para><para>The coalition is providing total funding of $6.9 billion for Australian schools in 2003-04, which represents an increase of 8.3 per cent over the previous year. Commonwealth spending on schools as a proportion of GDP is now higher than it was under Labor. This is despite rapid growth in GDP in recent years. In 2003-04, the Commonwealth is spending $130 million more on government schools than it did in 1996—an increase of 60 per cent. Over the same period, the number of students in government schools has risen by only 1.4 per cent. Commonwealth spending on government schools is at its highest levels ever.</para><para>These are the facts; they are alien to the Labor Party in this debate. With its mates in the Australian Education Union, the Labor Party is guilty of a smear campaign so devoid of truth it would make Joseph Goebbels or Joseph Stalin proud. The states regulate, manage and primarily fund public schools. They contribute approximately 88 per cent of all public funding to government schools. The Commonwealth contributes about 12 per cent. But to say that the coalition is not committed to public schools is a falsehood, and the amount of federal funding in recent years shows the serious commitment the coalition has to public education.</para><para>What the states do not tell you is that the Commonwealth accounts for 40 per cent of their revenue; they simply distribute and spend what the Commonwealth provides them with. They also do not tell you that the division of responsibility between the states and the Commonwealth in the area of school funding has been in place for decades. It was agreed by the states, territories and Commonwealth that the states would largely be responsible for public schools, and the Commonwealth for private schools—and that is why the Labor Party and the AEU are visiting such a gross calumny on the public when they `fantabulise' as they do about schools funding.</para><para>The average Commonwealth increase in the 2003 budget for state schools was 5.5 per cent, while the average state government increase in the 2003 budget for state schools was 2.1 per cent. If public schools are being deprived of funding then it is the state Labor parties that stand accused. If the states had increased their funding at the same rate as the Commonwealth did, government schools would be $668 million better off. As part of the government's commitment to choice, it provides funding to non-government schools as well as government schools. It is evidence that the government supports parents who choose to privately educate their children and, by doing so, reduces the cost to taxpayers. Non-government schools save the taxpayer money. If all the students currently attending non-government schools were to enrol in government schools, the taxpayer would need to contribute an additional $3 billion to their education.</para><para>Overall, the 2.25 million students who attend government schools attract $19.9 billion in public funding. The 1.04 million students who attend non-government schools attract $6.2 billion in public funding. In other words, government schools enrol 68 per cent of students and receive 76 per cent of total public funding, while non-government schools enrol 32 per cent of students and receive only 24 per cent of total public funding. This is the figure for all funding—state and Commonwealth.</para><para>The member for Jagajaga should come into this House and apologise for the fear campaign that she, hand in hand with the AEU, has waged: a campaign that has upset parents and children and created division in the community—and all for what? Grubby short-term political gain. The member for Jagajaga has attacked private schools as elitist and the playground of the rich. It rather begs the question of whether she has ever visited a private school.</para><para>One in five families earning less than $20,900 per annum send their children to non-government schools. How can a family earning less than $20,900 a year be classified as rich and elite? Why should a family earning less than $20,900 not receive some assistance from the government to educate their children? Just as it is untrue to say that private schools are the playground of the rich, it is also untrue to say that the government schools are populated by the poor and disadvantaged. Nearly 50 per cent of students who come from families with an annual income of over $104,000 attend government schools. How can the Labor Party advocate no funding for children from families earning less than $20,900 but argue that more funding should be provided to educate children from families earning more than $104,000 a year?</para><para>The choice between government and non-government schooling is often based not on wealth but on numerous other factors, such as religion, reputation and geography. Government funding should not be based on wealth, either; it should be based on the amount needed to ensure that each of our children receives the best education possible.</para><para>The vast majority of non-government schools are low-fee schools. The average fee that parents pay is $2,830, and half of all parents with children at non-government schools pay less than $1,568 per child. Many families who send their children to non-government schools are on low or middle incomes and often go without luxuries to send their children to the school of their choice. These families should be encouraged, not hindered or intimidated by the Labor Party and the unions.</para><para>As the product of both public education at Burnside Primary School and private education at St Ignatius College Athelstone, I have benefited from enlightened government policies that have supported both. No-one would argue that both should be funded equally, but the Labor Party should not argue that private education funding should be reduced, in some cases to nil, simply because of a class based view of the world which is as outdated as the spinning jenny.</para><para>A quality education for boys and girls must be a priority for every government wishing to ensure Australia's future. The decision between government or non-government school education is one the parents should make. The government should assist parents with the cost of education, regardless of their decision.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Gambaro, Teresa (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Ms Gambaro)</inline>—Order!

The Australian government's contribution to the health budget generally is over $42 billion over the next five years. That is just, amongst other things, to provide free public hospital care. There are numerous programs over and above those which are already funded by the federal government, such as the Tough on Drugs strategy. That is funding of well over a billion dollars. There are also various strategies to bring doctors and nurses to regional Australia and to lift the number of Australians we have entering medical schools. This includes scholarships of around $700 million.</para></talk.start><para>The Commonwealth provides enormous money for the federal health system. However, the downside of all that is that health is administered by the state governments. It is their responsibility under the Constitution, even though one way or another the Commonwealth provides most of the funding. Yet the states are very quick to blame any problem with health—and let me tell you that they certainly do have problems with health in New South Wales—on the federal government.</para><para>I wonder if it is time for a review not just of funding but of how funding is administered. Perhaps it is also time to look at who administers health. It seems ridiculous that we in the federal government finance health, and take as much blame as the states can put on us, yet we have no say over what happens on the ground in the hospitals or in the general running of health—and certainly not in New South Wales, which is without doubt the worst managed state for health in Australia. Whether or not health should be run by the federal government with local governments is something that needs to be looked at in the future, because the current system does not work for the patients and it does not work for the people of Australia. In New South Wales, it has created an incredible mess in hospitals and incredible waiting times in doctors' surgeries.</para><para>The New South Wales government seem to make very little attempt to deal with the problem. While the bureaucracy of New South Wales Health is without doubt the largest bureaucracy in Australia, with what must be approaching 100,000 people, very few of those people deliver health care to patients in New South Wales. It seems incredible that we can have such a large bureaucracy—almost one-sixtieth of the people in New South Wales—involved in the delivery of health, and yet very little health seems to get delivered. I wonder if one of the reasons the state government are not willing to tackle this huge bureaucracy is that it has pretty much become a political force in itself and the state government are not willing to upset those who are in it by sorting it out. By any criteria you choose to use, the New South Wales government and their health department are the most inefficient producers of outcomes that I have seen anywhere in Australia—or anywhere else, for that matter.</para><para>For an example of just how cost ineffective and inefficient the New South Wales government are at delivering health services, you could look at the town of Menindee in my electorate, 100 kilometres east-south-east of Broken Hill. Despite incredibly strong community support and numerous representations from me, the New South Wales government are refusing to even look at Menindee as a possible multipurpose centre. Multipurpose centres are one of the few areas of cooperation that we have been able to attain with the New South Wales government. They bring together health services, including primary health care, aged care and specialists' services, to disadvantaged and isolated communities. Without doubt, Menindee comes into this category.</para><para>To set up and fund a multipurpose centre, a state government has to establish a case and then put that case to the Commonwealth, because the Commonwealth funds the recurrent costs of aged care. But, as the New South Wales government is not taking any of those steps, the federal government is not in a position to pursue an MPC for Menindee. The state health department claim that they can support only the existing facilities in the area, and they are primitive in the extreme. They are going to put a new health centre there, but there will be no beds and nowhere to take people for acute or chronic care. Menindee is an isolated community. As I said, it is 100 kilometres from Broken Hill, which does have a good hospital, but it has an airstrip which is only any good in dry weather and a road that is cut off in flood.</para><para>The health centre that is proposed would only replace what is there—routine and basic accident and emergency services, and that is done by contract with the Royal Flying Doctor Service. The Royal Flying Doctor Service is one of the great successes of Australian development. The Royal Flying Doctor Service do a magnificent job, and I am certainly not casting any aspersions on what they do. But we are talking about a growing town of approximately 800 people in a very remote and isolated position, 100 kilometres from the nearest hospital. The state government do not say that they cannot afford to look at this, but that is the only reason there could be. If you compare Menindee with towns which, I am very happy to say, are getting multipurpose centres—such as Tullamore and Tottenham—you find that those towns are in nothing like the same isolated situation as Menindee. Those are towns of about 300 people with districts probably double that, and Tullamore is probably only 130 or 140 kilometres from a centre as major as Dubbo. It has access to Parkes as well, by bitumen road. It is nowhere near as isolated, cut-off and disadvantaged as Menindee.</para><para>Tottenham, a little further away, is similar in size to Tullamore, with a district of similar size. It is way under the size of Menindee. Menindee also has a very large Indigenous population. I fancy that not far under 300 out of the 800 people in that region would be Aboriginal people—who, for health care and aged care, are the hardest people to move; their culture does not make it easy for them to move even as far as Broken Hill, 100 kilometres away.</para><para>If ever I saw a town that was deserving of this sort of help, it is Menindee. I think it is the most, or the second most, disadvantaged community in western New South Wales. There is no respite care, no residential care, no handicapped care and no patient care in a town that has a population of around 800, with almost 300 Aboriginal people as well as an itinerant community of around 300 to 400 people when we are not in drought and when there is harvesting of the various horticultural activities around Menindee Lakes. As I said, Menindee was classified in 1999 as being the second most socially disadvantaged town in New South Wales. That is unlikely to change while ever the New South Wales government refuse to look at upgrading its health facilities, in a permanent sense and in a wider sense, to include aged care, and not simply a medical centre.</para><para>The high Aboriginal population and the high itinerant population very much back up the case that the community has put forward and that at this stage the New South Wales government are refusing to look at. Tourism and industry are both increasing in this region. It is not a shrinking population. It is no good for the New South Wales Labor government to simply sit back and say, `If we wait long enough, like some other communities in western New South Wales this one will become so small it won't be a problem.' That is not the case. This is a growing community, a strong community—but it is a community that needs the ability for the Australian government to look at a proposal from the New South Wales Labor government to further the health situation there. I think any reasonable person would say that is merited.</para><para>I am unyielding in my belief that the citizens of this area deserve a multipurpose centre, and if the New South Wales government is unable to see that then perhaps it is time we had a change in the Constitution. Perhaps it is time we had one government not only funding health but looking after it as well, perhaps in conjunction with local government. Here we have 100,000 people and the biggest, most inefficient, unwieldy bureaucracy in Australia, with a state government that refuses to look at the situation because it sees it as its own political mess. It is a disgrace in any terms that you look at it, and it is the people of New South Wales, especially western New South Wales, who unfortunately have to bear the cost of it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>25451</page.no><name role="metadata">Roxon, Nicola, MP</name><name role="display">Ms ROXON</name><name.id>83K</name.id><electorate>Gellibrand</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to address the allocation of a modest sum of money for what is a major social problem and follow how this money has been underspent, diverted, delayed, mismanaged and wasted. The sorry tale I want to tell is of federal expenditure that has been allocated to the prevention of violence against women, and it is a story that has many parts. The first part is to set some context for why I am raising this matter in the debate on <inline ref="R1975">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2003-2004</inline>, <inline ref="R1976">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2003-2004</inline> and <inline ref="R1977">Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2003-2004</inline>.</para></talk.start><para>I think it is worth touching briefly on a couple of incidents that have happened recently, and more generally, in the community. In Victoria just this last week we have seen that keeping a woman as a sex slave and torture victim in his own garage, with his wife and son living inside the house and his neighbours witnessing abuse from only metres away, was no real problem for a Warrnambool businessman who has just been convicted. Witnesses are now saying in the courts that they wish they had done something to help this victim sooner. In New South Wales there has been massive coverage about the alleged gang rape of a young woman by professional rugby players in the resort town of Coffs Harbour. This is being papered over very quickly by the club's media people, but some players, from this club and others, are now commenting that this sort of behaviour is not uncommon in rugby circles.</para><para>Nationally, about 63,000 women reported assaults to the police in 2002. We know that this figure is probably only about 10 per cent of women who have actually been assaulted, as that is the proportion of women that will go to police. Yet many in this House still do not believe that violence against women is a major social problem. Women and children are being subjected daily to violence and sexual assault by male members of their families in Indigenous communities across the country, and we are seeing drug addiction and suicide as the only escape for many of these young victims. A three-year-old child with syphilis is, I think, horrifying to everyone in this House, but it is not an uncommon story. Last year more than 32,000 women with young children in tow were assisted by women's refuges around the country, and many thousands more women on their own were also assisted. Many have suffered years of abuse and only leave when they finally see that the next violent episode may actually kill or severely maim either them or their children.</para><para>What do each of these awful stories or issues have in common? They all have in common the casual, almost dismissive manner in which the horror of sexual assault and violence against women is accepted within our community. Nearly 40 per cent of homicides in Australia are the result of domestic violence. Too often this is the tragic end of a relationship that has gone through all the preceding steps of emotional, physical and sexual abuse that are passed off as private matters by those who witness them or suspect them. On top of those women who show up in our homicide statistics, there are of course thousands and thousands of others who are not murdered but injured and abused each year by men who are often their friends, partners, husbands, lovers or fathers. This is the brutal truth.</para><para>So what funding has the government allocated in the budget to this issue? I use the context to emphasise that this is such a serious problem. Even though the extent of this problem is not widely acknowledged in the community and the statistics are just as neglected as the issue, it was welcome that the federal government recognised that it has a role to play in preventing further violence against women. As far back as 1997 the Prime Minister announced a new program of Partnerships Against Domestic Violence, with funding of $25 million over four years. Many groups in the community were led to believe that this was a signal that something substantial was going to be done to help prevent violence against women. In 1999 it was announced that the PADV stage 2 would attract an additional $25 million and that the program would be extended to June 2004. This looked like an additional commitment at the time but, with the benefit of hindsight, I am unsure whether this was just a way of stretching the period for payments over a longer time.</para><para>In 2001, a further welcome announcement was made that $16 million was to be spent on a national initiative to combat sexual assault. This was to be run over a four-year period. It was only $16 million to tackle this epidemic of violence and assault against women, and the most disappointing part of it is that we are now three years into that four-year period and we have yet to see anything for that money. Although it was a modest amount, it was enough of a commitment that, if spent properly, it could have a significant impact in this area. But, in order to have impact, the government must not only allocate this money but also develop the campaigns and spend real money on these prevention projects and campaigns.</para><para>Unfortunately, after a promising start, we can track a very sad tale when we look at the Howard government's neglect on this issue. We find that these small allocations of money have been left unspent; they have been diverted to other programs and then the money has been wasted, when it has been spent in this area. The budget papers for 2003-04 read as a <inline font-style="italic">Monty Python</inline> script when it comes to analysing the commitment the government has made to women's programs and women's issues. Words appear, such as `parameter adjustments', `unspent funds' and `rephasing of resources', which all basically come down to a smokescreen to divert attention from the fact that the limited amount of money allocated to women's programs has been consistently underspent and poorly accounted for by the Prime Minister's own department. However, there is one clear statement and that is on page 45 of the Prime Minister and Cabinet budget papers. It states:</para><quote><para>Women's programs end in 2004-05.</para></quote><para>What is going to happen after that? The additional estimates statement still notes that the money which has been allocated to these campaigns is there to be spent but, on this side of the House, we are starting to get suspicious that we will ever see anything for that allocation. Given the struggle to get money allocated to this sort of issue, when it is so hidden in the community, we are concerned that allocation is not enough. We also have to make sure that this money is going to be spent on the project.</para><para>The Prime Minister did refer to the prevention of domestic violence against women as one of his priorities after his election to government in 1996, but he now presides over a country that has increased levels of sexual assault and a domestic violence prevention strategy that has not delivered a single national anti-violence campaign in more than eight years. The government has spent several years talking about developing a national campaign against sexual assault but, in the meantime, it has allowed this money to be spent elsewhere. A shift in priorities saw $10 million of the money go, instead, to producing fridge magnets for the 2002 antiterrorism campaign. When the government was sprung for having diverted the funds in this way, it promised to spend the extra money in the following financial year—the financial year we are now in—on an exciting community awareness campaign, described as exciting by the Office of the Status of Women. This campaign was ready to be run at the end of last year, television and newspaper ads had been produced, media space was booked and experts from the US had assessed the program and were being flown here to speak at the launch.</para><para>At last those of us who had been following these issues could see that some of the money that had been allocated to this issue was being spent. Obviously money had been spent on the extensive research that had been conducted and it was found that the ads and the campaign devised were very well received in the target group of young people. Obviously the research cost some money and the ads that had been developed cost some money—we had ads for print and TV, and broader materials for schools and community education campaigns. We know that at least $2.7 million has already been spent in the production of these materials.</para><para>In December 2003, just a week before the launch was due, there was another spanner put in the works. A committee, consisting of three government male MPs and Mr Howard's private secretary, shelved this campaign. The real reason for the shock decision is not known. At best it reveals to me serious mismanagement of funds, atrocious planning by the government and, if this campaign material is never used and the campaign does not see the light of day, wasteful expenditure. At worst the decision is sexist, ignorant to the research and completely dismissive of the importance of this issue. Are we ever going to see proper resources allocated to this issue and spent on a decent project that comes to fruition? Surely this is not too much for us to ask.</para><para>What is the next stage? What is the Prime Minister now saying? Where will this campaign go? It is interesting that the Prime Minister, a couple of years ago, said he believed that we are living in a post-feminist age where women have got just about everything they need in terms of equality. Leaving aside issues that we have argued vehemently with the government about, like paid maternity leave, child care and pay equity, just to name a few, Labor clearly disagrees, on a large number of social and economic indicators, that women have achieved the equality that they deserve, but that is not my focus for today. When the Prime Minister thinks that we have everything we need in terms of equality, there is nothing very equal about the fear and reality of sexual assault and violence that so many women in our community are experiencing. The sad reality is that the majority of that violence is within relationships, perpetrated by somebody well known—often intimately—to the women.</para><para>I think these sorts of realities really focus on why the campaign that was going to be called `No respect, no relationship' was so important. In fact, the brief that the government designed to give to the advertising agencies to produce this campaign specifically says that it is targeted at relationship violence—to tackle this issue in a way that previous campaigns have not been able to do. I would like to read a comment from the brief that was given to the tenderers. It states:</para><quote><para>Most state/territory interventions have a crisis end focus. The Australian government has committed to a leadership role on the issues of relationship violence and sexual assault, particularly in the areas of prevention and early intervention.</para></quote><para>I am at a loss to understand how the Prime Minister can stand up in this House and say that the reason the campaign has been cancelled, delayed or postponed—we are not sure which—is that he thinks people should be referred to the police. That is the only answer he can see in this area. I will come to that in greater detail later.</para><para>The minister responsible for the status of women, Minister Kay Patterson, seems to have taken the cue from her predecessor, Minister Vanstone, and decided that, in the face of obviously almost no support from her male colleagues at the cabinet table, she will just keep quiet and not rock the boat. The sorts of things that are keeping women quiet in the community appear to be keeping women quiet in the cabinet room as well.</para><para>Minister Patterson has walked into this job inheriting more than one muck up. The debacle of the way we would celebrate women's suffrage is just another, where the Howard government could not even put up a sculpture to commemorate 100 years of women's suffrage in this country. It seems to me they had only 100 years notice that it was coming up but apparently that was not quite enough time to get things organised. Now the minister has been lumped with the shreds of the community awareness campaign that four blokes from the coalition, including the Prime Minister's own private secretary, have overturned. This is although the materials developed for the campaign and the public money already spent on it had received international acclaim as a progressive and effective campaign to stop relationship violence, particularly among young people. It is interesting that Donna Carson, a woman the Prime Minister recognised on Australia Day this year as a local hero for the work she had done in the prevention of domestic violence, has called for this campaign to be run because it would be so effective in preventing people from suffering the sorts of injuries and abuse that she herself has gone through.</para><para>That brings me to the final part of this story: what can actually happen now? How do we make sure that the money that has been allocated for this campaign, which in fact has now been spent partially, in developing this campaign, has some benefit in the community? The bottom line is that this campaign must be run. Public money has been spent and the campaign has been effectively researched; it is long overdue. It has been shown, through testing, that it is going to be a successful campaign, and we call on the government to run this campaign. We have already called on the government to change its mind and go ahead with this campaign, but if it is not prepared to do that it must release the materials that have already been produced and paid for. They were paid for with public money and they are well-developed materials. If the government is not prepared to pay the extra money to run the campaign, there may be others in the community who are. There may be television stations that would run the materials as community announcements; there may be state governments, domestic violence groups and others who would piece together some way to fund this campaign. It is not cheap to produce the materials that have been produced, and I know that many other people in this House and outside it would not like to see wasted all that work which finally has been done.</para><para>There is plenty of evidence that this sort of campaign is needed, with recent surveys showing in particular that many young men still believe that using violence against their girlfriends or pressuring girls into having sex is acceptable behaviour; clearly, it is not. The old beliefs that some young women are just asking for it, or that it is not always wrong to hit someone because sometimes they provoke it, are scarily still present and are still strongly held by some young men. The campaign effectively identified this as an issue that they could tackle. It used young men talking to other young men, which was a very effective way of getting the message through that this is not acceptable behaviour. It seems a waste to let all that work now be used for nothing.</para><para>In fact, the Prime Minister himself seems to hold some of those old-fashioned views and beliefs that the campaign was specifically designed to address. I am not saying the Prime Minister would agree with the statements I used before, but, in justifying the government's decision to shelve this campaign, the Prime Minister said he would prefer that the campaign just told young women to go to the police, their priest or someone else to talk about the issue, rather than referring young people to information on a web site or highlighting unacceptable behaviour through print and media ads. But this fundamentally ignores the fact that nearly 60 per cent of sexual assaults happen within a relationship context and that only 10 per cent of victims are ever likely to report it to the police.</para><para>Rather than relying on his own outdated ideas of what constitutes violence in a relationship or how it should be handled, the Prime Minister would be well advised to sit down and study the comprehensive brief that outlined the government's reasons for wanting to develop a mass community awareness campaign in the first place. He should take the time to understand the reasons why a simplistic answer such as, `It's a criminal act; report it,' in many cases of relationship violence and assaults does not work and, in any case, only deals with part of the problem. The government's own advice said this, yet the Prime Minister and his gang of four have ignored it.</para><para>When we talk about domestic violence, I think it is important for us to send a clear message about what is wrong and, certainly, what is criminal, and to give people the support they need to get assistance and to report criminal behaviour to the police. But what we in this House are surely trying to achieve is to prevent these instances from happening to start with. As I quoted to the House before, this campaign was directed at prevention—not at dealing with how people should cope in a situation where they have been assaulted or have been a victim of domestic violence, but at encouraging young people to develop strong and healthy relationships of mutual respect, where violence is not going to occur to start with, and perhaps to pick up some of the warning signs early on and to make sure that they get out if they see that their relationship is going in the wrong direction.</para><para>I think it is really critical that this campaign be run. It is an issue of national significance. The government has moved the money around, underspent it, not really been quick off the mark, spent it on something else and now says that it is going to spend it on this initiative. It finally spent some money on the initiative and then pulled it at the last minute. That is a great waste, and I think the Prime Minister should reconsider his position.</para><para>Evaluations from the first year of the Partnerships Against Domestic Violence projects, which were all pilot projects, show that, if we are serious about preventing violence and not just reacting to it, we have to work in the ways that this campaign was directed towards: we need to work with young people to break an intergenerational cycle; we need to work with communities to educate against violence; and we also need to work with victims and perpetrators. Going back to the old approach of telling women that if they do not go to the police it is not really violence is taking us back light-years to a culture that has ignored the insidious nature of the power imbalance and fear that characterises many relationships. </para><para>So I call on the Prime Minister to understand, as I know he does, that violence against women is wrong. It is about the abuse of power, and it is often about relationships and respect. We need the Prime Minister's leadership to help stop this cycle of violence. We need him to be brave enough to change his mind. We need him to show some leadership and override the decision that has been made by his small committee and let this campaign run. It might be difficult and ugly for many of us to confront the reality of violence against women in the community, but it sure is a lot uglier for those involved in abusive and violent relationships. I call on the Prime Minister to change his mind.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>25456</page.no><name role="metadata">Ley, Sussan, MP</name><name role="display">Ms LEY</name><name.id>00AMN</name.id><electorate>Farrer</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am delighted to speak today on <inline ref="R1975">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2003-2004</inline>, <inline ref="R1976">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2003-2004</inline> and <inline ref="R1977">Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2003-2004</inline> before the House because they give me the opportunity to update the parliament on matters that are important to the people in the electorate of Farrer, which I represent. The main issue on the table for us is the recently concluded free trade agreement with the United States. This will have positive outcomes not just for farmers and exporters but for ordinary consumers as well. The deal gives substantial market access gains to most of the farmers in my electorate. The beef quota, which is currently at 378,000 tonnes and is rarely filled, will rise by 80½ per cent over 18 years. Lamb and sheep meat will have most tariffs reduced to zero immediately, with the rest reducing likewise in four years. Our dairy quota is currently worth $40.5 million; it will increase by $55 million in the first year and build from there to be seriously worthwhile trade. The citrus producers in the west of my electorate in the Sunraysia region, part of which is also in the electorate of the member for Mallee, will get a zero tariff immediately. </para></talk.start><para>Our single-desk marketing arrangements for wheat have been preserved. Recently I attended a seminar in Corowa organised by the Grains Council of Australia, and farmer after farmer spoke to me in support of the single desk for wheat. This government stands behind them in support of the present marketing arrangements. I noted with interest that the chairman of US Wheat expressed disappointment that the US free trade agreement did not address what he called the `inequities inherent in the AWB monopoly' and as a result he opposes the free trade agreement. I mention that because there are those in this place who think that the Americans got it all their own way in the deal, whereas clearly a major sector of their agricultural producers is unhappy. Wine producers, who already have a rewarding market, will see all tariffs reducing to zero over 11 years. I am sure Australia's great wineries look forward to spreading to even more countries the good word about the quality wine we produce. </para><para>It is not just agricultural producers who will realise advantages, but manufacturers and service providers will as well. For example, Australian manufacturers will be able to export light commercial vehicles—utes—to the United States once their 25 per cent duty has been removed. Deniliquin, in my electorate, is home to the annual world record ute muster, which sees utes from all over Australia come together to be counted while their owners get together and celebrate what it means to be young in rural Australia—and we look forward to assisting the Americans with a similar initiative. </para><para>On the free trade agreement, Hugh Morgan from the Business Council of Australia said: </para><quote><para>The Agreement will provide massive opportunities for Australian companies of all sizes to gain access to the world's largest market.</para><para>...	...	...</para><para>It will deepen Australia's economic and investment relationships with the US beyond what we might reasonably expect from WTO arrangements to improve access for Australian business in key markets. </para></quote><para>Dick Pratt from Visy Industries, which runs the Visy Pulp and Paper Mill in the town of Tumut in my electorate, said:</para><quote><para>The FTA will protect trade access and encourage expansion. This will be good for growth and the health of the Australian economy. </para></quote><para>Investment is the key feature of the free trade agreement because of fundamentals in the world economy that we cannot escape from—and, in fact, we should embrace them. We have become used to looking at exports, but that tends just to restrict analysis to an assumption that every country exports from its home base when, in fact, it does not. Worldwide sales by offshore subsidiaries of companies now exceed global exports. US investment in Australia is now worth about $240 billion. Australian investment in the US is worth about $190 billion. The US is, of course, the biggest foreign investor in Australia. Our own Australian icons such as the Ford Falcon and the Holden Commodore would not have come about were it not for foreign investment. Also the free trade agreement will be good for Ion Transmissions, a company that makes transmissions for Ford and Holden in its manufacturing plant in Albury. </para><para>We are now also substantial foreign investors in our own right, particularly in the US. Our investments in the US earn income for Australians and keep our businesses on their toes. Competing in a market as tough as the American one does make for a successful enterprise, wherever it may locate and do business. I mentioned wine before, and Southcorp is a good example of a leading Australian business with significant investment in the US that also supports business in Australia. </para><para>Superannuation and its value are of supreme importance to all Australians, as was recognised by the Treasurer in his recent announcement about the inevitability of present demographic patterns in this country. Superannuation funds have to provide the best possible returns to enable a person to retire on the best possible income, and noone would expect any less. I think it is fair to say that to earn the best returns most super funds do have investments in the US, the world's largest economy. Therefore, if we look after our investments in the US, we look after the superannuation of ordinary Australians. </para><para>Increased technology comes from investment. That is why Premier Beattie with his smart state, Premier Bracks with his technology parks, and others in the other states all support the free trade agreement. They know that the IT and biotechnology investment they can get from the US will be invaluable to the economies of their states. This is why every Australian premier supports the free trade agreement: they want IT and biotechnology investment from the US. </para><para>Some say that we should not enter bilateral negotiations but rather hold out for multilateral outcomes. The last WTO round stalled and we are hopeful of further progress in the next one. Clearly, multilateral outcomes have greater positives than bilateral ones. But we should not wait for perfect outcomes; they are rare in the affairs of the world. It really is a twoway street. There is a less fashionable outcome of trade liberalisation—at least one that is spoken of less often—but it does mean that prices across a wide range of imported products tend to go down and consumers do benefit. </para><para>I was surprised to hear the level of protectionist policies and antibusiness speech-making that came out of the Labor Party conference recently. It may not come out of the mouths of the Labor members in this place to the same degree, but I am sure that it will be part of the directions they receive from those who pay the piper and call the tune. Protecting Australian jobs is the excuse used time and time again by unions and the Labor Party. Australian jobs are important, but Australian mums and dads cannot subsidise a concentrated protected sector of industry that looks after the jobs of a few while digging into the pockets of many.</para><para>At the recent Labor Party conference, the offering on trade policy by union leader Doug `free trade not fair trade' Cameron was laughed at by the Premier of New South Wales, who basically said that the removal of tariff protection in the textile, clothing and footwear sector meant that parents could afford cheaper shoes for their school children—and that is important. I thought we had moved beyond this tired old stuff. I thought we had a broadly bipartisan position on trade and industry policy that accepted that we are a small open economy competing in a global market for capital that moves around the world more quickly than it ever did. </para><para>Chapter 11 of the ALP national conference draft agenda is called `Engaging with the global economy'. It starts off with a series of sensible remarks about the link between trade and increased standards of living, but then the platform says that a Labor government will ensure that trade agreements that the Australian government enters into:</para><quote><para>... are assessed to ensure that they are consistent with the principles of sustainable development and environmental protection for all distinct regions of Australia.</para></quote><para>No doubt there is a similar blurb about protecting the jobs of the workers in developing countries so that they do not have to work in Asian sweatshops and we pay them a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. I have even observed this sort of rubbish coming out in our school curricula—ruthless international capitalism trampling across the world's poor. The symbol of this—and you see it in the antiglobalisation movement and, yes, in the union bosses who fund the ALP—is the Nike shoe. So I was interested recently to read that the ruling Communist party of Vietnam described Nike as a good, responsible business. Some of the facts are as follows.</para><para>Nike has four times as many workers in Vietnam as in the US. If you compare Vietnamese factories with American ones, the work looks tough and the conditions hard. The workers in those factories compare this with their alternatives, which are much worse, like farming 10 to 14 hours a day, bending your back in the hot sun with your ankles covered in warm water and goodness knows what insects floating around. The average pay at Nike in Vietnam is three times the minimum wage. Workers used to have to walk miles to work. Then they were able to afford bicycles, then scooters. Some are now buying cars. This is globalisation at work. Multinationals bring better technology, better machinery, better management, education and, of course, access to markets. Growing productivity in a country like Vietnam will make it possible to invest in improved education and health care. Surely this will make the lives of average people easier.</para><para>While we are discussing the ALP draft national platform 2004, I thought I would examine Labor's agriculture policy. There were 17 chapters covering the platform, including one about the environment. However, agriculture does not warrant a separate chapter. It is buried in the chapter on industry, which covers manufacturing, services, transport, tourism, small business and mining. Regarding the future of agriculture under the ALP draft platform, I checked out the section entitled `Investment in Innovative Agriculture', which says:</para><quote><para>Labor will examine and develop policies which will encourage new forms of ownership and investment by Australian capital in Australian primary industries. </para><para>...	...	...</para><para>... specific incentives and structures that will encourage [super funds] to play a significant role in contributing to the capital base required in the agricultural industry.</para><para>...	...	...</para><para>... the development of alternative farm ownership models that may make it more attractive for institutional investors to contribute to the capital costs required to improve returns.</para></quote><para>Can I suggest to the ALP that they do some more work on their agriculture policy and that they recognise that, in spite of successful and welcome corporations in farming in Australia today, the backbone of Australian farming is still the smaller family farm.</para><para>Superannuation funds deal with serious money, and those who rely on them for retirement have a right to expect them to perform in the global marketplace for the best possible return. But this does highlight an important difference between us and Labor. Labor says that super funds should be forced to invest in Australia and the shape of Australian agriculture should be made to change to suit this. We say that Australian agriculture should be allowed to develop in the way that lets it best reflect the society it supports and the competitive nature of farming in the 21st century.</para><para>While on agriculture, I wish to make some remarks about native vegetation laws. There is no doubt that the state laws relating to native vegetation are having a severe impact on the farmers in my electorate. I have spoken before about the NSW government and the peculiar manner in which it says it is a friend of the farmers but acts contrary to their interests time after time. The Productivity Commission has just released a draft report on the impact of existing native vegetation and biodiversity regulatory regimes on landholders and local communities. It has found that substantial costs have been imposed on landholders who have retained native vegetation on their properties. Regulation does not appear to have been particularly effective in achieving environmental goals and may have even been counterproductive. Many landholders gave evidence to the commission about the negative impacts of native vegetation legislation. I do not believe anyone was positive.</para><para>Of course, when this debate is portrayed in the cities, people possibly think that `clearing' means heading down to the back paddock where you have a stand of 100-year-old eucalypts and bulldozing the lot of them. It might mean that, but it also means that you are unable to remove native grasses in a paddock that you ploughed 10 years ago—a paddock that is an integrated part of your production cycle. The report also found that innovations such as introducing centre pivot irrigation and self-drive tractors as well as fencing and paddock rotation are being frustrated because of clearing restrictions. This can be as silly as being prevented from removing trees that have fallen down or lopping branches from trees that hang over your fence line.</para><para>I saw an example in my own electorate, where fallen timber in a dry creek bed choked any possible stream flow. The farmer dragged some of this out and left it in a heap. He did not burn it and actually left quite a bit in the creek, understanding the need for fish to have logs as part of their habitat. He is now facing a $1 million fine after a police style inquisition. Of course, you will not necessarily find a law that prevents these normal farming activities, but you will always find the forces of green advocacy acting as a gatekeeper. Everything is allowed, notionally and theoretically, but you will always need a permit or a soviet style panel to approve everything that you do.</para><para>I have another example. In the recently passed NSW native vegetation act you cannot touch remnant vegetation. Remnant vegetation is any native vegetation that has regrown following unlawful clearing or clearing caused by bushfire, flood, drought or other natural causes. Does this mean that seedlings coming up after bushfires, floods et cetera cannot be touched, even if the seedlings are not native to your area? I think it does. Further provisions of the bill indicate that you can only clear up to three metres out from your cattle yards and five metres along the sides of farm roads. Talk to any farmer about that, and they will tell you how ridiculous it is. I have said many times that regulation is a severe burden to farmers, and they continue to say to me: if governments would just get out of our back pocket and hip pocket, we would really appreciate it; we would not ask for subsidies and handouts if we were just left alone to do our business.</para><para>I am glad to say that one year after the last time I addressed the appropriation bills in this place, most of my electorate is recovering from a severe and exceptional drought. I attended a small country show in the little town of Jingellic—population less than 100 people—yesterday, and I was pleased to see that an optimistic mood prevailed. People were looking towards the future with a great deal more satisfaction and a much calmer attitude than they had 12 months ago. I can certainly understand why when I look back at what they have been through. It has rained, but we know that when it rains it does not rain money into your bank account. It will take a while for them to extract themselves from the circumstances that the drought put them in. But further out west it is not so good, and western New South Wales is still very dry. There have been some good rains in northern New South Wales and Queensland, but it literally takes months for that water to flow down in the river system. So very little water has arrived at the Menindee Lakes or the Lower Darling River. The Darling in that area has dried up into a series of rather sad waterholes.</para><para>I was very upset to receive, from somebody along that stretch of the river, an email that described the devastation, with many Murray cod dying along the banks:</para><quote><para>In the last day or so, we found, every 200 metres, large cod floating dead in the river—estimated weights between 30 and 60 pounds. We do not know why. It has been excessively hot weather but more likely though the consistently rank water quality has taken its toll. Whatever the cause it is too late for these big monarchs of the Darling. It really is a tragedy.</para></quote><para>I hasten to say that the cause of the deaths of the Murray cod is not the ghastly practices of irrigators who sometimes get attacked so unfairly but simply that it has not rained. The water, as it does in these river systems, has retreated into a series of holes where it has heated up and become an environment for blue-green algae. As soon as we get a flush of fresh water from up north, things will start to improve, and I look forward to that.</para><para>I, along with many other members and senators, attended the ecumenical service for the opening of parliament at the beginning of this parliamentary year. Professor James Haire gave the sermon. All of us who listened were inspired by his words and were encouraged in the work that we do. I am sure Professor Haire would not mind me quoting his concluding remarks, which I believe serve to remind all of us of the positive things we are capable of doing and our responsibility to be a force for good. I will conclude with those words:</para><quote><para>As you come down from the Hill each night, or even in the wee small hours, can you ask yourself two questions: Am I at peace with God?

We have been a very busy committee in this 40th Parliament. Factors of this are the good work by committee members and a hardworking secretariat. We have brought down six reports and one discussion paper in the 40th Parliament. For a government that allegedly does have a third term agenda and is committed to parliamentary reform it is surprising to go through the reports. On the <inline font-style="italic">Trial of additional tellers</inline> report tabled on 1 December, there has been no government response to date. Nor has there been a response to date on the <inline font-style="italic">Arrangements for second reading speeches</inline> report tabled on 1 December; Parliamentary paper 394 of 2003, tabled on 24 November 2003; Parliamentary paper 211, <inline font-style="italic">House estimates</inline><inline font-style="italic">:</inline><inline font-style="italic"> consideration of </inline><inline font-style="italic">the </inline><inline font-style="italic">annual estimates by the House of Representatives</inline> tabled on 13 October; <inline font-style="italic">Review of the conduct of divisions</inline>, tabled on 18 August; and <inline font-style="italic">Sessional order 344</inline>, tabled on 19 June 2003. In fact, the government has not responded to a Procedure Committee report since 27 June 2002.</para><para>I also want to draw the House's attention to a report in the 39th Parliament that still has not been responded to: <inline font-style="italic">Balancing tradition and progress: procedures for the opening of parliament</inline>. This report was tabled on 27 August 2001 and, again, there has been no government response to date. Recommendation 1 of the report was that there should be an Indigenous welcoming for the opening of a new parliament. As a member of that committee, I want to reiterate my strongest support for such an occurrence. As an adult, it pains me to think that the first occasion that I can recall that our Indigenous community was truly incorporated into the opening of anything was the Sydney Olympic Games. The whole nation was uplifted by the way our Indigenous community was involved and participated in the opening of the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games. How sad it is that this is the only occasion that I can recall as an Australian citizen when that has occurred. Surely you would join with me in saying how uplifting it would be to have a welcoming ceremony in the forecourt of Parliament House by the Ngunnawal people. I believe that, should Labor win the next election, that will be entirely possible. In addition to that, in any subsequent opening, wouldn't it be nice to have not only a welcoming by the Ngunnawal people—a sacred smoking ceremony—but also Indigenous representatives at that ceremony from each state and territory in the land?</para><para>The Procedure Committee also suggested that there should be a message from the Australian people and that someone like the Australian of the Year could do it. For me, I would be more inclined to have one or two young people make that message to the assembled senators and members.</para><para>The symbolism of having such a welcoming ceremony, a smoking ceremony, would place our Indigenous people at the heart of our deliberations. I think its incorporation in the opening of the Australian parliament is long overdue. It is an utter shame, an utter disgrace, that since that report was tabled on 27 August 2001—nearly 2½ years ago, when the Leader of the House was Peter Reith—the present Leader of the House, Mr Abbott, has failed to respond to the report. It is a disgrace. The failure to respond reflects the antipathy of the government and the cabinet to having an Indigenous welcome.</para><para>In this new century and this new millennium, having a welcoming ceremony would be an appropriate and a healing thing for us to do. It would bring the nation together. The people of Australia would welcome such a welcoming ceremony by our Indigenous community, just as they did with the Sydney Olympic Games. We hear government members saying, `Do positive things; do what we can for good.' I say to government members and to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, who is at the table: why won't you respond? Even if you reject the suggestion—and I would hope you would not—at least respond to the report; at least respond to the recommendation that there should be such a welcoming ceremony.</para><para>There has been a lot said about having an independent Speaker. In fact, in a number of speeches that he made, the member for Hotham proposed the idea that, for six years, you would have a Speaker from one side of the parliament and, after six years, the next Speaker would come from the other side of the parliament. This was the most creative suggestion about changes to the role of Speaker that we have had in a long time. It is not that I do not support that idea—I think it is a very worthwhile proposition—but the point that I would make is that, unless you have a government committed to reforming the parliament, it will not work in this House.</para><para>The Speaker is a prisoner of the standing orders. As much as you can have a Procedure Committee making recommendations for changes to the standing orders, if a government is of a mind not to change those standing orders, the Speaker is stuck with them. I do not know how many times Speaker Neil Andrew has suggested that the standing orders ought to be changed to allow him to rule one way or another—and I respect him for that; that is not a criticism.</para><para>I am pleased to say that the honourable member for Werriwa, when he was Manager of Opposition Business, agreed on behalf of the Australian Labor Party to two important changes in how we might reform this chamber. One was to set up a standing committee on appropriations and staffing. The Labor Party cannot claim that this is an idea that it developed. It was in fact Senator Jessop in the 1970s who proposed that there ought to be staffing and appropriations committees both for the Senate and the House to deal with their respective departments and that they would meet together for the joint departments. It is a matter of fact that the Senate proceeded to set up a staffing and appropriations committee, and successive presidents of the Senate would, I think, agree about the utility of the move and how it has been very helpful to them in negotiating with the Department of Finance and Administration for extra funding for the various things that are pertinent to the Senate.</para><para>We have no such body in the House of Representatives. It is a fact that the Department of the House of Representatives is the only area of government activity—if you can call it government activity; that is, department or statutory authority—that is not subject to any particular form of scrutiny. In this day and age, this lack of transparency and accountability is totally unacceptable. The honourable member for Werriwa supported a proposition, which the parliamentary Labor Party has adopted, to set up a staffing and appropriations committee for the House of Representatives—and I say well done.</para><para>The other area was to change the Procedure Committee. My notice of motion No. 19 proposes replacing standing order 330. It proposes that we establish a standing committee on modernisation and procedure of the House of Representatives. More importantly, it proposes that the Speaker or his appointed deputy speaker be a member of the committee. It also proposes that the Leader of the House and the Manager of Opposition Business be on the committee. If you have a government that is committed to reform and you have people like the Speaker, the Leader of the House and the Manager of Opposition Business as well as other members on that committee, clearly you will get reform. I am pleased to say that that proposal has already been adopted within the Australian Labor Party. Clearly, we in the Australian Labor Party are committed to reforming this place.</para><para>I contrast that with what the government has done. This is the 40th Parliament. The Procedure Committee has produced six reports, and not one of them has been responded to. The report on changing the procedures for the opening of parliament, which was tabled in August 2001, has not been responded to. It is an utter disgrace. There is no way that the government can claim to be of a mind to reform this parliament. The record speaks for itself. If we are to get a modern parliament, a parliament that is responsive to the people of Australia, it is not going to come from the other side of the House. I will make a prediction. There is no way that in this parliament the government will respond to the proposal to set up House estimates committees. What do the people of Australia want members of the House of Representatives to do? They want them to do their job and to hold the executive, government departments and statutory authorities accountable.</para><para>It is true that we have an appropriations debate, but that can in no way or measure suggest that we are holding the executive—the ministers of the Crown—their departments and their statutory authorities to any form of parliamentary scrutiny. We all know that the Senate does that, so why shouldn't the House? In particular, why shouldn't House ministers be accountable here? Mr Deputy Speaker Wilkie, I know you to be a person of wide interests on behalf of your constituents. Why shouldn't you have the opportunity on behalf of those constituents—representing the needs and aspirations of your electorate—to home in on particular departments to find out how the money is being spent, where it is being spent and whether or not your constituents are getting a fair share? You do not get that opportunity now.</para><para>In terms of developing our parliamentary knowledge and skills, compared with senators we members of the House of Representatives are handicapped. It is true that the Procedure Committee did not mirror Senate estimates procedures but represented completely different ones. But it would benefit us all and, essentially, we would be doing our job as members of this House acting on behalf of our constituents in a way that we are not now.</para><para>I will refer to a matter that occurred in my electorate. I was very pleased to be at the award presentation with Senator Marise Payne—who was the special guest—for a program for lone mothers, called Learning Circles. There were 32 participants in the program. Half of them are now in work and the others are in training. The cost was $53,000. I would like to read a couple of testimonials. Sherrie Harris was a sole mother who came to Mount Druitt with four children. This is what she had to say:</para><quote><para>I joined the Lone Parents program, firstly to find a full-time job and being new to Sydney, I wanted to find people I could socialise with and learn self-respect. The ultimate goal was to become fully independent and off the pension.</para><para>The Lone Parents program taught me how to find employment and training opportunities and also establishing friendships with people you saw once a week gave me a lot of support and respect for others and myself.</para><para>Doing this program enabled me to find full-time employment in May 2003 at Krispy Kreme in Penrith and I am still happily working there after 8 months (and I will still be working there when I am old enough to have a walking cane). I am extending my skills and knowledge on a daily basis through completion of various training programs and have been heavily involved in training new employees at other stores. Last week I was promoted to the Marketing and Promotions department where I will be involved in various functions and events and I have been enrolled in TAFE to complete the Certificate IV Workplace Assessment and Training.</para><para>My involvement in the Lone Parents program has enabled me to provide my children with more opportunities and has certainly improved our quality of life.</para><para>Thank you to all who have helped in making my dreams come true.</para></quote><para>Another participant, Gemma Currey, said:</para><quote><para>I joined the Learning Circles program to update my skills and to get the support I needed in order to boost my confidence to re-enter the workforce.</para><para>Through the program I could focus on my chosen career path (not just a job) and in July 2003 I successfully gained full-time employment at Blacktown Boys High School in the position of Science Assistant.</para><para>This opportunity has enabled me to attend various training courses and provided me with the skills and networks necessary to work in other departments within the Education system.</para><para>The Learning Circle has provided me with strong friendships and a solid support base for the future. It has also provided 31 other sole parents to achieve their dreams and be positive role models for their children.</para></quote><para>These are two tremendously moving stories, and to hear Sherrie Harris on that day was an absolute knockout. Why am I raising this? Tragically, this program did not have Commonwealth funding. There was a mere $53,000 for a 12-month program for 32 participants. It had a huge success rate, but it appears that the program is going to close. There appears to be no opportunity to get federal money to continue this program. We have demonstrated the benefit and the impact that it has on the participants, yet it looks as though Learning Circles will just be a one-off. We cannot afford that. We keep on lecturing people about getting into the work force and getting a job but, when it comes to having programs that actually provide the wherewithal to allow that to happen, it does not happen. We do not just need programs for the Mount Druitt Learning Circles; we should have more learning circles right across Australia. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>25465</page.no><name role="metadata">Entsch, Warren, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ENTSCH</name><name.id>7K6</name.id><electorate>Leichhardt</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This evening, in speaking on the <inline ref="R1975">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2003-2004</inline>, the <inline ref="R1976">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2003-2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R1977">Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2003-2004</inline>, I would like to focus on the vital issue of health. There is little doubt that in the recent Queensland state election, health and the state of the Cairns Base Hospital was the No. 1 issue of concern in our region. The debate between the sitting Labor members in the Cairns region and the challenging Liberal candidates, Stephen Welsh and Bob Manning, was certainly very interesting to watch. It was characterised on the one hand by the silence and denial from Labor about the problems plaguing the Cairns Base Hospital while, on the other hand, Bob Manning and Stephen Welsh had the guts to come out and put forward a well thought out and very sound plan for reform. Labor blamed everyone but themselves for the seemingly entrenched problems and low staff morale at the Cairns Base Hospital. Labor members refused to acknowledge the genuine concerns of nurses and doctors and effectively said, `We have spent something like $130 million on redeveloping the local hospitals, so stop complaining.'</para></talk.start><para>In fact, 2003 was a bad year for health in Cairns. Patients suffered and staff were demoralised. The health department unleashed a punitive review, and staff who spoke out were threatened with losing their jobs. The hospital lost an acute medical ward of some 22 beds, ignoring the fact that, despite being isolated at the northern end of the state, the number of beds per capita is one of the lowest in Australia. Cairns also lost its public cardiology service by driving three cardiologists out of the public system in less than a year. They were driven out because there was absolutely no support whatsoever given to them in their work, and it is not surprising that replacements have still not been found for those positions. An intensive care bed that was promised after a rally of concerned people from the local community in February 2002 simply disappeared due to nursing cuts.</para><para>The women in Cairns are coping with a gynaecology ward that is often closed or has dramatically reduced bed numbers. We have a situation there where women who have lost a child are sharing rooms with new breast-feeding mums. This is very difficult for those women who have lost a baby. A top-heavy centralised bureaucracy is running the show for its own self-interest. Nurses, unfortunately, are leaving in droves. If, as Labor claim, they have done a raft of things to fix the Cairns Base Hospital, you have to ask why local doctors and nurses are still expressing some very serious concerns about the state of the hospital and why patients are still being left untreated for hours and hours on end. The answer is that unfortunately we have a state government which is run by a presidential style Premier who is more interested in providing slick public relations fixes to serious problems affecting our hospital in Cairns than he is in addressing the real problems that he is responsible for.</para><para>Late last year I was inundated with letters of concern from constituents in relation to the standard of the Cairns Base Hospital. I was overwhelmed by some 4,000 responses to a letter drop calling for public comment on the condition of the hospital. One of the most heart-wrenching responses was from a woman claiming that her newborn child had died because she could not get medical attention fast enough. Another woman told of going into labour with her first child but being sent home twice over three days with sleeping tablets and pain-killers to delay her contractions because no beds were available. Finally, a 73-year-old man from Redlynch who had been waiting for new dentures for three years was forced to get by with a pair that were more than 30 years old.</para><para>We should not have to be talking about the chronic problems plaguing the Cairns Base Hospital; these problems should have been fixed many years ago. We should instead be talking about and planning right now for a new hospital and health services that Cairns will inevitably need in the next 15 to 20 years. The fact that we are not talking about the future—that the state government is still running around trying to fix the health problems of its own making—is nothing short of a tragedy.</para><para>Our state Liberal candidates during the recent election campaign got it right when they put forward a plan for addressing the problems of the base hospital. The current situation at the hospital is characterised by withdrawal of services, very low staff morale, questionable management practices, lack of resources and certainly no political leadership. What is needed is a genuine commitment to fix the problem, and they can start by reopening the lost acute medical ward and the lost gynaecology beds. Also, they could look seriously at the reclassification of Cairns as a group A hospital, which would be in recognition of the isolation of Cairns and the services our population has paid for. We also need a very transparent funding system and involvement of our local population in the running of the hospital. This has to be clear of government control of the bureaucracy.</para><para>The government has to clearly articulate just what level of health service is to be provided by the Cairns Base Hospital: no more political spin; just a statement of fact so that everyone knows and understands what is going to be done. So far all the Beattie government has provided are bandaid solutions to major problems, running around patching up one public relations crisis after another with no understanding of the cause behind these problems. Simply throwing money around in the hope of a quick fix is no answer. Funding must be backed up with serious management reform. What we need is accountability and transparency. At the moment, major funding decisions are made by bureaucrats in Brisbane who do not have to live with their decisions.</para><para>These bureaucrats should be replaced, in my view, by a hospital corporation with a board of directors headed by local business, community leaders and a chief executive officer, which would provide a degree of ownership for the Cairns community that they do not have at present. This board of directors would include specialist medical representation and, together with the CEO, would be responsible for staffing and structure in accordance with broad government policy. They would agree with the government on budgets and performance criteria, based on the specific requirements of the Cairns Base Hospital.</para><para>Mr Beattie should accept his responsibilities, stop blaming everybody else for the problems in Cairns and stop trying to wallpaper over the fundamental structure and management issues contributing to the ongoing problems. It is time to give the ownership of and responsibility for the Cairns Base Hospital back to Cairns and back to the Cairns community. Health is the No. 1 issue in this community, and the Queensland state government has to face up to this fact.</para><para>On the other hand, though, I think this situation presents a very strong argument for nationalising the Australian health system. This would ensure that all of the funding was taken out of the states' hands and given directly to the communities who needed it, avoiding the bloated administrative bureaucracy from state governments Australia wide which is certainly contributing to the dreadful problems that we are seeing in many of our state hospitals. I would encourage that line of thought; I think it is a great opportunity for us to start thinking outside the square. Given the state governments' chronic mismanagement of our health system in recent years, I do believe that this presents an opportunity to start thinking about direct funding to local communities, which would see a significant improvement in our hospitals and the provision of health services. And I believe that, by preventing the states from syphoning off and cost shifting significant amounts of Commonwealth funding, we would see greater injections of funds into these areas.</para><para>On a more positive health issue, I would like to say a few words about a wonderful non-government funded program based in my electorate which helps children with hearing difficulties. The Hear and Say Centre in North Queensland is based in Sheridan Street, Cairns, and provides education services to children with moderate to profound hearing difficulties located in areas from Townsville to Cairns and throughout the Cape York region. Hear and Say supports 10 children living with major hearing impediments throughout North Queensland. These children have cochlear implants or other hearing aids.</para><para>Hear and Say teaches children with hearing difficulties to listen, interpret and understand what they are hearing, often for the first time in their lives. Treating and teaching young children locally certainly delivers more effective outcomes than if they had to travel regularly to Brisbane—which would be the case if this service were not available—to access this support. Children identified as having profound hearing loss have only a very small window of opportunity, following corrective treatment, to learn how to listen and, just as importantly, to interpret and understand what they are saying. By the age of 6½ the learning window is all but closed.</para><para>It is clear that this is a very important service. However, as a self-funded organisation, Hear and Say North Queensland faced closure at the end of 2003 unless it secured funding for 2004. Closure would have been disastrous for those 10 young children that Hear and Say currently supports, who would have been forced to travel to Brisbane to receive the help that they need to overcome their major hearing difficulties. As you can imagine, the cost of those children having to travel to Brisbane for assistance would have been very significant, to say the least.</para><para>For many of those families, there was no way in the world that they were going to be able to afford those ongoing travel costs, given that it would have been necessary for them to travel to Brisbane on a very regular basis—every few months or so. That would have caused a huge financial drain on them. In fact, some of those families would have had great difficulty finding that money, so there is a chance that some of those kids would have missed out on that valuable ongoing training and support that they need. On top of the financial cost, the disruption to family life would also have been very significant: in most of these families there are other children, and parents having to travel with the child with the hearing disability would mean that those other children would be outside the family unit on a regular basis. It would certainly have been a great problem.</para><para>Fortunately, a local cooperative effort has led to a funding solution by securing ongoing financial support for the Hear and Say Centre in Cairns. I had a call from Hear and Say's founder and Clinical Director, Dimity Dornan, to alert me to the serious funding challenges that it faced. After a meeting with Dimity in my office, I discovered that the centre needed in the vicinity of $50,000 or its doors would close in May this year, and that that funding had to be ongoing. It could not be raised just once; the centre had to show that it could continue to provide that level of funding on an ongoing basis.</para><para>The centre's local coordinator, Kerry Endres, who has a profoundly deaf son, Sam—and I have spoken about Sam in this place before—had voiced her concerns also about the possibility of having to travel to Brisbane on a regular basis for Sam to receive treatment. Another mum, Andrea Crimmins from Port Douglas, had great concerns for her seven-year-old son, Corey, who would no longer be able to receive local treatment. I could certainly appreciate the concerns that they had. Having been previously associated with the good work Hear and Say had done, I could not say no to helping these kids to find a solution to their problems and to have the best possible start in life.</para><para>I contacted a friend, the General Manager of Trinity Petroleum—a fuel outlet company in Cairns—Jeff Hopgood. I spoke to Jeff about the plight of these families, and the response of Jeff and Trinity Petroleum to the situation was nothing short of magnificent. After some discussion, Trinity Petroleum agreed to donate $24,000 a year to Hear and Say North Queensland. This is, as I said, ongoing funding of $2,000 a month; the funding will be continuing. I suggest this is probably one of the more generous philanthropic contributions in our region. On top of that, Trinity Petroleum have offered to put collection boxes in their eight service stations throughout the region to encourage further donations from motorists. To encourage those donations, each month Trinity Petroleum will draw a prize of some $100 worth of fuel for motorists generous enough to contribute to Hear and Say.</para><para>Trinity Petroleum certainly has shown itself to be a very community conscious corporation. It has previously supported local groups and individuals in need over a number of years. But this particular contribution is something that is certainly worthy of recognition. It just shows that there are people out there—people like Jeff Hopgood—who are prepared to share some of their successes with their home communities by giving ongoing support to such wonderful organisations as Hear and Say.</para><para>I believe it would also be appropriate for us to look at ways in which both state and federal governments could also make some contribution to this organisation. Not too many years ago the opportunities in life for children afflicted with profound deafness would have been very limited. We now have a situation where these kids, through the Hear and Say centre, are able to reach their full potential. A small investment by both state and federal governments in these children would be money very well spent.</para><para>It is interesting, too, that during this process I was approached by the owner of a local restaurant, Marinades, in Cairns. They had also been made aware of the situation with Hear and Say. I spoke to Mr Dev Rao, who is the owner of Marinades, and he told me how he appreciated the fact that he had come into this country and had been very successful in his business. He was looking for some way in which he could show some level of appreciation for the support that he had received from the Cairns community. He came into my office and presented me with a $5,000 cheque. That was his way of saying thank you to the Cairns community. That $5,000 cheque went into the coffers of Hear and Say and certainly helped to guarantee that we would see Hear and Say staying in Cairns well into the future.</para><para>There is no doubt about it: Hear and Say North Queensland is an essential service for our region. I have to again say thank you very much to Jeff Hopgood of Trinity Petroleum and to Dev Rao for their incredibly generous support for this wonderful organisation. It is through their generosity that we in Far North Queensland can all look forward to seeing that organisation continue their vital work for hearing impaired children. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>25469</page.no><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Dr EMERSON</name><name.id>83V</name.id><electorate>Rankin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Last week, in a desperate search for a policy—any policy—the government discovered the need to address the problem of inadequate retirement incomes in this country. In its documentation, the government said in relation to retirement incomes:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Compulsory employer superannuation contributions comprise the second pillar of the retirement income system. The Superannuation Guarantee was introduced in 1992 and the ten-year phase in of the Superannuation Guarantee minimum contribution rate was completed on 1 July 2002 with the rate now at 9 per cent. The coverage of superannuation in Australia has grown significantly as a result of the introduction of the Superannuation Guarantee system. The latest estimates show that 98 per cent of employees with leave entitlements and 72 per cent of casual employees are covered by superannuation.</para></quote><para>You would be forgiven for believing that the government embraced superannuation; that it thought it was a good idea. But that is not the truth. This government has been hostile to the very notion of superannuation for working Australians. If the Prime Minister and Treasurer had had their way there would be no superannuation for wage earners; there would only be superannuation for the privileged. I refer to statements by the then opposition spokesperson on superannuation, speaking on Labor's Superannuation Guarantee Charge Bill 1992. In his speech on the second reading debate, the Liberal opposition spokesman said:</para><motion><para>That is why we find this legislation so absolutely abhorrent ... Australia does not need, and cannot afford, these proposals at this time.</para></motion><para>That is the coalition view on Labor 's superannuation initiatives that were introduced into the parliament by Prime Minister Keating. But that is not all: there is a range of further statements by this government that show exactly what their attitude has been to superannuation as a contributor to adequate retirement incomes. The now Treasurer, Mr Costello, said in this parliament on 13 May 1991:</para><quote><para>The Government cannot expect people to create jobs when it wants to load superannuation contributions and training taxes onto them ...</para></quote><para>That was the now Treasurer saying what he believed about superannuation and the merits of it. The current Prime Minister, when he was Treasurer back in 1981, said:</para><quote><para>... the government had decided not to introduce the scheme of national superannuation recommended by a majority of the committee.</para></quote><para>That was the Hancock committee back in 1981. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer of this country have a long track record of stated hostility to superannuation, and they come into this parliament now and say that they are the friends of superannuation—almost as if they had invented superannuation; but of course they did not. They displayed nothing but hostility towards superannuation. In a speech on 25 November 1985, the Prime Minister said:</para><quote><para>The issue of superannuation is, day by day, assuming more importance in the economic and political debate in Australia, and well it may because the current campaign for superannuation benefits which flows out of the renegotiated prices and incomes accord owes more to a Chicago-style extortion racket than it does to a proper and logical extension of superannuation.</para><para>...	...	...</para><para>That was a phoney, dishonest deal contrived at the time by the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations. </para><para>Of course, that action is now coming back to haunt the Government. More importantly, it is coming back to haunt the poor unfortunate employers of Australia. The employers were not given a seat at the renegotiation of the accord. They were not asked two and a half months ago whether they believed in paying 3 per cent more in respect of superannuation.</para></quote><para>There you go: that is the current Prime Minister then, again, indicating his total hostility to superannuation for working Australians. But, of course, Prime Minister Keating prevailed. He said in a speech in July 1991:</para><quote><para>It's a very long way off for most of you here, but what I want to talk to you about today is an issue that is going to be of critical importance to Australia over the next few decades. That is the issue of retirement, and how we pay for it. What we need is not only recognition of the problem and a solution, we also need decisive action to put that solution into effect ...</para></quote><para>And he went on to explain what he had in mind. That was Mr Keating back in July 1991—and here we are in 2004, and this government have now discovered the importance of superannuation to adequate retirement incomes. Back in 1991, Labor leaders were saying, `That is exactly what we need,' but they were opposed, root and branch, at every opportunity by the coalition. Worse than opposing superannuation, when this government came into office they cancelled Labor's co-contribution in their 1996 budget. In so doing, the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, broke his promise. An article in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of 3 February 1996, before the election, states:</para><quote><para>Mr Howard said the coalition would guarantee that taxpayers would get the “full measure and the full value” of the proposed Government payments, but this could be “by way of supplementation or some other benefit”.</para><para>...	...	...</para><para>He said people would “be no worse off” or “short-changed by a Howard government”.</para></quote><para>Short-changed? They cancelled the superannuation co-contribution that would have taken superannuation adequacy up to 15 per cent; and then they have the gall, last week, to say they have discovered superannuation and the need for an adequate retirement incomes policy. What hypocrisy! Hypocrisy, thy name is Liberal.</para><para>The government continued with the big Liberal lie. The big Liberal lie is this: this government cancelled the superannuation co-contribution, which was the second instalment of the tax cuts that were promised by the previous Labor government, and the Treasurer has said repeatedly, `There was one tax cut which did not pay $1 to one person for one day.' The Treasurer has said this time and time again. He said it again, in parliament on 11 May 2000, when he said:</para><quote><para>... the last time they were promised them they were not paid for one day and for one dollar.</para></quote><para>Not only did he say it then and once before but the Treasurer of this country has said in this parliament 12 times that Labor's tax cuts were not paid for one day or for one dollar—including in a matter of public importance speech titled `Public life: Ethical standards and honesty'. In that speech, the Treasurer repeated his lie that Labor's tax cuts were not paid for one day or for one dollar.</para><para>Let us have a look at the truth. The first half of those tax cuts were delivered, and they were delivered ahead of schedule. Just the first half of those tax cuts were a much bigger proportion of income tax collections than the Treasurer's own tax cuts in the 2003 budget were. I have worked it out. The Labor tax cuts, delivered ahead of schedule in 1993, were 5.1 per cent of personal income tax; whereas the Treasurer's tax cuts of 2003 were 2.5 per cent of personal income tax. The second instalment of the tax cuts was converted by the Keating Labor government into $4 billion worth of superannuation contributions for working Australians, and it was that co-contribution that was cancelled by this government after Mr Howard, then the opposition leader, promised that there would be no disadvantage, that he would not be taking anything off the working men and women of Australia. But he did. One of the very first measures of the government, when they came into this parliament, was to cancel that co-contribution, worth $4 billion, which would have taken superannuation up to 15 per cent. Then they come along and say, `We really need to do something about the adequacy of retirement incomes.' How on earth these people have managed to get away with this for so long is beyond me. It is absolutely breathtaking. When the Treasurer speaks about tax cuts, he also speaks about budgets. In parliament on 10 May 2000, he said:</para><quote><para>First of all, we put the budget into surplus on a headline basis, which the Labor Party never did. Then we say, `We ought to put the budget into a surplus on an underlying basis,' which the Labor Party never did.</para></quote><para>That is just untrue; it is another great Liberal lie. Labor produced headline surpluses in 1987-88, 1988-89, 1989-90 and 1990-91, and Labor produced underlying surpluses in 1972-73, 1973-74, 1974-75, 1987-88, 1988-89, 1989-90 and 1990-91. Yet the Treasurer said Labor never produced a surplus on a headline basis or an underlying basis. When talking about tax cuts at the National Press Club to a packed audience of journalists on 10 May 2000, the Treasurer said:</para><quote><para>... there is a very large proportion of the Australian public which has no experience of income tax cuts. If you've been in the workforce for 10 years, you've not known what an income tax cut is ... And I was thinking back through my own experience of taxation policy, of my own experience and I can vouch for someone who has been in the workforce for about 20 years. Was that whenever we seemed to get to the barrier on income tax cuts, for some reason or another they were never paid.</para></quote><para>Again, this is another great Liberal lie. Labor gave tax cuts seven times in 13 years. I will give you the years: November 1984, December 1986, July 1987, July 1989, January 1990, January 1991 and November 1993. Yet the Treasurer went to the National Press Club in 2000 and said there had not been a tax cut in this country for 20 years, and the Press Club full of journalists apparently accepted that.</para><para>This Treasurer says the same thing over and over again—the same untruth, the great Liberal lie. He is getting to the point where he knows that, if he says it over and over again—and he has already said it a dozen times in the parliament—people will believe him. He says that there were no tax cuts for 20 years, yet there were seven tax cuts in 13 years under Labor, handing back every cent of bracket creep and even more. That is something that this government has never done. This government owes the taxpayers of Australia a large amount of money in bracket creep—a fact that has been reported widely in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> newspaper, amongst many.</para><para>How much longer are the government going to get away with the big Liberal lie that Labor's tax cuts were never paid for one day or for one dollar? The fact is that the Liberals in government in 1996 cancelled the very superannuation co-contributions that would have taken retirement incomes up to an adequacy of 15 per cent, the target figure. They withdrew that—they axed it—after promising that they would not do so. That is why I say: `Hypocrisy, thy name is Liberal.'</para><para>The government has been searching for a third term agenda, a third term policy. It has no third term agenda, let alone a fourth term agenda. For eight years the Howard government has been harvesting the productivity yield from the hard economic reforms implemented by the Hawke and Keating governments. Now, tragically, productivity growth is forecast to turn down again, after a record-breaking decade. And what is the government doing about it?</para><para>I started warning about this in the year 2001, because the portents were then clearly evident. For its productivity growth and Australia's prosperity the government has relied, overwhelmingly, on Labor's creation of an open and competitive economy. But you cannot create an open and competitive economy twice. Without a new economic reform program aimed at the new sources of productivity growth, Australia's productivity performance was always going to suffer. And a slump in productivity growth and the ageing of the population are about as dangerous a cocktail as you could possibly imagine. Each ingredient—the productivity slump and the ageing of the population—is harmful, but together they are pure poison. Yet that is the official outlook.</para><para>The report heralded by the Treasurer and the Prime Minister of this country last week, their own <inline font-style="italic">Intergenerational Report</inline>, forecasts productivity growth to slump back to its 30-year, mediocre, long-term average by the middle of this decade—which is one year away. And what is the government doing about this disastrous outlook? On productivity, it is doing absolutely nothing. If you combine that forecast slump in productivity growth with the ageing of the population you get a startling result. By the year 2010 onwards that poisonous combination is expected to cause an almost halving of Australia's per capita GDP growth. This forecast slump in Australia's per capita GDP growth from the end of the decade onwards would constitute the slowest rate of improvement in measured living standards in Australia since the 1930s.</para><para>The government's own official documentation is forecasting a per capita GDP growth rate from the end of this decade not seen since the decade of the Great Depression. And they have only just woken up to it. They have an <inline font-style="italic">Intergenerational Report</inline> and last week they woke up to the need to address retirement incomes policy in Australia. And what was their response? They did a bit of tinkering here and there, and they attempted to appropriate the whole notion of a retirement incomes policy. They are attempting to appropriate for themselves the whole notion that superannuation is good when, for the last 15 years—or going back to 1981, in the case of the Prime Minister—they have expressed and displayed nothing but hostility to superannuation for the working men and women of this country. Over that entire period, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer and other spokespeople have argued that superannuation should be the preserve of the privileged and not be available through the mechanisms that Labor has used to deliver superannuation to the working men and women of this country.</para><para>The prognosis on productivity is a slump in productivity growth from next year back to the 30-year, mediocre, long-term average after a record-breaking decade. So what is the government doing about productivity growth? Nothing. The three sources of modern productivity growth, as recognised around the world, are skills development, new ideas and infrastructure. This government has failed to invest in skills formation in this country—a fact that is recognised by the Productivity Commission. There has been no discernible contribution to productivity growth through skills formation over the last decade. What an indictment on this government. There has been no contribution from skills formation because there has not been any significant skills formation.</para><para>The government's contribution to all of this is that, over the 10 years to 2001-02, government spending on education fell from 4.3 per cent of GDP to 3.8 per cent of GDP. The <inline font-style="italic">Intergenerational Report</inline> forecasts further reductions in government spending on education. The government has done nothing about skills formation. A yawning gap has opened up in Australia's private sector investment in research and development, compared with that of the countries with which we compete. There is precious little in the way of infrastructure and in the other area—the ageing of the population—in which the government is tinkering. </para><para>There was a great opportunity for Australia in 1996 as a result of the second tranche of tax cuts that were converted into superannuation co-contributions. The most vandalistic action of this government, which has prejudiced the retirement incomes of generations of Australians, has been to cancel the co-contribution. Yet the Treasurer of this country says that the tax cuts that were promised by Labor were never delivered for one day or for one dollar. He said that 12 times in the parliament and many times in other places. It is a great Liberal lie. He has the temerity to speak about public ethics, in a matter of public importance, and about the importance of telling the truth. Give us a break! </para><para>That is what this Treasurer has been up to. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer have displayed nothing but hostility to superannuation for the working men and women of Australia. Last week they discovered a problem, but they have never posed a solution because they do not believe in a retirement incomes policy for the working men and women of this country. They are vandals and they ought to be condemned for their vandalism for cancelling those co-contributions back in 1996 and for then having the temerity to lie about it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>25474</page.no><name role="metadata">Stone, Dr Sharman, MP</name><name role="display">Dr STONE</name><name.id>EM6</name.id><electorate>Murray</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak in support of the government's <inline ref="R1975">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2003-2004,</inline><inline ref="R1976">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2003-2004</inline> and <inline ref="R1977">Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2003-2004</inline>. Amongst other initiatives, these appropriation bills include expenditure critical to maintaining Australia's peacekeeping commitments and aid work in the Pacific. As well, there are funds to assist in putting people traffickers out of business. Such appropriations demonstrate that this John Howard led government does not simply offer platitudes or pay mere lip-service to the values that underpin our society. This government is prepared to commit funds, our own defence forces and other resources to actively assist countries who seek to deliver the freedoms and safety that we now take for granted. </para></talk.start><para>More than 1,000 individuals holding three- to five-year temporary protection visas live in the electorate of Murray. Most came originally from Iraq. They have joined another 4,000 or so humanitarian refugees, also mostly from Iraq, who came through the legitimate channels and have recently settled in the Cobram and Shepparton communities. The TPV holders tell harrowing tales of unseaworthy, dangerously overcrowded boats, and of the misinformation peddled by the criminals operating the trafficking networks. Many consider it a miracle that they managed to survive the last leg of their journey that took them by aircraft through a number of countries until they pushed off from a beach on their short sea voyage from Indonesia, bound for Australia. We will never know how many people drowned at sea during a time when human trafficking seemed a comparatively straightforward way to jump the queue for refugee resettlement in Australia. Through swift and appropriate action, our government has broken the back of the people-smuggling gangs, who had no interest in the safety of their human cargo once it had paid up and was pushed off. </para><para>I strongly support our government's measures that have helped to put the people smugglers out of business. This measure has saved lives. As well, it helps to ensure that our own carefully managed humanitarian program delivers relief and a new life to the most needy. Priority access to the security and protection of Australia should not be determined according to who has the best connections with criminal networks and who can most readily raise the funds to buy their way across borders.</para><para>While the appropriations detailed in these bills ensure that our international peacekeeping and aid work continues, the appropriations also deliver nearly $300 million in drought assistance and interim support payments to rural and regional Australia, where families are struggling to overcome the economic, environmental and community impacts of one of the worst and most extensive droughts on record. The Commonwealth's exceptional circumstances drought assistance continues to put food on the table for over 1,000 families in the electorate of Murray. </para><para>Unfortunately, because of the failure of the Victorian government to cooperate, at least another 1,000 families, trying to survive on the Murray irrigation system, received only six months of interim Commonwealth support. This support ceased in September last year. The Victorian state government refused to drought declare the area covered by the Murray irrigation system. However, it did declare others—the Goulburn, the Campaspe, the Loddon and some dry land areas—as drought affected, opening for them access to the full `exceptional circumstances' support that the Commonwealth could provide. Farms in these state preferred areas also became eligible for a $20,000 grant offered by the state in a small window of opportunity which they snapped shut immediately the 2003 state election was over. Hundreds of families in these state preferred areas missed out because of the sudden withdrawal of funds. Those in the Murray irrigation area never had the opportunity to apply, even though they too were in desperate circumstances. I cannot begin to tell you how stressful it is when some in a community receive assistance and others, equally worthy, miss out. </para><para>I wish to thank the Commonwealth government for stepping in and delivering at least some six months of interim support for Murray irrigators, despite the lack of recommendation from the state. Sadly, however, without the state backing their bid for full `exceptional circumstances', their interim support lapsed. Since then the local Centrelink office has noted a 500 per cent increase in applications for the Commonwealth Farm Help program which continues to deliver some weekly support payments that are literally putting food on the table for the numbers of these farm families now without EC support. </para><para>It is very difficult to imagine how the Victorian government can continue to justify why the Murray irrigation system irrigators, who are operating the same mix of enterprises as those next door and are experiencing the same weather conditions and with very similar economic circumstances, have never been given access to the Victorian government's drought relief package. I believe they have a moral obligation to now extend the state package to such farm enterprises, given that the Victorian government's refusal to supply the data or statement of support required by the EC regulations meant their application for full EC payments could not proceed.</para><para>In a cruel twist of fate, on 29 September last year the coldest series of frosts on record wiped out much of the season's harvest for these same drought affected orchardists in the Murray and Goulburn valleys. Hail and strong winds followed. Cereal crops, as well as fruit, were destroyed. So here we go again: trying to get the state to support the case for exceptional circumstances funding for another extraordinary event, which wiped out more than 50 per cent—and in some cases over 95 per cent—of the returns of the farm enterprises affected. In a rerun of the drought EC application debacle, the Victorian government argued for months that they did not intend to pay for the data collection—a task which is readily and regularly undertaken by other states as part of their responsibility in bringing forward EC applications to the Commonwealth. In northern Victoria, because of the state's refusal to pay, local councils have employed consultants and farm organisations have tried to raise the funds to produce the data, which then must still be passed through the state as it makes its application to the Commonwealth. Four and a half months after the frost damage, the Victorian government submitted an EC application for the Goulburn Valley orchardists. The omissions in the data submitted were so significant that the Australian government has requested that further information to argue the case be urgently supplied. Is it any wonder that small orchards in particular are in despair and banks are becoming extremely nervous.</para><para>Quite clearly, the review of the exceptional circumstances regulations and processes now under way must eradicate the potential for uncaring city-centric state governments to stymie applications for assistance. They should not be able to deliberately go slow or cause delays by delivering such incompetent material that precious time is wasted. Exceptional circumstances support should not be about political point scoring but about delivering emergency funding in exceptional circumstances from caring governments which understand what is at stake.</para><para>To compound the problems of frost damage and the consequent loss of the season's early fruit, early pickers were turned away; they have now failed to materialise when the pears and late fruit crops are in need of harvesting. So, in the first weeks of full operation in local fruit manufacturing, after many weeks of delay, with significantly less fruit to process, with export returns being killed by exchange rates, with the domestic market's dominant retailers viciously squeezing suppliers' prices because they can, and when things could not have been tougher for the northern Victorian fruit industry, the unions decided to shut down the factories. Can you imagine a more bloody-minded and short-sighted action than the union bosses of the AMWU pulling out the workers at the SPC Ardmona factories, with demands for wage increases, long-term job security and less management flexibility in transferring workers between the two factories sites, which are some 10 minutes drive apart. This was a strike that took work from a huge casual pool of seasonal workers who depend on the few months of work to supplement family income for the year. It was a strike timed to do maximum damage to an industry sector that was at its most vulnerable due to circumstances way beyond its control.</para><para>Obviously, all Victorians are going through an industrial relations induced nightmare at present, as the Bracks government leadership reaps the results of years of capitulation to union interests—too often at the expense of a competitive and flexible business sector. Job security becomes fairly meaningless—in fact, academic—when the boss's business has gone to the wall. Nor is the public sector immune from this current industrial unrest. Victorian teachers' strikes could see 60,000 students being kept at home next week. Nurses are keen to see their demands met or else. Power has been cut by workers who did not seem to care who was hurt, how or when. There is currently 30 per cent more industrial disputation in Victoria than in any other state.</para><para>The federal Leader of the Opposition, the member for Werriwa, in his first few days in the job liked to claim that anyone in Australia can achieve and make good—make a future—if they would just put in the hard yards, like him and his mum and the rest of his mates. I challenge him to look a Goulburn Valley fruit grower in the eye, when they have invested everything and have worked very hard only to find that freak weather conditions and the exquisite timing of the union's actions have put all this at risk. Old Labor habits die hard, despite the rhetoric. When a few union leaders can disrupt the enterprise of a region that is struggling to regain momentum after the worst drought on record and the worst frosts on record and the financial consequences of the state's dairy deregulation decisions, there can be no direct relationship between effort and earnings.</para><para>When the factory that converts your fruit to income to feed your family and to pay off the overdraft is shut down because no-one is going to break the picket line, there is not much joy in the words of the member for Werriwa. Besides, primary producers have long memories; they remember the days when sending top grade fresh fruit to the ports in containers was a lottery: `Would it leave on time?' `Would it go at all?' `Would the wharfies work this week?' Those days are over, thanks to the courageous industrial relations reforms of the Howard government. Today we boast some of the most efficient waterfront practices in the region and, because of the huge investment the Australian coalition government has made in major and minor roads and rail, the fresh and manufactured produce can get to the wharves in record time and in peak condition.</para><para>As I talk to my constituents, tough-spirited as they are, they like to reflect on aspects of their business activity that sustain them during this adversity. They thank the heavens and the Treasurer, Peter Costello, for the low interest rates in a growing economy. They remember only too well the 22 per cent interest rates in the early 1990s when Labor governments held sway in the state of Victoria as well as federally. They remember `the recession we had to have'. They applaud the free trade agreement and its prospects for them if it is passed by the Labor opposition. They acknowledge the more than $1 million per week from the Commonwealth which flows into the region for those still receiving exceptional circumstances payments and the support from Farm Help.</para><para>My constituents acknowledge the efforts being made to bring better services and infrastructure to small towns and diminishing communities—for example, through the great rural transaction centres, through small equipment grants, for veterans' projects and for the aged, and for employment projects to try and get work for the Indigenous population and for those who have not had a job in their family for generations. Since 1997, mobile phone coverage has become a reality across most of the electorate of Murray. Over 30 exchanges have been upgraded, giving access to faster and better telecommunications services. It is becoming less of a disadvantage to advertise the fact that you do business from home. These appropriation bills put another $12.8 million into helping fund the government's response to the recommendations of the inquiry into regional telecommunications.</para><para>To the Murray electorate goes the dubious distinction of having what are amongst the lowest bulk-billing rates in Australia, and this is not a recent phenomenon. The rates were at around 30 per cent when the Liberal government was first elected in 1996. Low bulk-billing rates are a direct consequence of a lack of sufficient health service providers—doctors, nurses, specialists of any description. General practitioners are more inclined to charge $20 or more above the Medicare rebate than offer bulk-billing to individuals—it does not matter if they are health care card holders, juveniles or those in deep distress who wait for weeks for a very short appointment.</para><para>These appropriation bills nominate some $38.8 million in funds for the implementation of the MedicarePlus package. This package aims to give greater incentive to doctors to offer bulk-billed services in particular to welfare recipients and the young. As well, it aims to provide a safety net for those who end up having to buy a significant number of health care services because of their circumstances and their health. The John Howard government recognised the decades of neglect that had occurred and started investing in the Murray electorate's health care future seven years ago. A Goulburn Valley department of rural health and clinical school was funded, amongst some other half dozen such projects across Australia. This clinical school and department of rural health operates in association with the University of Melbourne. The aim is to train city based students in a region where hopefully they will choose to stay.</para><para>The measures in the 2003--04 federal budget build on the government's $562 million regional health strategy. As part of a package to help with medical indemnity, the federal government is providing $10.3 million over four years to increase financial support for obstetricians in rural and remote areas. Given our need for such services with babies now very often not able to be born in nearby hospitals, I can only applaud the efforts being made to bring back gynaecological and obstetric services to rural and regional Victoria. There are rural retention program incentives and special rural women's GP services now being funded; there are financial incentives to help rural students study medicine. In Murray some of our brightest and best students can now go to university and study medical or other health related sciences because the government is helping them pay their way.</para><para> There is a critical need to enhance the provision of health care services in northern Victoria, where rates of depression have escalated due to the financial pressures from the drought—and, tragically, suicide rates reflect this. Schools report extreme distress in adolescents and young children, reflecting the tensions being experienced in families where—for the first time for many—there is simply not enough income for new school uniforms, shoes, excursions or school equip-ment, which are needs that accumulate and are accentuated at the beginning of each school year. A cry has gone up from teachers and parents pleading with the Victorian state government for special assistance. Its only response to the crisis in the schools has been to threaten to withdraw teachers, given declining enrolments as families are forced to leave the region due to the drought. Even a call for the state supplied education maintenance allowance to be brought forward for eligible families has fallen on deaf ears.</para><para>The Commonwealth is committed to trying to ameliorate the impacts of extraordinary seasons and circumstances on the longterm viability of otherwise sustainable rural and regional communities—commun-ities that would not otherwise recover from the impacts of eroded assets and escalated debt. The Commonwealth government has been left to tackle this job virtually alone. State governments have walked away, given piecemeal support or implemented policies like fodder or feed transport subsidies, which simply inflate prices and make the problem worse.</para><para>Over $900 million has been earmarked by the Howard government to sustain individual enterprises, both farm and small dependent businesses locked up in drought or blighted by frost or some other unique and not to be planned for event. These assisted individual enterprises can in turn sustain employment and grow the economies and social capital of rural and regional communities. Our government understands how important this is. Given their location in the landscape and their utilisation of the land and water to generate personal income, farming households have an additional responsibility compared with those who are salaried or who live in urban Australia. Farmers must generate their income in such a way that does not degrade the natural resource. Such degradation would have longterm consequences not only for their own livelihood but also for the nation. David Suzuki is fond of reminding us: `In a world where everything is connected, any action has repercussions and so responsibilities accompany every deliberate act.' Rural communities, especially those in Murray, are very alive to the consequences of land management practices and they accept full responsibility for trying to sustain resources on their own land. They cannot do that, however, if their own economic survival is in jeopardy or they are too exhausted or too dispirited to pick up the pieces and try yet again. </para><para>Once again I commend the Commonwealth government on acknowledging the needs of rural and regional Australia—needs which are often the same as those in urban societies: adequate, affordable and accessible health services, transport, telecommunications, housing and educational opportunities, a fair return for a fair day's work and a sense of a future worth pursuing. But smaller regional communities often require different institutional arrangements to operationalise their service delivery. This government has both the heart and the soundly managed economy that will make and is making a difference. I am proud to be part of this government and I commend the bills to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>25479</page.no><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name><name.id>DT4</name.id><electorate>Hotham</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—<inline ref="R1975">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2003-2004</inline>, <inline ref="R1976">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2003-2004</inline> and <inline ref="R1977">Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2003-2004</inline> before the House involve additional spending to the tune of some $957 million this year. That is $957 million additional of taxpayers' money. But what this highlights again is that this is a government that is profligate, a government which has no agenda—because it keeps making these decisions on the run—and a government which runs a non-transparent budget policy. An analysis of the Howard-Costello budgets reveals that the only thing greater than its propensity to spend money is its propensity to tax Australians. Indeed, in the latest mid-year economic and fiscal outlook, spending as a result of government policy decisions rose by a further $5 billion over the forward estimates—$5 billion from when the budget was brought down in May to the MYEFO at the end of last year.</para></talk.start><para>How was this expenditure paid for we may well ask, because the government is often saying to us, `Where does the money come from?' In the government's case it did not come from reordering priorities or cutting waste and mismanagement; it came from raising taxes, because over that same period between the budget and the MYEFO the figures reveal that the Costello tax grab increased by $19 billion—in the same forward estimate period. But this spending spree that we have talked about—the $5 billion to date—has only just begun. It is not only that which is contained in the appropriation bills before us. There is also the `MedicareMinus' package that the government is still trying to get through. What that proposes is spending up from the original $900 million to some $2.4 billion. But even with that additional spending it still cannot save Medicare and restore bulk-billing for all Australians. It will pay for a $5 rebate for concession card holders to lift bulk-billing but not for the whole of Australia. Only Labor will do that. If it is right to lift bulk-billing through that $5 rebate for concession card holders, why not do it for the lot? We have demonstrated that that can be achieved for less than what the government is proposing.</para><para>There is also the $300 million higher education backdown. University fees are still going to go up 25 per cent but, for the minister for education to get his higher education bill through, another $300 million of expenditure is still on the way. Then there were the weekend's announcements: $363 million for Catholic school funding arrangements; the $100 million-plus cost of fixing medical indemnity; and the $225 million which was the government's botched attempt to respond to the Clarke review—that humiliating circumstance in which the Minister for Veterans' Affairs was forced to not proceed with her ministerial statement. We still await with interest what that solution was, but $225 million was committed and it failed to achieve the result. We also await the additional expenditure consequent upon the government's response to the Hogan review of aged care. There is the expected continued bailout of the Job Network. There is the ongoing arrogance of the Prime Minister's overseas trips—the $10,000 a night hotel bills in Rome and other places—and there are the two public houses for the PM at Kirribilli and the Lodge. There is no public housing crisis for our Prime Minister. The list goes on.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>9V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Pyne, Chris, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Pyne</name></talker><para>—That is cheap.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name></talker><para>—It is not cheap. This is costing the Australian taxpayer every time, and the parliamentary secretary at the table says it's cheap. Cheap? It is billions of dollars, and they want to talk about fiscal discipline. The list goes on, and there is only one solution to how the government pays for all of this—higher taxes. Tax and spend is the Howard government legacy. They have rewritten the book. Their first golden rule of fiscal policy is: tax to the hilt and then spend the people's money. Their second golden rule is: spend the surplus as a tactic against political opponents. It is hard to imagine an approach that could display more contempt for Australian families or more disregard for Australia's economic future.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Of course, budget honesty has been the great casualty. The budget papers are so turgid that they are almost indecipherable. Decisions are masked through accounting tricks and sophistry. Indeed, in the bills before the House, two new clauses have been added which increase the power of the minister for finance to make decisions with relevant ministers on any line item of the budget. But in true style there is no provision to have these decisions disclosed. To make these provisions worthwhile and to improve the integrity of the budget process, what is needed is a system of continuous budget disclosure—something this government refuse to do, yet they talk about the Charter of Budget Honesty.</para><para>The cost of the misplaced value system of the Howard government is borne by Australian families. Our families have never been under greater financial stress than they are now. They face record taxes, they have never been more in debt and, as interest rates are forced up because the Treasurer has fuelled a housing bubble, it will be Australian families that are hit again. First, there are higher taxes, then increased charges for basic services and now higher interest rates. And what is the solution that is offered to these people by the Treasurer? Work till you drop and get paid less for the work that you do, while the government makes it easier for people to be sacked from their job. That is the extent of the future offered by this government. We do not see any agenda to boost productivity, any agenda to invest in our people, any agenda to invest in our communities and our infrastructure or any agenda to reduce the stresses, financial and otherwise, on our working families.</para><para>We know that this is the highest taxing government in Australia's history. We have seen new tax after new tax on airline tickets, sugar and milk—all new slugs on Australian families. Then there is the mother of all taxes, the GST. This is a Treasurer who has never seen a tax he has not fallen in love with, but the GST is a tax he does not want to even own. I mentioned earlier that to see the propensity of this government to tax Australians you need only observe their behaviour in the last six months of last year. Between the budget last year and the mid-year economic forecasts, estimated tax revenues over the forward estimates went up by $19 billion. The Treasurer boasts that he has reduced debt. That is easy if you sell the nation's assets. Of course you can pay off the mortgage if you sell the house. But debt reduction on the back of privatising Telstra has not been good policy in the past and it is not good policy now.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>9V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Pyne, Chris, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Pyne</name></talker><para>—Where did the Commonwealth Bank go?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name></talker><para>—The member for Sturt, the prattler, is never able to make a contribution in the House except to prattle at the table.

Never before have Australians faced higher levels of household debt. Now the government says it wants to debate fiscal strategy. At this stage of the economic cycle, we should be seeing significant budget surpluses over the forward estimates. Instead, what we see is an exorbitant budget spending spree. At every election, this government spends up big—very big.</para><para>Our shadow Assistant Treasurer, David Cox, has done some interesting analysis on this. In the election year 1998, the net spend by this government was $20.7 billion. In the election year 2001, there was a net spend of $25.6 billion. In 2003, while fuelling speculation of an early election, we saw a net spend of $23.2 billion—it is fiscal deterioration at its worst. There is still no agenda—just a government making policy on the run and prepared to buy votes at any cost.</para><para>Let us look at what the government does in non-election years. In non-election years the average spending of the Howard government is around $125 million—not the $20.7 billion as in 1998, or the $25.6 billion into 2001 or the $23.2 billion in 2003. The Howard government's fiscal strategy is well known: build up the war chest and spend it all at election time. Herein lie the two golden rules I outlined earlier as the government's approach to fiscal policy.</para><para>Labor, of course, have a different approach to fiscal policy, because we take it seriously. Labor's policies are, and will be, fully costed and funded. We will ease the tax burden on Australian families, with our highest priorities being relief for lower- and middle-income families. These families are struggling under the pressure of high effective marginal tax rates. If the Treasurer is concerned with work force participation, he will target this group for tax relief too. Labor will cut the Howard government's waste and mismanagement. We will redirect funding towards Labor's priorities on education and health. To date we have identified savings in the Howard-Costello budget of over $5 billion—by reordering priorities, cutting waste and exercising the choices a budget gives to invest in people. We have shown that we can make education more accessible and affordable, we can save Medicare, we can save the Murray River and we can do it by a reordering of priorities. Indeed, we have even embarrassed the Treasurer into acknowledging some of his wrong priorities and into accepting Labor's savings. It underscores our claim that budgets are about priorities. This is a government that has made the wrong choices. </para><para>The government says that we need a long-term strategy to deal with the ageing population. The Treasurer's solution, and we saw him out there last week, is to repeat the old ideas—forcing Australian families to pay more for education and health care, cutting disability benefits and making older people work till they drop. He will push these old ideas and he will call it reform. What he will not do is offer new ideas about how to provide for the future.</para><para>An important part of providing for the future must be to increase national savings. The government's approach to one element of national savings, the budget surplus, is to spend it—no assistance there. But another important mechanism for national savings is the system of superannuation—the system introduced in this country by a Labor government. </para><para>The Treasurer has made some minor changes on superannuation in the past week. They are changes that are welcome as far as they go. But you are left asking yourself, `After more than eight years in government, is that all the government has to say?' We heard the Treasurer say after a budget four years ago that his next big challenge was superannuation. The <inline font-style="italic">Intergenerational Report</inline> was released two years ago, and all he did was re-release it the other day. As many commentators have said, there is a huge gap between the scale of the challenge and the Treasurer's policy response. Ross Gittens summed it up best of all when he said:</para><quote><para>If what Peter Costello announced yesterday is the answer, it must have been a pretty small question.</para></quote><para>Given the hype, Australian superannuation fund members will be disappointed by the lack of tax relief in the government's package. The Treasurer's announcements are worth $5 million per annum, but they have to be seen in the context of the government's $5 billion annual tax take from superannuation. The government have also failed to respond to Labor's plans to make superannuation simpler and safer. They have done nothing to address the crippling fees and charges that are eating away at the retirement incomes of Australian families. </para><para>Labor has shown how, with the right priorities, you can do more on superannuation. When the government announced a superannuation tax cut that benefited just four per cent of income earners, Labor proposed an alternative that would have delivered a superannuation contribution tax cut to everyone in the work force—a tax cut from 15 per cent to 13 per cent. The government chose to look after only the very top income earners. Labor's choice is to distribute that fairly, back to the whole of the work force. Under our alternative, adequacy could have been improved for the many, not just a few. But the government rejected Labor's approach and spent the money on the top four per cent of income earners.</para><para>The Treasurer's statement highlighted some important issues confronting us in terms of the ageing population. These issues are well known to Labor; we have been highlighting them for seven years now. The Secretary of the Treasury, Dr Ken Henry, says that the three most significant economic issues facing the nation are population, productivity and participation. Yet we still have a Treasurer who refuses to invest in the drivers of productivity and growth: infrastructure, education and research. There is a famous saying of the Treasurer's: `demography is destiny'. If that is the case, why don't we have a population policy, Treasurer. It is a slogan; it is not a solution—and it typifies this government's approach. Also, for some inexplicable reason, the Treasurer refutes the evidence of demographers when they say that family friendly policies can improve both incentives and fertility rates.</para><para>With his newfound concern for mature age Australians, the Treasurer forgets that his budgets made the largest cuts to support for mature age job seekers this country has ever seen and abolished incentives for employers to take on older, long-term unemployed job seekers. The Treasurer has also imposed on older job seekers an impersonal privatised system of job seeker support—a system now in a shambles. And of course who could forget the Treasurer's last big idea—that mature age Australians should just get out there and mow our lawns?</para><para>It takes more than just an update of the <inline font-style="italic">Intergenerational Report</inline> or a slogan about demography to address the policy challenges that we face. The solution lies in an agenda to lift the growth potential of the economy by investing in the drivers of economic growth, to lift participation by rewarding effort and removing disincentives to hard work, and to address the incentives to provide dignity in retirement. This Treasurer is trying to convince people that he has an agenda for Australia's future. Over this year we will see a debate about the future economic and fiscal direction of our nation. From the government we will hear the same tired old ideas, but from Labor you will hear about new solutions—solutions that will produce a better future for the people of Australia and solutions that are consistent with the Australian ethos of opportunity for all. The next election will be about a challenge: our ideas versus the government's staleness. I look forward to that challenge and to meeting it and putting forward, through the new leadership of the Labor Party, the very ideas that will advance the interests of all Australians, not just the privileged few.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>25483</page.no><name role="metadata">Moylan, Judi, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs MOYLAN</name><name.id>4V5</name.id><electorate>Pearce</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I welcome the opportunity to speak on <inline ref="R1975">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2003-2004</inline>, <inline ref="R1976">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2003-2004</inline> and <inline ref="R1977">Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2003-2004</inline>, because the responsibility of government to balance the national budget—and the member for Hotham has this right—is pivotal to the quality of life for individuals and for the successful operation of the nation's businesses and, indeed, the government itself. It is the small business community that I often get up here and speak about that stands to lose in a major way if the federal budget is not adequately managed—as we saw during Labor's 13 years in government. We saw their knee-jerk reactions, unfettered spending in some areas and unseemly haste in bringing in certain economic reforms. All of this contributed to some disastrous years for small business in particular.</para></talk.start><para>I noted the member for Hotham's comments about his view on wasted expenditure. But no-one can forget the tremendous waste under the Labor government—a government that allowed young people to leave school and leave the family home and go on social security. So many millions of dollars were squandered. But it was not the dollars squandered that was the big concern; it was the policy that encouraged young people to leave school, to leave education, to leave job training, to leave the family home and to go on social security benefits. No funding could have been squandered more and no policy could have done more harm than that particular policy of the then Labor government.</para><para>Going back to the small business issue, it is very easy to forget what the economy was like during Labor's 13-year period. It was marked by unacceptably high unemployment rates; troughs and peaks, making it impossible for businesses to plan with any certainty; high interest rates and burgeoning inflation. I recall with great clarity the pleas of farmers, small businesses, mums and dads whose kids could not get jobs and the mums and dads who could not get jobs during that time. They pleaded with the coalition to change things when they got into government—to even out the highs and lows; to ensure a reduction in unemployment; and to reduce the excessively high interest rates and high inflation rates that were rapidly eating up any gains they were making. They wanted a government that would manage the finances—and that is what they got. That is what the Howard government delivers. Rather than being tired, the Howard government continues to deliver and continues to come forward with fresh programs and policies which will make a very big difference to the lives of many people in our community.</para><para>Since coming to government in 1996, the Howard-led government has evened out the economic highs and lows, reduced interest rates, reduced inflation and, importantly, reduced unemployment rates to below six per cent. In an assessment at the end of October last year, the International Monetary Fund assessed the Australian economy as continuing to perform remarkably well over the year. This was despite a weak world economic environment, despite the worst drought we had seen in this country in a hundred years and despite the SARS epidemic, which hit the travel and tourism sectors very hard indeed.</para><para>Despite a small rise in interest rates last year, home loan rates are still below the average over the last six years. Based on an average new mortgage, families with home loans are currently paying $585 per month less than they did in 1996 under the Labor government. As the Prime Minister said, the Australian public will never forget the 17 per cent interest rates that we had under the Australian Labor Party. </para><para>Under the economic management of the Howard government, for the first time in 21 years unemployment in non-metropolitan areas of Australia fell below six per cent. Those areas included my electorate, a large part of which is rural. Again, despite the worst drought in 100 years, unemployment in country areas fell below six per cent, almost 75 per cent of non-metropolitan Australia recorded a drop in unemployment, and across the country the number of people in work increased by 70,000. This does not happen with poor management; it happens with good economic management.</para><para>When Sensis released its business index for small and medium enterprises late last year, it revealed that perceptions of the Australian economy are at their highest level since the business index commenced. The index revealed that the confidence of small and medium businesses continued to increase, taking it to the highest level since August 1994. Again, these indicators do not come about because of poor targeting of money raised by the government through the tax system; they come about through sound economic management and the application of some sound principles. These figures were supported by an ACCI report that revealed that small businesses reported an improved outlook for sales, revenue, profitability, investment and job creation.</para><para>The steady management of the economy by the Howard government is particularly important to people living in the Pearce electorate, because they have been the beneficiaries of the savings that have been made by the poor targeting of spending under Labor. The rank and file out there in the community welcome measures to improve the safety of roads, such as the $1 million allocated to safety measures and a passing lane on the Clackline bridge in my electorate. It is a particularly nasty area. That will be met. Mums and dads benefited from the new home child-care places in Western Australia that the federal minister made available. Twenty-five new home places were made available to Narrogin, in my electorate, in the Upper Great Southern region of Western Australia. These are the kinds of measures that we have been able to put into place, because we have had sound economic management and we have been able to give back.</para><para>That is why the Howard government has also been able to take a practical, commonsense approach to protecting and repairing the environment. My electorate has been the beneficiary of some of the $2.7 billion that has been allocated to the National Heritage Trust—the largest and most successful environmental restoration project in Australia's history—since 1996. People in many electorates throughout Australia have benefited from that. In addition, we established the Green Corps project, which has given 5,500 young people the opportunity to receive training to participate in projects addressing significant environmental issues, giving them a lifelong appreciation of the importance of the environment and providing them with training and skills that they will have for a lifetime. The Green Corps program has been enormously important, as has the Green Reserve program, an initiative of the Commonwealth government under the Work for the Dole program. These are the kinds of areas that this government has been able to target, with programs that help local people. The government has also created programs in rural areas which give additional money to assist with the delivery of health services.</para><para>My electorate is the third-largest, in geographical terms, in Western Australia. It covers an area of 26,000 square kilometres or thereabouts. It has a diverse range of interests, from broadacre wheat and sheep farming to intensive agriculture, including fruit, wine, olives, milk products and fishing, just to name a few. There is a mix of rural areas and some very significant outer metropolitan urban cells—new areas which are growing very rapidly. For those areas, many of the programs that the government has been able to put into place, because of savings made in other areas, have been immensely important.</para><para>Infrastructure in an electorate like Pearce is absolutely essential. We have the crossroads of the major highway from the eastern states to Perth and we also have the north-west mining and pastoral region road to Perth. These two transport routes are vital to farming, industry and tourism, and to local people who rely on fast, efficient and safe transport to major centres, the wharf and the airport. The federal government has recognised the importance of these roads and has allocated funding to improve their efficiency and safety. As a result of a public rally, the minister for transport allocated $14 million recently to improve a dangerous section of the Great Northern Highway, the main road to the northern pastoral and mining areas. That is very welcome.</para><para>We have a long way to go, of course. We need some major works done and another $80 million or so spent on that road, which now carries some very large double and triple load trucks. The road was never designed to carry that kind of transport. At least the federal government is taking responsibility and allocating money. After receiving many representations from local government about the condition of local roads, which are a state government responsibility, the federal government has again agreed to continue the funding of the Roads to Recovery program. This was particularly welcome in the Pearce electorate because it responded to local representation about the woeful condition of local roads neglected by the state government.</para><para>In Western Australia, many local road projects have been shelved as the Gallop Labor government have poured all their money into the rail to Mandurah. Indian Ocean Drive is an important link from the coast to the major north-west highway, but they have shelved the project on that road—they have mothballed it—because all of the money is going on the rail to the south. I am not against rail; I think it is a very good plan, but I think it is premature, given the state of roads in the eastern and northern corridors. It is premature to put a rail down south when there is a perfectly good freeway, and buses that run quite often with few passengers on board, while our eastern and northern corridors and roads such as the Indian Ocean Drive get mothballed. Indian Ocean Drive was a particularly important road to the locals. It is important from an industry point of view but it is important also to continue the fast-growing tourism in the region. After discussion with our Ian Campbell, who is now Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads, we are hopeful that we might be able to reignite state government interest in coming good with their earlier promise to construct this road.</para><para>There continue to be challenges in my electorate to ensure that major highways are safe and efficient, and I will certainly continue to work very closely with the community of Pearce to do my best at a federal level. What we need is a commitment by the state government to ensure that priority is given to work in the eastern region. Too often they come with the excuse that they need money from the federal government. The federal government hands them a bucket of money but quite often the state puts its priorities somewhere else. We need that commitment from the state Labor government.</para><para>In fact, the state Labor government has shown little interest in infrastructure in the eastern corridor—an area that produces much of the agricultural wealth of the state and, indeed, of the nation. Roads are but one of the casualties of state Labor's budget priorities. Power, particularly to the country, has also been neglected. Indeed, in the city we saw recent 40-degree heat and power failures. I must say that I was impressed that it so quickly made changes at the head of the power supplier, but the fact is the government has ignored the issue of power for too long. Recently I had calls from York in my electorate to say that a number of ageing power poles had been knocked over in a storm. They were propped up only by a tree, and there were sparks flying. This is in conditions where the grass and other growth is tinder dry, which puts the area at high risk of fire. We saw recent tragic deaths in the southern area of Western Australia from fire caused by faulty power lines or poles, and it is high time that the state government got its priorities right in its budgets and attended to these concerns in the rural areas of Western Australia.</para><para>Lack of adequate power inhibits the development of regional areas and thus hampers local efforts to continue to provide local jobs for people. The federal government has gone to a lot of trouble to establish area consultative committees to put money into the development of the regions, and then we find that they are hampered. If we take Avon Industrial Park, which we have tried to get up and running—the federal government has allocated money to try and assist that project on more than one occasion—we find that major industry, which wants to establish businesses there, is inhibited by the lack of an adequate power supply. The power supply in Western Australia's rural areas was designed probably in the fifties and little has been done to really address the matter of adequacy of power in these regions. It is hampering development.</para><para>One of the most important areas of federal funding for families is the education and training opportunities for their children and for school leavers going into the job market. I am very pleased that apprenticeships under the Howard government have more than doubled compared to the last year of Labor's incumbency, from 520 in 1995 to 1,070 in 2003. This is a very important issue for not only the apprenticeship system but also other training means and scholarships for professions, because we have a shortage in many skilled and professional areas. Spending on new apprenticeship incentives has continued to increase in Pearce, from $1.7 million to $2.246 million over a relatively short period of time. Given the continuing shortage of tradespeople, the need to continue to provide job opportunities to young people and ensure appropriate levels of skilled people becomes critical.</para><para>On the issue of schooling, the Australian Education Union has launched against the government a campaign which is deliberately misleading in its portrayal of school funding. It is important to clarify the facts around the important area of funding, which is one of great concern for parents. Schools are funded by both state and federal governments. Under the Australian Constitution, state and territory governments have primary responsibility for funding state schools. They own them, manage them and provide 88 per cent of their public funding. While the Australian government is the primary source of funding for Catholic and independent schools, it is also a significant contributor to state government schools. Australian government funding has risen by an estimated 60 per cent since 1996, when the Howard government came to office.</para><para>Overall, state schools continue to receive considerably more public funding than Catholic and independent schools. There are 2.25 million students in state schools receiving $19.9 billion in public funding and there are just over one million students in Catholic and independent schools receiving a total of $6.2 billion in public funding. In other words, state government schools enrol 68 per cent of students and receive 76 per cent of total public funding for schools while Catholic and independent schools enrol 32 per cent of students and receive 24 per cent of total public funding.</para><para>I think it is really important to keep the record on whose responsibility is whose. It is very easy—for our state government, anyway—to pass the buck in that respect, and I have worked very hard to get, for example, library facilities for a little state school in my electorate where the buildings have been there for 100 years. I must say again that it is because of this deficit in the eastern region by the state Labor government. It seems very difficult for them to find funds to put into schools in my region—although I am pleased to hear that the state minister, after much pushing and prodding, is now considering establishing, finally, some kind of specialist music school in the eastern region. We have two of them in the western suburbs and nothing in the eastern sector, where we have some very talented students.</para><para>The federal government also has the great responsibility of funding Medicare, and is doing so through the MedicarePlus package, worth $2.4 billion. This would not have been possible if the government were mismanaging the economy—if it did not manage the economy very carefully. It does have a big responsibility in these areas. I think the Howard government will stand on its record. The people out there know that there are many benefits in the proper economic management of the national budget. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>25487</page.no><name role="metadata">Snowdon, Warren, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SNOWDON</name><name.id>IJ4</name.id><electorate>Lingiari</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am pleased to have the opportunity to participate in this debate on <inline ref="R1975">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2003-2004</inline>, <inline ref="R1976">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2003-2004</inline> and <inline ref="R1977">Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2003-2004</inline>. The purpose of my contribution this evening is to discuss a number of issues relating to Indigenous policy in Australia. I want to concentrate my remarks on one community and, using that community as an example, demonstrate the fatuous nature of remarks which have been made recently by a number of people, not the least of whom is Keith Windschuttle, who had an opinion piece in today's <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>, headed `Assimilation already a reality'.</para></talk.start><para>The community that I want to refer to is an Aboriginal town, Wadeye, which lies about 420 kilometres south-west of Darwin. I refer to this place for a particular reason: it is the largest Indigenous community in the Northern Territory. It is an interesting place for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that it is the site of a COAG trial, one of the community coordination pilots. This trial is a partnership between the Thamarrurr Regional Council, which is the local governing body of Wadeye; the Northern Territory government; and the federal government. </para><para>As part of that trial, work was done to establish some baseline information on the community. The report, by John Taylor, was released only last week and is entitled <inline font-style="italic">Baseline profiles for social and economic development planning in the Thamarrurr region—a report to the Thamarrurr Regional Council and the Northern Territory Office of Indigenous Policy, Wadeye and Darwin,</inline> December 2003. John works for the Centre for Aboriginal Economic Policy Research at the Australian National University. The reason I mention this document is that it will now go forward, as part of this COAG process, to be deliberated upon by the territory and federal governments, as well as the Thumarrurr Regional Council. The information it contains is quite significant in the context of towns in the bush because it is symptomatic of what is happening across northern Australia, and certainly in the Northern Territory, to Aboriginal communities.</para><para>According to this document, Wadeye has a total service population of 2,373, of which 45.7 per cent are under the age of 15. Significantly—and this is an issue I will not have the opportunity to discuss in a great deal of detail this evening—women predominate at ages above 29. It does not take too long to conclude that this is because of a number of factors, not the least of which is the mortality rate for Aboriginal men. What is significant about this population is that John Taylor's work projects that it will increase by 88 per cent in 20 years, by 2023, to a population of 4,045. If that were its population now, on current figures that would make it probably the third, fourth or maybe the fifth largest town in the Northern Territory.</para><para>This is significant because it means the population is growing at the rate of four per cent per annum. You would know, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, as a keen student of this sort of data, that that is more than twice—almost three times—the annual population growth rate of Australia generally. What we are seeing here is a population boom, and that creates a number of interesting dilemmas for those who provide services to that population. It also goes to the need to develop an argument for far greater government outlays for the purposes of providing infrastructure and services to these communities. I will come in a moment to one startling statistic showing the immediate need for housing in this particular community.</para><para>But before I do I want to go to this article by Windschuttle. The House would know that Dr Windschuttle made a contribution to a conference in Perth last week in which he said `remote Aboriginal communities are a failure', that they should be closed and that Aborigines should be moved to cities and towns. I am not sure what he regards as remote or whether he would regard Wadeye as a town. What I am certain of is that he has absolutely no comprehension of these issues as they relate to Northern Australia, or any real appreciation of the history that surrounds these communities in Northern Australia and particularly—in this case—in the Northern Territory. I would suggest to him—just so he gets his head around a few things—that he go to source material which has been made available to respective Aboriginal land commissioners in the form of claim books. These claim books document local and regional histories in relation to Northern Australia. They tell us the very sorry state of public policy over the decades of the last century—particularly, I might say, the decades when assimilation and integration were the hallmarks of government policy.</para><para>I noticed last week that he was seeking to protect the good name of the Chief Protector of Aborigines in the 1930s in Western Australia, A.O. Neville. I suggest, judging by what he has written and what we have seen in the press today from Dr Windschuttle, that he would have been at home in the 1930s, because clearly he has yet to come to terms with the fact that Indigenous Australians have the capacity to make decisions on their own for their own communities. Whilst it is true that for many of these communities there are real difficulties in terms of substance abuse, if we look at the data we will see that levels of alcohol consumption among Indigenous Australians, certainly in the Northern Territory, are lower than levels of alcohol consumption among non-Indigenous Australians. But it is true that in some communities there is very demonstrable evidence of social dysfunction.</para><para>But what Windschuttle tries to tell us is that this is all because of the policies of self-determination. He says as much in this document today—this opinion piece in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>. He talks about the need for paradigm shifts. Well I have got news for him. I have been working in this region now for a quarter of a century. I have spent a lot of time talking to Aboriginal people in their home communities. He might tell us, as he has done in this newspaper article, that these Aboriginal people should be dealt with differently than they are at the moment—he refers to Hasluck in the sixties—and say that we should not be providing special resources for Indigenous people to live in their home communities but, frankly, I think that is a bit pass. It is about time he understood that we live in a new century—one in which Indigenous Australians have rights and one in which we have responsibilities in terms of affording those rights some special recognition.</para><para>One of the rights they have is to be afforded some measure of justice. Whether or not Keith Windschuttle agrees is irrelevant, frankly, but I imagine, Mr Deputy Speaker, that he would be one of those who would say that the stolen generation was a figment of my and your imagination; that those people in the Northern Territory who, as a result of government policy, were taken away from their families were being done a good service by the community and that the issue of an apology should be something that we should forget about. I have to say that is not the view that I hold. Certainly it is not the view of Aboriginal people in my electorate.</para><para>Windschuttle makes the point in this article today that 70 per cent of Aboriginal people now live in the cities and larger country towns. Let me tell him that in the case of the Northern Territory 72 per cent of the Indigenous population live on Aboriginal land in their home communities. They live in communities like Wadeye; communities that are growing and vibrant; communities that have, however, been neglected by successive governments of both political persuasions over the decades to the point—and this is the value of this work that has been done in recent weeks—where there is a housing shortfall. The average house occupancy in Wadeye is around 17—that is a three bedroom house. In some houses, it is as high as 20; in others I know of it is certainly higher. Can anyone imagine 17 people living in a small housing commission three bedroom house? Where do these people live? Where do they have their beds? In the corridors? Outside the lavatory? Behind the kitchen benches? Those critics—Windschuttle and others—would say, `That's their choice.' The fact of the matter is that if governments were to provide resources so that housing in these communities was sufficient to allocate, say, seven residents to every three bedroom house, they would need to provide for the current shortfall of 207 extra homes. By 2023, if it is not addressed now, that figure will be 465 extra homes.</para><para>There are many problems in many of these communities, but I stress that it is not the communities' fault that the resources have not been provided for infrastructure such as housing. Despite whatever Windschuttle might like to think, if these 2,373 people were to migrate immediately to Darwin, where would they live? Who would provide the resources and the public housing? Of course, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, you and I both know. The issue here is that we have a vibrant community which is growing, unlike many rural communities in other parts of Australia, and this is true of other Aboriginal communities in my electorate. We also know that in this community, like others, there have been dreadfully poor educational outcomes. What have these been the result of? You could look at housing for a start. Nutrition is an issue, school attendance is an issue and the availability of school is an issue. </para><para>The fact is that, like many other communities in the Northern Territory, this community has been neglected in terms of the provision of this sort of infrastructure. There is no high school to speak of at Wadeye, and the school attendance rates are abysmal. According to John Taylor's report, only a third of secondary school-aged children are enrolled, only 18 per cent are attending school, and only 13 per cent of 12-year-olds are attending school. I would ask you to think about that, because 16 per cent have never attended school. Think about it. Then think about the abuse that is heaped on these communities by people like Windschuttle and others, who think they know what is good for the world, and think about the blame that is foisted upon these communities because people cannot get mainstream employment opportunities because they cannot achieve at university. These educational attainment levels are an issue to do with the way in which the community sees education. But, contrary to what Windschuttle might like to think and contrary to what he expresses in his article, they are primarily related to the willingness of successive governments to provide the resources to make sure that these educational services can be properly provided.</para><para>It is true that, at Wadeye, Maningrida, Galiwinku, Yuendumu and many other places across my electorate, successive governments—and I might say successive conservative governments; 27 years of CLP governments—since self-government in 1978 have absolutely neglected these communities. Now we are left with a problem. Instead of providing essential infrastructure, as they should have done, they deliberately chose not to. Now we have the likes of Windschuttle saying that, because these communities have problems, the whole issue of self-determination has been a failure. I have a rough appreciation of what `self-determination' means, and it is worth recalling that a committee of this House gave us a working definition of `self-determination' in a unanimous report titled <inline font-style="italic">A chance for the future</inline>, which was published in 1989. It described `self-determination' as `Aboriginal people having the authority, resources and capacity to control the future of their own communities within the legal structure common to all Australians'. I think that is a reasonable proposition.</para><para>I can tell you that Aboriginal people in my electorate and those in communities such as Wadeye and Thamarrurr are an expression of self-determination—the ability to make their own decisions—because they have redefined what their local government structure should look like so that it reflects traditional decision-making practices. There is a unique opportunity here, and it has happened because this community took control of itself and took control of these questions. Now it is working within its COAG framework to try to find solutions to some of these problems. </para><para>The resolution of these problems is not helped by the idiocy of people like Windschuttle and the bigotry that they reflect in what they assert. What we have to do is work with communities. We have to work with Aboriginal leaders across Australia to overcome these problems—and there are problems—but we are not going to do it by kicking people in the guts. We are not going to resolve these problems by smacking people around the ears. We are going to resolve these problems by recognising that Indigenous Australians have rights. Then we need to sit down and talk to them as equals and work out the parameters under which they can be funded, by negotiating and working out outcomes which are commonly accepted. We should not, as Windschuttle would have it, close these communities down and relocate their populations to major urban centres.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>25491</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

In particular, I would like to thank Trevor Davies, who did the bulk of the organising, and a number of the residents of the Block who have been there many years—especially Aunty Joyce but also Uncle Dick, Lyal Munro and a number of others who came to that meeting. The purpose of the meeting was to keep dialogue open between ALP representatives at various levels of government and the Aboriginal community in Redfern. </para></talk.start><para>The House would be aware that slightly over two weeks ago there was a very tragic death of a young man in Redfern—Thomas Hickey, or T.J. Hickey, as he was known. The death of any young person is a terrible tragedy, and there are many people in Redfern who are still very much affected and will be mourning for a long time. If there is anything positive to come of this young man's death, perhaps it is that there is a renewed focus at the moment on the terrible disadvantage suffered by many Aboriginal people in this country, as the member for Lingiari was just explaining, and by many residents of Redfern in particular.</para><para>Redfern is an area where there has been a long history of disadvantage, not only but most particularly in the Indigenous community. As a community, it suffers the scars of dispossession and racism. The picture is not completely grim though. The meeting that we had on Sunday was a very positive meeting, and it was in part an opportunity to hear from many of the people who are involved in community efforts in Redfern for individuals to improve their own lives and the situations of their families and for their community to be a stronger, better community.</para><para>There was a young man at the meeting, who was also called T.J., who had been employed by the Premier's Department to work specifically with kids on the Block. The sort of work he has been doing—and he is going to stop doing it shortly, unfortunately, because he has resigned—made the most enormous difference to the lives of young people. He made sure that kids got to school and that they had a positive environment to do their homework in. These sorts of things are absolutely vital.</para><para>What gets covered in newspapers is not the positive efforts that people like T.J. are making but kids throwing rocks. While there is never any excuse for that sort of violence, it saddens me that the amount of media attention that is given to kids throwing rocks is so many times greater than the attention given to the much bigger, sadder story of over 200 years of racism and dispossession in this country. We live in a modern country where Aboriginal life expectancy is still 20 years less than the national average and imprisonment rates are 15 times higher than the national average. I think that is a disgrace in a modern nation like Australia.</para><para>We need to see construction start straightaway on Aboriginal housing on the Block. The state government has committed many millions of dollars to this. It will certainly cost over $20 million. So far the Commonwealth government has refused even to discuss this with the state government and the Aboriginal housing corporation. We need to make sure that the people building that housing employ Aboriginal apprentices, Aboriginal builders and Aboriginal architects.</para><para>There is so much that is being done currently by people of goodwill, but there is so much more than can be done in the area. I think that our whole community has to be engaged in this battle against poverty, racism, disadvantage, unemployment and abusive drug pushers. It heartens me that there are so many local people who are fighting this fight. I am heartened also by the support I see in the wider community for tackling the disadvantage faced by the Aboriginal residents of Redfern.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Emergency Call Services</title><page.no>25492</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>25492</page.no><name role="metadata">Lloyd, Jim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LLOYD</name><name.id>IK6</name.id><electorate>Robertson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to take the opportunity to highlight the importance of the emergency 000 service in Australia and to bring forward some suggestions which I hope will make this service even better than it is today. The 000 service is, of course, the emergency service which most people know. They know that if they dial that number they can be connected immediately with an emergency service—the police, ambulance or fire service. The Australian Communications Authority is responsible for monitoring the provision of the emergency call services under part 8 of the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999, the Telecommunications (Emergency Call Service) Determination 2002 and the Telecommunications (Emergency Call Persons) Determination 1999—so it is a well-regulated area. The emergency call service is an operator assisted service that connects a caller, free of charge, to the police, fire or ambulance service in a life-threatening or time critical situation.</para></talk.start><para>Under the specifications of the Telecommunications Numbering Plan, the primary emergency service number is 000 and can be accessed from a fixed or mobile network anywhere in Australia where there is coverage. There are secondary emergency service numbers of 112 and 106, which most people would not be aware of. The 000 service is provided by Telstra, as the designated universal service provider. They currently operate the 000 emergency call service from two centralised emergency call centres in Darling Park, New South Wales and Windsor, Victoria. Telstra's role in operating the 000 service is to connect callers to the nearest and most appropriate emergency service organisation as quickly as possible. The local emergency service organisation—police, fire or ambulance—is then responsible for sending help to the correct location.</para><para>Callers can be connected to the police, fire or ambulance service simply by dialling 000 from any fixed or mobile phone, wherever there is coverage. However, as the location of callers using mobile phones cannot be identified automatically, mobile phone callers need to give as much information as possible about their location when speaking to the operator. As 000 is Australia's primary emergency service number, it should always be used to access emergency assistance in the first instance. I understand that the 000 service has recently instigated a brief four-second recorded message when people dial 000 to ensure that it is, in fact, a genuine emergency. This is very important, and it is important that all people understand whether they should be dialling 000.</para><para>With globalisation and cable television the world is a much smaller place. Young children are subjected to information that comes from all over the world and watch a great deal of American television. Some members on the other side of the House, with their anti-American stance, may not think that is such a good idea, but the fact remains that children watch a lot of American television.</para><para>In America the emergency services number is 911. When watching American television in our lounge rooms we often hear that in an emergency you dial 911. If you dial 911 in Australia, nothing happens—you get a dead line. It would be very simple for Telstra to automatically divert 911 to 000. You can divert any house number or any mobile number in Australia to virtually any number you wish, but if you ring 911, you get absolutely nothing.</para><para>I call on Telstra and on the government to immediately instigate a diversion service so that if a young child or anyone else rings 911 the call is automatically and immediately diverted to the 000 service. It is simple and would cost nothing—it may, in fact, save a life. I hope that this can be instituted very quickly so that, if someone rings 911, the call is automatically diverted to 000. It may save a life.

I state clearly that, in my opinion, the statement last week by the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads, Senator Campbell, that the government will change federal-state road funding arrangements under AusLink is nothing short of a shameless exercise in cost shifting and responsibility shifting. </para></talk.start><para>When the minister told the national roads summit that the Australian government should not be expected to pay for the maintenance and construction of national highways, he confirmed that politics, not policy, is the new mantra of the Howard government. This means, in everyday terms, that the Howard government intends to cherry-pick national highway projects for political purposes and simply leave the rest of the network to fall through the cracks for local and state governments to pick up. This is nothing short of a national disgrace and is buck-passing at its best. It confirms that the Howard government is interested only in the high profile projects where political gain is the desired outcome, that it has no interest in the economic development of Australia and that it has no interest in making our national highway system safer for all those who use it.</para><para>In every state and territory of Australia there are road construction projects and upgrades. If these improvements actually happen, they will significantly increase the benefits to our freight industry and help make our roads safer. Take, as just one example, the key freight corridor down the eastern seaboard of Australia linking Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne. The freight task is set to increase substantially over the coming decades, yet the eastern seaboard corridor is not linked by a highway that will cope with this increase. The Hume Highway is a key part of that national road freight corridor on the east coast, yet, unfortunately, it remains a single lane highway from Albury through to Tarcutta, and the Pacific Highway upgrade to a four-lane highway is only one-third complete. The Hume Highway is a key part of the national highway network and Australia's freight network, yet the Minister for Transport and Regional Services now says that the upgrade is not his job—that it is no longer a Commonwealth government responsibility under AusLink. An NRMA audit of the Hume Highway estimates that road crashes would decrease by 80 per cent if the highway were a full dual carriageway. Yet the minister for transport and the Howard government are walking away from making our roads safer and from boosting freight efficiency by saying, `It's not our job and it's not our responsibility.'</para><para>I can assure the House that the Labor Party is rock solid in its commitment that responsibility for the national highway lies 100 per cent with the Commonwealth. This is not a political game; this is about the government accepting its national responsibilities for freight movement in Australia. We will not be party to political game playing at the expense of the national interest. The Howard government's announcement last week by the minister for roads, Senator Campbell, is all about politics and buck passing. The minister for transport and the minister for roads should have the guts to come clean now on what they will and will not fund. The ministers must spell out which sections of the national highway system they are walking away from. Is it the outstanding upgrade of the Hume Highway from Albury to Tarcutta, at a cost of approximately $1.5 billion? Is it the outstanding commitment to upgrade the Ipswich Motorway that is so important to Queensland? Is it the outstanding commitment on the Deer Park bypass in Victoria? Or is it the outstanding commitment to an overtaking lane for the Sturt Highway in South Australia?</para><para>These are all programs of national significance. They are about the movement of freight and the economic challenge that confronts Australia. The NRMA is now stating that, more than ever, it is about reducing our health expenditure, about reducing the number of serious injuries and fatalities that occur on our roads around Australia, and especially on the national highways, because we have walked away from our responsibilities. The national highways are the responsibility of the Commonwealth. It is our task and our responsibility. The government should stop political buck-passing on road and rail infrastructure in Australia, accept its responsibility and stop cherry-picking highway projects for political purposes. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline><inline font-style="italic"></inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Roads: Tugun Bypass</title><page.no>25494</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>25494</page.no><name role="metadata">May, Margaret, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs MAY</name><name.id>83B</name.id><electorate>McPherson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is ironical that tonight the member for Batman is talking about a Commonwealth highway and a Commonwealth responsibility. Tonight I want to talk about a state responsibility, when it comes to a road in my electorate. On several occasions I have spoken in this House about the Tugun bypass. This is a very important piece of road infrastructure in my electorate, linking Queensland and New South Wales, that we thought had the green light but that is no longer the case.</para></talk.start><para>Last Saturday I convened a public meeting in my electorate to discuss with the residents of Tugun a new plan that was put on the table. More than 600 residents turned up for this public meeting. It was a chance for us to put on the table the facts regarding the Tugun bypass and why it was not going ahead. But, first, I will give you a little bit of history on the Tugun bypass and what has happened with this special piece of road.</para><para>Three governments agreed on the route for the Tugun bypass: the New South Wales government, the Queensland government and the Commonwealth government. I reiterate tonight that it is a state government responsibility, but the Commonwealth stepped up to the plate with $120 million to help fund the Tugun bypass. All three governments agreed on a western route for the bypass, west of the Gold Coast airport. In November last year, the New South Wales Minister for Roads, Carl Scully, killed off the dream of the people of Tugun that they would finally see this road come to fruition. A bypass route had been selected, the money was on the table and Carl Scully turned around and said, `We are not building it on New South Wales land.' It is a state road; it is not a federal government responsibility. I take my hat off to the federal transport minister, John Anderson, for stepping up to the plate and putting the money on the table, but we are now in a situation where the New South Wales government will not agree with this road being built on New South Wales land.</para><para>A second route was put on the table two days before a state election; residents had only two days to ascertain where this road was going. The federal government was not even consulted about where this road was going. But, worse than that, 14 homes were going to be resumed to build this piece of road infrastructure and hundreds of other homes were going to end up with a six-lane highway in their front yards. What sort of consultation went on with regard to this new route? None. The residents were not consulted about it and the Commonwealth government were not consulted about it. The first we knew about it was when we read about it in the newspapers. Part of that route is going to take the northern part of the Gold Coast Airport, which is a very important piece of infrastructure for the Gold Coast; it is our international airport. The Gold Coast is built on a tourism industry that relies very heavily on that airport. The general aviation area of the airport was going to be wiped out, and people were going to lose their homes.</para><para>The New South Wales Minister for Roads, Carl Scully, said he was saying no to the bypass for environmental reasons. He had every opportunity to put those concerns on the table for many months before that. We understand that the environmental concerns raised by Mr Scully were all able to be overcome. In fact, the EIS was never submitted to the federal government, so we had no idea what his environmental concerns were. Still, the people who are going to be impacted by this piece of road had not been consulted. The transport minister in Queensland had not consulted his counterpart in New South Wales; they still had not decided to have a talk about this and the impact that it was going to have on these residents. Quite frankly, I think Premier Beattie has a role to play in this; he needs to pick up the phone and talk to his counterpart in New South Wales; he needs to talk to the Premier of New South Wales and get this piece of road infrastructure back on track.</para><para>This road needs to be built; we have enormous traffic problems from New South Wales to Queensland and from Queensland to New South Wales. Mr Beattie should stop his grandstanding and get on the phone to Premier Carr and work this problem out. He now wants the Commonwealth government to take over the route; he wants us to take charge of the route. It is not our responsibility. It is entirely the responsibility of the Queensland state government to build this road, but in consultation with the Commonwealth government and the New South Wales government. Mr Beattie says that, under constitutional powers, the federal government have the right to take over this piece of land. We do not. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Chifley Electorate: Chifley College</title><title>Wonderland Sydney</title><page.no>25495</page.no></subdebateinfo><title>Wonderland Sydney</title><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>25495</page.no><name role="metadata">Price, Roger, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PRICE</name><name.id>QI4</name.id><electorate>Chifley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr Speaker, you have sat in this chamber enough times to know that I am a keen advocate for senior high schools. I want to make a couple of remarks about Chifley College, a senior high school with a number of junior campuses. I want to report on what I think is a great turnaround in retention rates for years 11 and 12. I would love to be able to tell the House what the pre-existing retention rate was for each campus, but I am unable to do that. I can tell you that there was a time when the total year 11 and year 12 component at the Bidwill campus of the school was 19 students. I do have the figures for the Shalvey campus. Prior to the senior high school structure, the retention rate from year 10 to year 11 was 60 per cent. I am pleased to report that it is now 80 per cent. At the Mount Druitt campus, which was the subject of a notorious <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> article, it is now 82 per cent. At the Dunheved campus it is 77 per cent. Bidwill campus is a little different. Bidwill is at 27 per cent because it still has a year 11 and year 12 component, but a further 50 per cent go to the senior college. So, in total the retention rate is some 88 per cent. This is a remarkable turnaround.</para></talk.start><para>I was privileged to attend the senior campus presentation to the year 12 students of 2003. It was a marvellous event. I congratulate the principal, Steve Freeborn, and the teachers, students and parents. The school having been open for some two years, I live in expectation of receiving an invitation from the department, or whomever, to an official opening of the Chifley College senior campus. In our area it is certainly something that is worth celebrating.</para><para>The other thing I wish to raise is the tragic closing of Wonderland, which was in my electorate and is now just outside of it. The endorsed Labor candidate for Greenway, Ed Husic, was one of the thousands of teenagers who have had the opportunity to be employed at Wonderland. It is a tragedy that young people will not have that leg-up of part-time work at Wonderland. One wonders at Queensland's Gold Coast being able to have four theme parks—as would be acknowledged by the honourable Minister for Employment Services at the table—but that Sydney's only theme park is closing. We never had an opportunity to save it. The real tragedy is that some of the 500 hectares of the site were rezoned to allow for a technology park. In fact, 18 years ago I attended the opening of Wonderland by Premier Wran and I find it really sad that I am participating in its closing. But it is closing because of the value of its land as a technology park. It is a great tragedy. It is really sad that young people will now have to travel to the Gold Coast to experience a theme park, as they can no longer experience one in Australia's largest capital city.</para><para>We need to look at planning laws. If the Malaysians could not make a go of Wonderland, it should have been sold as a theme park, not as something to be demolished and redeveloped as an industry park. I mourn the loss of Wonderland and I regret that none of us was given an opportunity to save it. I hope that in the future we may see again in Sydney a theme park like Wonderland and not only the tourist opportunities but also, in particular, work opportunities. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Illegal Fireworks</title><page.no>25496</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>25496</page.no><name role="metadata">Gash, Joanna, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs GASH</name><name.id>AK6</name.id><electorate>Gilmore</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Last year the annual police ministers conference resolved to focus on the issue of illegal fireworks entering Victoria. According to news reports, they were being smuggled in from the Northern Territory. The Victorian government ultimately failed in its bid for a total ban and rightly so, as there is, and has been for centuries, a place in our lives for legal fireworks displays to celebrate significant events.</para></talk.start><para>But there is no place for the illegal detonation of fireworks smuggled in from other states. In my case, I am concerned by fireworks readily available in the ACT being brought down to the South Coast by holiday-makers. Every summer in the late evening residents throughout my electorate can expect to hear the odd explosion. Police are regularly called out to investigate these explosions, the resulting vandalism of private property and the occasional fire.</para><para>In the Canberra fires of 2001 it was suggested that one such fire may have been started by fireworks—illegally detonated, of course. It is of real concern that this is occurring, as is the anxiety such incidents are causing affected residents, their children and particularly their pets. Pets have been the target of extreme cruelty with fireworks—again by the yobbo element—and I know that the RSPCA has some strong words to say on this issue.</para><para>The actual threat posed by fireworks is of great concern for the reasons mentioned; but also in an age where shootings seem to be commonplace, as is the case in Sydney, there is no way of knowing what an isolated explosion or report in the night can be. Elderly people are particularly susceptible and fearful, and it is for them that we feel the most concern.</para><para>I find it difficult to comprehend why fireworks are legal in the territories but not in the states. In terms of consistency, this is clearly a strange and incongruous state of affairs. In New South Wales fireworks for private use have been banned for a couple of decades but every year we get reports—both pyrotechnic and written—of fireworks being let off illegally, more often than not, by the uncaring element in our community. More disturbingly of late, the TV footage of the riots in Redfern showed fireworks being thrown at police. It is a small step from this to being able to buy fireworks and extract the gunpowder to produce homemade ordnances for aggressive purposes. It is obviously too easy to hop across the border and make such a purchase.</para><para>It is heartening to learn that in May 2002, in a joint communique of workplace relations ministers, it was agreed that further information on this issue be provided to the Commonwealth for enhanced regulation. I am realistic enough to appreciate that we can never totally ban these incidents, but we can go a long way towards it by simply instituting a uniform code to address the question. It seems ridiculous to find that in an area like Canberra and Queanbeyan, for example, a 10-minute journey is all the difference between `legal' and `illegal'.</para><para>Unfortunately, in this case the Commonwealth cannot act of its own volition because the laws governing the sale of fireworks are the domain of state and territory governments. They would have to relinquish that power to the Commonwealth, and we all know how jealously they guard their rights and entitlements. In this day and age it is a stupid situation, and we as a modern nation are deserving of a better approach.</para><para>I know that every nation has weird laws. Goodness knows that a quick search of the Internet can produce some classics. Overseas visitors to Australia must be astounded by these small and seemingly incongruous discrepancies in legal issues. While I was researching this subject, I came across a site called `dumb laws'. Under `Australia', it had the following summary:</para><para>	Children may not purchase cigarettes, but can smoke them.</para><para>	You may never leave your car keys in an unattended vehicle.</para><para>	It is illegal to roam the streets wearing black clothes, felt shoes and black shoe polish on your face as these items are the tools of a cat burglar.</para><para>	It is illegal to read someone's tarot, or give them a psychic reading as these are forms of witchcraft.</para><para>	Under Australian Communications Authority (ACA) regulations, your modem can't pick up on the first ring. If it does the ACA permit for your modem is invalid and there's a $12000 fine. - Telecommunications Act 1991.</para><para>To that list we can add: you can buy fire crackers in Canberra but you cannot let them off in Queanbeyan. I have not verified that list, but I am sure members understand what I mean.</para><para>We need to address this issue for a number of reasons, and the governments of the ACT and the Northern Territory really need to get on board and stop dragging their heals. I am sure that I am not the only local member who is concerned by this anomaly. In closing, I thank those people who have taken the time to write, phone or call in to make me aware of this situation. I urge all states and territories to get together to fix it—if not, let us fix it.

Job seekers choose Job Network members for a variety of reasons including location, proximity to transport routes and Centrelink offices, or the satisfaction of friends and others. Job seekers residing in one electorate or ESA may elect to be assisted through Job Network sites located in adjoining electorates or ESAs. For illustration, job seekers residing in the electorate of Throsby may be assisted through Job Network sites located in the electorate of Hume.

honourable member's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>The Department of the Treasury has carriage of implementing tort law reform issues. Tort law reform issues are primarily consulted through the vehicle of the Ministerial Meeting on Insurance Issues which is attended by Commonwealth and State insurance ministers. The Standing Committee of Attorneys-General (SCAG) has considered the issue of tort law reform during its 2003 meetings and during the July 2002 and November 2002 meetings. </para><para>(a)	SCAG Ministers have agreed to progress work to assist the consistent implementation of tort law reform. SCAG Ministers have continued to consider this issue and direct SCAG officers to work towards this goal.</para><para>(b)	In June 2002 the Commonwealth introduced the Trade Practices Amendment (Liability for Recreational Services) Bill 2002 to enable the self-assumption of risk by users of recreational services. These amendments to the Trade Practices Act 1974 became law in December 2002. </para><para>In July 2002 the Commonwealth (with the agreement of the States and Territories) established a Review of the Law Negligence (`the Ipp Review'). The Ipp Review presented its final report to Australian Governments on 30 September 2002. The Ipp Review made 61 recommendations, most of which relate to the law of negligence, and are therefore matters for State and Territory Governments. However, the Ipp Review also recommended changes to the Trade Practices Act 1974 to ensure that proposed State and Territory reforms are not undermined by Commonwealth law. The Commonwealth introduced the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill 2003 into the Parliament in March 2003. </para><para>If passed, this Bill will amend the Trade Practices Act 1974 to prevent claims for damages for personal injury or death flowing from misleading and deceptive conduct or other unfair practices. However, on 1 December 2003, the Opposition parties moved amendments to the Government's Bill in the Senate. </para><para>The Commonwealth expects to introduce a second tranche of amendments to the Trade Practices Act 1974 into the Parliament during the Autumn Parliamentary Sittings. These further changes to the Trade Practices Act 1974 will implement the Ipp Review recommendations concerning damages and limitation periods. The amendments will ensure that a nationally consistent approach is taken so that limitation periods and constraints on damages arising from personal injury or death apply consistently across the country. Together, these changes to the Trade Practices Act 1974 will prevent State and Territory civil liability reforms from being undermined. </para><para>The Commonwealth has announced that it intends to amend the Trade Practices Act 1974, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 and the Corporations Act 2001 to ensure that proportionate liability applies to damages for economic loss for misleading or deceptive conduct. The reforms are being pursued as a part of the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program (CLERP 9) package of reforms and were introduced into Parliament on 4 December 2003. </para><para>The Commonwealth also intends to amend the Trade Practices Act 1974 and other relevant legislation to support professional standards legislation on a nationally consistent basis. The Commonwealth introduced legislation to support State and Territory professional standards legislation on 4 December 2003.</para><para>A summary of the tort law reforms which have been agreed to by the State and Territory Governments may be found in the Joint Communique from the last Ministerial Meeting on Insurance Issues (April 2003) at http://www.aila.org.au/BDP/4APRIL.pdf. The next Ministerial Meeting on Insurance Issues will be held during February 2004, and another update on the progress of implementation of tort law reform issues should be available at that time. </para><para>I have been informed that New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria have already enacted provisions to introduce proportionate liability for economic loss or property damage. However, all three States have delayed the commencement of their legislation, pending the introduction of complementary amendments to the Trade Practices Act 1974.</para><para>An Act to introduce proportionate liability (among other things) was passed by the Western Australian Parliament on 23 October 2003. Other States and Territories have not yet legislated for proportionate liability. </para><para>New South Wales and Western Australia have had professional standards legislation in place since 1994 and 1997 respectively. Western Australia plans to introduce a Bill in early 2004 to ensure that its law is consistent with that of New South Wales.</para><para>Victoria introduced a Professional Standards Bill into Parliament on 16 October 2003. The Bill is broadly consistent with New South Wales and Western Australian legislation, but includes a carve out for breach of fiduciary duty. South Australia has also undertaken to enact professional standards legislation.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Military Detention: Australian Citizens</title><page.no>25510</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2841)</subtitle><id.no>2841</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>25510</page.no><name role="metadata">Organ, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Organ</name><name.id>BNL</name.id><electorate>Cunningham</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 3 December 2003:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Do the views he expressed on the ABC TV program Lateline on 25 November 2003 in which he said “...as we've warned all Australians, you put yourself in a situation of risk when you're outside Australia that you will be dealt with in accordance with the laws of the countries in which you may be while you're abroad”, and on the ABC Radio program PM on the same date on which he said “Australians who breach the laws of foreign countries while overseas have no automatic right to be repatriated to Australia for trial.
