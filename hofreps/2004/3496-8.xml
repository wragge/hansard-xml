The Dawson review is the most comprehensive review of the competition provisions of the act for a decade.</para><para>After extensive and comprehensive consultation and consideration, the Dawson review concluded that the competition provisions of the act have served Australians well. The committee made a total of 43 recommendations aimed at improving the operation of competition and authorisation provisions, as well as the administration of the act.</para><para>The overall theme of the Dawson review is that the competition provisions should protect the competitive process, rather than particular competitors. The government strongly supports this view of the act, and has accepted the vast majority of the Dawson review recommendations.</para><para>The bill will improve existing ACCC processes by providing for greater accountability, transparency, and timeliness in decision making and reducing the regulatory burden on business.</para><para>The major initiatives contained in the bill are as follows.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Mergers</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">New Merger Clearance Process</inline></para><para>A voluntary formal clearance system will be created that will operate in parallel with the informal clearance system. The test for considering mergers will remain unchanged—section 50 of the Trade Practices Act will continue to prohibit mergers that would have the effect, or be likely to have the effect, of substantially lessening competition in a market.</para><para>The Dawson review found that the ACCC's informal system of merger clearance can be quick, inexpensive and flexible in many circumstances but identified a lack of certainty for business as a clear disadvantage:</para><para>	there is (necessarily) no statutory time limit on the ACCC;</para><para>	the absence of a meaningful appeals mechanism may allow the extraction of undertakings that go beyond the competition concerns of a merger;</para><para>	the lack of a legal requirement for the ACCC to provide reasons for its decisions prevents the development of a body of precedent; and </para><para>	ultimately, there is no certainty of immunity from legal action.</para><para>In response to these concerns, the Dawson review recommended that a voluntary formal clearance system operate in parallel with the existing informal system—thus providing business with options dependent upon their particular circumstances.</para><para>The informal system will continue to answer the needs of straightforward mergers. Parties to more difficult mergers will be able to utilise the informal system to address ACCC concerns but, when they are ready to proceed, the formal system will provide the certainty of legislated time limits, require the disclosure of reasons, allow the applicant to appeal to the Australian Competition Tribunal, and provide immunity from legal action should the clearance be granted.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Merger Authorisations</inline></para><para>The Dawson review identified that dissatisfaction with the merger authorisation process has been largely attributed to concerns about the time which may be taken to reach a decision and the risk of third party intervention by the way of appeals to the tribunal.</para><para>These factors have rendered the authorisation process commercially unrealistic for many merger proposals, especially those involving publicly listed companies.</para><para>The bill provides that merger authorisation applications will be considered directly by the tribunal so as to ensure commercially realistic time frames for such applications, and to prevent strategic appeals by third parties. Third party interests will be considered as part of the tribunal's comprehensive assessment.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Non-Merger Authorisation</inline></para><para>The bill addresses the concerns of business regarding the sometimes expensive and protracted nature of the non-merger authorisation process by placing time limits on the ACCC for considering applications. Small business in particular is advantaged by providing the ACCC with the discretion to waive, either in whole or part, the filing fee, in appropriate circumstances.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Collective Bargaining</inline></para><para>This government acknowledges and supports the important contribution made by small business to the Australian economy.</para><para>The bill will reduce the regulatory burden on small business by introducing a notification process for collective bargaining by small business dealing with large business, as an alternative to the authorisation process.</para><para>In the absence of objection by the ACCC, the bill provides collective bargaining arrangements will receive immunity at the end of 14 days for a period of three years. The government proposes that the period be initially set at 28 days by regulation, with a further assessment at the end of 12 months.</para><para>The onus will be on the ACCC to provide notice that the conduct does not or is unlikely to benefit the public, or the benefit will not outweigh the detriment resulting from the conduct.</para><para>The ACCC already authorises collective bargaining arrangements, including those by chicken growers, dairy farmers, sugarcane growers and small private hospitals. However, the process of obtaining authorisation may be expensive, time consuming and impose an unnecessary burden on small business—in many cases notification will be an appropriate, effective and speedy alternative.</para><para>To ensure the collective bargaining process benefits small business dealing with large business, there is a transaction limit of $3 million in any 12-month period. However, it is recognised in the bill that there are businesses with high turnover and small profit margins which should have a higher transaction limit, and the bill provides that a higher limit can be set by regulation. </para><para>The government considers there would be a range of businesses suitable for a higher limit. These could include motor vehicle dealers, petrol station owners and some agricultural businesses. The Minister for Small Business and Tourism will develop proposals for the government's consideration in respect of these regulations.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Exclusionary Provisions, Price Fixing and Joint Ventures</inline></para><para>The act prohibits exclusionary and price-fixing provisions outright; that is, not subject to a substantial lessening of competition test. The government considers that outright prohibition should continue for such serious cartel conduct.</para><para>However, the Dawson review found that the existing joint venture exemption contained in the act is too narrow to encompass many newer forms of joint ventures, such as those found in e-commerce.</para><para>The bill provides a joint venture defence to the prohibitions on exclusionary provisions and price-fixing provisions. Clear cartel behaviour will continue to be prohibited outright but genuine joint ventures will be considered on the basis of a competition test. Authorisation on public benefit grounds will still be available for other joint ventures where appropriate.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Dual Listed Companies</inline></para><para>The modern phenomenon of dual listed companies is recognised in this bill by allowing intraparty transactions in a dual listed entity to be treated on the same basis as related party transactions within a group of companies, and for the aggregate market power of the dual listed company to be assessable for the purpose of considering market power.</para><para>The formation of a dual listed company will be prohibited where it would substantially lessen competition in a market, with authorisation available in appropriate cases.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Third Line Forcing</inline></para><para>Most exclusive dealing arrangements are only prohibited by the act if they substantially lessen competition. Third line forcing, which involves selling only on condition that goods are acquired from a third party, is however prohibited outright.</para><para>The Dawson review considered that third line forcing is often beneficial and procompetitive. The ACCC presently opposes very few of the hundreds of third line forcing notifications received annually and has also found that these arrangements can encourage competition, such as the grocery shopper docket arrangements for cheaper petrol.</para><para>The bill amends the act to subject third line forcing to a substantial lessening of competition test, consistent with other forms of exclusive dealing.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Enforcement</inline></para><para>The ACCC is a vigorous and effective regulator. In recognition of the ACCC's extensive investigative powers and its potential to significantly disrupt business if not used appropriately, the Dawson review recommended greater transparency and accountability in the ACCC's enforcement mechanisms, and greater safeguards on the use of its extensive powers.</para><para>The current provisions in the act provide the ACCC with the power to enter premises and inspect documents without a warrant. This bill will provide the ACCC with the ability to search premises and seize evidence; however, these powers are matched with appropriate accountability by requiring the ACCC to obtain a warrant from a magistrate. </para><para>These amendments both enhance the effectiveness of the ACCC's investigative powers and also ensure accountability and transparency. The relevant rights and responsibilities of the ACCC in carrying out its enforcement duties are clearly specified.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Penalties</inline></para><para>The bill provides for higher penalties for contraventions of the act, as a means of better deterring corporations or individuals from engaging in anticompetitive behaviour.</para><para>The government has adopted recommendations made by the Dawson review which provide that the maximum pecuniary penalty for corporations be raised to be the greater of $10 million or three times the gain from the contravention or, where gain cannot be readily ascertained, 10 per cent of the turnover of the body corporate and all of its interconnected bodies corporate, if any.</para><para>The bill also gives the court the option to disqualify an individual implicated in a contravention of part IV of the act from being a director of a corporation or being involved in its management.</para><para>Corporations are also to be prohibited from indemnifying, directly or indirectly, officers, employees or agents against the imposition of a pecuniary penalty.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Other Measures in the Bill</inline></para><para>In addition to implementing the major recommendations of the Dawson review, the act is amended to apply to local government consistently with other levels of government—that is, to the extent it carries on a business. The bill also implements measures to help ensure the constitutional validity of the act's national application, addressing uncertainties raised by the High Court in the Hughes case.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Conclusion</inline></para><para>The Trade Practices Act is an essential component of Australia's regulatory framework, and the bill enhances existing measures in the act to provide greater accountability, transparency, timeliness and efficiency.</para><para>I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fitzgibbon</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>AUSTRALIAN PASSPORTS BILL 2004</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>31450</page.no><id.no>R2116</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>31450</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Downer</inline>, and read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>31450</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>31450</page.no><name role="metadata">Downer, Alexander, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DOWNER</name><name.id>4G4</name.id><electorate>Mayo</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Foreign Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>The <inline ref="R2116">Australian Passports Bill</inline> will provide a modern legal structure to underpin our world-class passports system.</para><para>The government wants to ensure that Australians can continue to rely on a travel document of the highest integrity, which clearly establishes their identity and citizenship.</para><para>The Australian Passport Bill would replace the existing 65-year-old act. New elements include increased penalties for fraud, measures to reduce the number of lost and stolen passports, and an improved mechanism to prevent terrorists and other criminals from using passports.</para><para>Identity fraud is a major security problem—it has been estimated to cost $1.1 billion annually.</para><para>The bill would increase the penalties for fraud up to $110,000 or a 10-year jail term from $5,000 or two years jail in the current act.</para><para>These penalties are the same as for comparable offences for people-smuggling. </para><para>These penalties will apply across all indictable offences, such as false statements in applications and illegal use of a passport, including sale.</para><para>This will ensure that the Australian passport is not targeted by those seeking to commit identity fraud.</para><para>The new act would enable us to combat identity fraud through the use of emerging technologies, such as biometrics.</para><para>The bill also contains a package of measures aimed at reducing the number of lost and stolen passports. The government's policy approach is twofold—to emphasise the importance of protecting passports and to stop the misuse of lost or stolen passports.</para><para>The bill contains important new measures to support national security and law enforcement objectives.</para><para>The new act will explicitly allow for refusal or cancellation of a passport if an Australian is likely to engage in, is charged with—or has been sentenced for—specified serious crimes.</para><para>These crimes will include child sex tourism, child abduction, sexual slavery, drug trafficking, people-smuggling and terrorism.</para><para>In these circumstances, the bill makes clear that it is the responsibility of law enforcement agencies to assess that a person should be prevented from travelling. The person's passport would then be refused or cancelled to complement the law enforcement objectives.</para><para>Existing powers to cancel a passport if a person could prejudice national security are retained in the bill.</para><para>These strong measures are necessary, particularly to stop the misuse of lost or stolen passports and to stop terrorists and other criminals from travelling on Australian passports.</para><para>However, these powers must be administered fairly. Natural justice under the new act will be maintained in a number of ways. </para><para>Firstly, the bill clearly states the entitlement of Australians to a passport. This provides a sound legal footing for any subsequent proceedings.</para><para>Secondly, the bill retains the comprehensive administrative review regime of the existing act.</para><para>In this context, the government's policy is that Australian passports law should not be used as an extension of the judicial system and should not be expected to impose any more restraint on an individual than a court would be prepared to impose.</para><para>In short, the refusal or cancellation of a passport should not be used as a substitute for arresting and charging a suspect. Such administrative action should complement the law enforcement action.</para><para>In addition, as some travellers can lose multiple passports through no fault of their own, the specific categories of circumstances in which action may be taken against them will be set out clearly. These categories will be subject to parliamentary approval.</para><para>Another priority for the government is that the new act set out a clear statutory framework to protect privacy.</para><para>I consider that high standards of privacy protection are important to maintain community confidence in a system which holds the information of about eight million Australians.</para><para>A key element is a transparent mechanism for obtaining information to verify identity and citizenship. The bill also proposes to regulate the disclosure of information for other limited purposes.</para><para>The bill retains the basic requirements for the issue of passports for children. These requirements are in place to protect children from abduction and to protect the rights of parents. </para><para>In some circumstances, where there is a dispute between parents about whether their child can travel internationally, officers of my department are required under the current act to make decisions to resolve the dispute. These decisions are made with the best intentions but outside the formal policy and legislative framework established under the family law system.</para><para>The bill proposes that, in such cases, a declaration may be made that the matter should be dealt with by a court.</para><para>In the short time available, I have set out the basic new elements of the Australian Passports Bill.

Without secure and high-quality water resources we would be unable to sustain our regional economies or urban communities. The long-term health of our fresh water ecosystems also depends on us minimising the negative impacts of agricultural and urban water consumption.</para><para>The emerging urban water problems in Australia are looking increasingly serious. One only needs to look at Melbourne, Sydney, Perth and south-east Queensland for a graphic illustration of the urban water issues. High rates of population growth, the strong economy, increasing demands for environmental releases and prolonged drought conditions are continuing to offset the gains from conservation programs and increasing the pressure on available water supplies.</para><para>Reduced rainfall and inflows to storages have resulted in much lower sustainable yields from available storages than had been projected as recently as five to 10 years ago. The Gold Coast, for example, will be past the sustainable yields of its existing dams in only a few short years. Previous estimates of the potential water available from unexploited dam resources are being revised downward as a result of the recent drought at a time when the population is growing at a tremendous rate. As a consequence the Gold Coast is now in the process of planning a new regional pipeline to collect water from a dam near Brisbane. Unfortunately this solution will only provide temporary relief and the Gold Coast is now looking at recycled water, desalination and rainwater as part of its future water supply strategy. Water conservation has become more than a noble idea for the Gold Coast, but is now an integral part of meeting future water needs.</para><para>The Howard government has taken this challenge very seriously by committing significant resources to improving water management across the nation and by working in partnership with the state and territory governments.</para><para>Today I am introducing a <inline ref="R2088">bill </inline>for the introduction of a national Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Scheme that will require water efficiency labels to appear on a range of common water-using products like washing machines, dishwashers and toilets and also establish a regime for the setting of minimum water efficiency standards. But before I explain the detail of the bill, I would like to provide the House with the broader context of the initiative. </para><para>At the 1994 Council of Australian Governments (COAG) meeting, COAG agreed to implement a strategic framework for the reform of the water industry. Through the implementation of water reforms over the last 10 years, Australian governments have made some real progress towards efficient and sustainable water management. The recognition of the need for environmental water provisions, the separation of water entitlements from land, and pricing reform, have all been significant steps forward.</para><para>At the COAG meeting in August last year, the government agreed to develop a draft national water initiative for COAG's consideration at its 2004 meeting. It was agreed that opportunities for a cooperative national approach to further progress water reform exist in four key areas, which form the basis of the national water initiative. The four key areas encompass water access entitlements, water market institutional and administrative arrangements, the specification of environmental flow regimes, and a new generation of urban water reforms.</para><para>The urban water reforms are aimed at improving water-use efficiency and demand management and making better use of stormwater and recycled water. There has been a lot of activity in this area over the last 10 years, including in the reform of water pricing in urban areas. This bill—the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Bill—is a key initiative in support of the urban water reform agenda. </para><para>The government is also working with states and territories to develop <inline font-style="italic">National guidelines for water r</inline><inline font-style="italic">ecycling—managing health and environmental risks. </inline>The new guidelines will cover water recycling and water sensitive urban design and be a part of the National Water Quality Management Strategy. The guidelines will increase the uptake of water recycling opportunities in Australia to provide new sources of supply in a way that protects public health and the environment.</para><para>So the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Bill must be seen in the context of the government's very significant achievements in relation to water reform and as a contribution towards achieving efficiency improvements under the national water initiative.</para><para>At just under 1,800 gigalitres per year, that is, 1,800 billion litres per year, household water use accounts for about 16 per cent of the consumption of the mains-supplied water in Australia. This is the second largest share of mains water use after agriculture, which at around 8,400 gigalitres per year, accounts for around 75 per cent of consumption. Clearly whilst the `main game' in water consumption will always focus on agricultural use, urban and household water use cannot be ignored, especially as our main urban centres are experiencing significant water supply problems. The dual effects of increasing population and the emerging impacts of climate change make efforts to manage urban water use ever more important. Indeed, between 1996 and 2001, the supply of water to households in the main urban areas increased by 13 per cent.</para><para>The purpose of the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Bill is to establish a water efficiency scheme for a range of important water-using products. Through the scheme, the government wants to empower consumers by providing them with information about the water efficiency of products so that they can contribute to water conservation directly through the purchase of more water-efficient products. This information will predominantly come in the form of labels on products covered by the scheme, but also from the associated web site and promotional material. </para><para>The net savings to consumers are forecast to be substantial. By simply choosing more efficient appliances, by 2021 the community stands to save more than $600 million through reduced water and energy bills. And these savings are achieved without any compromise in product performance or convenience or any major adjustment in user behaviour. A water-efficient washing machine performs its function just as well as an inefficient one, as does a water-efficient urinal. So the scheme will promote clever design that benefits both consumers and the economy. </para><para>The water efficiency scheme will be the first of its kind in the world. Given that pressure on freshwater resources is emerging as a truly global problem, the potential for Australia to position itself as a leading exporter of water-efficient technologies and expertise is significant. Underpinned by a robust technical regime, our exporters will be able to use the label as a platform for marketing the water efficiency of their products to a growing global market.</para><para>The government estimates that by 2021, water efficiency labelling will cut domestic water use by five per cent or 87,200 megalitres per year. A total of 610,000 megalitres—more water than in Sydney Harbour—will be conserved by 2021. Nearly half the water savings will come from more efficient washing machines, about 25 per cent from showers and 22 per cent from toilets. </para><para>The scheme will also deliver substantial energy savings and greenhouse gas abatement through a reduction in hot water use. The reduction in greenhouse gas emissions for Australia is projected to reach about 570 kilotonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per annum by 2021, with a cumulative total of around 4,600 kilotonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2021.</para><para>The Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Bill establishes a national legal and administrative structure for the scheme. And yet, in the true spirit of federalism, the scheme provides for working in partnership with the states and territories, which will enact complementary legislation. This mirror legislation will fill in the small constitutional gaps in the Commonwealth's powers. Importantly, the states and territories have also agreed in principle to assist with funding the program using the usual population-based funding formula for any program costs that cannot be recovered through industry registration fees.</para><para>The government expects the scheme to commence in 2005. Initially, six appliances will be required to carry water efficiency labels: washing machines, dishwashers, toilets, shower heads, taps and urinals. Flow control devices will be covered on a voluntary basis. In addition to labelling, it is proposed that toilets will be required to comply with a minimum efficiency standard so that inefficient toilets with an average flush volume of more than 5½ litres can no longer be sold in Australia.</para><para>Under the framework set out in the bill, it will be possible in future years to introduce minimum water efficiency standards for additional water-using or water-saving products other than toilets, where the need for this can be established. Minimum water efficiency standards will ensure that inefficient products can no longer be sold. </para><para>The bill will also allow the product range covered by labelling requirements to be expanded if this is found to be appropriate in future years. Whilst the scheme will initially cover washing machines, dishwashers, toilets, shower heads, urinals, taps and flow control devices, there is every reason to believe that further research and development will reveal that other products would benefit from labelling and minimum standards. For example, evaporative air-cooling systems and hot-water systems are potential candidates for inclusion in the scheme. </para><para>Industry has been consulted on the detail of the proposal and I am pleased to advise that the scheme enjoys broad support.</para><para>The water efficiency scheme will help consumers make informed decisions about what products to purchase and the water, energy and financial savings that are possible. Industry will also benefit from the scheme because it will create a level playing field in relation to claims about water efficiency and provide for nationally consistent product standards. </para><para>In conclusion, in this Year of the Built Environment the water efficiency labelling and standards initiative provides another important way that all Australians can conserve water and so help to make our urban communities more sustainable.</para><para>I present the explanatory memorandum to the House.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fitzgibbon</inline>)

I announced changes to the anti-siphoning provisions of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992.</para><para>With these changes, the government reaffirmed its commitment to the anti-siphoning scheme.</para><para>The scheme continues to protect the access of Australian viewers to events of national importance and cultural significance by giving priority to free-to-air television broadcasters in acquiring the broadcast rights to those events.</para><para>This remains an important policy objective for the government.</para><para>With fewer than one in four households having access to subscription television at this time, the rationale for the anti-siphoning scheme remains valid.</para><para>However, after extensive consultation, the government determined that the anti-siphoning scheme did need updating to better reflect the attitudes of Australians and the commercial realities of the sporting and broadcasting sectors.</para><para>The government has therefore developed a new anti-siphoning list which will protect listed events which take place between 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2010.</para><para>On 11 May 2004, I signed the Broadcasting Services (Events) Notice (No. 1) 2004, which gave effect to these changes.</para><para>The government's package of reforms to the anti-siphoning scheme also included a decision to extend the automatic de-listing period from six to 12 weeks.</para><para>This requires a legislative amendment to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992.</para><para>And this <inline ref="R2120">bill </inline>seeks to give effect to that decision.</para><para>Automatic de-listing of an event currently occurs six weeks prior to the start of the event.</para><para>The responsible minister can stop the automatic de-listing if, in the view of the minister, the free-to-air broadcasters have not had a reasonable opportunity to acquire the relevant rights. </para><para>This bill amends the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 to extend the automatic de-listing period from 1,008 hours (or six weeks) prior to the start of an event, to 2,016 hours (or 12 weeks) prior to its start.</para><para>This amendment will improve the efficiency of the operation of the de-listing provisions of the anti-siphoning scheme to the benefit of sporting bodies and viewers, by allowing subscription television operators a reasonable opportunity to acquire those rights not taken up by the free-to-air broadcasters, arrange coverage and market the programs to viewers.</para><para>This change, together with the removal of some events from the anti-siphoning list, will provide subscription television broadcasters with access to the broadcast rights for an increased range of sports, to the benefit of both sporting bodies and viewers.</para><para>The bill also contains a transitional rule which applies to events that start between six and 12 weeks after commencement of the bill.</para><para>The effect of this rule is that events of this kind are de-listed upon commencement of the bill.</para><para>This provision aims to provide certainty to sporting bodies and broadcasters in relation to events that are on the anti-siphoning list and that start during the first 12 weeks after the bill's commencement.</para><para>I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.</para><para>Debate (on

ref="R2114">bill </inline>gives effect to two beneficial family and community services and veterans' affairs 2004 budget measures that require legislation.</para><para>Firstly, the bill will exempt all scholarships (or such components of any scholarships) that pay tuition fees or any student contribution amount on a student's behalf, or waive all or part of a student's tuition fee or any student contribution amount, from the social security and veterans' affairs income tests. This extends the exemptions announced in December 2003 in which Commonwealth learning scholarships and full fee-waiver scholarships provided by higher education institutions were made exempt from the social security and veterans' affairs income tests. This will apply to scholarships offered in the secondary, vocational education and training and higher education sectors, and will assist approximately 1,550 students at the present time. However, this number is expected to increase by up to 2,200 students per year by 2008.</para><para>Secondly, the bill expands the eligibility criteria for carer allowance by allowing a carer to be qualified for carer allowance if they provide certain care for an adult with a disability, even if they do not live with that adult. This measure recognises that it may not always be possible or appropriate for the carer to live with the person for whom they are providing care, and yet these carers still make a valuable and significant contribution to the community. In many cases this care allows the person with a disability to continue to live in their own home, instead of going into alternative care. This measure recognises that people have different living arrangements, and allows them the flexibility to choose the arrangements that best suit their particular circumstances, without precluding them from receiving carer allowance. </para><para>The bill also makes one technical amendment to correct an unintended minor drafting error.</para><para>I commend the bill to the House and present the

parliament.</para><para>However, since the introduction of that bill, the shadow minister for homeland security has written to me offering to facilitate passage of schedule 5 of the Anti-Terrorism Bill (No. 2) which deals with disaster victim identification and criminal investigation following a domestic mass-casualty incident.</para><para>The member for Barton has rightly recognised the importance of our ability to respond if a terrorist attack or other mass-casualty disaster were to occur within Australia.</para><para>This bill will amend the forensic procedure laws in Part 1D of the Crimes Act 1914 to ensure that, if a terrorist attack or other mass-casualty disaster were to occur within Australia, forensic services from all jurisdictions in Australia can work together, using the national DNA database system, to identify the victims of the disaster and conduct a criminal investigation.</para><para>In the spirit of cooperation I have agreed to excise schedule 5 from the Anti-Terrorism Bill (No. 2) and progress it in a separate bill, the Anti-Terrorism Bill (No. 3), in recognition of the importance of this measure and its relatively non-controversial status.</para><para>I will be moving amendments to remove schedule 5 from the Anti-Terrorism Bill (No. 2).</para><para>In a similar vein, I will also be excising schedules 1 and 2 from the Anti-Terrorism Bill (No. 2) and have included the provisions from those schedules in the bill I am introducing today.</para><para>Schedules 1 and 2 deal with the need to ensure that a person who carries both an Australian passport and a foreign passport cannot leave Australia on a foreign passport after the person's Australian passport has been cancelled by Australian authorities.</para><para>This bill contains amendments to the Passports Act 1938 that will, among other things, give competent Australian authorities the power to request an order for the surrender of a person's passport.</para><para>The amendments to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 will give the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation the power to demand a person surrender their Australian and foreign passports if the person is subject to a request for consent to apply for a questioning warrant. </para><para>This will prevent a person who may have vital information about a planned terrorist attack from fleeing Australia before ASIO has the opportunity to question the person.</para><para>I welcome the member for Barton's constructive approach to matters of national security but I caution him that the importance or urgency of national security matters is not dependent on the Labor Party's assessment of what is important or urgent.</para><para>I take my advice on what is in the national interest from our intelligence and law enforcement agencies.</para><para>I am advised that both the passport and victim identification measures are important and urgent and should not be delayed because the bill in which they are contained has, as is the usual practice for this opposition, been referred to an already over-burdened Senate committee system.</para><para>I call on the opposition—and I hope the member for Hunter, at the table, will share this with his colleagues—to support this bill which has been developed in a response to an initial constructive suggestion by the shadow minister for homeland security.</para><para>I challenge the opposition to not respond in a predictable fashion and oppose the bill simply because it does not meet their precise specifications.</para><para>I cannot imagine that even the opposition believes it is acceptable that a person who carries both an Australian passport and foreign passport can leave Australia on a foreign passport even though that person's Australian passport has been cancelled by Australian authorities.</para><para>Securing our borders against incoming or outgoing terrorist suspects is an important weapon in our fight against terrorism, both domestically and internationally.</para><para>We are not interested in letting terrorists enter Australia.</para><para>Nor are we interested in exporting terrorists who are then free to pursue their deadly ambitions in other countries—against other peoples and possibly even our own nationals travelling abroad.</para><para>I trust that the opposition do not need a Senate committee to repeat these basic facts in order for them to acknowledge the importance and urgency of these measures.</para><para>I commend this bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fitzgibbon</inline>)

move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>It is an important measure that I now introduce. The <inline ref="R2123">bill</inline> is necessary because there is significant community concern about the possible erosion of the institution of marriage.</para><para>The parliament has an opportunity to act quickly to allay these concerns.</para><para>The government has consistently reiterated the fundamental importance of the place of marriage in our society.</para><para>It is a central and fundamental institution.</para><para>It is vital to the stability of our society and provides the best environment for the raising of children.</para><para>The government has decided to take steps to reinforce the basis of this fundamental institution.</para><para>Currently, the Marriage Act 1961 contains no definition of marriage. </para><para>It does contain a statement of the legal understanding of marriage in the words that some marriage celebrants must say in solemnising a marriage that: `Marriage, according to law in Australia, is the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life.'</para><para>The government believes that this is the understanding of marriage held by the vast majority of Australians and they should form the formal definition of marriage in the Marriage Act.</para><para>This bill will achieve that result.</para><para>A related concern held by many people is that there are now some countries that permit same-sex couples to marry.</para><para>The amendments to the Marriage Act contained in this bill will make it absolutely clear that Australia will not recognise same-sex marriages entered into under the laws of another country, whatever that country may be.</para><para>As a result of the amendments contained in this bill, same-sex couples will understand that, if they go overseas to marry, their marriage, even if valid in the country in which it was solemnised, will not be recognised as valid within Australia.</para><para>In summary, this bill makes clear the government's commitment to the institution of marriage.</para><para>It will provide certainty to all Australians about the meaning of marriage in the future.</para><para>These provisions were contained in another bill that passed this House. They were referred to the Senate, and all of the measures have been referred by the Senate to a committee for review. It would be my intention to amend the Marriage Amendment Bill now before the Senate to delete these provisions. If this bill is acceded to today, I want to make it very clear that the reason for this, without breaching any privacy matters, is that some parties have already sought recognition of offshore arrangements approved under the laws of other countries and would be seeking recognition under our law.</para><para>It is the government's view that the provisions of the Marriage Act which we are seeking to enact should not be delayed and should not be the subject of Senate referral. The opposition having indicated its support for these measures should ensure—having restricted it to those matters that relate to a definition of marriage and the recognition of overseas marriages, which they say they support—that they receive a speedy passage. I invite the opposition to accede to that. I table the explanatory memorandum.</para><para>Leave granted for second reading debate to continue forthwith.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>31460</page.no><name role="metadata">Roxon, Nicola, MP</name><name role="display">Ms ROXON</name><name.id>83K</name.id><electorate>Gellibrand</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This is extraordinary. Not only does the Attorney want to use the processes of this House to get around procedures that have been agreed to in the Senate—which is of course something that we have come to expect from the Attorney—but it seems that the government cannot even manage the order of business in terms of the debate today. The parliamentary secretary cannot be here for the debate when he was meant to; the Attorney cannot agree to a procedure which he has agreed to. We really have a complete procedural shemozzle when it comes to the way the Attorney treats the processes in this House, and I think the people at large would agree. Obviously, it takes away proper opportunities for the consideration of these measures.</para></talk.start><para>As the Attorney rightly points out, the measures that have been introduced in this new <inline ref="R2123">Marriage Amendment Bill 2004</inline> are measures that the Labor Party have indicated that we would agree to. But we object strenuously to the process that is being used by the Attorney. We object strenuously because the Attorney knows that the content of this bill, along with its other provision, has been referred to a Senate committee. There have been several weeks during which negotiations could have been held about the way the bill was to be treated or about its referral to a Senate committee. It is not appropriate to receive a phone call at 9 o'clock the night before, to be told that this bill is going to be introduced and then to be expected to agree to whatever procedure the government thinks suits it at the time. We can be sure of one thing with the Attorney—that is, whichever portfolio the Attorney is in there will be a crisis. It does not matter if it is immigration, it does not matter if it is Attorney-General's, and it will not matter after this which shadow ministry he is responsible for, because there will be a crisis.  </para><para>The Attorney would have us believe, in the comments he has made, that the reason for needing to urgently press ahead with this matter is that, if we do not, there would be a major crisis in this country. This is because two applications have been filed seeking to have gay marriages recognised, but they are 99.9 per cent likely to be rejected by the courts. I have no doubt that the Commonwealth will appear in these matters and make its views known. Frankly, I have no doubt that it is most likely that they will be rejected. It is just not credible for the Attorney to come into the House and say, `Unless this bill is passed, the world as we know it will come to an end.' We are sick of dealing with an Attorney who thinks that crisis is just a way of life. He has manufactured a crisis out of this matter. There is no crisis. The Labor Party are quite happy to deal with the content of the bill, but we respect the parliament; we respect the Senate. We believe that a process has already been partly undertaken. The community are entitled to have an opportunity to have their say on the provisions of this bill. That is the process that has been set up in the Senate. The government missed its chance, if it was genuine about this, to negotiate with us or to negotiate with the Senate about the time frame, about the process for reporting from the Senate committee or about separating out different provisions of the bill, if that is what it wanted to do.</para><para>We know that we do not have the numbers to stop the Attorney doing whatever he wants to in the House. The reality is that, if those of us on this side of the parliament seek to object to the process, we ultimately cannot stop the Attorney pushing it through the House. The content of the bill is something that we do not have an objection to, and obviously we will not be voting against the bill. But we object strenuously to the process which is being used. We do not believe that there is any legitimate argument for this to be treated as an urgent matter. The Senate has already determined its program for the rest of today, in consultation with the government. It seems that the Attorney is not prepared to talk to his colleagues in the Senate to ensure that, if this is such a matter of national crisis, it will be put on the program and that there will actually be time for it to be debated in the Senate. That has not happened, and the Attorney should not expect that he will have cooperation from the Labor Party in the Senate to deal with this matter when the program has already been fixed.</para><para>I might, for the benefit of those of us in this House, indicate some of the matters that are going to be debated on the last sitting day for this session in the other place. The Attorney needs to be able to mount an argument—which I do not think he can successfully do—that this is a more important matter for the future of our nation than the national health amendments, pharmaceutical budget measures, superannuation budget measures, tax law amendments, higher education legislation amendments, Treasury legislation amendments relating to professional standards, trade practices amendments for personal injuries and death, the Energy Market Bill announced as part of the government's package several weeks ago, electoral reforms, the sex discrimination amendment and antiterrorism bills. </para><para>Really, if the minister is seriously saying that it is more important to deal with these provisions—which simply confirm the existing law, for goodness sake—and that he has to stop all of the other matters being debated in this House and in the Senate, then he is not going to get our cooperation to just tip everything upside down because he has decided that there is a crisis. As I say, there is one thing that we are really sure of with this minister: wherever he is, there is a crisis. We have now learnt that that does not mean there is a crisis; it just means the minister happens to be there. We will not be supporting speedy passage of this bill through the Senate and we object strenuously to the process which has been undertaken by the minister.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>31462</page.no><name role="metadata">Organ, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ORGAN</name><name.id>BNL</name.id><electorate>Cunningham</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R2123">Marriage Amendment Bill 2004</inline> is a disgrace. It is quite clearly discriminatory. It discriminates against those 20,000 couples in Australia that the ABS has recently told us want to be married, who are living as married couples and who are not heterosexual—they are part of the lesbian, gay and transgender community. There are 20,000 couples out there—perhaps 40,000 Australians—or more. As the ABS said, those figures are undervalued. This is 2004 we are talking about. The government seems to be living in the fifties and seems to deny everything that has happened in regard to so-called gay liberation and rights for people of other sexuality. The government has its head in the sand on this matter.</para></talk.start><para>The government are discriminating against the gay and lesbian community—there is no doubt about that—and it is a disgrace that the Labor Party are also supporting this discrimination. The Greens do not support this discrimination. We support the gay, lesbian and transgender community in our society. We now have before us an amendment to the Marriage Act stating:</para><quote><para>Marriage ... is the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life.</para></quote><para>In this day and age in Australia—and we are talking about Australia here; we are not talking about America, Canada or anywhere else—there are gay and lesbian couples living in loving relationships as married couples. We cannot deny this. It is not going to change. It is part of our society and we have to embrace it. It is disgraceful for the government to come into this place—and for the opposition to support them—and to blatantly discriminate against those people.</para><para>Since this issue has been raised in the last couple of weeks, my office has been inundated with calls of support from the gay and lesbian community. Obviously there is some division in that community about marriage itself and the whole institution of marriage, as there is in the wider community. Not everyone wants to get married. As we know, there is a high divorce rate and there are de facto relationships as well. But a large number of people in the gay and lesbian community do not want to be discriminated against and want to live as married couples. I have stood in this House and given some examples of that. For this bill to insert this new definition of marriage with the words `voluntarily entered into for life' begs the question: if the union is `for life' in this bill then surely there must be some amendment to the Family Law Act—where does divorce come into it?</para><para>The Greens cannot support this bill. It is a backward-looking measure. It is blatantly discriminatory. I will be seeking to introduce the following amendment to this bill: </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">(1)	Subsection 5</inline><inline font-weight="bold">(1): </inline></para><para>Insert</para><para>“Marriage means the union of </para><para>(a)	a woman and a woman</para><para>(b)	a man and a man </para><para>or</para><para>(c)	a woman and a man </para><para>to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life.”</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">(2)	</inline><inline font-weight="bold">At the end of section 88B: </inline></para><para>Add: To avoid doubt, in this Part (including section 88E) marriage has the meaning given by subsection 5(1) </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">(3)	After section 88E</inline></para><para>Insert: </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">88EA Certain Unions are marriages </inline></para><para>A union solemnised in a foreign country between:</para><para>(a)	a man and another man</para><para>(b)	a woman and another woman</para><para>or</para><para>(c)	a woman and a man </para><para>must be recognised as a marriage in Australia</para><para>It is a sad day for this parliament to be introducing such discriminatory legislation. This government seems to want to deny that there are thousands and thousands of ordinary Australians out there who are being discriminated against based on their sexuality. The minister has not addressed that issue. We have heard the Prime Minister come into this place and say, `I'm not going to discriminate against anyone based on their sexuality,' yet here we have a blatant example of the government and the opposition supporting discrimination against ordinary individual Australians based on their sexuality. This simply cannot be condoned.</para><para>The government are using the institution of marriage. Marriage does mean, in part, the union of a man and a woman, but, as I have pointed out, in this day and age in this country, marriage is more than that. There are individual gay and lesbian couples living in loving, caring marriage relationships, asking that they not be discriminated against in the many areas that they are—for example, superannuation, entitlements, living as married couples et cetera. It is not up to this parliament to interfere there—not at all. I condemn the government for this bill and I condemn the ALP for supporting its introduction.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>31463</page.no><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name><name.id>0J4</name.id><electorate>Berowra</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Attorney-General</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will not keep the House long in responding to the comments that have been made. I would, in relation to the comments of the honourable member for Cunningham, simply make the observation that nobody is being discriminated against in relation to entering into a relationship. In fact, we are more than happy for the states to—as they have in large part—order both the maintenance and the dissolution of those relationships and interests that might be created by them, whether they are de facto or same sex. The question is whether or not the institution of marriage means a union between a man and a woman for life, which it does for most people in the Australian community. That has been the expectation and that has been the understanding of the law; what we are seeking to do is to maintain that. </para></talk.start><para>I recognise that the member for Cunningham would like to change it. His amendment suggests that that is what he would like to do. But that is not the government's position, and we understood that that was not the opposition's position.

I am sure that you could facilitate that if there were a bona fide effort to ensure that this measure were able to be enacted today. I think that should be the effort, and I am affording you the opportunity to be able to play that part.

As I said previously, we have thousands of non-heterosexual Australian couples living in loving, committed relationships in this country. For this parliament to tell those people that what they are doing is illegal, that it is not supported, that we are going to discriminate against them, is just not fair or equitable and it is not the right thing to do. We should be supporting all Australians. We should be making sure that we are not discriminating against ordinary Australians. This bill is clearly discriminatory. </para><para>This amendment will reflect marriage as it exists in this country as we speak. Marriage has a lot of different dimensions to it, secular and religious. I think that is an important element of what we as federal members of the House need to reflect here. We cannot bring our own personal prejudices to this place. We are representing the people of our electorates, the people of this nation. With some 10 to 15 per cent of the people of this nation being part of the lesbian, gay and transgender community, it is just unbelievable that this government should try to discriminate against them. </para><para>We have heard the minister say that this is not discriminatory law. We have heard the minister come into this place before and tell us that black is white and say things are not happening when we have heard from his own words the complete opposite. I take those comments with a grain of salt. I know what the people in my community believe. I know what people throughout Australia believe. There are thousands and thousands—a large number of people in this community—who support gay marriage. We are here in 2004. We have come a long way since the bad old days of gay bashing and homophobic behaviour and things like that. Hopefully we have come a long way.  </para><para>We are an open democracy here in Australia. We should be sending a clear message to the community that discrimination against people based on their sexuality and on homophobia is not to be condoned at all. Unfortunately, this Marriage Amendment Bill does send the wrong message out there to the community. It caters to some of those homophobic attitudes in the community and it is the wrong message to be sending. But it is a message that this government seems happy to send and unfortunately it is a message that the opposition seems happy to support as well. I commend these amendments to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>31465</page.no><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name><name.id>0J4</name.id><electorate>Berowra</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Attorney-General</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In the face of the stated purpose of the bill, I suspect the amendments are probably not in order, and they will certainly be opposed by the government.</para></talk.start><para>Question negatived. </para><para>Bill agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>31465</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Mr RUDDOCK (Berowra—Attorney-General) (10.15 a.m.)—by leave—I move:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a third time.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a third time.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>NEW INTERNATIONAL TAX ARRANGEMENTS (MANAGED FUNDS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2004</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>31465</page.no><id.no>R2089</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>31465</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ross Cameron</inline>, and read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>31465</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>31465</page.no><name role="metadata">Cameron, Ross, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ROSS CAMERON</name><name.id>3K6</name.id><electorate>Parramatta</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>The <inline ref="R2089">bill </inline>I am introducing today further modernises Australia's international tax regime as part of the government's ongoing review of international tax arrangements. It builds on legislation directed at the superannuation and funds management industries, which passed parliament last week. It also follows legislation for a participation exemption and important reforms to Australia's tax treaty policies reflected in the new tax treaty with the United Kingdom, signed in August 2003.</para><para>This bill focuses on making the Australian managed funds industry more attractive to foreign clients. Australia has a significant managed funds industry facilitated by strong economic performance, a highly educated work force, low-cost infrastructure, advanced regulatory systems and sophisticated financial markets.</para><para>Schedules 1 and 2 make changes designed to reduce taxation impediments to further growth in this area. These changes will allow Australian managed funds to become more internationally competitive, increasing their attractiveness to non-residents.</para><para>Under current capital gains tax arrangements, non-residents investing in assets through an Australian managed fund may be taxed more heavily than if they invested directly in those assets or through a foreign fund. Measures in schedule 1 will eliminate these distortions. Complementing this, measures in both schedules 1 and 2 will reduce taxation of foreign source conduit income earned by non-residents via interposed Australian managed funds. </para><para>Schedule 1 makes three key changes to the income tax law.</para><para>It amends the law to disregard a capital gain or capital loss made by a foreign resident from disposing of its interest in an Australian fixed trust if the underlying assets of the trust are not Australian assets. A second amendment will disregard a capital gain made by a foreign resident in respect of the taxpayer's interest in a fixed trust, if the gain ultimately relates to an asset of the trust which is not an Australian asset. In both cases, had the underlying asset been directly held by the foreign investor, Australian capital gains tax would not apply.</para><para>Reflecting the conduit principle of international taxation, foreign source income flowing through an Australian trust to non-residents is not taxed in Australia. However, under current arrangements when a trust interest is sold, previously distributed foreign source income is, on a delayed basis, subject to Australian capital gains taxation. On the other hand, non-residents investing directly or through an offshore managed fund do not pay Australian capital gains tax in respect of the foreign source income. A third amendment will eliminate this distortion.</para><para>Schedule 2 amends the rules for determining the source of income derived by certain residents of treaty partner countries. The interaction of treaty source rules and other treaty rules relating to non-resident beneficiaries of income derived by business trusts operating in Australia has implications for the managed funds industry. This interaction may result in foreign source passive income derived by those foreign beneficiaries through an Australian trust being treated as sourced in Australia and therefore taxed in Australia.</para><para>For example, if a New Zealand resident invests in an Australian managed fund investing offshore, this interaction inappropriately exposes the New Zealand beneficiary to Australian tax on conduit income. The amendments ensure the domestic source rules rather than treaty source rules (which have a wider potential reach) apply in this case. The effect of this amendment would be to relieve the conduit income from Australian taxation.</para><para>The amendments will align the tax treatment of foreign residents investing through managed funds that derive income from sources outside Australia with the tax treatment that would apply if those foreign residents made such investments directly.</para><para>Schedule 3 implements three measures finetuning interest withholding tax arrangements, consistently with other recent developments in the tax law. These changes will allow Australian businesses generally to take advantage of global opportunities to lower their cost of debt and to facilitate efficient business structures.</para><para>The first measure broadens the range of financial instruments eligible for interest withholding tax exemption by adding `debt interests'. The second treats payments of a non-capital nature, made on certain Upper Tier 2 hybrid capital instruments issued by banks, as interest for interest withholding tax purposes. Finally, the bill facilitates the transfer of additional assets and debts from Australian subsidiaries of foreign banks to their Australian branches without losing interest withholding tax exemptions.</para><para>The size of Australia's funds management pool and its prospects for continued growth, are drawing global firms to establish operations in Australia. The resultant clustering of activity and the concentration of expertise has created a robust domestic industry. This infrastructure provides a framework for Australia to become the funds management hub for the Asia-Pacific region and these reforms will remove impediments to achieving that goal. </para><para>I note the strong business support for the bill. The business community has played a valuable and constructive role in helping develop the proposed legislation. This bill again demonstrates that the government has listened and been responsive to industry calls for specific tax reforms to remove distortions from the tax system and allow Australian businesses to grow.</para><para>The future of the Australian economy is fundamentally linked to global prosperity and to Australians being a part of that prosperity. This bill is an important part of modernising Australia's international tax system, to make the most of Australia's potential to market financial products to foreign investors.</para><para>Full details of the measures in this bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum.</para><para>I commend this bill and present the explanatory memorandum.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McClelland</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2004 MEASURES NO. 4) BILL 2004</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>31467</page.no><id.no>R2104</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>31467</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ross Cameron</inline>, and read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>31467</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>31467</page.no><name role="metadata">Cameron, Ross, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ROSS CAMERON</name><name.id>3K6</name.id><electorate>Parramatta</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>This <inline ref="R2104">bill </inline>makes amendments to the income tax law and other laws to give effect to several taxation measures.</para><para>Firstly, after listening to the concerns of business, the government is implementing, in schedule 1 further refinements to the consolidation regime.</para><para>The refinements provide greater flexibility and certainty to the consolidation membership and loss rules. The bill clarifies the consolidation cost setting rules with respect to finance leases, certain types of mining expenditure, and low-value and software development pools. The refinements also reduce compliance costs by alleviating the notice requirements under the inter-entity loss multiplication rules during the consolidation transitional period for entities that are in the same consolidatable group and in other circumstances approved by the Commissioner of Taxation. Generally, these amendments take effect from 1 July 2002, which is the commencement date of the consolidation regime.</para><para>Secondly, this bill ensures that copyright collecting societies are not taxed on income they collect on behalf of members.</para><para>Broadly, the provisions will ensure that copyright collecting societies that are appropriately structured and administered, are exempt from income tax on certain types of income that they derive and hold pending allocation to recipients. The provisions will also ensure that any amounts of income that are exempt at the society level, are included in the assessable income of recipients once these amounts are distributed to them.</para><para>The third measure ensures further implementation of the simplified imputation system, including anti-avoidance rules in relation to exempt entities that are eligible for a refund of imputation credits; and consequential amendments to the income tax laws to replace references to the former imputation system with those of the simplified imputation system and to update terminology of the former imputation system to equivalent provisions of the simplified imputation system. </para><para>Schedule 4 to this bill amends the lists of specifically listed deductible gift recipients in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. This includes adding certain fire and emergency services bodies as specifically listed deductible gift recipients. Deductible gift recipient status will assist these organisations to attract public support for their activities.</para><para>Lastly, this bill will extend an existing transitional rule in the debt equity rules for at-call loans to 30 June 2005. This will give business extra time to assess existing loans and adjust their arrangements if need be.</para><para>Full details of the measures in this bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum.</para><para>I commend this bill and present the explanatory memorandum.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gavan O'Connor</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (WINE PRODUCER REBATE AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2004</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>31468</page.no><id.no>R2085</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>31468</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ross Cameron</inline>, and read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>31468</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>31468</page.no><name role="metadata">Cameron, Ross, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ROSS CAMERON</name><name.id>3K6</name.id><electorate>Parramatta</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>This <inline ref="R2085">bill</inline> amends the A New Tax System (Wine Equalisation Tax) Act 1999 to implement a new wine producer rebate and to improve certain compliance and administration arrangements.</para><para>The government announced in the 2004-2005 federal budget a wine producer rebate that will provide a $290,000 rebate of wine equalisation tax (WET) to every wine producer per annum which effectively exempts from WET the first $1 million (wholesale value) of each producer's domestic sales every financial year.</para><para>The new wine producer rebate arrangements apply from 1 October 2004 and will replace the existing Australian government cellar door rebate scheme. The new producer rebate will apply to all domestic sales, not just cellar door sales. The maximum of $290,000 in rebate that will be available to each wine producer under the new scheme is significantly greater than the $42,000 cap of the current cellar door rebate scheme. This maximum rebate applies to each individual producer or a group of producers that are associated or connected with each other.</para><para>Around 90 per cent of wine producers will receive a rebate that will offset their WET liability, with around 85 per cent of the benefits being received by small wine producers in rural and regional Australia.</para><para>The rebate will continue to be claimed through the business activity statement. To reflect the implementation of the arrangements from 1 October 2004, transitional provisions in the bill provide that the rebate available in the 2004-2005 financial year will be pro-rated.</para><para>The two compliance measures relate to ensuring wine packaging is included in the tax base and the export and re-entry of wine.</para><para>In particular, the practice of a retailer purchasing bulk wine and then subsequently and separately undertaking steps integral to preparing the wine for retail sale, such as bottling and packaging the wine, will be addressed. This practice artificially excludes the costs of these value adding processes from the wine tax base.</para><para>The other revenue protection measure will ensure WET is not bypassed by the practice of exporting wine, claiming a WET credit for the export, then re-entering the same wine WET-free for sale in the Australian market.</para><para>This bill will also remove accelerated depreciation for grapevines, with effect from 1 October 2004. New grapevine plantings will fall for consideration under the general arrangements for horticultural plants. </para><para>Currently, a grapevine starts to decline in value in the year in which the taxpayer first uses it in a primary production business for the purpose of producing assessable income. Grapevines can be written off over a four-year period at a rate of 25 per cent per annum. Under the horticultural plant provisions, grapevines will still be subject to write-off at an accelerated rate, depending on their effective life.</para><para>Full details of the measures in the bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum.</para><para>I commend the bill and present the explanatory memorandum.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gavan O'Connor</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>INDIRECT TAX LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SMALL BUSINESS MEASURES) BILL 2004</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>31469</page.no><id.no>R2086</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>31469</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ross Cameron</inline>, and read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>31469</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>31469</page.no><name role="metadata">Cameron, Ross, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ROSS CAMERON</name><name.id>3K6</name.id><electorate>Parramatta</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>The Treasurer announced in the budget a package of taxation measures aimed at reducing compliance costs for small business and providing greater flexibility to taxpayers in managing their affairs.

The business will make a single payment of any GST at the time they lodge their returns with the Commissioner of Taxation.</para><para>The second initiative provides businesses that have an annual turnover of $2 million or less the option to undertake annual apportionment of input tax credits for acquisitions used partly for non-business purposes. Those businesses will disregard for most acquisitions or importations their non-business use in determining the amount of input tax credit they can claim in their monthly or quarterly GST return. The business will then make a single adjustment after the end of the financial year in which they made the claim for the credit to account for the non-business use. Businesses that are also required to determine the extent of non-business use of acquisitions or importations for income tax return purposes will be able to use the same determination for GST purposes.</para><para>The third initiative further reduces compliance costs for small businesses by simplifying the election rules relating to the option to pay GST by instalments and to lodge an annual GST return.

They are technical amendments. One amendment slightly changes the long title of the bill; the other refines its commencement provisions. The House agreed to two requests from the Senate on Tuesday, and the bill received a third reading in the Senate yesterday.</para><para>The bill complements the government's response to the Clarke committee's review of veterans' entitlements. It implements two significant changes for persons in receipt of disability pensions. First, the portion of disability pension paid above the general rate will be indexed with respect to both the consumer price index and the male total average weekly earnings, backdated to 20 March 2004. Second, it introduces the Defence Force income support allowance, otherwise known as DFISA, from 20 September 2004. This allowance offsets the loss of income resulting from inclusion of the disability pension in the income test for social security pensions and benefits.</para><para>The bill enables the payment of rent assistance as well as the ceiling rate of income support supplement or service pension to war widows and widowers and increases the maximum funeral benefit from $572 to $1,000. It also enables former prisoners of war of the North Koreans or their surviving spouses to receive a one-off payment of $25,000 in recognition of the inhuman conditions that they endured. Finally, the bill extends operational service to personnel who were involved in minesweeping and bomb clearance operations after World War II who have the appropriate qualifying service medals.</para><para>The measures of this bill demonstrate the government's commitment to ensuring that Australia's repatriation system meets the needs of its veterans and their families and remains one of the best in the world. Again, I thank members of the Clarke committee, those individual veterans and the ex-service organisations who participated in the inquiry and my parliamentary colleagues who took such a keen interest in the government's response to the committee's report—in particular, the members for Gilmore, Blair, Dunkley, McEwen, Riverina, Eden-Monaro, Herbert, McPherson, Dickson, Cowper, Macarthur and Moncrieff. I also pay tribute to those officers in my department who have worked hard and long to bring this legislation through to the parliament. </para><para>On a personal note, this is the second major piece of legislation of benefit to veterans and their families which this government has been able to bring into the parliament in the space of six months. The first was the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act, which passed the parliament in March this year. This landmark legislation provides a generous and responsible military specific rehabilitation and compensation scheme for Australia's Defence personnel and their families—indeed, the future veterans of our nation. Being part of the Howard coalition government and delivering on our strong commitment to veterans, ex-service personnel, war widows and their families and being the minister responsible for the carriage of both pieces of legislation has been of immense personal satisfaction to me—indeed, an immense personal privilege.

Bob underwent surgery in Adelaide yesterday. I understand that he has come through the operation well and his condition is stable. As a Labor minister for agriculture he has a deep interest in trade matters. On behalf of all members I wish him a speedy recovery. </para></talk.start><para>The two bills that we are debating here today are related to the so-called free trade agreement with the United States. The <inline ref="R2118">US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Bill 2004</inline> amends a number of pieces of legislation, including two pieces of legislation that fall within the area of my portfolio responsibilities—namely, the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act 1994 and the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act 1980. The <inline ref="R2111">US Free Trade Agreement Implementation (Customs Tariff) Bill 2004</inline> provides duty-free access for certain goods and preferential rates of customs duty for other goods originating in the United States.</para><para>Labor will not be opposing these bills in the House at this stage, but we will make a final decision once we have received the report of the Senate Select Committee on the Free Trade Agreement between Australia and the United States of America chaired by my colleague Senator Peter Cook, which is currently inquiring into the so-called free trade agreement. Labor will be carefully examining the report of that committee before determining our final position on these bills when they are debated in the Senate and when they come back into the House.</para><para>The government is fond of touting this trade agreement as a free trade agreement. It is clear that it is not. The agreement is not comprehensive because a major rural industry—the sugar industry, with production valued at $1.3 billion and exports of around $1 billion—has been left off the table completely by the Howard government as a result of political pressure by the US sugar lobby and the American President. Also, this agreement has left in place and, in some cases, enhanced the protective measures employed by the United States to inhibit freer access by Australian agricultural producers to some key markets. Quotas, in-quota tariffs, safeguard provisions and long phase-in periods are still the order of the day in this agreement.</para><para>It is quite clear that this agreement was negotiated and concluded according to the Prime Minister's political timetable. Now a domestic imperative is the reason that these bills have been introduced into the House at this time for debate. The Prime Minister ought not to be playing politics and political games with Australia's national interest. Labor will not be stampeded into making an untimely decision on the fate of this trade agreement merely to suit the electoral timetable of the Prime Minister. We owe it to our electorates and to the Australian people to thoroughly examine this agreement and its impact on Australian industries, Australian workers, the farm sector and, of course, the Australian community generally.</para><para>At present, we simply do not have enough information to make an informed decision about the purported benefits of the agreement. In my own electorate of Corio there has been considerable disquiet about the possible impacts of the so-called free trade agreement on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme—the PBS. For many of my constituents, an increase in the cost of medicines would put a real strain on the family budget and have a real detrimental impact on their standard of living.</para><para>Before we finalise our position on the FTA, we have to be absolutely sure that we will not be placing an increased burden, by increasing the costs of medicines, on those Australians who can least afford it. Evidence given to the Senate inquiry on the FTA by medical experts, academics and even former members of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee has suggested that the processes established under this trade agreement, which allow decisions of Australia's Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee to be reviewed, could lead to significant increases in costs. </para><para>In a submission to the inquiry by Professor Peter Drahos and others entitled <inline font-style="italic">The FTA and the PBS</inline> they argued that the agreement would increase the bargaining power of the United States drug companies. The submission said that over time the price differential for medicines between the Australian and United States markets would be significantly reduced. They cited a previous study by the Productivity Commission which found that prescription drugs in the United States are around three times the price of equivalent drugs in Australia. Professor Drahos and his colleagues found that, even if the cost differential between Australia and the United States were halved over the next five to 10 years, the cost of the PBS would increase by $1.6 billion and there would be considerable flow-on cost increases for Australian hospitals.</para><para>My constituents in Corio greatly value the PBS and, if the FTA is shown to be likely to have a negative impact on the PBS, they would rightly be very concerned. This type of uncertainty must be addressed before any decision can be made by Labor as to the future of these bills. My electorate of Corio is based on one of Australia's great manufacturing centres. At the heart of our regional economy are the automotive and TCF industries. Manufacturing provides more jobs in Geelong than any other sector. According to the 2001 census, there are 9,355 people living in my electorate and another 6,348 living in the electorate of the member for Corangamite, just across the Barwon River but in the Geelong region, who have jobs in manufacturing industries.</para><para>I have had discussions with representatives of a number of manufacturing industries in Geelong about the likely impact of this trade agreement on their businesses, including Ford Australia. I have also discussed the agreement with the Geelong and Region Trades and Labour Council and with representatives of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, the AMWU. The AMWU is rightly concerned about the impact that the FTA might have on the jobs of its members. Just yesterday, I met with a delegation from the AMWU, which included Geelong shop stewards, that raised a number of significant issues with me concerning the impacts of the FTA. The AMWU is concerned about the potential for this agreement to lead to job losses in the auto, auto parts, electrical equipment and appliances, fabricated metal products, medical and scientific equipment, non-electrical machinery and paper and wood product industries. Many of these industries provide substantial employment in my electorate. The union has looked closely at the experience of Canadian workers following the signing of the NAFTA agreement. They are particularly concerned that, following that agreement, Canada suffered a net loss of 270,000 jobs.</para><para>To try and quantify the impact of the FTA on our manufacturing industries, the AMWU commissioned the National Institute of Economic and Industry Research to undertake an economic analysis. That analysis found that there was a reasonable probability that the Americans will start to export high value added automotive components into Australia, including instruments, brake and clutch systems, transmission systems and engines and components. The Office of the United States Trade Representative has estimated that the removal of barriers to trade on passenger motor vehicles and other components will result in an increase in the United States' exports to Australia of $720 million—not an insignificant amount in Australia's marketplace. An increase of anywhere near this magnitude would have an impact on jobs in Australia's motor vehicle manufacturing industries. </para><para>I now want to raise a number of general concerns in relation to chapter 3 of the so-called free trade agreement, which deals with agriculture. Before I turn to the details of the agreement, at the outset I point out that the most favoured nation provisions, which were negotiated in this agreement for the trade in services and investment, will not apply to agriculture. Under the MFN provisions, if the United States negotiates a better deal with some other nations for access in services and investments, then these would automatically flow on to Australia. But the Howard government did not negotiate similar provisions for Australian agriculture. Once again, our farmers were treated as second-class citizens by the Prime Minister in this trade agreement when compared to the deal done for the paper shufflers in the investment and service industries.</para><para>I will now turn my attention to the future of Australia's single desk marketing arrangements. The future of these arrangements for wheat, sugar, rice and barley under this FTA has been the subject of considerable debate. Article 3.1 commits the parties to work together in the WTO to reach an agreement to develop `disciplines that eliminate restrictions on an entity's right to export'. While the DFAT fact sheet on the FTA says that Australia's single desk arrangements for marketing Australian commodities to the world such as for sugar, rice, wheat and barley have been preserved, the US trade representative fact sheet says:</para><quote><para>In response to US concerns about Australia's state trading enterprises, Australia committed to working with the US in the ongoing WTO negotiations on agriculture to develop export competition disciplines that eliminate restrictions on the right of entities to export. </para></quote><para>That simply means that the government has moved its assault on Australia's single desk arrangements away from the FTA negotiations into the WTO and has agreed to work with the Americans to develop export competition disciplines that eliminate restrictions on the right of entities to export—that is a crack at the single desks.</para><para>In a media release dated 10 March 2004, American Farm Bureau President Bob Stallman is quoted as saying:</para><quote><para>Australia had always been resistant to changes in its system of state trading enterprises (STE) but through this initiative Australia has agreed to work in principle with the United States in the WTO to make its system of agricultural trade more market oriented.</para></quote><para>I suggest that this is something the Americans should take up themselves, because this agreement leaves in place some significant protective devices that severely restrict access by Australian agricultural producers to the US market. The report of the US Agricultural Technical Advisory Committee for Grains, Feed and Oilseed said:</para><quote><para>We expect the Administration to hold the Australian Government to this commitment ...</para></quote><para>The government may be technically right when it says that our single desk marketing arrangements remain intact under this FTA deal, but it seems to have given a clear commitment, which the US interests intend to pursue vigorously, to work with the US in the WTO to have such arrangements dismantled.</para><para>Further concern in this area comes from the joint letter from the US Department of Justice and the US Federal Trade Commission that has been appended to the end of chapter 7, the chapter relating to sanitary and phytosanitary measures. This letter seems to go well beyond quarantine issues. In the view of the US Department of Justice and the US Federal Trade Commission it `affirms their interest in pursuing discussions with Australia with a view to strengthening cooperation and enforcement assistance concerning antitrust and competition matters'. This letter would seem to reflect a determination to pursue agriculture related competition matters through the FTA process. It would be of concern if Australia's single desk marketing arrangements were among the competition matters to be looked at, given the commitment in chapter 3 to pursue these matters only through the WTO. </para><para>I now want to turn to concerns in relation to chapter 7 on sanitary and phytosanitary measures. The government has agreed to the establishment of a special committee on sanitary and phytosanitary matters as part of this free trade agreement with the United States. According to the text of the agreement, this committee will enhance each party's implementation of this agreement and facilitate trade between the parties. Note the reference to trade facilitation. The blurring of the lines between trade facilitation and strictly science based quarantine arrangements occurs again and again in the text of the FTA document. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade fact sheet on the FTA says:</para><quote><para>Australia's quarantine and food safety regimes, which ensure our health and our environment are protected, are not affected by the Agreement.</para></quote><para>This claim has been repeated a number of times by Australian government ministers. But this is not the view of the American Farm Bureau, which, in its paper `Implications of an Australian Free Trade Agreement on US Agriculture', states:</para><quote><para>The sanitary/phytosanitary language calls for two initiatives, which are (1) efforts to resolve outstanding issues and (2) efforts to work together to develop and implement common ... sanitary/phytosanitary regulations.</para></quote><para>The 8 February 2004 press release of the US Trade Representative included the statement:</para><quote><para>Food inspection procedures that have posed barriers in the past will be addressed, benefiting sectors such as pork, citrus, apples and stone fruit.</para></quote><para>Clearly there is a belief in the United States that the commitments given in relation to sanitary and phytosanitary measures represent an important breakthrough in getting US agricultural products through Australia's quarantine barriers. The agreement also provides for a special technical working group to be established on animal and plant health measures, once again inserting another layer into the import risk assessment process with a view to `facilitating trade to the greatest extent'. As I said earlier, the FTA has been exercising the minds of many in the parliament this week as the government brings forward the necessary legislative amendments to facilitate it.</para><para>I now want to move from the quarantine issue to specific agricultural commodities—firstly, the dairy industry. Access for a range of Australian dairy products into the United States market will be improved under this agreement, with a tripling in the current quota access in year 1 and growth in access of between three per cent and six per cent a year. It has been estimated that the increased access would be worth between $50 million and $60 million in year 1. Dairy farmers are disappointed that free trade in dairy products was not achieved, but they believe that worthwhile gains in a small but high value market have been made. However, these gains should be put in context: a gain of $50 million a year only represents a 1.6 per cent increase in Australia's $3 billion a year dairy export market.</para><para>The government has also claimed significant gains for beef producers. It is true that this agreement delivers an additional quota of 70,000 tonnes above the existing quota, but it is to be phased in over 18 years and quantity based safeguards will remain in place from years 9 to 18 and price based safeguards will remain in place indefinitely. Overnight, there has been disturbing news that a powerful United States Senate committee has voted to recommend an amendment to the US legislation that would make life even tougher for Australian beef producers. The United States Senate finance committee yesterday voted 11 to 10 to make it harder for US trade officials to waive the special beef safeguard that takes effect from year 9 of this agreement. </para><para>If this amendment is finally adopted by the US administration it will make inroads into the already meagre gains for Australian beef producers through the FTA. Beef producers and their representatives are already disappointed by both the magnitude of the quota increase and the phase-in periods. They believe that Chile got a much better deal than the one done by the Howard government. There is even some concern about the ability of the Australian industry to take advantage of the increased quotas given that the current quota ceiling has only been reached in two of the past seven years.</para><para>It is fitting that I conclude my remarks by discussing the sugar industry. The accumulated benefits to the industry, assuming implementation in 2004, would have been in the order of $2 billion if free trade had been reached. Right up to very late in the day the government led sugar producers to believe that failure to include sugar in the agreement would be a deal breaker as far as the Australian government was concerned. The trade minister was quoted in the<inline font-style="italic"> Canberra Times </inline>of 24 January 2004, saying, `Sugar must be part of the deal.' The Deputy Prime Minister was quoted in the <inline font-style="italic">Age on the same day, </inline>saying:</para><quote><para>I cannot see how Australia can agree to a free trade agreement that did not include a fair and reasonable approach to sugar ...</para></quote><para>The Prime Minister gave his solemn commitment. He said:</para><quote><para>I want to assure the agricultural sector of Australia that we won't be trading away their interests ...</para></quote><para>That promise now has a very hollow ring in the cane fields of New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia. Once again, the Prime Minister has broken a solemn promise to the sugar industry. This government has been promising the Australian sugar industry better access to markets since 1996. In facing the greatest opportunity we have had for years to crack the market access nut and send a powerful international message about how serious we really are on the issue, the trade minister and the Prime Minister squib the issue. This was one of the most spineless negotiations we have seen.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>31477</page.no><name role="metadata">Thomson, Kelvin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KELVIN THOMSON</name><name.id>UK6</name.id><electorate>Wills</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to support the second reading amendment to the <inline ref="R2118">US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Bill 2004</inline> moved by the member for Rankin. Labor are not opposing passage of the FTA enabling legislation through the House but we are reserving our position in the Senate. We have not made a decision to support this legislation in the Senate, nor have we made a decision to oppose it. When we say we are reserving our position, that is precisely what we mean. I therefore strongly support the second reading amendment.</para></talk.start><para>One of the points I want to make in relation to this issue is that this government has been selling out Australia's national interest in making a disgraceful claim that to oppose the free trade agreement with the United States is to be anti-American. That is a ludicrous proposition. Our obligation in this place and our obligation as Australians is to act in Australia's national interest. Does the government seriously propose that, no matter what the content of the free trade agreement might be and no matter how disadvantageous it might be to Australia, we have an obligation in these matters to look after the Americans? That is an absurd proposition, and yet that is exactly what government ministers have been saying. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has been suggesting that people are anti-American if they do not support this deal. The Minister for Health and Ageing said on the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday </inline>program, hosted by Laurie Oakes: </para><quote><para>... the big question, Laurie, is does the Labor Party support the US free trade agreement. They say they support the alliance, but it's hard to see how they can support the alliance if they don't support the free trade agreement ...</para></quote><para>It is a ridiculous and outrageous proposition that, in supporting the Australia-US defence alliance, we are somehow obliged to support anything and everything that might come forward in a proposed free trade agreement—or trade agreement, because as other speakers have noted this is certainly not a free trade agreement; it is anything but. Indeed, yesterday we had a number of actors and directors such as Geoffrey Rush, Sigrid Thornton, David Wenham and Toni Collette in the parliament. Is the government seriously alleging that these people are anti-American if they put forward the proposition, as they were yesterday, that we should not be supporting the free trade agreement—that somehow this involves questioning the alliance with the United States? That is an absurd and preposterous proposition. It suggests that the government is in fact willing to sell out the Australian national interest in the interest of pursuing a trade deal with the United States. Our obligation—and I am sure this is what the Australian people expect of us—is to look to the Australian national interest in these matters and to come up with a position which reflects Australia's best interests.</para><para>The second thing I want to say is that bilateral trade agreements are not cost free. Some people would want us to look at the Australia-United States agreement as if it were the only thing on the table and not think about what implications these bilateral trade agreements have for global trade and what implications they may have for other countries with whom Australian trades and wishes to trade. I believe that the proliferation of preferential free trade agreements—or trade agreements—is dealing a severe blow to the global round of multilateral trade negotiations, that this proliferation is damaging in the region and that beyond that it undermines the continued viability of the World Trade Organisation. I believe that the negotiations for the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations are being put in jeopardy by the focus on bilateral preferential deals. I think we need to understand that these bilateral deals are not cost free and that indeed it would be better if we had success at the multilateral level and were able to reduce barriers to trade in an international way rather than seeking to do one-off special deals which undermine trade relations with other countries and undermine international and multilateral trade negotiations.</para><para>I want to speak now in more detail about the environmental consequences of this proposed agreement. The environmental implications of the Australia-United States free trade agreement have not received a great deal of scrutiny. I think that is unfortunate, and I want to use my opportunity in this debate to try to rectify that. It is not that people have taken no interest in the environmental implications. Indeed, I want to draw to the attention of the House the work of the Australian Conservation Foundation, which has done a very detailed submission concerning the Australia-United States free trade agreement. I have had a good look at that very detailed work.</para><para>In my opinion, the strongest area of concern regarding the environmental impact of the Australia-United States free trade agreement relates to the potential right to compensation for United States investors where Australian governments make decisions to protect the Australian environment. Article 11.7.1(c) obliges the Australian government to pay compensation to United States investors if Australian laws, including environmental laws, expropriate their investments either directly or indirectly through measures equivalent to expropriation. </para><para>According to the Australian Conservation Foundation submission, this article is equivalent to an article in the NAFTA. Also, in a NAFTA case, Metalclad Corporation v. United Mexican States, back in 2000, the relevant tribunal provided an extremely broad definition of what constitutes expropriation. In addition to the more conventional notion, the one that we would understand about expropriation involving the taking of property, the tribunal held that expropriation under that NAFTA clause or article includes:</para><quote><para>... covert or incidental interference with the use of property which has the effect of depriving the owner, in whole or in significant part, of the use or reasonably-to-be expected economic benefit of property ...</para></quote><para>This decision was subsequently upheld on appeal to the Supreme Court of British Columbia.</para><para>Such a decision or definition would grant rights to US investors to obtain compensation from the Australian government well beyond the compensation rights enjoyed by Australians under Australian law. The Australian Constitution, as we all know, recognises a right to compensation when property has been acquired or—as they describe it—effectively `sterilised'. It does not extend to circumstances where regulations significantly interfere with the use or reasonably to be expected economic benefit of property. There is good reason for this. To extend a right to compensation to circumstances where there has been a mere regulatory interference with the use of property would be enormously costly. The obvious example is: if I say that I want to put a casino on my property and the local council say, `We're not going to give you a planning permit to put a casino on your property,' you can understand that, if I could then sue them for the loss of the economic benefit that the casino might provide to me, that would make life very difficult for councils. Indeed, it would make life very difficult for state and federal governments to make good and proper decisions.</para><para>The prospect of the costs in that kind of situation would deter or limit the capacity of current and future Australian governments to pass legislation pursuing legitimate public interest objectives, such as environmental protection. The article that we see in the Australia-United States free trade agreement could fetter the capacity of future Australian governments to legislate to protect the environment. The Australian Conservation Foundation gives examples which might require compensation to be paid to US investors, such as amendments to state planning schemes to protect sensitive coastal areas from development—indeed, Labor recently released a policy about protecting sensitive coastal areas from development—and amendments which would prevent US property owners from developing a coastal property. Or it could relate to emission standards on power generators that interfere with the profits of US companies which own Australian coal-fired power generators. It could also apply to new anti-tree-clearing or water conservation laws which interfere with the profits of United States agricultural companies operating in Australia.</para><para>Article 11.11, in chapter 11, says:</para><quote><para>Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting, maintaining, or enforcing any measure ... that it considers appropriate to ensure that investment activity in its territory is undertaken in a manner sensitive to environmental concerns. </para></quote><para>While that might sound as if it is a protection for environmental measures, this article does not appear to deal with the question of compensation. It appears that if an environmental law expropriates or significantly interferes with the investments of a US corporation, the Australian government would still be liable to compensate that corporation, notwithstanding article 11.11. I want to reiterate the point that that would then put United States investors in a position superior to that of Australian investors or investors from any other country. I think that is a matter of concern.</para><para>Another serious point raised by the Australian Conservation Foundation is the absence of an environmental impact statement concerning the free trade agreement. Unlike United States law, there is no Australian legislation in place that requires the Australian government to undertake a review of the environmental impacts of free trade agreements. The United States government commenced its environmental review of the Australia-US free trade agreement back in March 2003, so it has been doing the environmental review for over a year. The Australian government still has not done so. Without an environmental impact statement, Australia is unable to fully assess the potential environmental impacts of the Australia-United States free trade agreement.</para><para>The Australian Conservation Foundation and other bodies have raised a range of other issues. I think perhaps they are of lesser significance, but they are issues which ought to be considered and responded to nevertheless. They indicate that the emphasis throughout the agreement is on measures to enhance environmental performance through voluntary and flexible outcomes and that those sorts of outcomes have not been successful in the past. I think that it is frequently the case that voluntary and flexible mechanisms do not really get you the results. But I suspect that it may not be a valid criticism of the free trade agreement to say that it fails to strengthen existing environment protection mechanisms.</para><para>The submission also talks about the cross-border trade in services. The ACF is concerned that environment regulations could be considered a barrier to trade in services unless they are based on objective and transparent criteria and are not more burdensome than necessary to ensure quality of the service. Some of Australia's environment regulations are based on the precautionary principle but, for my own point of view, I do not see any reason why properly founded regulations could not meet the tests being established. The ACF also mentions the possible privatisation of national parks or water services as an outcome of the free trade agreement. I think this is drawing a long bow, but we as a parliament do need to have a response to this concern. The government wants to rush this legislation through without anywhere having produced a response to concerns such as this.</para><para>Conservation groups have also expressed concern that chapter 7 of the free trade agreement, which relates to sanitary and phytosanitary measures, runs the risk of watering down our stringent controls on imported products which could become pests or invasive species and impact on Australian flora and fauna. Prior to my remarks, I heard my colleague the member for Corio talking about the issue of sanitary and phytosanitary measures. Clearly, we need to ensure that our stringent sanitary and phytosanitary measures are not watered down. Weeds and invasive species are already a very substantial problem for the Australian environment. Wherever I go in my travels around the country, talking with groups concerned about environmental issues, the question of weeds comes up very frequently. We cannot afford to have any relaxation of controls which could allow new invasive species into the country. </para><para>There has also been concern about chapter 8 of the free trade agreement relating to technical barriers to trade. There is concern about the possibility of changes to labelling arrangements for genetically modified organisms. My impression is that chapter 8 does not really change the existing law. Given the arguments that have been put, it appears to me that United States companies could already initiate proceedings under WTO dispute settlement procedures and that the free trade agreement does not change the legal situation in this regard. But I believe that all of these issues are serious concerns and that a proper environmental impact assessment would enable the federal government to assess environmental issues in detail and establish whether some of the concerns which have been raised have genuine merit. It would certainly enable us to deal with that important question of the liability of Australian governments to compensate corporations whose profits are adversely affected by Australian government decisions designed to protect our environment.</para><para>There are serious issues which have been raised. If the parliament is going to make a considered decision, it needs to take these issues into account as well as the many other issues that have been raised, such as on pharmaceuticals, the protection of Australian culture, and sanitary and phytosanitary controls. There is a whole range of issues which will impact on this country's future. This is not a decision which should be entered into lightly; it is one which should be entered into after proper consideration of all the issues. Labor has properly sought this through the Senate committee process. The government appears to be unwilling to allow that proper process to run its course. It prefers to bring the legislation into the parliament when, in many cases, Australians have not had the opportunity to properly consider and understand its impact.</para><para>The government's motives in this regard appear to be political rather than genuinely those in the Australian national interest. The United States have not yet voted on the free trade agreement. They are giving themselves proper time to consider these issues and so should we. Therefore, the second reading amendment moved by the member for Rankin properly expresses some of the issues which need to be considered before we make a final judgment on this matter. I commend that amendment to the House and reject the government's politically motivated attempt to get the legislation through the House and the Senate during the final sitting week of this session.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>31481</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Martyn, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MARTYN EVANS</name><name.id>N36</name.id><electorate>Bonython</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I think it is very important in the initial stages of my remarks this morning to clear up a number of issues which the government has sought to put before the parliament and the public in relation to this very important debate on the <inline ref="R2118">US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Bill 2004 </inline>and the<inline ref="R2118"></inline><inline ref="R2111">US Free Trade Agreement Implementation (Customs Tariff) Bill 2004</inline>. This issue of a free trade agreement with the United States is perhaps one of the most important economic measures which has come before the parliament in recent times. It has received detailed scrutiny in this parliament before the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties and is also receiving ongoing scrutiny in the Senate Select Committee on the Free Trade Agreement between Australia and the United States. As I understand it, the Senate committee is preparing an interim report and a final report, which will be tabled when the House resumes in August, if that is indeed the case. That scrutiny necessarily must be very detailed, given the enormous import of a free trade agreement of this magnitude. </para></talk.start><para>The parliament has undertaken, on behalf of the nation, free trade agreements with a number of other countries. Singapore immediately comes to mind, and the treaties committee undertook scrutiny of that agreement as well, prior to recommending ratification. Of course, the United States also has free trade agreements with a number of other countries.</para><para>Australia also has another free trade agreement—that is, the closer economic relations agreement which we have had with New Zealand for some 20 years. It is very instructive to look back on the history of that agreement at the way that it has developed over two decades. Indeed, it evolved from the frustration which the then trade minister, Doug Anthony, experienced in trying to negotiate a detailed package with the New Zealand government in those days which only dealt with relatively trivial matters of trade: specifications which covered individual items of trade, very small topics, minor adjustments to tariffs—as he would have characterised them 20 years ago—and not worthy of the sweeping kinds of economic reforms which both countries would have had to enter into to make changes which could have a significant impact on both economies and indeed move them both forward.</para><para>The governments of Australia and New Zealand two decades ago were brave enough to enter into an agreement which would set the course of economic reform over the next two decades. I think most people would now agree that the agreement has had a very beneficial impact on reforming the economies of both countries to some degree—improving bilateral trade between our two countries and enhancing economic opportunities for both Australians and New Zealanders, in the context that we have seen that economic relationship expand and improve. That relationship still has a way to go; we have not strengthened it to the degree that we could. There are many opportunities which can still evolve through that relationship. It is a living agreement. We have recently taken on board ways in which therapeutic goods, for example, can be incorporated into that kind of relationship. There is a joint agreement to approve drugs and related therapeutic standards between our two countries which the treaties committee is examining at the moment. There are other areas still in investment and services where the agreement can be expanded.</para><para>People criticised the agreement at the time and raised any number of areas where they felt it would damage the interests of particular groups in both our countries. Those areas have gradually been overcome, and I think most people would now welcome it. The question we now have to turn to when examining this agreement is whether those issues would arise in relation to the Australia-US free trade agreement. I think most members of this House and many people in Australia naturally appreciate that trade is good for a country like Australia. Free trade is better; the freer the trade, the better we are as a world and the better Australia is as an economy. The question is whether our trading partners enter into this on the same basis as we do as a country. Do they also approach this with the same kind of bona fides as Australia? Would nation-states like those in Europe and the EU or a country like America set aside their subsidies, as we have done in the agricultural area, and approach this with the same kind of bona fides as Australia? We must ensure that free trade actually prevails, that there is a reasoned approach to trade so that we can approach this on an equal basis and ensure that, in fact, Australia obtains a good deal out of this free trade deal with the United States. That is the question which the treaties committee sought to answer and which the Senate committee is still considering as we speak. Many of my constituents have that kind of question. It is not an unreasonable question for the Labor Party to seek to address. </para><para>This government has sought to link this issue with the ongoing security relationship with the United States. This is a very bad way to approach public policy. It is very wrong to link trade with security when you are dealing with an ongoing strong relationship, which this country has had with the United States and which everyone I think in this parliament, certainly from the two major political parties, would want to see continue. It was the Labor Party, as I am sure you would acknowledge, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, that established the firm relationship with the United States many decades ago in relation to security. We have always sought to maintain that strong relationship with the United States in security and we will continue to do so. I support that strong alliance in security, and I know my colleagues do as well. We do not link that to trade, and I think it is very bad public policy to seek to do that. I know the United States do not do that; they do not put their friendship on the line in relation to security matters by linking them in Australia's interests with trade. That is not a good way to proceed in this area. We can discuss trade issues with our friends across the Pacific without linking them to our security interests.</para><para>In relation to trade, we approach that as a different question. We say, `Is a trade agreement in our national interest?' The United States does that too. The question is a very reasonable one. In my electorate we have many of the industries which are at stake in this trade agreement, including the motor vehicle industry, the wine industry and many other related areas. People in my electorate—for example, at the Holden plant—very reasonably say, `What will be the outcome of this if we sign up to it?' Domestic legislation of course is critical in these areas. How will this agreement impact on the lives of people in my electorate and on Australians generally? We will not know from reading the treaty itself, which is a very substantial document, because it does not actually go to the way in which this free trade agreement will be implemented in domestic law—that in itself is a very critical component of this. When you read the agreement, you see that most of it deals simply with eliminating tariffs or phasing them out over a period of time—perhaps up to 18 years for the beef industry and a lesser time in other areas and so on. Those things are relatively easy to grasp. In other areas, there are more complex arrangements—for example, with copyright and so on. I will come to those in a minute. In other cases, we simply have to look to domestic law to determine the actual impact on the Australian electorate. That is what the legislation before the House now deals with.</para><para>We cannot assess the totality of the impact of the free trade agreement unless we also go to the domestic law, and that is what the minority report of the treaties committee sought to address. Normally, a treaty can be assessed on the basis of its own impact, on the face of the treaty, so you can determine what the impact on Australia will be. In the case of a complex treaty like this, especially given its terms, we have to understand the domestic law implications as well. That is, of course, what the government have not allowed for in this case. They have not given the Australian people the opportunity to assess the impact of the domestic law—some of which is before us today, but not all.</para><para>In the case of the PBS, for example, the appeal mechanism and the precise terms of that appeal mechanism are absolutely vital in understanding whether there will be an adverse impact on domestic drug prices arising from the treaty itself. The treaty does not determine whether that will be the case. The treaty requires that there be an appeal mechanism. On its face, that is not necessarily adverse. It may be good; it may be bad; but it is not necessarily adverse of itself. In fact, in principle it sounds quite reasonable. But whether the adverse impact will arise is determined by the way in which the government implements that in our domestic arrangements. We have not yet seen that in its terms. The health minister more or less dismissed that as an administrative arrangement. Until the parliament have seen those details, we will not be in a position to determine whether that arrangement will have an adverse impact. </para><para>The PBS is a very significant part of our health arrangements in this country and has a very significant impact on the lives of all of our constituents. In determining the actual national interest outcome of this treaty, until we see the totality of the treaty and the domestic arrangements which this government puts in place, we will not actually know whether this treaty is in the national interest of Australians. It may well be the case that the PBS arrangements are perfectly satisfactory, but we will only know that when we see the totality of the arrangements.</para><para>In respect of the other parts of the treaty dealing with, for example, the copyright and patent law arrangements and the impact on software, including the areas of non-commercial software and open source software, the treaties committee received a lot of evidence, as has the Senate committee. We received a lot of evidence on the impact of copyright law on universities and educational institutions—the extension from 50 years to 70 years. All of these areas will depend a great deal on the ultimate impact of the way in which this is implemented in domestic law. If, for example, we move to an area—as the treaties committee has recommended—of US style `fair use' rather than the more restrictive Australian interpretations, then this would have much less impact on domestic libraries, on educational and academic institutions and on the students who study at those institutions.</para><para>The way in which we implement this in domestic patent law would have much less impact on our open source software industry than it might otherwise under the terms of the treaty itself, depending on the precise terms of the amendments to the Patents Act. The reality is that the exact terms of our domestic law implementation will determine the outcomes for our national interest of the combination of the treaty and domestic law. The treaty might well be totally benign in terms of its impact on those institutions if the totality of the two taken together is properly drafted. That is the outcome we need to assess, which is why the minority report of the treaties committee recommended that we could only draw that final conclusion when we actually saw the two taken together and not just the one on its own.</para><para>If the government does not draft the domestic law properly as a result of the free trade agreement implementation, then of course this could have a very adverse impact. But if the domestic law arrangements are taken properly then I think the treaty could have a favourable impact on our economic situation in this country. Obviously, as someone who has supported an increased trade arrangement and free trade agreement—as many of my colleagues have on both sides of this House—I can see enhanced economic benefits arising from any free trade agreement and particularly one from such a substantial trading nation as the United States. But that will only be the case if the government safeguards the arrangements in this country with a proper domestic law implementation.</para><para>Many people in this country have been concerned about provisions of the treaty which may in fact not be of such concern at all. For example, the NAFTA agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico contains provisions called the investor state provisions, which were of substantial concern to many people in Canada and Mexico because of the way in which those legal provisions have been used against corporations and governments in Canada and Mexico by companies in the United States. Because of the legal arrangements and the rule of law in Australia, while the United States originally lobbied strongly for such a term in the free trade agreement with Australia, the end result was that no such provision was incorporated in the treaty which is now before the parliament. The reality is that that makes a very substantial difference to the kind of treaty we have before us. There is no investor state provision in this treaty, and that really does make quite a difference to the way in which we consider this treaty. Not having an investor state provision does make a real difference to us. If there were an investor state provision in this treaty, I would have a very different view of it. Not having it here is a real difference and should allay some concerns people have. </para><para>I have received a lot of representations during the course of the treaties committee hearings about the lack of travel provisions in this treaty. Other treaties that the United States has recently negotiated have contained provisions which freed up the travel arrangements between those countries and the United States. They may well not be agreed to ultimately by the US Congress, but it is a real gap in our consideration here. If we are to have enhanced trading opportunities with the United States, the government needs to use other measures to ensure that those provisions are negotiated separately and in parallel with this treaty if it is to really move forward. Improving travel rights to the United States, especially in a post 9-11 world, is a very significant means of improving business and communication between our two countries. Without that, the treaty will have far less economic value to our country. There are significant travel barriers now for business and other professional people moving between the two countries—not so for tourists, but certainly for business and professional people—and they need to be addressed separately.</para><para>Mutual recognition of professional qualifications and other trade qualifications is also a significant problem. If you are an Australian lawyer and you have the right to practise in the United States, that will be gained in one state and one state only. If you need to practise in another state, you will have to sit a separate bar admission exam—and again and again in each of the states of the United States. That is an enormous impediment to qualifying to practise in the United States. The same is true in all of the other professions, and that is an enormous barrier to practising in the United States in any of those professional areas. It is an enormous barrier within the United States itself; it does not just apply to foreign applicants like Australians. Indeed, the United States could benefit its own microeconomic reform process by tackling these areas. Far be it from me or Australians to give the United States advice on microeconomic reform, but it would be of enormous benefit were it to tackle this. In terms of mutual recognition, as we have it in the treaty, that would be a significant area for the government to press the United States on.</para><para>I think we need to bear in mind that many Australians feel that the effect on the manufacturing industry, like the motor vehicle manufacturers in my own electorate, will be significant. The lowering of tariff barriers in this area does have an impact on people's lives. When these motor vehicle tariff areas are adjusted, the government needs to take into account that the United States, while it still has agricultural subsidies, also has a number of those in relation to the manufacturing industry. It has significant support structures for the manufacturing industry in the United States which, while not being subsidies, are certainly support structures for research and development. It has contracts with defence industries which provide significant support for manufacturing through the defence contracting support structures. So there are hidden subsidies in the United States which do not go directly to the manufacturing industry by way of support but are indirect support structures. Those need to be taken into account. </para><para>When assessing this treaty, I do not think we should jump to a government imposed, election-viewed deadline to this. It is an important treaty, one which could have significant benefits for Australia but which can only be taken into account as part of our national interest when we look at the whole of the treaty and the domestic underpinning legislation. So let us not do this in a rush; let us not do it overnight. Let us do it in a proper and mature and reflective way when we have all of the evidence to hand. That will be here in early August. Let us do it in a proper and mature way when we know whether or not it is in the national interest. Only then can we decide what the outcome ought to be.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ruddock</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>31486</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Procedure Committee</title><page.no>31486</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>31486</page.no><name role="metadata">Abbott, Tony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ABBOTT</name><name.id>EZ5</name.id><electorate>Warringah</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Leader of the House</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the revised standing orders presented by the Procedure Committee on 24 November 2003 be adopted and come into effect on the first day of sitting of the 41st Parliament.</para></motion><para>The last major revision to the standing orders of this House of Representatives took place back in 1963. The Procedure Committee has been working on revised standing orders since November 2002, along with the clerks. They have now completed that work, and it is presented to the parliament for approval. The standing orders have been renumbered, reordered and rewritten—not to alter their meaning but to make them clearer and more intelligible. It is of course a unanimous recommendation of the Procedure Committee that these new standing orders be adopted by the House. It is appropriate that the new standing orders begin from the commencement of a new parliament. </para><para>I would like to thank the Procedure Committee for their work on this important subject. I would also like to thank the clerks for their excellent work on this important subject.

As a member of the Procedure Committee, may I say that it is good to see that the chairperson of the committee, the honourable member for McPherson, is in the House, as well as Claressa Surtees, who did all the hard yards in preparing the original draft. I would also like to acknowledge the work of other committee members: particularly on my side, please forgive me if I mention the honourable member for Batman, who devoted considerable time to the committee; and the member for Calwell, who, although a new member of the House, in terms of these standing orders made contributions that indicated she punched well and truly beyond her weight.</para></talk.start><para>As the Leader of the House has said, a lot of obsolete and arcane terms have been removed from the standing orders and the language has been modernised. For all honourable members, there has been a real attempt to make sure that you can actually find an appropriate standing order by looking at the index without having to have a PhD on standing orders. So it will be a lot more user friendly, not only for all honourable members but perhaps even for members of the public if they are of a mind to read such a document. </para><para>I need to thank the Leader of the House, because procedure committees in 1903, 1905, 1937, 1943 and 1949 presented revised drafts which were never implemented; so, although it has taken 40 years to resize these standing orders, it is good that in the 41st parliament we will be having a fresh or a more appropriate set of standing orders.</para><para>I say for my own part that I certainly believe some of the standing orders need contemporary revision to restore some fairness into the operations of the House—I call to mind some relating to questions and answers—but this was beyond the remit of the Procedure Committee at the time. Hopefully, there may be a future opportunity to look at the standing orders and see whether or not some standing orders need to be changed or added to, to facilitate the procedures.</para><para>I also acknowledge that we have the Manager of Opposition Business present, who has always been supportive of the work of the Procedure Committee and has been able to find time to participate in round conferences in order that we were able to ascertain her views on those occasions. The leader has also done so quite generously. Last but not least, and I do not want to push my luck on matters in relation to the Leader of the House, I wonder whether he might be able to indicate when government responses might be made on arrangements for second reading speeches, which is something that seemed to attract a degree of unanimous support; perhaps also on the report <inline font-style="italic">House estimates: consideration of the annual estimates by the House of Representatives</inline>, which would improve the working of the budget session. That would not only help members but would also be more efficient in terms of the government dealing with the budget. I commend these significant changes. I hope that members of the 41st parliament will find using the standing orders and trying to find the standing orders much easier tasks than they have been in the past.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>31487</page.no><name role="metadata">May, Margaret, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs MAY</name><name.id>83B</name.id><electorate>McPherson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Following the comments of the Deputy Chair of the Procedure Committee, I would also like to support the motion on the adoption of the revised standing orders, as presented by the Leader of the House today. The committee undertook an enormous job. I am delighted to see in the House Claressa Surtees, who was very much part of the revision of the standing orders. I would also like to pay tribute to the members of the committee from my own side: the members for Mackellar, for Kalgoorlie and for Wentworth. The revision of the standing orders was a huge undertaking and all members were very committed to the process. It took a lot of time, and I think that along the way all of us learnt a little bit about our history and exactly what is in our standing orders. I thank the deputy chair for his support throughout the whole process. I think we all agree that it was a big process. I thank both the Leader of the House and the Manager of Opposition Business for their support in adopting these revised standing orders.</para></talk.start><para>As the member for Chifley has already indicated, there has been no revision of the standing orders since 1963, so all of us involved in the rewriting of the standing orders can be very proud of the part we have played. It is always a great sense of achievement when you see the adoption of a report that you have brought before the House. We all believe that the revision of the standing orders is going to make it a lot simpler for members of the House, particularly in the next parliament, with the new members coming in, to understand the standing orders and how they relate to the parliament. When we went through them we were lost on some of the meanings of the standing orders, and we certainly had some great debates about what those standing orders meant, so I think members will find them a lot more user-friendly. They will make more sense to the workings of the parliament. I say to the new members coming in, and even to the present members who are very familiar with what we have in front of us, that I think they will find the revised standing orders a lot more user-friendly. I thank everybody who was involved: my committee, the Leader of the House and the Manager of Opposition Business.

These are very important bills for Australia to consider. Also, the Australia-United States free trade agreement is very important for Australia to consider, because it is probably the most significant trade deal that this country has ever embarked on. Therefore, I believe very strongly that we should be very considerate, we should examine the issues very closely and we should take all the time necessary that we have available to us to make the right decision in Australia's national interest.</para></talk.start><para>Australia has always been a trading nation. Ever since our birth, as it were, we have been a country that has relied not so much on what we do, in terms of local jobs, but on what we manufacture and what we can export. Our real strength is in export markets in such things as the sheep trade, the beef and cattle trades, coal, mining, manufactured goods, our media, our intellectual property, our skills, our education—there is a whole range of industry areas where Australia is a world leader and a world trader. Whether or not we have this agreement does not necessarily impact on those industries as to whether we continue to trade. We are an export nation; we always have been and we always will be. </para><para>The concept of a free trade agreement is a good one—the concept that countries that sign up to a free trade agreement would be able, in a bilateral sense, to remove trade barriers between them and put in place incentives for that free trade to take place. On an initial reading of this free trade agreement, it is very complicated. There is an inordinate amount of material. If someone were to go to this and have look at it, they would just be stunned at the amount of pages that are contained in it. You get different numbers of pages depending on which version you look at, but it is either 600 or 900 pages—and some people tell me it is over 1,000. I have looked at cut-down versions of it, but it is certainly a lot. That in itself worries me, because it tells me that there is a lot of complexity within the agreement—a lot of complexity, a lot of bureaucracy and a lot of rules as to how it operates. We could imagine that a genuine free trade agreement would be slightly simpler. It would have rules that benefit both sides and it would have easily used and accessed dispute resolution mechanisms. So that, for me, is a point of concern.</para><para>A free trade agreement in itself—or a trade agreement, I believe, in this case—is neither revolutionary nor should it be nonbeneficial. There is no doubt that there can be some benefits to Australia's economy and possibly some downsides as well, and there should be the same consideration for American industry as well.</para><para>I want to highlight a number of issues about how we got to today and the rushed process that is being put forward by the government and by the Prime Minister. Currently, in the United States, their own processes for determining whether they will approve this agreement are continuing, but no decision has been made. Our processes here are continuing. The government have already made it clear that, regardless of the outcomes, regardless of what the Senate select committee says, regardless of anything, they had already decided from day one that, after they had finished negotiating, it was a done deal. It is only the US that really get to review this properly—only the United States that really get to examine it closely.</para><para>The government tells us here that, if we try to examine this closely or get some time to look at it in depth—and it is complicated, and we should be given the time—somehow, by us wanting to do that, just as the US Congress is doing, we are anti-American. And, by virtue of that, somehow we are anti-Australian. I find it a bizarre concept that somehow wanting the best deal that we could possibly get in the national interests of Australia would be either (a) anti-American or (b) anti-Australian. But this is the sort of pressure that we are getting from the government and from the Prime Minister about this legislation and this trade agreement.</para><para>In Australia, we have a Senate Select Committee on the Free Trade Agreement between Australia and the United States of America, where we have received over 500 submissions outlining different views for and against the free trade agreement. Those hearings continue. An interim report is to be delivered today, and there will be a final report delivered on 12 August. The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties also released its report last night. The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties report came back with a view that we should approve the free trade agreement between our two countries, but that we should do that in the light of some concerns and some amendments that would be put in place.</para><para>There have been a number of people—including academics and economic modellers—and different organisations that have done some studies as to the benefits of having a free trade agreement. At the end of the day, if it is just a bit of paper that does not deliver anything, there is not much point in having it. The idea is that it delivers a benefit for Australia and it also delivers a benefit for the United States. There were claims early on by the government—which they have quickly backed away from now—which alleged that there would be a $4 billion a year benefit derived from the agreement. That was work done by the Centre for International Economics. That made a whole heap of assumptions which now have been discredited, and of course it is no longer the case that there will be a $4 billion a year benefit. Those areas were of course sugar and agriculture. It did not take into account looking at the US investment in the film industry, which was lifted from $50 million to $800 million—sorry, foreign investment restrictions—and a whole range of other areas. </para><para>There have been other studies which have looked at the benefit and at how much that would actually be for Australia. Other studies have said that the benefit would be in the order of just over $1 billion per annum in 20 years time, which obviously would still be a benefit, albeit very small. There are other figures by Dr Philippa Dee, a consultant employed by the Senate committee, who has assessed the FTA on the basis of more reasonable assumptions and using a model which is better equipped to assess the full impact. When taking into account a whole range of factors, she assessed that there would be a net benefit to Australia of only $53 million per year after 10 years—again, a very small benefit, although nonetheless a benefit. If you use more generous assumptions, she raises that level to $359 million per year after 10 years, which of course is significantly less than another assessment made by the Centre for International Economics, which revised its model—using the G-cubed model—to $6.1 billion.</para><para>So there is a lot of conjecture as to how much net benefit there will be for Australia. The Australian Manufacturing Workers Union commissioned an assessment by the National Institute of Economic and Industry Research as well. They came up with a net loss. They expected a net loss of around $46.9 million in net present value terms to 2025, as well as a net loss of jobs—mostly in the manufacturing sector—of 57,700 per annum. So there are those who say there will be a minor net benefit, others who say there will be a larger net benefit and others who say that there will actually be no net benefit; in fact there will be losses in jobs and economic loss as well.</para><para>I am of the view that we should trade with the US, and we currently do. We do have a robust trade between our two countries. We should look at a free trade agreement that is beneficial to both countries and particularly beneficial to Australia's national interest. If there are parts in this free trade agreement which are unworkable or are of concern—and there are many and I will outline those in a minute—we should go and look at those and either renegotiate them or make amendments to the agreement and make the agreement conditional on those things being done. I think there is an imperative to do that. I do not accept what government members say—that this is a wondrous, magical deal that will reap great benefits for Australia. I am yet to see that evidence put forward. In principle I do support a trade agreement, as I think everybody in the end would. If you are offered a trade agreement or deal, as long as it is a good one, you would take it. But if we are giving away too many things in that deal that are not of benefit to us, we should have a closer look and make the appropriate amendments. </para><para>In doing a bit of research on this subject, I decided I would have a look not so much at what we are saying here in Australia but at what US congressmen and senators are saying about this agreement and what they feel it will do for their own country. While a number of people are in favour of the agreement in the United States, there are also a number of people in their legislature against it as well. I will mention a few of these people for the record. Congresswoman Jennifer Dunn, who is a Republican, advocated a US acceptance of the free trade agreement on the grounds that more than 99 per cent of US manufactured goods will become duty-free immediately, once the agreement is passed. That means that 99 per cent of US manufactured goods coming to Australia would be duty-free. She also stated that US manufactured goods account for 93 per cent of US exports to Australia. In effect, that manufacturing sector part of the Australia-US free trade agreement is the largest part in terms of jobs and the economy. It is obviously a very good deal for the United States because 93 per cent of their exports to Australia are actually manufacturing based, and hence it is where concerns lie for our own manufacturing industries here in Australia.</para><para>Congressman Adam Smith talked about the trade agreement certainly helping the US economy and benefiting Washington's manufacturing employees and ports—and, again, for the same reasons. Congressman Wally Herger, who is a Republican, supported it on the grounds that there would be a trade surplus of $6.6 billion to the United States. So they would have the surplus, not us. He also said that the agreement provided significant benefits for US businesses and employees, as well as US consumers. Again, he talked on the same issues that relate to manufacturing.</para><para>Congressman Howard Berman talked basically on the same grounds, except he touched on the entertainment industry, which is one that I have concerns about here. Currently in Australia about 72 per cent of all television is United States based or sourced. This agreement would open up that market to basically unlimited content on our own television here. And it is not just television; it is radio, print, digital media and new media, which we do not yet know what they are. That particularly concerns me. While Australia is very innovative and we have some wonderful programming here, the sheer ease of just using pre-plugged, pre-programmed shows from the United States makes it too easy for our networks, if they are not restricted, to use. I would hate to see us go from 70 per cent of content to 90 per cent or more of content. That concerns me, and it is something that we need to deal with. These congressmen are supporting the agreement because it will give them huge access to our markets and a huge increase in their own ability to get into our markets.</para><para>On the other side of the ledger, those who oppose the free trade agreement do so because it is not good enough and they do not get enough access to Australia's Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. That is a real problem for all of us in this place. We want to protect our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. We want to make sure that it is a sound scheme that we control. We want to make sure that we determine what drugs go on the list and the prices of those drugs and that the parliament of Australia sets the bounds for, and the prices under, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Those who oppose it say that it is not strong enough for the United States because they cannot get into our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme market.</para><para>There were complaints from other congressmen. Congressman Mike Simpson complained about the sugar industry. Initially, he would not support the agreement. After a huge lobbying effort in the United States, they would not accept under any circumstances any negotiation on sugar. They made it very clear to their negotiators not to come back to them with an agreement that had sugar in it from Australia. They got their wish 100 per cent. Unfortunately for Australia's sugar industry—and this is a major concern particularly in Queensland—we got zero access to sugar. There was no sugar in this deal at all, and that is extremely disappointing. In this agricultural area, Australia could have competed well with the US and could have had access to a good market. Our sugarcane farmers and all our agricultural farmers and industry in Australia worked very hard and were very competitive, but they came across very unfair tariffs and barriers to trade internationally. This would have been a major part of any free trade agreement. If it were a free trade agreement, you would have thought that was a key factor. </para><para>The other issue, of course, is beef. There were concerns in the United States about beef—that Australia was too good a beef producer and that this would affect their industries. So beef also had to be cut out. The best they got was that the beef lead-in was 18 years, so they have an 18-year window. So it is a really long time and many elections away before we see any benefit at all from beef. That is a view of what is happening in the United States. I read this morning that there has been a bit of a stumbling block in the negotiation in the US Congress. A very powerful US Senate committee has knocked it on the head. They disapproved it. They wanted even more control than the current 18-year lead-in time for beef import provisions. The senate finance committee voted 11 to 10 to recommend that the Bush administration change its implementing legislation for the US-Australia free trade agreement, to make it harder for US trade officials to waive a special beef import safeguard that would take effect in the ninth year of the pact.</para><para>So the US Senate committee want to make it even harder; I personally cannot accept that. I think it is already hard enough that we have to wait nine years before the provisions even kick in and 18 years before we see any benefit. Now they are saying that that is not even far enough out and it should be maybe 25 years. Again, I await the outcomes of this committee's negative response in the United States to the free trade agreement. If we cannot even get the beef lead-in times that are currently in the agreement, there is not much more left in that agreement.</para><para>In the short time that I have left I want to raise just a couple of other issues more broadly, such as television; television broadcast and media, which is of concern; the PBS and our own right to determine how the PBS works; and the delay and lead times that are afforded to generic drugs in this country. The cost of drugs in Australia is significantly lower than in the United States. What concerns me is that there would need to be a parity or harmonisation between the cost of drugs here and the cost in the United States. That would be a net disaster to this country and I would be very concerned about that.</para><para>The problem with this trade agreement is that some of the impacts and effects will not be seen for many years down the track. Basically, you sign it now and the lead times and other things that happen mean that those involved who negotiate the deal today may not be around or will not be in any position of influence to make any changes further down the track. There is certainly no room for renegotiation.</para><para>Television broadcasting is an area that really does concern me. An image that sticks in my mind is that of my two little girls, aged five and six. Whenever they are at home and they decide that they are going to pretend they are doing something and role-play, they do it with an American accent. I find that a bit funny. It is humorous and a lovely thing that they are play-acting and doing those things, but it also worries me. With the way that the current content of American television affects our culture and identity, it will not just be role-play. It will be a bit more significant than just role-play and more significant than just two little girls playing games in the backyard. That really does worry me. </para><para>I think what we need to do is look very carefully at this agreement. We need to go through the full process here in this House and not just have it rubber-stamped through this parliament, as is being done by the government. Why is the government so determined not to examine this? Why is the federal government so determined that it is okay for the United States Congress and Senate to examine it in-depth and reject certain parts that they do not like, but not for us? If it is anti-American for us to examine this, is it anti-Australian for Americans to also do the same thing? I do not think so.</para><para>I think this agreement and the rushed status that it has in this House today just highlights once more the politicking that goes on from the government and the rush to get this in and try to wedge the Labor Party on a critical issue for Australia's national interest, but only in the interest of their re-election. They are not so concerned about what is in this agreement. It is not about the agreement or what it delivers; it is about whether they can get through an election. That disturbs me even more than some of the parts that are contained in the Australia-US free trade agreement.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>31493</page.no><name role="metadata">Andren, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDREN</name><name.id>KL6</name.id><electorate>Calare</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Amongst all of the debate over the US-Australia free trade agreement, it is enlightening to go to the `Trade facts' page of the Office of the United States Trade Representative. In detail, in the `Expanding US manufacturing' sector, the site boasts:</para></talk.start><quote><para>More than 99 percent of U.S. exports of manufactured goods to Australia will become duty-free <inline font-style="italic">immediately </inline>...</para></quote><para>The site says:</para><quote><para>This is the most significant immediate reduction of industrial tariffs ever achieved in a U.S. free trade agreement, and will provide immediate benefits for America's manufacturing workers and companies.</para></quote><para>This begs the question: will it provide immediate benefits to Australia's manufacturing workers and companies? Based on what I have read in the plethora of information about this deal, I think not. In that I am supported by none other than one of this country's most conservative economists, Alan Wood, whose column in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian </inline>on 9 March is very revealing. Wood says that the government's refusal to seek a Productivity Commission assessment of the deal `is an admission the government wants a quick and dirty job'. Wood also said that his inquiries revealed serious reservations in DFAT about the agreement.</para><para>At the very least, members need to review in full the 300-page report and recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties inquiry. The `tabling yesterday, voting today' program of the government is blatantly politically motivated. I will certainly not be supporting the legislation at this point. It should be remembered that the Senate Select Committee on the Free Trade Agreement between Australia and the United States of America is not due to report until 12 August and that report should also be considered before this parliament commits itself to the agreement.</para><para>While the opposition seems inclined to approve this legislation, you would have to wonder why after listening to the dissenting report delivered by the member for Swan, especially as he highlighted Professor Ross Garnaut's evidence that the Centre for International Economics projection of a $6 billion GDP bonus from the agreement does not `pass the laughter test'. I thoroughly support the dissenting report's recommendation that binding treaty action should not be taken until adequate opportunity has been given to consider the necessary legislative, regulatory and administrative actions that underpin the implementation of the treaty. That is the most basic of requirements. How long did it take to lobby and then negotiate this deal: two or perhaps three years. How much time do we have to consider the report and the legislation and then vote: 24 hours. </para><para>Among information presented to the Senate select committee was the very detailed submission by Dr Philippa Dee from the Asia Pacific School of Economics and Government at the Australian National University. I present some of her observations in no particular order of importance. Firstly, under preferential tariff cuts, most of the tariff revenue goes not to Australian consumers but to US producers to make up for their higher production costs. Secondly, it is likely that many Australian products in the categories of textiles and other machinery and equipment could have difficulties meeting the rules of origin and thus being eligible for preferential tariff treatment, especially when they are assembled from components sourced in East Asia. It is interesting to note that the Singapore-US free trade agreement allows a concession of up to nine years on the application of the rules of origin for apparel.</para><para>Thirdly, there is a high cost of proving compliance with the rules of origin, especially for small and medium sized businesses. Fourthly, the DFAT-CIE study has assessed that only 8.8 per cent of Australian exports of textiles and clothing will meet the yarn forward rule. Fifthly, on government procurement, Dr Dee contradicts the DFAT-CIE assessment that Australia could achieve as much as 30 per cent of Canada's market penetration to government procurement contracts. She says empirical studies that correct for country size and distance between countries suggest the figure is more likely four per cent. On intellectual property rights, Dee suggests the changes in copyright payments will be $88 million per year to Australia. Indeed another study from academics at Macquarie University, the University of Sydney and the University of New South Wales says our negotiators have agreed to abandon any `buy Australian' clauses or conditionalities, `and these are totally unreciprocated by the US side'.</para><para>According to Dr Dee, based on the alternative assessment to that provided for the government, the annual gains to Australia from the AUSFTA are a mere $58 million. She concludes:</para><quote><para>On a strict cost-benefit calculation, the agreement is of marginal benefit to Australia, and possibly of negative benefit given some of the pernicious but unquantifiable elements in the intellectual property chapter. Australia will continue to be subject to US bilateral opportunism, whether or not it signs AUSFTA, unless it can persuade the United States and all its future bilateral partners to multilateralise all future concessions, not just those in services and investment.</para></quote><para>That is one assessment of the agreement. While Dr Dee makes comment on the fact Australia has received less than other US bilateral partners on agriculture, let me quote from the NSW Farmers Association press release of 9 February. It says:</para><quote><para>The outcome of Australia's trade negotiations with the US will bring some benefits to our agricultural industries, but it is ultimately a victory for the powerful US farm lobby.</para><para>Even though our beef producers will achieve some market access gains, with the 378,000 tonne quota rising by 18.5 per cent over 18 years, it is disappointing to see such a huge phase-in period.   </para><para>“The US has no justification for blocking Australian farmers from unimpeded access into their market and Australian farmers will remember this moment for a long time,” said president Mal Peters.</para></quote><para>The previous speaker, the member for Oxley, alluded to moves in Congress to even further toughen this access regime, which begs the question: why won't The Nationals come in here and justify why they are lending their support to that part of the deal at this stage, a deal that means little or nothing to most farmers, as far as I can see, whose sons might enjoy some benefit, but who in the short term have got the short straw?</para><para>Mr Peters, the NSW Farmers Association President, should have also included pork and apple growers in his assessment, for these producers are seeing the current erosion of our Biosecurity standards in order to facilitate the entry of pork and, inevitably, fruit under this agreement. Less than two weeks after the Prime Minister and President Bush announced their intention to pursue a free trade agreement, three reports from Biosecurity Australia were released recommending imports of pork, bananas and apples. All these reports reversed previous positions that consistently banned imports due to quarantine concerns that legitimately protected our clean and green products.</para><para>Not long afterwards, the US trade facts briefing paper proudly boasted that the trade agreement offered new opportunities for US farm exporters saying, `Food inspection procedures that have posed barriers in the past will be addressed, benefiting sectors such as pork, citrus, apples and stone fruit.' The US obviously know something my apple growers do not know yet relating to the fire blight decision, which has yet to be announced by the government. Is this coincidence? I think not. Now we have the spectre of fruit from fire blight affected North America allowed into Australia, picked by cheap labour from Mexico to unfairly compete with apple growers in my electorate who are already being exploited by supermarket chains and a corrupt paddock-to-plate supply chain—all of this in the best interests of the consumer.</para><para>To compete, our growers will have to find cheap labour too, and it is already happening in the horticulture sector with picking and pruning teams made up of temporary visa holders paid about half the going rate. <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> economics writer Ross Gittens said on 11 February:</para><quote><para>The main thing we wanted from the Americans was exemptions from the huge protection they give their farmers. As everyone knows, they didn't give us much.</para></quote><para>In fact Phillippa Dee points out that `Australia has achieved less than others' and less than other trading partners have in bilateral negotiations with the US.</para><para>Linda Weiss, Elizabeth Thurbon and John Mathews, three academics from the University of Sydney, the University of New South Wales and Macquarie University, say that under this agreement Australia is `voluntarily abandoning its long-established independent quarantine procedures. The deal stipulates the creation of a new oversight committee—including US trade representatives—to monitor Australia's science-based quarantine decisions.' Weiss, Thurbon and Mathews go on: “In effect we are about to downgrade the scientific rigour of risk assessment in favour of trade politics.”</para><para>We have a marketplace here already in which many horticulturists can barely survive. Why throw out our biosecurity and labour standards to allow more unfair competition? We have already created unfair competition with our very own internal free trade agreements between the big supermarkets, processors and the government. We may have finally got around to addressing some of that with the collective bargaining legislation introduced into the parliament yesterday after a lot of pressure over quite some years from, among others, orchardists in my electorate, but there is a long way to go before that is tested in the marketplace. One of the weaknesses of collective bargaining will be that it is as strong as its weakest point. How often do we see growers in Batlow, for example, forced to take the price on offer when they have tried to hang together in the face of the price being offered? It is a start, but it is a long way from overcoming the problem. </para><para>While claiming to be concerned about aspects of competition policy and weaknesses in the Trade Practices Act relating to small producers, the alternative Labor government is nevertheless making it clear at this point that it will sign off on this FTA. That is the feeling I am getting, despite all the huffing and puffing of the opposition leader.</para><para>According to the Australian Conservation Foundation, on environmental issues, article 11.7 of the agreement will `fetter the capacity of future Australian governments to legislate to protect the environment or act on other matters that become important to Australia's economic and social welfare'. The ACF says that, under AUSFTA, compensation might well be paid to US investors where, for example, an amendment is made to a state planning scheme designed to protect sensitive coastal areas from development, which prohibits a US property owner from developing a coastal property.</para><para>Another area of concern is the inevitable higher cost of medicines, with the review of decisions of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, despite the assurances of the minister. The free trade agreement changes the process to allow drug companies to seek review of PBAC decisions. As the Bathurst branch of the Combined Pensioners and Superannuants Association pointed out in a submission to the Senate inquiry, the people of Australia were given a guarantee by the present government that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme would not be on the negotiating table. It might not be quite in the middle of the table, but it is certainly in the top drawer.</para><para>Pensioners might ask whether the Labor Party rollover on prescription charges is recognition of the inevitability of further increases in the wake of the FTA. Currently the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee only lists new drugs for subsidy if they offer real health benefits and value for money. The giant US drug companies want higher wholesale prices and will apply plenty of pressure to ensure that happens. I am aware of arguments from Medicines Australia—notably, from the eminent cancer researcher, John Zalcberg—that the FTA will make drugs more readily available, but most consumers are not convinced that we should risk any tampering with a process that has ensured the most rigorous proof of the efficacy of a drug before it is listed. There is real concern that that protocol is under threat with this agreement. Perhaps we do need to review the PBAC process, as Dr Zalcberg recommends, but the FTA need not be the catalyst or the leverage for such a review.</para><para>I must reflect the concerns from the entertainment and media community at the restrictions in this agreement on Australian content rules for new media. The government would argue that it has protected local content, but it has set existing content at existing levels which, if reduced in the future, cannot be restored. Free-to-air radio broadcasting, the most popular of media in disseminating talk and ideas—and arguably our most important national identity medium—has Australian content capped at 25 per cent. I have seen no counterargument from the minister to the contention of the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance that new media such as e-cinema and others are set to be dominated by programming from Hollywood. </para><para>Let me return to <inline font-style="italic">Trade Facts</inline> on the web site of the US Trade Representative. It brags that all US investment in new business is exempted from screening by Australia's `Foreign Investment Promotion Board'. That is a very Freudian slip. It should be the Foreign Investment Review Board. What a beautiful irony, and how fitting it is that the US Trade Representative should see it as a promotion board for US investment, because that is exactly what this agreement seems to achieve: promote US investment at the expense of Australia. The US Trade Representative web site goes on to spell it out. It says:</para><quote><para>Thresholds for acquisitions by US investors in nearly all sectors are raised significantly, from $A50 million to $A800 million. This higher threshold would have exempted nearly 90 per cent of US investment transactions from screening over the past three years.</para></quote><para>Is this what the Australian people want from this deal? I am not sure that it is. Yet it is boasted about on this site as a plus for US investors. Whether it is US, French or Chinese investment, Australians want our investment reviews to remain. I would suggest that the majority of Australians would still strongly argue for a maximum of 49 per cent foreign ownership, but those days are long gone. Telstra remains one entity that is firmly in the sights of overseas investors and, no doubt, American investors. Not only will there be increasing pressure to privatise, there will surely be inexorable moves towards greater foreign shareholding. I would urge ordinary Australians to visit the US Trade Representative site at www.ustr.gov.</para><para>I am asked: why would Australia risk so much? The alleged $6 billion worth of benefits claimed by the government just do not seem to be there, so why would we do it? Unless there is some agenda to lock us into an American alliance—both security and economic—then I cannot see a lot of good or any sense in it. I cannot see a lot of sense in it unless there is a belief that the world is developing into three great economic blocs—the EU, Asia and America. The government may believe this is our only course—to be integrated primarily into the American economy. If decisions on supporting pre-emptive military action are any guide, we have already taken that move and made our choice. That is the only logic I can see for such a deal that seems, from all I have read, to be so one-way.</para><para>My electorate has been seriously impacted by the loss of employment under the free trade agenda in recent years. Jobs at Berlei were exported to Indonesia, and there was no benefit to anyone except the Berlei shareholders. Australian defence industry jobs were lost, with orders being sourced overseas. Email—and now Electrolux—jobs are to go as refrigeration manufacture is moved offshore to China and Thailand, with cheaper product coming back into this country. Orchardists and pork producers will be left with not even the protection of our quarantine standards, which stood unchallenged for many years. I could go on.</para><para>There are many aspects of this free trade agreement that need scrutiny far beyond this truncated debate. It is vital to point out that Australians have no process available to them to change the draft text. Unlike the US Congress, which has a vote on any agreement in total, this parliament can only debate certain enabling legislation, as we are doing here, whatever title it is dressed up in. The final decision on signing off rests with the Prime Minister and the cabinet. I had intended to move a second reading amendment but, because of procedural difficulties—because of the opposition's amendment—that is not possible. I would have moved: `That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: the House is of the opinion that the Bill should not proceed until legislation has been enacted that will ensure that the Commonwealth Parliament has a defining role in approving or amending international trade agreements, such as the proposed Australia/United States Free Trade Agreement.' </para><para>I am confident that the people of my electorate have as many doubts as I do about this deal. It has been presented as a major dual-carriageway freeway, when it is really a one-way street, headed our way, with only a footpath in the other direction. It seems to most farmers in my electorate—quite apart from the manufacturers—that the US gets to eat the cake and we are left with the crumbs. It is not good enough, it is not fair enough and it is not free enough. I cannot support it as it stands.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>31498</page.no><name role="metadata">Organ, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ORGAN</name><name.id>BNL</name.id><electorate>Cunningham</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Well, here we are again, confronted with complex legislation which has been introduced in haste and which the government expects to be debated forthwith. This government continues to mock the democratic process by trying to ram legislation through this parliament with the minimum of scrutiny. I remember the last time this happened, with the Greater Sunrise Unitisation Agreement Implementation Bill 2004—and look at the hornet's nest that stirred up with East Timor. Now here we are again with the <inline ref="R2118">US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2111">US Free Trade Agreement Implementation (Customs Tariff) Bill 2004</inline>.</para></talk.start><para>There is one sitting day—perhaps two—left to us before the five-week winter break, and the government decides, in its infinite wisdom, that it is a good idea to introduce this legislation in what could be the dying days of this parliament. We are still waiting for one of the parliamentary committee reports, for goodness sake! Another was tabled only yesterday morning, half an hour before this legislation was introduced. What an affront to the democratic process, and what a slap in the face to the Australian people! What motive could the government possibly have for this unseemly haste, unless it is trying another wedge move on the opposition?</para><para>And what on earth are the opposition doing in agreeing not to oppose this legislation? Didn't the AMWU reps come around and see them on Tuesday? They certainly came to see me, and the National Institute of Economic and Industry Research report which they brought with them should have set alarm bells ringing in the Labor Party. That report says the free trade agreement will make us $47 billion worse off. That is a very long way indeed from the prediction in the government-commissioned report produced by the Centre for International Economics of a $52.5 billion boost, a prediction which previous opposition speakers have reminded us was summed up by Professor Ross Garnaut's devastating put-down that it fails the `laugh test'.</para><para>I am not an economist; I am a geologist who worked in a university library before the people of Cunningham put me in this place as their representative. But even I can see that what we are being told about the benefits of this agreement cannot be true. Look at the dichotomy between the views of the Minister for Trade and those of his US counterpart, Special Trade Representative Robert Zoellick. Our bloke says we will be way better off under the FTA, and theirs says the same about the US. Those positions cannot exist at the same time; they are mutually contradictory.</para><para>Let us look at the `real deal', as Dr Elizabeth Thurbon and Professor Linda Weiss have dubbed it. They say the government is only telling half the story—and here is why. Let us look at agriculture first. The government says: </para><quote><para>The AUSFTA will give Australian agriculture a significant boost in the US market.</para></quote><para>But here is the real deal. Under the deal, we have agreed to completely open our market to all US agricultural exports, removing all tariffs, quotas, seasonal restrictions and subsidies from day one. But the US is allowed to keep many of its tariffs, quotas, seasonal restrictions and enormous subsidies in place. This is not free and it is not fair. The government says:</para><para>	Two thirds of all agricultural tariffs—including in important commodities such as lamb, sheep meat and horticultural products, will be eliminated immediately</para><para>	a further 9 per cent of tariffs will be cut to zero within four years.</para><para>But here is the real deal. Some tariffs might come down—but not for our most competitive exports. Tariffs remain in place for key sectors like wool, for 10 years; wine, for 11 years; steel; and beef, dairy, horticulture and cotton, for 18 years. Also, if our exports to the US rise too quickly or our prices are too competitive against the exchange rate, the US can slap its tariffs back on, no questions asked.</para><para>While Canberra chime, `We've got new market access for X, Y and Z,' they do not tell you about seasonal restrictions. Under the deal, our avocado producers are allowed to sell to the US for the first time. But the catch is that we are not allowed to sell to the US during our peak production time. It is the same story for citrus. No such barriers will remain at this end. It is not free; it is not fair. The government claims:</para><quote><para>The AUSFTA provides greater access to the US market for two of Australia's key agricultural export industries, beef and dairy.</para></quote><para>But the real deal is that our beef and dairy producers have to wait almost a generation—18 years—for the elimination of US quotas and tariffs. This is longer than any developing country has ever been given by the World Trade Organisation, the WTO, to prepare for competition. As for dairy, US farmers only agreed to let us in because we will not be competing directly with US producers—that is, we will be selling certain kinds of cheese that will displace European imports, not US products.</para><para>Australia's sugar access remains unchanged at 87,000 tonnes per annum. Our sugar producers got nothing from the deal, even though the government promised it would not sign a deal that locked sugar out. Now we will spend millions of dollars closing down our sugar industry. This is a loss for Australia, not a gain. And the government says:</para><quote><para>Australia's quarantine and food safety regimes, which ensure our health and our environment are protected, are not affected by the Agreement.</para></quote><para>But the facts are that under the deal we have agreed to let US trade representatives sit on the bodies that determine our quarantine standards. This will expose our quarantine regulators to even more pressure to compromise science based risk assessment, placing animal, plant and human health at risk. We do not have a good track record of resisting the persistent US pressure to relax our stringent quarantine standards. Last year, we started importing Californian table grapes following 10 years of relentless pressure, even though the grapes are infested with diseases that could ruin not only our grape and wine industries but also our mango and avocado orchards and eucalyptus forests. But do not worry: we are decontaminating the grapes with methyl bromide, a known carcinogen that is one of the most toxic chemicals known to humans and that will be banned in the US from next year—except for spraying export produce. In response to US pressure, we have also relaxed our quarantine protocols to allow in pest- and disease-affected pork, poultry, apples, citrus, stone fruit and pears. So much for agriculture; what about manufacturing? The government says: </para><quote><para>Duties on more than 97 per cent of US non-agricultural tariff lines (excluding textiles and clothing), worth $6.48 billion in 2003, will be duty free from day one of the Agreement.</para></quote><para>And here's the real deal: manufacturing tariffs between Australia and the US are already very low, except in a few key areas. In the few areas where tariffs do exist in the US, many will remain. For example, we will still be prohibited from selling our world-class, highly competitive fast ferries to the US. But, again, the US gets 99 per cent access to our market, no questions asked. The US enjoys a huge trade surplus with Australia in manufactured goods and calculates a further $US2 billion in its favour as a result of the deal. The government says:</para><quote><para>... tariffs on textiles, some footwear and a handful of other items will be phased out, with all trade in goods free of duty by 2015.</para></quote><para>But in place of tariffs, we will have to comply with complex rules of origin. Rules of origin mean that the goods you export have to contain a certain level of Australian made content to qualify for tariff reductions in foreign markets. That means that our textile producers who import their yarn will probably not qualify for any concessions at all. Singapore thought it was getting a bargain under its free trade deal with the US, but it found the rule of origin conditions so hard to meet that it does not even bother applying for tariff reductions now; it just pays the tariff.</para><para>It is a similar picture in government procurement. The Howard government claims:</para><quote><para>The A$200 billion market in US federal government—</para></quote><para>and most state government—</para><quote><para>purchases of goods and services will now be open to Australia.</para></quote><para>But under the real deal our access to the US procurement market will be severely limited by a number of barriers and discriminatory policies. A major barrier is that the US government has retained the right to give preference to its small firms—which are not small at all, employing up to 1,500 people. How many Australian companies applying for procurement contracts in the US will employ more than 1,500 people? Also, we will be competing with hundreds of other much larger US firms in our own market—firms that the US government supports with what it calls `aggressive advocacy'. That means the US government gives subsidies to US firms to help them win foreign procurement contracts.</para><para>Basically, then, our government expects us to be able to compete in a huge US market alongside millions of protected `small' US firms, employing up to 1,500 people, and in our own small market alongside many hundreds of US firms also subsidised by their own government. How can we possibly win? We will not win, and the government knows it. We did not sign the WTO government procurement agreement because the government's own report on the matter concluded that access to the US market would remain limited by domestic regulations. So why has the government suddenly changed its tune? If competition in government procurement is so good, why do we not just sign the WTO government procurement agreement?</para><para>Then there is the claim:</para><quote><para>Australia will have a waiver from US programs favouring US firms and products.</para></quote><para>The facts are that, while 28 other countries also have such a waiver, in practice `buy American' laws continue to influence the purchasing strategies of many US agencies. The vast purchasing budget of the Homeland Security agency is being used to acquire American produced goods without competitive bidding, and a law currently before the US Congress will make it extremely difficult for waivers to be granted. The Buy American Improvement Act of 2004 is aimed at restricting waivers of the `buy American' laws, to prevent foreign firms gaining procurement contracts, thus protecting US companies. </para><para>More worryingly, we have agreed to scrap our industry development programs. These allow us to set conditions in return for granting procurement contracts to foreign suppliers in our own market. Such offset programs produce net benefits for Australian industry and employment, for example, by stipulating that suppliers source local inputs, employ a certain percentage of Australians, transfer technology or undertake similar actions. All this is to disappear. In particular, our young information and communications technology industry, which has made important strides under the mandated component of the procurement program, can expect to lose out to the tactics of a well-subsidised Microsoft. So while the US can keep and strengthen its Buy American Act under the deal and continue to subsidise its major exporters, we have agreed to abandon our development programs—the so-called `Microsoft clause'. Then there is the claim:</para><quote><para>Australian preferences for small businesses and indigenous people will remain.</para></quote><para>Sure, but so will America's. The funny thing is that our government defines a small business as a business employing up to 20 people, but the US defines a small business as a business employing up to 1,500 people. So it will be able to give preference to companies that are huge by Australian standards. How will we compete with that?</para><para>The picture is just as grim for intellectual property. The government would have us believe:</para><quote><para>Australia's IP laws will be substantially harmonised with the largest intellectual property market, and a global leader in innovation and creative products.</para></quote><para>The facts are that intellectual property protection under the WTO and WIPO treaties is more than enough to make sure that innovators are rewarded for their efforts. Extending patent protection in pharmaceuticals will delay the critical introduction of generic drugs for even longer, making us pay more and more for medicines. Patents extending copyright well beyond the life of any author—the so-called `Disney clause'—will mean that libraries and educational institutions will have to pay royalties for even longer. That is a cost that many institutions will not be able to bear.</para><para>On investment, the government claims:</para><quote><para>Australia has secured an agreement that should provide a strong framework for continuing to promote high levels of two-way investment between Australia and the US.</para></quote><para>This would be fine if it meant that the US would carry out more wealth-creating, productive or technologically-upgrading investment in Australia. Over the past 10 years, the vast majority of US investment in Australia has been for the purchase of Australian firms and assets—that is, the simple transfer of wealth from Australian to US hands. US greenfields investment in Australia—investment in new businesses, which creates more jobs for Australians—is miniscule in comparison. There is nothing in the deal to ensure that US investment in Australia will become more productive in the future. The government says:</para><quote><para>The Agreement preserves Australia's foreign investment policy, but with a range of changes that maintain our ability to screen all investment of major significance.</para></quote><para>But the real deal is that we have given up the right to screen all foreign investment beneath a threshold of $800 million. That means that 90 per cent of all Australian companies could now be purchased without screening. But the effective end of screening is less problematic than the removal of all conditions attached to foreign investment to ensure that it is fruitful for the Australian economy. </para><para>Now what about the biggie—that is, health? The government says:</para><quote><para>Access by Australians to affordable medicines under the PBS will be maintained under the AUSFTA.</para></quote><para>But Thurbon and Weiss's <inline font-style="italic">Real Deal</inline> shows this is just wishful thinking. Australia's Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is seen as the gold standard of affordable public health care by the rest of the world. US state governments have been trying for the past 10 years to build their own PBS, but US pharmaceutical companies keep taking them to court to prevent this as it would undermine their massive profits. US drug companies are now keen to destroy our PBS to ensure fatter profits. Under the deal, we have given the drug companies what they least deserve: increased protection against generic producers; a new body to sell the virtues of overpriced US drugs to Australians, the Medicines Working Group; and an independent appeals process to challenge the listing decisions of the PBAC—all of which will increase the price of the existing pharmaceuticals bill by $1.5 billion without any added health benefits and place more onerous burdens on the PBS.</para><para>Then there is the government's assertion:</para><quote><para>The Agreement reinforces Australia's existing framework for intellectual property protection of pharmaceuticals.</para></quote><para>It is a nice sentiment, but who is protecting whom? We have a framework extending the life of pharmaceutical patents, but who is this protecting? Not the Australian pharmaceutical industry, which mainly comprises generics producers who will now have to wait longer to introduce their more affordable versions of overpriced US drugs; not the Australian public, who will have to fork out more money for brand-name medicines for longer periods; and not the PBS, which will have to extend its subsidisation of expensive brand-name medicines with Australian taxpayers' money. So who is being protected?</para><para>The big question is: how did our government come to negotiate our country into this glaringly lopsided, nationally detrimental agreement? Thurbon and Weiss say the Australian government's deluded sense of the special nature of its relationship with the US saw it enter into negotiations under a misguided assumption that the US would modify its publicly proclaimed approach to international trade negotiations—that is, aggressive advocacy of US business interests in overseas markets—in order to further the special friendship that our countries are believed to enjoy. It is a fact that the Australian negotiating team originally anticipated the attainment of a comprehensive and nationally advantageous free trade deal, including a comprehensive deal in agriculture. This accords with DFAT's understanding of what constitutes an FTA. According to DFAT's webpage headed `Free Trade Agreements' and sub-headed: `What are Free Trade Agreements?':</para><quote><para>The crucial test of an FTA or Customs Union is that it must <inline font-weight="bold">eliminate all tariffs</inline> and other restrictions on <inline font-weight="bold">substantially all the trade</inline> in goods between its member countries. ... this means, at the very least, that a high proportion of trade between the parties—whether measured by trade volumes or tariff lines—should be covered by the elimination of tariffs and other restrictive trade regulations. Australia considers that this must be a very high percentage, and that no major sector should be excluded from tariff elimination.</para></quote><para>It is a fact that Australia's negotiators, led by the trade minister, believed the attainment of such an agreement would be possible due to our special relationship with the US. It is a fact that the Australian negotiating team sold the idea of an AUSFTA to Australian industry con-stituents, both at home and in the US, on the grounds that the deal agreed to would be comprehensive. </para><para>It is a fact that Australian businesspeople working in the US and familiar with the US political system believed such a deal was impossible and that the US had no intention of granting substantive market access concessions to Australia in a range of areas in which we are highly competitive, including sugar, beef, dairy and a range of horticultural industries such as stone fruit. It is a fact that US based Australian business representatives expressed these concerns to the trade minister during a visit to the US in 2003 to muster support for the negotiations. It is a fact that the minister insisted that a comprehensive agreement would be possible due to our special relationship with the US. It is a fact that Australia's US based businesspeople were right and the minister was wrong. Australian businesspeople in the US never believed for a moment that the Australian government would actually push ahead with a deal which clearly fell so short of its original goals and which in many ways puts Australia's economic future at risk.</para><para>The belief that the US would approach its negotiations with Australia any differently from the way in which it negotiates agreements with other countries—that is, on the basis of aggressive advocacy-—bears testimony to the naivety of Australia's negotiators. The fact that our government is seeking to paint meagre concessions and horrendous potential damages as overall wins for Australia is, at best, naive and, at worst, anti-Australian. It is clear that the costs of this deal will dramatically outweigh the benefits and cause irreversible damage to our economy, to our major national institutions and to our enviable status as a disease-free producer. That is why this so-called free trade agreement must be rejected—not closely examined in the Senate as Labor proposes but rejected outright for the outrageous sham it surely is.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>31503</page.no><name role="metadata">Albanese, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ALBANESE</name><name.id>R36</name.id><electorate>Grayndler</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to support the second reading amendment moved by my colleague the member for Rankin and to make a contribution to this very critical debate on the <inline ref="R2118">US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2111">US Free Trade Agreement Implementation (Customs Tariff) Bill 2004</inline>, which will impact on not just the people currently in Australia but also future generations of Australians. If we are going to enter into a free trade agreement with an economy such as the United States—an agreement where Australia's GDP is something like four per cent of it—we need to be very clear that it is indeed a good agreement and that it is in Australia's interests. So we need to have the ability to examine the detail, and Labor is committed to examining the detail and making a decision on whether to accept or oppose the Australia-US free trade agreement based upon what is in Australia's interests. The government has attempted to portray that view as somehow being anti-American. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is indeed a pro-Australian attribute that one would hope all members of the Australian House of Representatives and the Australian Senate hold.</para></talk.start><para>We have seen this legislation rushed into this parliament in order to pressure Labor into making a decision prior to the Senate committee handing down on 12 August its report resulting from the inquiry. Of course, this is well before the government's proposed imple-mentation date for the free trade agreement of 1 January 2005. Indeed, the US Congress is unlikely to vote for the Australia-US free trade agreement until mid-July. Based on the government's logic, the US Congress is anti-Australian and anti-American for actually wanting to consider the detail and to see if it is an agreement which the United States is prepared to support. </para><para>This legislation fails critical tests. For months we have been asking for the detail on the appeal mechanism to examine unsuccessful drug-listing applications by pharmaceutical companies. In spite of that, there is still no detail in this legislation as to how that appeal mechanism will be funded, who will participate in the committee or what the structure of the committee will be—the very details which are absolutely vital if we are to be able to make an informed decision on the impact of the agreement on the price of pharmaceuticals. That is just one aspect of the agreement in which this legislation is inadequate.</para><para>Labor will only support the agreement if it is in Australia's interests. We will not be rushed into a decision, a decision that will impact on future generations of Australians. We certainly will not be intimidated by the government's unsophisticated, crude attempts to portray the opposition as anti-US and to somehow link the agreement with our attitude towards the Australia-US alliance, an alliance forged by the Australian Labor Party and supported by the Australian Labor Party for more than five decades. The linking of trade with national security issues raises many questions about the government itself.</para><para>Labor will make a decision on the merits of the agreement, and those merits perhaps can be character-ised as two primary issues: firstly, the economic impact of the agreement; and, secondly, the social impact of the agreement. On the economic impact, the govern-ment engaged consultants, CIE, to give a report based upon what the economic benefits of this agreement would be. The consultant's report said that there would be some quite extraordinary benefits for the Australian economy. Of course, this assumed that there would really be a free trade agreement in agriculture—something that the members who represent sugar electorates in Queensland and New South Wales said was absolutely critical to the agreement. Of course, sugar was excluded from the free trade agreement because it was not in the interests of the United States.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>FK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Kelly, De-Anne, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs De-Anne Kelly</name></talker><para>—We got a better outcome.

They have a package in which a whole lot of money has been transferred in order to get people out of the sugar industry. The second issue of course is beef. The limited access to beef markets after 18 years is also a severe re-stric-tion on the agricultural benefits of this agreement.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The government, in spite of their rhetoric prior to going away and being feted by the US negotiators, came back, literally with their tail between their legs, and said, `We'll have to do a reassessment because the whole basis of the benefits of the agreement was something that is not even there.' So the CIE—surprise, surprise—were engaged to do another study for the government. It is interesting that the same company got to do both models on behalf of the government. The second time around, they came up with more benefits for manufacturing and other sectors of the economy than they had the first time around, in order to compensate for the fact that agriculture was not there.</para><para>A number of economists question this report and argue that essentially the government is exaggerating the benefits of this agreement and is downplaying the losses. Professor Ross Garnaut in fact has said that this report fails the `laugh test', as he put it. We need to be sceptical about what the economic benefits of this agreement are. </para><para>With regard to employment, I am concerned about the impact of this agreement, particularly on manufacturing in Australia. Much of the recent growth in the economy has occurred in areas seen as being part of the new economy. But if Australia does not retain a vibrant, growing manufacturing sector the impact on overall economic growth—as well as the specific impact on those who gain employment in that sector—will be quite devastating. With regard to manufacturing, one issue that comes up is government procurement. At the moment, governments are able to gain access to markets and gain advantages for Australian manufacturing through purchasing policy. If that is outlawed there will be a very negative impact on jobs in Australia.</para><para>Peter Brain of the NIEIR has estimated the potential loss in manufacturing areas to be some $49.6 billion, and in his assessment there may well be some 17,000 fewer jobs per year as a result of changes to government procurement policy and from tariff cuts in areas such as TCF and motor vehicles and parts. These are good jobs for Australians that would be lost. The largest single employer in my electorate, Tristar—which is located in Marrickville—produces suspension and other parts for motor vehicles. I am very concerned about the impact on jobs not just in my electorate but in the whole of the Australian economy. We cannot continue to grow and be a successful economy if we have a situation whereby we simply rely upon agricultural products and other non-manufacturing sectors.</para><para>The other issue that raises concern when it comes to the economic impact of this agreement is the impact on pharmaceuticals. I have raised that briefly already. But what we have seen in the United States is the very explicit use of courts and legal proceedings to stop competition coming in—particularly competition from generic drugs. That has a negative impact not just on the economy and on jobs and on the prices of pharmaceuticals but also on the types and quality of pharmaceuticals produced. Many companies tend to spend more money trying to protect their market share and trying to stop cheaper products which have exactly the same health benefits coming onto the market than acting in the public good.</para><para>There are other economic concerns in the agreement. The reduced right to review foreign investment in Australia is of considerable concern. There will also be restrictions on regulation of investment and services. The Senate committee is arguing very much over issues such as what the impact of this agreement will be on water and other regulated essential services. Indeed, a side letter of the agreement speaks about Telstra being fully privatised. That is a matter for this parliament and the Australian people, not a matter that the United States should have a determining influence over. That highlights the loss of sovereignty which can occur under an agreement that is not closely scrutinised to ensure that it is in Australia's interests.</para><para>Indeed, one of the concerns is political sovereignty. The trade tribunal will look at disputes over future legislation. When it examines that future legislation it will determine whether there is a breach of the agreement and therefore the potential imposition of trade sanctions. That will not be on the basis of whether there is some economic, social or cultural benefit to Australia but simply on the basis of the impact on trade. That will restrict our future political sovereignty and our ability to determine legislation based upon our own interests. </para><para>The final concern I wish to outline is the concern over our cultural sovereignty. Australia, as an island continent, has a unique culture and one which we should cherish. The arts and cultural community do a superb job, often against the odds, to make sure that Australian voices are heard. I am proud that there are more people who work in the arts living in my electorate than in any other electorate in Australia. This agreement would limit, or cap, the Australian content provisions that are currently in free-to-air commercial TV, radio broadcasting and subscription television to the current levels which have been determined by past Australian parliaments. But it also completely restricts Australian content rules in new media. </para><para>Thirty years ago, it would have been inconceivable that the computer sitting on your desk could look up the Internet, send messages, log on and watch just about any parliament in the world live and send the program to someone's phone so that they can watch it. These days you can send it to someone's wristwatch so that they can watch it. We do not know what form new media will take over time, but this agreement says that there will be no Australian content rules on this new media. If, in the future, the Australian parliament decides that this is a problem—because no-one is watching TV or other forms of media in which there are current Australian content rules—the government can then ask for a reconsideration to see whether it will be allowed to put in Australian content rules. This is one of the biggest concerns. There are 15 countries that have regulated new media. So we should be allowed to make sure that we are not making decisions that take away the rights of future generations.</para><para>I believe that the details of this agreement must be scrutinised, and we must make an assessment based on Australia's economic, social and cultural interests. If the concerns can be addressed and the agreement stacks up, we should adopt it. But, if not, we should reject it as not being in Australia's interests. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>31506</page.no><name role="metadata">Wilkie, Kim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr WILKIE</name><name.id>84G</name.id><electorate>Swan</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R2118">US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2111">US Free Trade Agreement Implementation (Customs Tariff) Bill 2004</inline> are extremely important pieces of legislation and their debate here today gives a further opportunity to discuss some of the issues raised in the agreement itself. As deputy chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties and having had the committee table its report into the Australia-US free trade agreement yesterday, I welcome this opportunity to expand on a number of the recommendations made by the committee which received bipartisan support and also to comment further on the recommendation contained in the Labor members' dissenting report, particularly as these recommendations should have been considered in relation to both these pieces of legislation. As I stated yesterday, many witnesses at the public enquiries made the observation that this is not a free trade agreement because it never achieved free trade. They stated that it was merely another trade agreement, and I wholeheartedly agree with that sentiment.</para></talk.start><para>In relation to the timing of the introduction of this legislation, I make the observation that the government has abused the committee process by not considering the contents of the report and by rushing this legislation into the chamber less than one hour after the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties tabled its report. I re-mind members opposite that the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties was established by the government to specifically give parliament an opportunity to scrutinise and examine all aspects of these sorts of agreements, to take evidence from relevant organisations and the public, to determine whether such agreements are in the national interest, to make recommendations as to appropriate matters concerning the national interest and to suggest ways in which an agreement may be implemented in a way that may provide further benefit to the country. </para><para>These considerations should have been taken into account by the government when introducing this legis-lation. Obviously when you are looking at a report of something like 300 pages and you introduce legislation that has already been drafted and written one hour after the tabling of that report, clearly the matters raised in the report could not have been considered before the introduction of the legislation. Clearly the government is in contravention of its own processes in relation to committees, and it should be condemned for that.</para><para>The Senate called for a Senate committee inquiry to also peruse this agreement and to complete the necessary parliamentary review process. But, instead of waiting for the committee's findings to be handed down in August, the government has juggernauted this legislation into this House for political reasons. Both the US Congress and the Australian Senate are still deliberating about the free trade agreement. But, in an attempt to capitalise on what the government has continually tried to push as an anti-American stance by the opposition, the government has tried to rush this legislation through. In doing so, the government is ignoring the outcomes of the committee reports and it is propelling the legislation into parliament without due analysis and consideration of the impact of the free trade agreement on Australia.</para><para>The Labor Party is an avid supporter of the US alliance. In the past, the United States and Australia have had an exceptionally good friendship, and that friendship will continue. That is not to say that, if you have a very good friendship with anyone or another country, there may not be an occasion when you can disagree. That has happened on occasions, and I think that is a healthy process. To say that Labor is opposed to an alliance with the United States is just ridiculous.</para><para>It was entirely fair and reasonable for the Leader of the Opposition to wait for the outcomes of both these inquiries before making any statements in relation to the Australia-United States free trade agreement and its benefits or otherwise for Australia. By waiting for both the JSCOT report and the Senate report, we could then get a true analysis of the impact of the Australia-US free trade agreement before committing ourselves to a position of support. In actual fact, this is something that the government should have done. Before making any other comments, the government should have said, `We will wait for the handing down of the joint standing committee's report and the Senate's report.' But, of course, they had already made a commitment to the agreement. It is the effect of the agreement on the Australian economy, Australian business and the Australian people that Labor have had at the forefront of their minds, not just jumping into bed with the United States and capitalising on a false and irresponsible belief that the Labor Party are anti-American—we all know that we are not. Obviously the government do not have the Australian public's best processes and best interests at heart.</para><para>In the dissenting report we raised four key areas. Firstly, we said that an extension of time had been needed by us to be able to report as a committee. Section 1 says: </para><quote><para>Therefore, the dissenting Members:</para></quote><para>1.	Believe an extension of time should have been sought from the Minister for consideration of the Treaty to allow adequate time to review the evidence presented and to prepare the Report of the Committee.</para><para>As I observed yesterday, the committee was given less than three months—to look at all the evidence presented to it, to interview people from around the country, to prepare a 300-page report and consider all the information contained in it and to report back to the parliament. Clearly that was not enough time considering that some time ago, to look adequately at all the issues of and report responsibly to the parliament on the International Criminal Court—which was also quite a contentious issue—the committee was given an extension of time. Clearly, given this agreement's implications for Australia's future, the same sorts of concessions should have been granted to us in coming up with an appropriate report. </para><para>Also, given the interdependency of the consideration of the treaty and the legislative, regulatory and administrative measures which must be taken to implement its various terms, it is not possible to determine if it is in Australia's national interests for binding action to be taken without first considering the terms of certain measures—such as the appeal mechanism to be established with the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and the implications for generic medicines; access by universities, educational institutions and libraries to copyright material under the proposed arrangements; and an environmental impact review of the treaty and legislative safeguards for local content rules subject to the treaty's ratchet provisions.</para><para>Firstly, with the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, concerns relate to the operation of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) decisions. On the weekend the minister for health, when talking with <inline font-style="italic">Sunday</inline>'s political editor, Laurie Oakes, referred to the appeal mechanism and said:</para><quote><para>... this independent review process will be a purely administrative mechanism.</para></quote><para>The independent review of processes of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee is not an administrative mechanism; it is a fundamental part of maintaining the integrity of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. If the minister cannot grasp this simple fact, as I said yesterday, he is in the wrong job—this is vitally important. The committee, in fact this parliament, needs to know how the review arrangement will operate. Will it be an open and transparent process or a closed process? If findings differ from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee's recommendations, will that be used against the government and the board's decision in a public campaign designed to have a favourable change to the ruling? The government know all about advertising campaigns and are running them now with the coming election; so what do you think a pharmaceutical company would do if it thought that by running a campaign it could get a different ruling?</para><para>Recommendation 5 of the committee's report outlines the need for a pragmatic review process to be undertaken by a specialised subcommittee of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. It reads:</para><quote><para>In establishing the independent review of PBAC processes (for PBS listing under Annex 2-C of the Agreement), the Committee recommends</para><para>that, in order to ensure that the fundamental integrity of the PBS is retained, the following principles be taken into account:</para></quote><para>	the review should focus on the issues of concern rather than reopening the whole application</para><para>	the review should be undertaken by a specialised subcommittee comprising experts relevant to the subject of the requested review</para><para>	the subcommittee should consider only that information provided to the PBAC, and relevant to the requested review</para><para>	 the subcommittee should report back to PBAC, and not directly to government </para><para>	the review process should be pragmatic, and facilitate, not delay, the PBAC approval processes for PBS listing of pharmaceuticals</para><para>	the review process be transparent and the findings and reasons for decisions made publicly available.</para><para>That recommendation was agreed to by both the government and opposition members. In other words, the government members also acknowledge that that is the sort of process that should take place when reviewing pharmaceutical benefits listing of drugs. The only person who seems to fail to get it is the minister. He just says, `It's an administrative measure and really, you know, it just happens administratively.' </para><para>It is a fundamental part of this agreement. If we do not get that right, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme will be put at risk. The reason I say that is, based on the evidence the committee received, if you do not have that sort of process in place, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee may look at one set of criteria when assessing whether a particular drug should be listed and the new committee set up to do the review may look at a different set of criteria. If that criteria is not made public, if it is not open, accountable and transparent, you could have the position where you are comparing apples with oranges. You need to compare like with like so that, if the result handed down by the advisory committee or the review committee differs from that contained in the PBAC, you do not have a pharmaceutical company then running off and conducting a public media campaign designed to get that decision overturned.</para><para>This agreement was negotiated in good faith by bureaucrats, but it has not taken into consideration the political reality of life in the real world. I would not trust Humphrey Appleby to negotiate one of these sorts of agreements without political scrutiny. When politics comes into it and when public opinion can sway governments and ministers, you know that a big company will use its advertising might in order to try and get a different outcome. So, if we do not get this particular part of the agreement right—if we do not have a review process that is clear, transparent and works properly—then the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme will be put under threat. There is no doubt about that. It is vital that we get this particular mechanism right.</para><para>The committee heard a range of evidence about potential problems with copyright legislation. Recommendation 16 of the report seeks to preserve the rights of universities, libraries and educational and research institutions to readily and economically access material under copyright. Their concerns are totally understandable. They have not seen the legislation and neither has the committee. How can a free trade agreement be analysed if vital components are missing? Recommendation 16 says:</para><quote><para>The Committee recommends that the Government enshrine in copyright legislation the rights of universities, libraries, educational and research institutions' to readily and cost effectively access material for academic and related purposes.</para></quote><para>Recommendation 17 says:</para><quote><para>The Committee recommends that the changes being made in respect of the <inline font-style="italic">Copyright Act 1968</inline> replace the Australian doctrine of fair dealing for a doctrine that resembles the United States' open-ended defence of fair-use, to counter the effects of the extension of copyright protection and to correct the legal anomaly of time-shifting and space-shifting that is currently absent.</para></quote><para>There are a number of other regulations in relation to copyright that I commend to the House. In relation to the environment, recommendation 22 of the committee's report states:</para><quote><para>The Committee recommends that the Government undertake a review of the environmental impact of the Agreement ... </para></quote><para>Page 117 of the guide to the agreement put out by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade states:</para><quote><para>The Australian Government will be preparing an environmental assessment of the Agreement in the context of an overall analysis of the Agreement. The US Government has already prepared a draft review (December 2003) available on the USTR website ...</para></quote><para>Despite the fact that the guide to the agreement said that there would be an environmental impact statement and analysis, we never received that, and it is ridiculous. That is also raised on page 271 of the report, where it is stated:</para><quote><para>The Australian Government is remarkably under-prepared to ensure that trade agreements such as the AUSFTA do not have a negative impact on the Australian environment. For example, unlike under US law, there is no Australian legislation in place that requires the Australian Government to undertake a review of the environmental impacts of free trade agreements. Furthermore, unlike under US law, there is no Australian law that sets out Australian environmental objectives for free trade agreements.</para></quote><para>Clearly, legislation needs to be introduced to ensure that all future agreements have had an environmental impact assessment, and the committee has recommended that. The government need to provide more data about these and many more detailed considerations, but until they do I believe the committee is unable to consider those sorts of issues—and they are vital issues.</para><para>Since the text of this agreement was first presented there have been concerns about the economic modelling designed to measure the outcomes of the agreement. The government commissioned analysis by the Centre for International Economics, and that modelling has been effectively discredited by a range of expert commentators, including Professor Ross Garnaut, who suggested the CIE's modelling would fail the laugh test. I quoted from Professor Garnaut yesterday. It is quite interesting that other noted economists made similar observations. The day after we talked to Professor Garnaut, another economist was giving us evidence. I asked if he would like to comment on the Garnaut assertions that the modelling had not passed the laugh test. He said: `No. Professor Garnaut is one of my competitors. I would not really want to quote him, but I would certainly say that when I looked at the modelling it raised a few eyebrows.' So I asked him if it passed the eyebrow raising test, and he felt it did not.</para><para>The government has failed to apply independent assessment of the impact of the Australia-US free trade agreement on Australia's economy. The modelling is seriously flawed. The only modelling that really has any credibility that was put to the committee was that undertaken by Professor Dee from the Australian National University, and the projected gains in Professor Dee's study are very limited. The government has consistently rejected the use of the Productivity Commission, which has professional expertise to analyse the free trade agreement and has done a substantial body of work on regional trade agreements in the past. The committee has made a recommendation that the Productivity Commission be used to look at the agreement in five years time to assess whether it is achieving what it set out to achieve. But, if the government can agree to let the Productivity Commission have a look at the agreement down the track, why did not it let the Productivity Commission have a look at this report in this instance? Why was it not used to put it forward then?</para><para>In terms of a whole range of other areas in relation to cross-border trade in services, I would like to look at recommendations 10 and 11. Australia did not get in the agreement the sort of access we wanted for our professionals. We were looking to have visas fast-tracked so that people who had qualifications could go and work in the United States and have easy access, similar to that established in many other agreements that the United States has negotiated. Unfortunately, we could not get this commitment. We had a commitment for the establishment of a working party to review this issue. Obviously, a working party is not necessarily going to lead to an agreement. </para><para>We had the same problem with qualifications. We had the committee recommending that issues of mutual recognition of qualifications and movement of business people should be made a priority within the professional services working group. Further, not-with-standing the operation of the professional services work-ing group, the committee recommended that the Australian government pursue, through all other available diplomatic channels, the issues of the mutual recognition of qualifications and the movement of business people between Australia and the United States.</para><para>Many people have dipped out in this agreement. We have had limited gains in agriculture but far less than what was expected by the industry, far less than what was promised by the minister and far less than we could have achieved. The Western Australian gov-ernment also made that observation. The government keeps saying that state governments like the agreement, but in fact the state governments have said that they really need it to achieve more. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>31511</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Brendan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR</name><name.id>00AN3</name.id><electorate>Burke</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R2118">US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2111">US Free Trade Agreement Implementation (Customs Tariff) Bill 2004</inline> are very historic bills. It is true that sometimes in this place laws that are proposed and accepted, or indeed rejected, have a great bearing upon the course of Australia's future and upon the future of all of us. Alongside the debate we had about whether to invade Iraq, this debate is one of great national significance. It has been indicated already in this debate that the Labor Party are not opposed to the bills altogether but that we have serious reservations about the merit of the draft agreement struck by the US and Australian governments. I say `draft agreement' because not only has it not passed through our parliament; it has not passed through the US congress.</para></talk.start><para>The truth is that the government is playing politics with this very significant piece of legislation. It is putting politics over good policy. If the government were serious about properly scrutinising the pros and cons of the US free trade agreement, it would allow the processes of the parliament to take place. It would ensure there was proper analysis and scrutiny of the pros and cons to weigh up whether there was in fact a net gain, and it would ensure that it was in the nation's interest and that it was good for Australians. But I do not think that we have seen today an exercise of good government by the Howard government. We have seen, instead, an effort to prematurely have the parliament make a decision about a very complex matter that has huge consequences for the country. I think it is also fair to say that there should have been the capacity for the report of the Senate select committee on the free trade agreement to be handed down, and its recommendations properly considered by members and senators, before embarking upon this matter.</para><para>As other speakers have said, the processes of the US congress have not been exhausted, which undermines the contention that has been put by the government that it is critical that the matter is dealt with now. The reality is that it will be some three weeks before the US parliamentary processes have been exhausted, so we do not know whether the agreement will be adopted by the United States congress. So there is no need to push ahead prematurely with this matter. This is about pushing ahead in order to try to score a political point, but all it will do is undermine the good processes of this place and, indeed, the government's credibility on what is a very important area. </para><para>There are a number of areas that are of concern to me. I know that some members are concerned about areas of the agreement that may affect their electorates, and there are other matters that are of concern to all of us. There is no doubt that there is concern in the North Queensland seats because the sugar industry was entirely omitted from the agreement. There is no doubt that sugar farmers would feel that they have been sacrificed in the negotiations and that they clearly are the losers, because they were not even considered in the document when it was finally drafted by this government and the US administration. Those sugar farmers no doubt feel that they have been ignored, and of course the Prime Minister thinks he can go up to North Queensland and throw money at the problem, but it just shows again that this government is not willing to defend very important sectors of this community in order to get the best deal for all sectors. So sugar has been sacrificed, and there has been an effort to throw some money at the problem, but I do not think the sugar farmers will be happy. They know now that this government has no regard for them or their future, and the money that the government provided, even though it was a reasonable sum, will not buy the loyalty of sugar farmers to support this government. We know that the sugar industry was willingly sacrificed by the Minister for Trade and the Prime Minister.</para><para>I have some concerns in relation to some other areas, and the member for Swan and others have mentioned them. I think it is critical to say that, in assessing whether this is a good or bad agreement, we have to consider the economic, social and cultural consequences of agreeing or not agreeing to it. Many of my constituents have been concerned about the free trade agreement's impact on jobs, health—particularly pharmaceutical costs—intellectual property and culture.</para><para>This week and earlier members of parliament have been meeting with community members representing different interests, and I have to say there have been many serious concerns raised about this so-called agreement. In relation to manufacturing, there have been assertions made by Professor Peter Brain that there would be job losses—in the automotive industry and in manufacturing industry generally. Many thousands of jobs would be lost, it has been asserted. I do not know whether that is true or not but I would certainly want to be convinced that this was not the case—that it is not the case that we are willing to sacrifice jobs in the manufacturing industry and rush through a document in order to satisfy the self-interest of the Prime Minister and the government. I hope it is not the case that people would in fact lose their jobs as a result of this agreement, and I would like to be convinced of that.</para><para>In relation to cultural content, there has certainly been a huge debate in the community about the dangers of sacrificing our local film and television content and risking an increase in what is already to some, I suppose, a flood of US-produced shows on television, and I think that concern has to be allayed. There has to be some assurance given that we will not surrender our cultural sovereignty to a much larger country that is able to produce many more shows for us to watch on television. I think it is critical, and it has been said by others, that we are able to ensure that there is a certain minimum of time on television for Australian shows, with Australians writing the material, producing the material and indeed acting in those productions. </para><para>It is critical for this nation, in order to know who we are and in order to ensure that our culture survives, that we have proper local content laws. There have been questions raised about this matter; indeed, there are concerns. As many would know, currently commercial networks must show a level of 55 per cent Australian content between 6 a.m. and midnight, 32 hours of Australian first-release children's drama and 130 hours a year of preschool programs. There are also currently rules for Australian content in drama and documentary programs.</para><para>The concern is that under the free trade agreement the rules for Australian content on network television can never be increased. That is the first concern that we and many others have. On pay television the vast majority of channels will have no Australian content rules at all. Children's channels on pay television may be able to introduce Australian content rules; however, these rules, if ever introduced, according to the draft agreement would require no more than four per cent Australian content to be shown on children's channels. These are the sorts of concerns people have.</para><para>Whether we like it or not, television has become probably the most powerful medium in people's homes. It would probably be preferable if we spent more time reading or listening to the radio and in other pursuits, but the fact is that television is a very power-ful medium. Therefore, it seems to me that regulators have a responsibility to ensure we get balanced programming and that we reflect in television programming our own cultural identity in an effective manner. Concerns have been raised, none of which have been properly responded to by the government, in my view. I think it is something that has to be properly considered, and there has to be an unequivocal assurance given by the government that we will not surrender our cultural sovereignty in this particular area. We are not a large country—we are a small country in economic terms—but we are a country proud of our history and we want to see Australians on television talking to other Australians, allowing us to watch ourselves, if you like, not only foreign based productions. So it is a critical issue.</para><para>I do not want to play Chicken Little. I do not want to say, `The sky is falling in!' but the fact is we have to ensure that this matter is properly resolved and that fears in the community that we are losing our local identity are allayed. I had the opportunity to meet representatives from the film and television industry yesterday, and I think they quite eloquently put their concerns to us. They were not in any way extreme in their comments; they were just concerned, like most citizens, about ensuring that we have proper local content on our television and we continue to have a decent film industry producing films with Australian content. I think that is a very grave concern.</para><para>The other concern we have is about pharmaceuticals. There have been many submissions made, I know, to the Senate select committee. I have obviously had the opportunity to read some of the submissions made. There is a very compelling submission on this matter, the authors of which are Professor Peter Drahos, Dr Thomas Faunce, Martyn Goddard and Professor David Henry, all of whom are experts in the field. They have raised particular concerns about pharmaceuticals and about the potential hike in prices that would occur if we were to enter into this agreement. I would like to go briefly to a number of points made in their submission. Firstly, they indicate:</para><quote><para>A close look at the FTA indicates that this is not the most likely outcome. The text of the Agreement is unbalanced and most of the measures increase the pricing power of US drug companies operating in Australia. It is inconceivable, based on past practice, that they will not make use of that new pricing power. </para></quote><para>They go on to ask, rhetorically, how much it would cost, and say:</para><quote><para>American consumers, insurers and health programs pay two to three times as much for many important drugs as their Australian counterparts. Because most of the measures in the FTA apply to new drugs rather than existing ones, and because legislation will need to be enacted, regulations changed and new procedures put in place, there will be a substantial time-lag between the signing of the FTA and its full effect on prices.</para></quote><para>However, it concludes:</para><quote><para>The full effect of the FTA on the pharmaceutical market is therefore unlikely to be felt for about five years.</para></quote><para>This clearly points out that, whilst we may not feel immediate consequences as a result of entering into this agreement as it is currently formed, there is a strong likelihood that in only five years time prices for pharmaceuticals will rise very high. The community want to be assured that they are not going to have to pay exorbitant prices.</para><para>We have a very effective health system in this country. There are some weaknesses—and the opposition has been focusing on those and hoping the government will attend to them—but there are some serious concerns about the hiking up of pharma-ceuticals and those concerns have not been allayed by comments from the government. There has been no capacity for the Senate committee to formally hand down its recommendations and to take into account that contention in the submission that I have referred to. This again undermines the government's position. Not allowing the Senate select committee appointed by the parliament to make recommendations for our consideration concerns me and concerns Labor members generally.</para><para>There are a number of critical areas of concern in this matter. We know that the sugar industry has been completely ignored in relation to this agreement and will suffer the consequences. Quite credible assertions have been made that there will be job losses in the manufacturing industry, and people want to be assured that that will not be the case. There are concerns about our local content on television and about losing our cultural identity.</para><para>I am not against US culture; there are some fine things in US culture. I have been inspired by writers like Joseph Heller, John Steinbeck and many others who have come out of America. I am not against US culture, but I am against untrammelled US cultural hegemony. I am against having US culture at the expense of all other culture and of our own culture. This government has failed to properly have regard to the concerns of the community in relation to that matter. I am a republican. I would like to see an Australian head of state one day. But there are many ways to surrender your sovereignty. Unfortunately, if some of the things people have raised concerns about in relation to this agreement happen, I think we will be seeing a surrender of our sovereignty in many areas. We will potentially be seeing the surrender of our cultural sovereignty and our economic sovereignty.</para><para>There are concerns that this agreement has more of a corporate objective than the objectives of two nations. We have to ensure that domestic sovereign states and domestic laws are not undermined by the objectives of some corporate organisations. We are in danger of losing some economic control and regulation over our economy. I know we live in a globalised world, and a lot of benefits flow from globalisation. There have been costs but there have also been benefits. But we do not want to see the only things on the agenda being those that the large multinational companies want to put forward and not what people want to put forward—not concern about local jobs in the community but only about what is the interests of the large corporations. Therefore, this government has to seriously have regard to the assertions that have been made in relation to many of these factors. To date it has not done so. </para><para>Today the government has introduced a number of bills in order to play politics. If it were seriously concerned about the consequences of the free trade agreement, it would allow a proper consideration by the Senate select committee, it would allow proper consideration by members of parliament generally and it would listen to the community representatives of many sectors who are concerned about the potential downside of this agreement. There has been no proper regard for those things, and that is why I am very concerned that this is about politics and not about good policy. I hope the government opens its ears, listens to people's concerns and has proper regard for some of the things I and other Labor members have raised in this debate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>31515</page.no><name role="metadata">Hall, Jill, MP</name><name role="display">Ms HALL</name><name.id>83N</name.id><electorate>Shortland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Before I make my contribution to the debate on the <inline ref="R2118">US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2111">US Free Trade Agreement Implementation (Customs Tariff) Bill 2004</inline>, I would like to associate myself with the contribution of the previous speaker. I think he made some outstanding points about the need to maintain our sovereignty and about issues such as sugar, jobs within the manufacturing industry, local content on television and the need for us to really look at this piece of legislation seriously. I commend him for the outstanding contribution he made.</para></talk.start><para>It is with some reluctance that I rise to speak on this legislation as I do not believe that the merits of signing this so-called free trade agreement have been established. The bill has been introduced into the parliament five minutes before the winter recess with the aim of preventing proper parliamentary scrutiny and debate and impeding the democratic process. I am debating it today, the day after the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties tabled its report, the same day that the Senate select committee on the free trade agreement is to deliver an interim report and almost two months before it is due to report.</para><para>The fact that the legislation is being debated today is a blatant distortion of the democratic process and is more about political point scoring than good government. This is a government that is in election mode. It is a government that is not focused on what is good for Australia; it is only interested in what is good for it. A decision on whether Australia should sign the US free trade agreement should be based on fact, not on preconceptions or on whether or not the Prime Minister will be invited to another barbecue with George Bush at the ranch. The Howard government is only interested in pleasing its masters and painting Labor as anti-American and un-Australian, which is not true.</para><para>We on this side recognise and appreciate the enormous contributions that the US has made to the world and we like to be associated with them in many ways. But, on the other hand, the Labor Party are pro-Australian and we believe that any decision that is made should be in the best interests of Australia and the Australian people. What is in the best interests of Australia and the Australian people is proper scrutiny of the 1,000-page document that is the free trade agreement—scrutiny that allows Australians to express their opinions and that allows full and thorough economic analysis of the impact that this agreement will have on Australian industries, the Australia people and the Australian economy. </para><para>The Howard government is treating this parliament and the Australian people with contempt, and it should be condemned for that. The US process is much more transparent and consultative and is unlike the process that we in Australia have before us. Proper scrutiny of the free trade agreement has been taken seriously by the US Congress, which is not expected to vote on it until mid-July. This means that Congress is examining all the implications that the agreement has for the US and making sure that the US will not be affected detrimentally by this legislation. It is ensuring that the agreement is in the national interest. The Howard government should be ensuring that the free trade agreement is in Australia's national interest and, foremost, it should not be just answering to its masters. It is all about what is best for Australia and not what is best for the government or how it can maintain close friendships with certain people in the US.</para><para>My question to the government is: can it be demonstrated that this agreement is in the best interests of the nation? Will its cost implications and the potential to impact on our way of life be greater than the benefits it delivers? Some other questions I have are: will this legislation give drug companies the right to seek reviews of decisions of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee and make changes to laws that may delay the production of cheaper generic drugs? In a moment I will discuss in more detail the implications that I believe it has for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and how it could add $1.5 billion to the cost of the scheme each year.</para><para>Will this legislation restrict Australian voices in the media by limiting the right to have Australian content in new forms of media? Once again, I think this is a question that has not been properly examined and answered at this stage. Will the adoption of US copyright laws have a net cost for Australia? I truly believe that this government needs to look at this more thoroughly than it has to date. So my question to the government is: will this agreement bring the promised economic gains that they expect? I think that there are some issues around the limited access to US agricultural markets, and these have been well detailed in Senate submissions from Dr Philippa Dee from the ANU and the Productivity Commission and from Dr Peter Brain. They have predicted that this will result in small gains, and possibly losses, to the Australian economy.</para><para>I would like to turn now to pharmaceutical benefits and the impact of this free trade agreement on the price of drugs. One of the issues that has been raised and examined by the Senate select committee in some detail and on which a number of submissions have been received by it is that the free trade agreement will inevitably lead to higher drug prices. It is argued that the agreement is unbalanced and that most measures increase the pricing power of the US drug companies operating in Australia. I believe that the free trade agreement has the potential to significantly undermine the effectiveness of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and reduce the affordability of medicines in Australia.</para><para>Intellectual property rights that revolve around pharmaceutical benefits is another issue that I am quite concerned about. The US is seeking changes to Australia's intellectual property laws, particularly in relation to pharmaceuticals. These changes have the capacity to undermine the effectiveness of the PBS and to lead to higher costs. IP regulations like those discussed in the free trade agreement have led to extensions of pharmaceutical monopolies by delaying or preventing the entry of low-cost generics into the market. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

They have regular military training exercises. They have counter-terrorism cooperation—indeed, to such an extent that their counter-terrorism cooperation has led to the arrest of Hambali and Khalid Shaikh Mohammed. Regional support for the Proliferation Security Initiative is growing. Japan and Singapore are core members. New Zealand and Thailand are participating in meetings on the PSI. Importantly, Japan supports the missile defence initiative. Defence Minister Ishiba said at the end of last year, `Missile defence is indispensable for Japan's security.'</para></talk.start><para>Significantly, many countries in Asia have troops in Iraq supporting the Iraqi people and the coalition more generally—Japan has over 500; South Korea has 660 and is proposing to send a further 3,000; and Mongolia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand all have troops. This explodes the myth which is propagated in par-ticular by the opposition and some of their supporters that having involvement in Iraq damages us in Asia and having close relations with the United States damages us in Asia. Indeed, what is interesting is that countries in Asia are interested in a free trade agreement with the United States. Singapore has a free trade agreement with the United States. Negotiations with Thailand are to start. Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Brunei all have trade and investment facilitation agreements with the United States. </para><para>The Labor Party believe that you cannot have close relations with the United States and close relations with Asia. The Labor Party believe that the two are mutually contradictory. As a result, Labor argue that we should downgrade our relationship with the United States. We know that the Labor Party want to pull the troops out of Iraq. They reject the United States' right to defend its people from ballistic missile attack, by opposing the missile defence initiative. They are opposed, apparently, to the Proliferation Security Initiative, even though 60 countries support it. And when it comes to the free trade agreement with the United States, the Labor Party rejected that at the outset. Let us remember what the Leader of the Opposition said:</para><quote><para>If we were asked to vote on it today, or in the parliament tomorrow, we would be opposing it.</para></quote><para>And since then the Labor Party have constantly attacked the free trade agreement. They have raised the phoney issue of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme cost rises when in fact they are voting for cost rises of pharmaceuticals. They are against it if it has anything to do with the free trade agreement—and it doesn't—but they are in favour of it if it has nothing to do with the free trade agreement. The logic of that, I think, would escape almost all human beings, and it certainly escapes the electorate.</para><para>When it came to JSCOT, the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, it is perfectly clear that many but not quite all Labor members wanted to sign off in support of the free trade agreement, and at the last moment somebody contacted them and said, `You had better not go that far.' We understand that the contact came from the office of the Leader of the Opposition. In other words, `Instruct committee members on how to vote; make sure they do not support the free trade agreement,' because, in the end, Labor wants to maintain its image of being viscerally anti-American, which the Labor Party leadership is, and the Labor Party believes that it will enhance Australia's status in Asia by downgrading our relations with our alliance partner. It will have the reverse effect. It will make Australia look weak. It will make Australia isolationist. And you win no respect in Asia by being weak. </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Family Services: Family Payments</title><page.no>31518</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>31518</page.no><name role="metadata">Macklin, Jenny, MP</name><name role="display">Ms MACKLIN</name><name.id>PG6</name.id><electorate>Jagajaga</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.

In circumstances where we deem that an individual or a young mother is perhaps at risk—there could be a drug dependency problem or alcohol issues—then there is discretion by the secretary of the department to look at those particular narrow areas to ensure that that money is not all blown in one hit but used responsibly. </para><para>The fact is that the Australian Labor Party want to invade households' lives.

I can inform the House that living standards in Australia have been strongly rising over the last eight years. This is reflected in various surveys of public opinion, including surveys about whether or not people have optimism for the future. Today Newspoll reports a survey where people were polled about their standard of living—whether they expected it to improve, stay the same or get worse or whether they were uncommitted. The level of those who thought that they would either maintain their standard of living or improve it over the next six months was the highest, at 84 per cent. That is a good thing, isn't it? Eighty-four per cent of Australians feel confident enough about their standard of living to say that they thought they were going to either maintain or improve their standard of living over the next six months. The level of those who thought things were going to get worse is the lowest it has been in this survey since 1997. In fact, if you look back to 1985 you see that it is the lowest level that has been recorded by that particular survey. So people are confident and optimistic about the future. It is good for our country that our country feels optimistic and confident. </para></talk.start><para>There are reasons why people feel optimistic and confident about their future in Australia. Real household disposable income, the key summary measure of economic wellbeing, has increased by 28 per cent. So household disposable income has increased under this government. Unemployment, at 5.5 per cent, is at a 23-year low. The number of jobs has increased significantly, with 1.3 million jobs having been created in Australia since 1996, and they have been widely shared around Australia.</para><para>We can welcome to the House the children and companions from Camp Quality in Darwin who are visiting us today. The Territory is one of those areas which has been sharing in job creation and increasing standards of living. We have had continuous growth over the last eight years. Interest rates are at their lowest level in 30 years; inflation is down towards the bottom of the band of two to three per cent; and, best of all, at the national level, Labor's debt of $96 billion has been reduced under this government by $70 billion in net terms. That has set Australia up for much better opportunities in the future, but we cannot relax. Economic management is hard, it is difficult, and we have to maintain the pressure in relation to that. If you cannot govern a local council, you cannot govern a country. That is why it is important that we continue strong economic management in this country, that we do not lose focus, and that the coalition continues to work in relation to economic management for our children's future.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Family Services: Family Payments</title><page.no>31520</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>31520</page.no><name role="metadata">Swan, Wayne, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SWAN</name><name.id>2V5</name.id><electorate>Lilley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question without notice is directed to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.

I enjoyed my time looking at some of those projects that you have been talking about that have needed to be addressed for so long but which will be addressed under AusLink. We recently announced AusLink, and it does highlight some very major works to be undertaken in New South Wales. Indeed, the construction budget for New South Wales goes up by 76 per cent over the next five years. We really will be presiding over some very serious infrastructure upgrades in that state, including duplicating the Hume Highway and the Pacific Highway, so we can get to the point in this country where we have major capital cities increasingly linked by dual carriageway.</para></talk.start><para>The Minister for Roads in New South Wales, Carl Scully, led me to believe that he was about to obviously do something really fantastic. I thought he must be. His reactions indicated that he had something that was so big and so spectacular that it would make everything we were doing pale into insignificance. He called our 76 per cent increase in the construction budget for New South Wales a disgrace and said that it fell well short. So it was that I waited to see what he would produce. The headlines were pretty spectacular in relation to the New South Wales budget this week. They said that it included a record roads budget. Mr Scully had a very colourful song to sing about that. He said that 2004-05 was a landmark year, with a record allocation involving huge increases. We must be reading different budget documents. The NRMA-Access Economics analysis of the New South Wales budget shows that next financial year's capital expenditure on roads—that is, what you actually spend on building them—has dropped by $22 million since 2002-03 and there had been a drop that year of $34 million from the previous year. So, in the past two years alone, road building has gone backwards $56 million in New South Wales, before you take inflation into account. </para><para>There is more than that. Do you know what we found when we had a look at the projects they had listed in this giant increase in their New South Wales roads budget? We found that over 20 per cent of them are actually Australian government road announcements. They are federal government roads. Their magnificent new roads program is at least one-fifth ours, when you look at it closely. The drop in the actual New South Wales commitment to roads construction over the last two years is $250 million before inflation. This massive increase turns out to be a very significant decrease. Worse than that, of course, is that, at the same time that has been happening, motor vehicle taxes and charges in New South Wales have increased by $400 million. So there you go: it is quite a windfall indeed. Mr Scully was so desperate that, in his media statement, what was the first project he trumpeted? Westlink—the Western Sydney Orbital—at $110 million. How much of that money is state money? None. It is Australian government money.</para><para>I want to make this point: it is time that Australian electors started to contemplate what life under a Latham Labor government would be like. It is time they started to think that through. Where might they find some clues on what it might be like? There are some people around Liverpool who could probably give them a pretty good idea. You could think back to what it was like when the Labor Party was last in office, you could contemplate having the modern version of those days, with Treasurer Crean's hand in your pocket, and you could also have a bit of a look at how the state governments run things. What it shows is that it is very expensive to run nanny states. Your taxes go up and up, so New South Wales motorists are paying more and more—it is a bit like that magic pudding thing—and, at the same time, of course, your services come down and the amount of money spent on capital works comes down. But it is all covered with the most extraordinary fudge—and that is what we have seen in New South Wales with their roads budget. We announced a 76 per cent increase in road building and, according to them, that is a disgrace. At the same time, according to them, a $250 million decline before inflation in road funding is a landmark achievement. People ought to remember what it is like living under a Labor government and start thinking about just what sort of a shambles Mr Latham would run.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Family Services: Family Payments</title><page.no>31525</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>31525</page.no><name role="metadata">Jackson, Sharryn, MP</name><name role="display">Ms JACKSON</name><name.id>00AN2</name.id><electorate>Hasluck</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.

Indeed, a lot more Australian families have now been choosing to take that lump sum. To answer your question—and I would be interested in any specific cases if you would like to refer them to us—for those Australian families that were receiving a lump sum at the end of last year, there was a decision made that they would be entitled to that $600 payment.

I hope that Australian families that are watching or listening to this broadcast today will go to their local ALP members in the House of Representa-tives and their senators and say, `Why haven't you guaranteed that $600 payment that we are receiving now as a bonus from the coalition government because of their good economic management?'

The statement is that the Labor Party will ban exploration and drilling on or near the Great Barrier Reef. The fact is that drilling on the Great Barrier Reef is prevented by law under the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975. In other words, since 1975, drilling on the reef has been prevented, yet the Leader of the Opposition is going around telling the Australian people that he is going to do something about this. He is either completely ignorant of the laws or utterly dishonest and deceitful in what he says about the protection of the Great Barrier Reef, because he is undertaking to do something which has been law in this country for over 25 years.</para></talk.start><para>Then we have concerns being expressed about possible dangers to the reef from drilling off the reef. This government has introduced environment protection and biodiversity conservation legislation which specifically empowers the Minister for the Environment and Heritage to prevent any action which could have any detrimental effect on the values of the Great Barrier Reef. Of course, this legislation completely protects the reef from any of the activities which the member is implying may possibly have an adverse impact on tourism and other industries within the reef.</para><para>The government which has protected the Great Barrier Reef more than any government in Australia's history is this government. I am delighted to be able to say that on 1 July the new zoning plan for the Great Barrier Reef will come into operation. It will lift the protections of the Great Barrier Reef from some five per cent of the marine park to over 33 per cent of the marine park. It is very interesting to hear what the major interests concerned with the reef have said about the government's policies.

In 1978 the Fraser Government implemented a policy of responding in the House by ministerial statement within six months of the tabling of a committee report. In 1983, the Hawke Government reduced this response time to three months but continued the practice of responding by ministerial statement. The Keating Government generally responded by means of a letter to a committee chair, with the letter being tabled in the House at the earliest opportunity. In 1996, the Howard Government affirmed the commitment to respond to relevant parliamentary committee reports within three months of their presentation. The Government also undertook to clear, as soon as possible, the backlog of reports arising from previous Parliaments. </para><para>The attached schedule lists committee reports tabled and government responses to House and joint committee reports made since the last schedule was presented on 4 December 2003. It also lists reports for which the House has received no government response. A schedule of outstanding responses will continue to be presented at approximately six monthly intervals, generally in the last sitting weeks of the winter and spring sittings.</para><para>The schedule does not include advisory reports on bills introduced into the House of Representatives unless the reports make recommendations which are wider than the provisions of the bills and which could be the subject of a government response. The Government's response to these reports is apparent in the resumption of consideration of the relevant legislation by the House. Also not included are reports from the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, the House of Representatives Committee of Members' Interests, the Committee of Privileges, the Publications Committee and the Selection Committee. Government responses to reports of the Public Works Committee are normally reflected in motions for the approval of works after the relevant report has been presented and considered. Reports from other committees which do not include recommendations are not included.</para><para>Reports of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit primarily make administrative recommendations but may make policy recommendations. A government response is re-quired in respect of such policy recommendations made by the committee. However, responses to administrative recom-men-dations are made in the form of an Executive Minute provided to, and subsequently tabled by, the committee.

In making those statements, both the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and the former minister have misled the working people of Australia. We now call upon this Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, who says that workers have the right to bargain collectively, to explain why the Workplace Relations Act does not give them that right when an employer refuses to bargain with the union.

Of the allegation that children were thrown overboard, he said:</para><quote><para>Well it did happen. The fact is the children were thrown into the water.</para></quote><para>The truth is that the children were not thrown into the water. The government failed to tell the truth.</para><para>I refer to the ministerial guidelines in the first term of the parliament when the Prime Minister said:</para><quote><para>The guidelines that were laid down in this document will be complied with in full.</para></quote><para>It was obviously a non-core promise, because seven ministers resigned for breaches of those guidelines, but nine more ministers also breached the guidelines and did not resign. In the end, the Prime Minister tore up the ministerial guidelines.</para><para>In the area of tax, which directly affects the living standards of working Australians, there is that golden oldie of the Prime Minister saying in 1995 that a Howard government would `never, ever' introduce a GST—obviously a non-core promise. Similarly on tax, referring to a promise of no new taxes and no increases in existing taxes for the life of the first Howard government, the Prime Minister said, `That promise is quite explicit.' We have checked that through the Clerk of the Senate. The Prime Minister was saying there would be no new taxes and no increased taxes for the life of the first term of the Howard government. How many increased and new taxes do you imagine there were in that first term? Not one, not two, not 10, not 20, but 86 new taxes or increased taxes were introduced in that first term. In the life of the Howard government to date, that has now ballooned out to 151 new taxes or increased taxes. But of course this mean and tricky government says, `We'll get out of that promise by changing their names to fees, levies and charges.' The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry described the sugar levy as `an opportunity to contribute'. This is the government's description of a tax: it is an opportunity to contribute! So 151 increased taxes or new taxes have been introduced by this government in the life of the Howard government.</para><para>While we are on tax: the Prime Minister was asked about the tax act in 1998, `Will the number of pages in the tax act be reduced by the introduction of a GST?' The Prime Minister answered, `Yes, it will.' Well, what has happened to the size of the tax act? It was 3,500 pages when this government came to office, and it is now more than 8,000 pages—so much for a streamlined new tax system for a new century that working Australians were promised before the 1998 election!</para><para>Still on tax, referring to income tax cuts the Treasurer said in 2000:</para><quote><para>The last time they were promised, they were not paid for one day and for $1.</para></quote><para>He has repeated that so many times in this parliament, whereas the truth of the matter is that the first half of Labor's tax cuts were brought forward to November 1993 at a full-year cost of $2.9 billion. That is not $1; that is not $10—$2.9 billion is a lot of dollars. And the second part of those tax cuts was deferred into superannuation co-contributions which the Treasurer and the Prime Minister promised to keep. But what happened? They abolished those co-contributions in the 1997 budget. </para><para>Still on tax, in 2000 the Treasurer said:</para><quote><para>I can vouch, as someone who has been in the work force about 20 years ... that whenever we seemed to get to the barrier on income tax cuts for some reason or another they were never paid.</para></quote><para>He asserts that they were never paid in 20 years. Here in the parliament he made those claims. Labor cut personal income tax rates seven times in 13 years—in 1984, 1986, 1987, 1989, 1990, 1991 and 1993—and here is the Treasurer saying that there were no tax cuts in the 20 years prior to 2000. He also told parliament on the same day—it was a big red-letter day for the Treasurer—about the budget:</para><quote><para>First of all we put the budget into a surplus on a headline basis, which the Labor Party never did. Then we say, `We ought to put the budget into a surplus on an underlying basis,' which the Labor Party never did.</para></quote><para>The truth is that Labor produced budget surpluses in 1987-88, 1988-89, 1989-90 and 1990-91.</para><para>As we move on to foreign debt, remember this promise from the Prime Minister with the debt truck:</para><quote><para>I promise you that we will follow policies which will ... bring down the foreign debt.</para></quote><para>What has happened? That was in 1995. Since then, foreign debt has doubled in size to around $360 billion—or $18,000 for every man, woman and child in Australia. Working Australians are drowning in debt. There is record household debt, record credit card debt and record national debt.</para><para>Now we move on to another area that affects the living standards of working Australians—those working Australians who aspire to send their children to a university where their talents can be developed and expressed. In October 1999, on university fees the Prime Minister very solemnly said:</para><quote><para>I can guarantee we're not going to have $100,000 university degree courses.</para></quote><para>Well, we have $144,000 university degree courses.

You might remember Senator John Herron, a minister in this government. A decision was made to appoint that minister as Ambassador to Ireland and the Holy See after the 2000 election, but the decision was made before the 2000 election. Again, the Prime Minister was asked about that and he said, `There's nothing to it.' Say one thing before the election; do another thing after the election.</para><para>In relation to the notorious ethanol matter involving the Prime Minister and his good friend Dick Honan, the member for Chisholm asked this question in parliament: </para><quote><para>Prime Minister, was the government contacted by the major Australian producer of ethanol or by any representative of his company or the Industry Association before its decision to impose fuel excise on ethanol? </para></quote><para>The Prime Minister responded, telling the Australian parliament: </para><quote><para>Speaking for myself, I did not personally have any discussions, from recollection, with any of them. </para></quote><para>We know he did because there was a note-taker from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet who produced the notes, and one of our shadow ministers, Kerry O'Brien, was able to obtain that documentation.

What I have sought to do today is to outline just a few examples of the constitutional incapacity of this government, the Prime Minister and ministers to tell the truth. </para><para>The Australian people deserve better than John Howard. The Australian people deserve a truthful, honest and decent government. The fact is we have seen, with the family debt trap, that this government will say anything and do anything to get re-elected.

The Australian people are waking up to this government. They are waking up to its unwillingness to tell the truth. The government always say, `Let's worry about the truth after the election,' like they did last time, when the truth was thrown overboard. I say to working Australians: do not trust the Howard government. The Australian people deserve better than John Howard. They deserve a new government, a fresh government—a Latham Labor government with fresh ideas, with energy; a Latham Labor government committed to honesty and integrity in governing our great country.  </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>31548</page.no><name role="metadata">Andrews, Kevin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDREWS</name><name.id>HK5</name.id><electorate>Menzies</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—One thing we can be sure of is that Australian Labor Party members deserve a decent spokesperson on workplace relations.

It was basically one of the most lightweight performances we have seen in this House for a long time. </para><para>Let me address the question of collective bargaining in this country. What we have in terms of the policies of the government, compared to those of the Labor Party, is a situation where the Australian Labor Party refuses to allow Australian workers the freedom to choose their own terms and conditions of employment. This coalition government believes that both workers and businesses should have the freedom to choose working arrangements which best suit their needs. Both the coalition and the Labor Party believe that workers should have the right to be represented by unions, but the fundamental difference between the two parties is that Labor wants union membership to the exclusion of all other options. The government wants workers to have the freedom to choose whether to belong to a union or engage directly as an individual in the workplace with their employer to set workplace agreements with third parties. </para><para>Yesterday the honourable member for Rankin asked me a question—I think the first question and the only question that he has asked me in relation to industrial relations. In it there was a suggestion from him that somehow Australian workers are not able to collectively bargain. May I remind him of the provisions of the Workplace Relations Act, which as the spokesman he does not seem to have even read. Section 170LJ states that an employer may make an agreement with one or more organisations of employees—in other words, in normal parlance, with trade unions. Section 170LK states that an employer may make an agreement with a valid majority of the persons employed at the time—namely, a group of workers within a particular business. </para><para>Let us look at the actual details of the number of people who have made such agreements in Australia. Section 170LJ agreements are where the unions in effect bargain on behalf of the workers for a certified agreement. Between December 1996 and 31 March 2004 there have been 30,809 of those agreements covering 3,695,400 Australian workers. That is hardly a situation in which Australian workers are unable to make collective agreements. Under section 170LK, over that same period of time, 6,301 non-union collective agreements have been made, covering 465,700 workers. </para><para>In terms of the facts about what was raised by the member for Rankin, he obviously has not read the Workplace Relations Act and has not looked at the details as far as agreements are concerned. It is no wonder, because we on this side all know, and half of his colleagues say, that he does not really want this particular job; he is trying to line up to be the Treasurer, if he can, if Labor were ever elected to government. That is the factual situation we are dealing with.</para><para>What is the Labor Party's proposal in relation to freedom of choice? As far as the Labor Party are concerned, they want so-called good faith bargaining, which requires employers to bargain in good faith. Let me point out to the House that under the Workplace Relations Act there are provisions which require the Industrial Relations Commission to act according to equity, good conscience and the substantial merits of the case. Indeed, in a case before the Industrial Relations Tribunal in October last year, the full bench of the Industrial Relations Commission ruled that these provisions include the power for the commission to issue directions to ensure a fair process is adopted.</para><para>So a case of bargaining fairness is something which is already provided for in the Workplace Relations Act in Australia and something which, in December last year, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission made reference to. The Labor Party are not advocating fair bargaining. That is a misnomer for what they are saying when they talk about good-faith bargaining. What it should be called is union monopoly bargaining, because what the Australian Labor Party are proposing is that unions will have the right to become involved in enterprise bargaining, even against the wishes of the business concerned. In a bargaining process it will force businesses, under the threat of law, if it were never introduced by the Labor Party, to reveal sensitive business and financial details to the union during the period of negotiation. That means that employers will be forced by the Australian Labor Party, if they are ever elected to government, to negotiate with the union, regardless of whether or not their employees actually want that process of negotiation. Therefore, under Labor's proposals, the businesses will be forced to negotiate on the unions' terms. This is part and parcel of the Labor Party's proposals.</para><para>In addition to those hundreds of thousands, indeed millions, of employees in Australia under collective certified agreements, this government introduced the ability for employers and employees to enter into individual agreements—so-called Australian workplace agreements. Since that was introduced, a choice of industrial mechanisms can be used: a person can have a collective bargaining process done on their behalf by a union, or a group of employees in a particular business can collectively bargain, or, as an alternative, an individual employee can bargain with their employer on that individual basis and enter into an Australian workplace agreement. What we are saying is that Australian workers ought to have the opportunity not only to collectively bargain but also to reach individual Australian workplace agreements.</para><para>What the Australian Labor Party want to do—not just want to do but propose in their written policy platform—is abolish Australian workplace agreements. That is to say that, for the almost half a million employees who have entered into these in Australia, you should not have the right and the opportunity to have an individual agreement with your employer. That is what the Australian Labor Party are proposing. Instead of leaving it to employers and unions to come to an agreement, the commission will have the power to impose an enterprise agreement if employers do not concede to their demands. Under legislation in Western Australia, and it is also proposed under South Australian legislation, we are starting to see this happen already, and the honourable member for Rankin would like to see this nationally. We believe that businesses should be free to make their own plans and arrangements and not be forced to a union agenda. </para><para>What this is about, when we come to the core, the nub, of the Labor Party's proposition, is a policy that is simply about giving unions a legislative leg-up by dealing them back into the bargaining process. You could ask yourself: why would the Australian Labor Party want to do this? Surely they are about freedom of opportunity and choice on behalf of their workers. As I said, we have had nearly half a million Australian workplace agreements. If workers want to enter into an individual arrangement with their employers, surely they should have that choice. What crazy motive stands behind this proposition from the Australian Labor Party to whip away the choice that Australian workers and employers currently have? It comes down to a couple of things.</para><para>It is interesting to look at the current make-up of the Australian Labor Party compared to what it was some years ago. In 1983, when union members made up 49 per cent of the Australian work force, almost one in two Australians were members of a union. At that stage, the union members comprised just 29 per cent of the federal parliamentary Labor Party in this country. Since then, union membership has declined in Australia from 49 per cent to 23 per cent overall—half of what it was back in 1983. Yet, over that period, the number of Labor Party parliamentarians having a union background has increased from 29 per cent to 74 per cent—that is, 2½ times what it was. So when union membership in Australia has been decreasing from 49 per cent to 23 per cent overall, and in the private sector it is down to 17 per cent—so less than one in five Australian workers are now members of a union—we have had the opposite occurring as far as the Australian Labor Party are concerned.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>FK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Kelly, De-Anne, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs De-Anne Kelly</name></talker><para>—Not representative.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>HK5</name.id><name role="metadata">Andrews, Kevin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDREWS</name></talker><para>—So almost three-quarters of the members of the federal Australian Labor Party come from a union background. That is in no way representative of the Australian work force today; in fact, it is going in the opposite direction. In addition to that, since 1996 the unions in Australia—the big union bosses—have donated $40 million to the Australian Labor Party. Imagine the outcry if the Business Council of Australia had donated $40 million to the Liberal Party or The Nationals. So far as I am aware, they have not donated anything, but imagine the outcry if $10 million, $20 million, $30 million or $40 million had been donated by major business organisations like the Business Council or the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry to the Liberal Party or The Nationals. That is not the case. But $40 million, it seems, buys you a lot of policy within the Australian Labor Party.</para></talk.start></continue><para><inline font-style="italic">Honourable members interjecting</inline><inline font-style="italic">—</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

As I said, Australian workplace agreements are being entered into in Australia at the rate of about 12,000 per month. Last month we saw a record number of almost 16,000 approvals of Australian workplace agreements. Employees covered by these agreements are earning on average 29 per cent more than colleagues covered by federal certified agreements. Women on Australian workplace agreements are earning on average 32 per cent more than those who are employed on the collective certified agreements. So what we have here, simply, is not only the opportunity for Australians to enter into individual contracts but that opportunity being realised for them individually and for their families in higher wages. But this is part of the massive regression of policy which is being proposed by the Australian Labor Party should they win office. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Increasingly we see what their policy is: increasing the powers of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to impose solutions on the work force, strengthening union bargaining power, restricting business capacity to make non-union individual agreements, increasing the award regulation of workplaces and increasing the powers for trade unions to enter workplaces, organise and take industrial action. In short, Labor under Mark Latham will undo the reforms that were made in the Workplace Relations Act 1996 but, in addition to that, they will even undo some of the modest reforms that, to their credit, the Keating government put in place between 1993 and 1996.</para><para>These reforms are important, because the proof of the pudding is in the eating. Look what has happened in Australia over the last seven or eight years. We have created the circumstances, through this more flexible work force, where 1.3 million extra jobs have been created in Australia. Indeed, more full-time jobs have been created in Australia in the last six months than in the last six years of the Labor government. Unemployment is at a 23-year low—at 5.5 per cent in May 2004. Full-time employment is at a record high, with more than 6.9 million Australians in full-time work. Between 1996 and 2004, real wages for full-time employees have risen by some $140. Strikes are at historic lows in Australia at the present time. And these reforms are all at threat of being undone by the regressive policies of the Labor Party.

In its report, it found that some 21 per cent of Australian households—that is, 3.6 million Australians—now live on less than $400 per week. I think what was most extraordinary about the poverty inquiry was that in past years the single greatest cause of poverty in Australia was joblessness. What is frightening about the report that was handed down this year was that it identified a new phenomenon in Australia called the working poor.</para><para>I want to give the minister some of the figures, not necessarily from that report but from other sources of information, about what is actually being experienced out there in Australian communities.

It covers people employed in occupations which the minister would surely agree with me are vitally important, like the aged care industry and our hospitality and tourism sector, as well as in our schools and hospitals. It found—and it seemed reasonable to me—that a single person without children needs approximately $550 a week before tax for a decent quality of life. I have already said that there are some 3.6 million Australians living in households that earn less than $400 per week. The full-time Australian minimum wage at the moment is approximately $470 a week, so we actually have a minimum wage set in this country which is already below that figure that is seen as necessary for people to have a decent quality of life.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Eighty-seven per cent of the jobs that have been created in the last decade, including jobs that the minister takes credit for, are jobs that pay less than $500 a week. Indeed, almost half of the jobs that I refer to pay less than $300 a week. You might be interested to know, Minister Andrews, that weekly wages for low-paid workers have actually gone backwards. During the 1990s, they went backwards by 14.4 per cent. You may also find it interesting to know—and I suspect that this helps your averages—that the weekly wages of managers over the same period went up by 41.4 per cent. In 1992, CEOs made 22 times as much as ordinary workers in Australia. In 2002, they made 74 times as much as ordinary workers.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83V</name.id><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Dr Emerson</name></talker><para>—The rich get richer, the poor get the picture.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AN2</name.id><name role="metadata">Jackson, Sharryn, MP</name><name role="display">Ms JACKSON</name></talker><para>—That is right.

Not only does that mean that we have a growing class of workers who are not able to access basic entitlements like sick leave, annual leave, maternity leave or any of those other benefits or conditions; these people also do not know whether they have a job from one day to the next. You cannot secure a loan from a bank or any other financial institution to buy a house, to afford a car or to meet any of those other costs of living that we have, without having secure employment. </para><para>No doubt the minister would subscribe to the view that every worker in Australia should go to work being fearful and scared about being sacked every day. Certainly, if his workplace relations fair dismissals legislation had gone through, there would be a class of people who had no right or access to redress in the event that they were unfairly dismissed. The minister and this government are consistent over this idea of fear and insecurity. They say, `The more we make Australian people fearful and the more we make them insecure, the more we put them where we want,' and that is a disgraceful and despicable way to conduct business in Australia.</para><para>The minister is repeatedly dishonest about Labor policy and what he understands it to mean. There were a number of examples of that today. The classic was the misrepresentation of Labor's position with respect to bargaining. I do not know what the minister did before he came into parliament, but his own reading of the provisions of the industrial relations act has demonstrated his ignorance on this point. He has absolutely no idea. The point we were talking about was that there was no ability under the laws of Australia—your laws, Minister; this federal law—to compel an employer who does not want to bargain with his or her employees to bargain. There is nothing in your legislation which you can rely on to compel an employer to bargain in good faith. If a boss does not want it, it does not happen. That is how your system works, but that is probably exactly the system that you want: one where the boss calls the shots and decides about agreements. Your vision of what an AWA is absolutely amuses me. An AWA is an individual contract. Individual contracts have been legal in Australia forever. What has been illegal in Australia, until people like you took control of this policy area, was to pay less than prescribed minimums well established in our community. That is what you have made legal.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

The minister and his government have made legal the ability to drive down the wages and conditions of ordinary working people. If you are a skilled employee and your skills are in demand, you might have some ability in an open market to demand higher rates of pay. But if you are employed in a low-paid occupation or are casual, you have no power. I operated in the system in Western Australia, where workplace agreements were prevalent. I witnessed people actually losing pay every week off their hourly rate, as they were forced into AWAs or workplace agreements and to take the job or resign. In the case of cleaners in the contract cleaning industry in Western Australia, over a two-year period their average hourly rate of pay was reduced by $2 an hour. Minister, if that is a system that you applaud and think should continue, get out there and be honest about it. Do not hide behind some notion that there is fairness happening out there with respect to collective bargaining.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83V</name.id><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—The member for Rankin is warned!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AN2</name.id><name role="metadata">Jackson, Sharryn, MP</name><name role="display">Ms JACKSON</name></talker><para>—The minister's view of what happens is extraordinary. Also, I think it demonstrates the government's values. We got a lecture the other day I think from the Minister for Education, Science and Training about values and values in our education system. Let us talk about the values that the industrial relations legislation of this government demonstrates. Their values are that the notion of a fair go all round—that great Australian ethos of fairness—is not one that is appropriate in the workplace. You do not think there should be redress for harsh or unfair treatment. Probably in the minister's little fantasy world, there is no harsh or unfair treatment out there in Australian workplaces. He thinks it is all hunky-dory. I am almost embarrassed sometimes to hear the minister speak on industrial relations. I am sure that, when his advisers or people with experience from his department are in the box, they cringe and feel exactly the same way. If I look on the bright side, he might be doing more than other ministers to assist with the election of a Latham Labor government.

He spoke about everything else—tax, health, promises and the whole lot—but not industrial relations. I think the member for Rankin actually read out the MPI and that was his contribution to the industrial relations debate today.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It was a job interview.

The domestic moggy came in today, just for the one day, to rule the patch. Of course, he was not up to it. As I said, he was speaking on every other issue bar his own. I would say to the member for Rankin that, as far as this MPI goes, he is probably a far better representative of the parliamentary rugby team than he is of his own MPI and his own portfolio.

They know that, the more they talk about industrial relations and ALP IR policies, the more the community understands what the ALP has in store for them after the next election. The more they talk about it, the more they will be exposed for turning this country back to a pre-1996 industrial relations world. The business community will be exposed to ALP policies and, if the member for Rankin will not do it, certainly we will. Every member on this side is certainly tuned in to what the ALP plans to do in the area of industrial relations. Every business will also be tuned in to it over the next few months. I say to the small business community in the electorate of Deakin and elsewhere around Australia: watch out, because what the alternative government has in place is going to destroy your business.</para><para>We have heard it said many times in this place that the ALP is bad for the nation, bad for business and bad for jobs. It is not just a cliche. Have a look at the policies. You do not have to go too far to look at them. You need to go only as far back as the ALP national conference, where this member—the member for Rankin—stood up and moved many of the motions which will destroy this country. In fact, he gloated at that ALP national conference when he proclaimed quite clearly that the `Labor Party and the unions are in partnership once again'. In fact, I would say that it is certainly not a partnership situation but rather a master-servant situation, with the union movement calling the shots.</para><para>The ALP policy and this MPI are not about equality or even-handedness. This MPI is about one thing: helping out ALP mates in the union movement. The objection to the member for Rankin's and the opposition's claim that we have misled working Australians is that Labor wants to give union bosses a foot back into Australian workplaces. Let us have a look at the platform. Back in January, it said:</para><quote><para>A law which requires an employer of a non-unionised work force to bargain with a union on wages and employment conditions above award levels would give trade union officials a dominant agenda-setting role in bargaining across the economy.</para></quote><para>This is exactly what those opposite are on about. The ALP platform is about creating a law which would provide a dominant agenda-setting role in bargaining across the economy for the union movement. Why should the union movement have a dominant bargaining role across the economy? They certainly should have a role, but when you see the decline in union membership and the fact that people are turning away from the union movement in droves, this policy is simply about giving unions a legislative leg-up by dealing them back into the bargaining process.</para><para>I say to the member for Rankin and members on the other side: union membership in the work force is now 23 per cent. In the private sector it is now 17 per cent. That is certainly a far cry from the halcyon days of the sixties and seventies. Union membership of the ALP caucus, however, is 74 per cent. It is not representative of the community. It is not representative even of their own membership. As union membership in the work force has declined, union membership of the ALP caucus has continued to grow ever upwards. In 1983, union members were 49 per cent of the work force and unionists comprised 29 per cent of the ALP caucus. Now we have the situation where it is 17 per cent of the private sector and 74 per cent of the caucus. What contrasting statistics! What message do they send out to the Australian community: that the people on the other side—the alternative government—do not represent the workers out in the community. I am afraid to say that, from what I understand and from what I have been told by the business community, those statistics will become even more damning in years to come. </para><para>Under Labor's proposal, businesses will be forced to negotiate on the union's terms. The ALP policy to require employers to bargain in good faith with a union is nothing but a misnomer and a joke. In fact, it should be called union monopoly bargaining. What it really means is giving unions a right to become involved in enterprise bargaining against the wishes of the business. It will force businesses to reveal sensitive business and financial details to the union during negotiations. It will mean that employers will be forced to negotiate with unions regardless of whether they or their employees wish to. Who knows—perhaps we may even see some of the tactics that were put to such effective use around my electorate by the CFMEU coming back again: tactics, which I note that the member for Rankin has never criticised, by Mr Craig Johnston at Skillshare and also Johnston Tiles at both ends of my electorate.</para><para>The ALP is planning to hurt business through its industrial relations policies. In stark contrast to some members on the other side who have said that the ALP platform is just a platform and it is not policy, the Leader of the Opposition, Mark Latham, said on 31 January 2004:</para><quote><para>Once the platform is adopted, it is binding on everyone in the party, from the new greenhorn recruit out in the branches of my electorate, right through to the federal parliamentary leader.</para></quote><para>That is what the member for Werriwa said. The industrial relations platform is a great guide to what the ALP is going to do to destroy this nation. Those opposite cannot hide behind the fact that it is only a platform or that it was only a national conference—it is binding on every member from the greenhorn right through to the parliamentary leader. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

Therefore I am obliged to make some comments about the matter. It is fair to say that the Public Works Committee was put in a position of having to comment on what the government should or should not do in relation to this matter. This matter goes to the potential refitting and refurbishment of the buildings which the parliamentary secretary has mentioned; however, the amount we are talking about is in excess of $100 million and we believe that the Public Works Committee was not in a position to do anything other than what is happening now.</para></talk.start><para>The reason we were not in a position to do anything else is that the government, in relation to this matter, failed to foresee that the lease of the building the Australian Federal Police are currently occupying is going to expire in September 2006. I contend the government should have been well aware of that fact and should not have put the Public Works Committee in such a difficult position. Of course we do not want to see the Australian Federal Police without a roof. We do not want to see them out of a home. Particularly in this current climate, it is essential that the Australian Federal Police are properly looked after. But it should not have taken the rescission of a referral to the Public Works Committee for this matter to be properly looked after.</para><para>It means that, given that the government has not foreseen the end of a lease that is currently in place in September 2006 because the government has not been focusing on its job in administering this matter, $100 million of taxpayers' money is going to be spent without any proper public scrutiny. I know I reflect the concerns of other members of the Public Works Committee that this matter has come before the chamber as a result of the incompetence of the minister in not foreseeing the end of the lease that the Australian Federal Police have for a particular building and not realising that the building owner is not in a position to or does not wish to extend that lease. For those reasons and because the government failed to have proper regard to those circumstances, we are now in a position where over $100 million of expenditure is not going to be properly scrutinised pursuant to the Public Works Committee Act.</para><para>I believe it is an unfortunate situation that we find ourselves in. It is comparable to the urgency motion moved by the parliamentary secretary with respect to the reception and detention centre at Christmas Island, which I have to say was a complete bungling by the government. There has been definitely been an enormous amount of Commonwealth expenditure wasted in the way in which that was handled by the Department of Finance and Administration—DOFA—and by another department. Here we have DOFA again failing to indicate to the Public Works Committee that the committee will not be able to properly scrutinise over $100 million because the department did not foresee that the building owner may not want to extend the lease beyond September 2006. I think it is a shameful situation. I have to say that it was certainly under some duress that the Public Works Committee decided not to oppose what the government is doing today because we do not want to put the Australian Federal Police in a position where they are not adequately looked after, given the current climate. We believe the minister and the department should have paid more regard to these very important matters, given the heightened security needs of this nation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>31562</page.no><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SLIPPER</name><name.id>0V5</name.id><electorate>Fisher</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—One can at times sense when there is an election in the air, just around the corner or a number of months away, when we find that the bipartisan committee process is politicised by a person of no less senior position than the deputy chairman of the Public Works Committee.

Certainly you are aware that the work of the committee could not proceed without a very high level of cooperation.  </para></talk.start><para>There is very little controversy with respect to these matters. The government very strongly supports the principle that matters ought to be referred to the Public Works Committee, and this matter was in fact referred to the committee. I think my department has an excellent relationship with the Public Works Committee. I see the member for Burke is conceding that point and nodding. I spoke about this matter over lunch to the honourable member for Pearce, who is the chair of the committee. She agreed that there is a great deal of cooperation between the government and the committee. We reject the allegations—perhaps election-driven allegations—by the member for Burke that the government has in some way been incompetent or dilatory in referring the matter to the Public Works Committee.</para><para>But, as the member for Burke would be well aware, there is a great deal of public works infrastructure carried out by the government. There is a lot of work referred to the Public Works Committee. In a democratic society, every three years we have an election. As we approach the end of a parliamentary term, there are certain matters that just have to be got through. While it would be desirable to subject this project to the usual thorough, competent, cooperative scrutiny of the Public Works Committee, I think the member for Burke in his contribution even conceded that in this case that is not possible. We are at one that it is not possible to have this matter dealt with by the committee. It was referred to the committee. The committee then wrote to the government pointing out that it might not be possible to follow due process in time. In fact, I have a letter here from the honourable member for Pearce, who says:</para><quote><para>The committee therefore recommends that the referral of the work be withdrawn and that the work be made the subject of a motion in the House of Representatives to the effect that it is expedient to carry out the work without referral to the committee.</para></quote><para>So in effect the committee and the government are in agreement that this matter ought to be withdrawn. We as a government reject the party political allegations of the deputy chairman, the member for Burke. We have not been dilatory; we have not taken our eye off the ball. The government at all times have been timely with respect to this matter. I would be remiss if I did not also reject the allegations made by the member for Burke with respect to the Christmas Island matter, which of course is a matter quite different from the motion that is currently before the chamber, but in his remarks he did take a gratuitous sideswipe at the government over that matter.

This report presents the committee's review of Australia's aviation security. The review arose from the committee's statutory obligation to review reports of the Auditor-General, namely audit report No. 26, 2002-03, entitled <inline font-style="italic">Aviation security in Australia</inline>, which was tabled in January 2003. Australia's aviation industry services approximately 50 million international and domestic passenger movements each year and involves some 70,000 employees who contribute in one way or another to aviation security. The industry is regulated by the Department of Transport and Regional Services.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The committee has reviewed over 500 pages of submissions and over 400 pages of transcript of evidence taken at six public hearings and has inspected Sydney airport and two regional airports. The headline for the committee's review is that it provides a positive report card for aviation security in Australia at this point in time. The committee has assessed the current threat environment within which Australia's aviation industry operates, the opportunities and costs of security enhancements, the aviation security framework and the human aspects of security, including the culture of security. </para><para>In summary, the committee has found that the security measures under which aviation security operates in Australia are appropriate to the current level of threat, there is flexibility to adjust the framework to meet changing threats and the culture of security is positive. The committee has identified the security culture as being one of the more important aspects of security and is pleased with the attitude of employees at the interface between the aviation industry and the travelling public. The committee has drawn on its own experiences of airline travel in Australia and overseas and notes the friendly, yet firm and professional, attitude of the staff involved in aviation security in our country. This security attitude in Australia contrasts markedly with the attitudes of security personnel, particularly screeners, in some other countries. The alternative—belligerence, heavy-handedness and arrogance—will not engage the public and will hinder security outcomes.</para><para>The committee has made five recommendations aimed at: clarifying the interaction between the newly created Australian government airport security committees and existing airport security committees; strengthening the regulations by the inclusion in them of the non-negotiable aspects of the security framework; improving the procedures for the return of expired aviation security identification cards; broadening security awareness training to cover everyone who has access to security-controlled areas at airports; and maintaining the positive security culture through the introduction of educational measures aimed at promoting a robust security culture.</para><para>Overall, the committee is satisfied that the standard of security at Australia's airports and on aircraft is sufficient to meet the current threat environment. From time to time there will be security incidents triggered by circumstances at various layers in the system. Sometimes an incident which may appear trivial to the casual observer will cause major disruption. The committee believes this shows aviation participants are taking their security responsibilities seriously.</para><para>In conclusion, I would like to express the committee's appreciation to those people who contributed to the inquiry by preparing submissions, giving evidence at public hearings and providing briefings to the committee at private meetings and during inspections of airport facilities. I also wish to thank the members of the sectional committee involved for their time and dedication in conducting this inquiry, in particular the deputy chair, the member for Sydney. I also thank the secretariat staff: the acting secretary to the committee, Mr James Catchpole; the inquiry secretary, Dr John Carter; research staff, Ms Mary Ellen Miller; and administrative staff, Ms Maria Miniutti and Ms Jessica Butler.

I believe it was quite reassuring to see that all of the major players take airport security very seriously. We did not uncover a culture of complacency, and I think that was very reassuring to the committee. However, we cannot afford to leave it there. Any proper security environment in airports or anywhere else does require a continued commitment.</para></talk.start><para>The five recommendations that we came up with are all very important but I would have to say that recommendation 3, looking at aviation security identification cards, was the one that most struck me during the evidence that we took. It is very important that, once people have stopped working at an airport or for an associated business, we have means of recovering those aviation security identification cards, and I particularly draw the attention of the House to that recommendation. </para><para>As I said, there was generally a good culture in relation to security, but part of that good culture is that complacency has not developed and we have to be vigilant into the future to ensure that it does not. There is no cause for complacency. I would like to add my thanks to those of the chair, Bob Charles, the member for La Trobe. The other members of the committee did an excellent job but I would particularly like to thank the committee secretariat, James Catchpole, as well as John Carter, Mary Ellen Miller, Maria Miniutti and Jessica Butler.

Accordingly, the committee conducted an inquiry into the ACC's involvement in assessing trafficking for the purposes of sexual servitude in Australia. The committee's inquiry was, in part, prompted by reports alleging that government agencies had mishandled cases of trafficked women. During the committee's inquiry, the government launched its national action plan to combat trafficking in women. The plan includes a range of measures funded by an allocation of $20 million. The inquiry focused on three major issues: the extent of trafficking in women into Australia for the sex trade, the effectiveness of the national action plan and the adequacy of Australia's relevant legislation. This was seen as part of the inquiry.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The extent of trafficking of women for sexual servitude proved difficult to establish, principally due to differing definitions of the crime. It seems that around 300 women are trafficked into the country each year for sex work. However, the number that can be considered to be kept in sexual servitude is likely to be relatively small, although estimates vary from 10 to 1,000. What is clear is that there is a continuum of those who have been trafficked into Australia. This ranges from those who entered with full knowledge and consent to those who entered with consent but were deceived as to their working conditions to those who entered Australia completely deceived as to their work in the sex industry.</para><para>The committee found the evidence of working conditions for women in this industry deeply disturbing. The conditions under which many of these women work are Dickensian. Working a six or seven day week with little freedom of movement, they suffer from poor nutrition and are often confined to their basic accommodation. The women must see as many as 10 customers per day, with no control over which customers they see or what sexual acts they are forced to perform. Many women are the victims of sexual and physical assaults and suffer a range of physical and emotional health problems.</para><para>Traffickers provide fraudulent documentation which allows women to gain entry visas to Australia. In exchange, the victim incurs a debt to the traffickers of around $35,000. The committee was particularly alarmed at the ease with which traffickers appeared able to obtain entry visas for the women they bring into the country each year. As a result, the committee has recommended that the Australian Crime Commission focus its investigations on the methods by which people traffickers are able to circumvent Australian immigration barriers through visa fraud. </para><para>The committee commends the government for the release of the national action plan. However, several potential weaknesses of the plan became apparent to the committee. Firstly, although an interdepartmental committee has been formed to coordinate the government response, roles and responsibilities could be made clearer. The committee has recommended that its role should be strengthened by the formal appointment of a chairperson and the drafting of a charter. Secondly, the committee considers that the measures for the protection and support of trafficked women are inadequate.</para><para>The new arrangements, as announced in the government package, are a distinct improvement on the old. However, while trafficked women are recognised as victims of crime, under the victim support package women receive only basic benefits equivalent to the special benefit level. This is the same as that received by, among others, asylum seekers. The committee does not believe this adequately reflects the level of danger faced by women who agree to assist Australian law enforcement agencies or the vital importance of their cooperation in the investigation and prosecution of traffickers. To address this, the committee has recommended that the benefits payable to these women be benchmarked against those available under the witness protection scheme.</para><para>The final matter examined by the committee is the adequacy of Australian law in relation to trafficking. The government's national action plan includes a review of the relevant laws. The committee suggests that this review take place as soon as possible, and it should focus particularly on measures needed to ensure Australia's compliance with the United Nations protocol. The committee also recommends the review include the following: the addition of Criminal Code provisions, covering the recruitment and transportation of women; the expansion of the definition of deception to include deception regarding the kind of services to be provided, whether of a sexual nature or not; and consideration of adopting the use of victim impact statements in sentencing.</para><para>The government has already indicated its intention to ratify the protocol and the committee recommends that this occur as soon as possible. It is important to ensure that Australian law reflects a consistent approach to what is an international problem. The implementation of the national action plan as well as ratification of the protocol will go a long way towards realising this goal.</para><para>In bringing forward this report, I want to acknowledge the support of the committee and their dedication to the task—particularly, my deputy chair, the member for Maribyrnong, Mr Bob Sercombe, and the secretary of the committee, Jonathan Curtis, as well as the other members of the committee. It was an interesting review. Obviously, we see these recommendations as significant in preventing widespread abuse and what is unfortunately a very sad practice within Australian society.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>31567</page.no><name role="metadata">Sercombe, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SERCOMBE</name><name.id>QK6</name.id><electorate>Maribyrnong</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I do not think there is any doubt that the great bulk of the credit for recent improvements in the Australian approach in relation to the practice of trafficking women for sexual servitude rests with the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>, particularly the investigations editor, Natalie O'Brien, who was supported by a number of other people, including Elisabeth Wynhausen. This particular newspaper and the individuals I have referred to carried out quite an extensive public campaign in relation to a number of practices. In many respects, I believe the committee's inquiry reflects the public attention that was drawn to the issues, and also I believe the government's action plan reflects that heightening of public awareness, largely through the campaign of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>. All credit to them. </para></talk.start><para>The committee's inquiry slightly predates the government's announcement of an action plan. We may have had some modest impact on the government's decision in that respect too. As the member for Cook indicated, the government's action plan is a significant, in fact, dramatic improvement on the position that existed prior to the introduction of the action plan, and the quite shameful ignoring of the problems, particularly under the administration of the former Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. However, as the committee's inquiry indicates, there are a number of areas of significant improvement needed on what the government's announcement included and the committee has dealt with a number of them.</para><para>The member for Cook has outlined the question of providing sufficient incentive for women who are probably under some risk from organised criminals when they cooperate within Australian law enforcement in these matters. It has been quite inadequate. Addressing the benefits to which women would be entitled if they remained in Australia to assist law enforcement investigations was an important matter, as were issues in relation to the type of visa the women are on. The committee has made some recommendations, for example that witnesses be allowed to return to their country of origin for short periods in certain circumstances to enable contact with their families whilst criminal investigation and prosecution matters are afoot. In those respects and in terms of improving the efficacy of law enforcement in this area, I think the committee has made some fairly useful suggestions.</para><para>Similarly, the committee has made some recommendations on improvements of the Australian Criminal Code, particularly in broadening the offence of deception that is a characteristic of the practices of traffickers. Also, as the member for Cook has indicated, the committee's recommendations indicated it is anxious for the Australian Crime Commission to focus its efforts in this area on the methods by which people traffickers are able clearly to circumvent Australian immigration barriers through visa fraud. Additionally, as the member for Cook indicated, the committee has come up with some proposals to strengthen the bureaucratic structures with which the Commonwealth will now conduct its welcome activities in this area through the national action plan. These are important areas for Australia's international reputation.</para><para>Just the other week on Wednesday, 16 June, the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> produced an article by Natalie O'Brien, to whom I referred earlier, which was headed `Australia listed for sex slave problem'. So Australia, along with other countries, is going to continue to remain under international scrutiny in relation to its performance in this area. I hope that the committee's work in this area will make a modest contribution to improving the situation.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee</title><page.no>31568</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>31568</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>31568</page.no><name role="metadata">Baird, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BAIRD</name><name.id>MP6</name.id><electorate>Cook</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade I present the committee's report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Human rights and good governance education in the Asia Pacific region</inline><inline font-style="italic">.</inline></para></talk.start><para>Ordered that the report be printed.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>MP6</name.id><name role="metadata">Baird, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BAIRD</name></talker><para>—by leave—Good human rights education is a key to ensuring that the concept of human rights underpins our legislative framework, our social policies and the way we think about others and ourselves. The protection of human rights depends on them being accepted, observed and protected by each and every member of our society. This requires that people are educated and informed about human rights principles, the relevant international human rights instruments and the impact of human rights on their daily lives. Similarly, it is increasingly recognised that the way a society is governed has a direct correlation to the success of social, political and economic development, including the protection and promotion of human rights.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The decade 1995-2004 was designated as the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education. As a contribution to achieving the goals of the decade and to address the increasing recognition of the importance of good governance to development and the promotion and protection of human rights, the committee decided to review and take stock of Australia's contribution not only to the decade but to the broad promotion of human rights and good governance in the region. This is the report of that inquiry.</para><para>The committee received 45 submissions to the inquiry and took evidence from representatives of 16 organisations during public hearings. The committee found a lack of consensus on the level of community understanding of human rights and good governance in Australia, demonstrating that current promotional and educative approaches are not having the desired impact. The relationship between human rights education and good governance education was not clearly addressed in the submissions to this inquiry, and the two terms were, on the whole, conflated. This leads to confusion as to the relationship between education in human rights and education in good governance, and what qualifications and training are required to be considered an effective educator in either area.</para><para>The committee recommends that Australia works towards developing consensus on a definition of hu-man rights and good governance regionally, with the aim of promoting the development of a regional human rights education agreement. The committee also concludes that there is a need to provide better coordination of human rights and good governance education efforts in Australia. At present, domestic efforts appear to be a collection of worthwhile yet fragmented programs that are not well integrated into the core curriculum in Australian schools and universities, and there is a noticeable lack of community based initiatives.</para><para>There is a need for coordination frameworks to provide direction and assist with the better use of resources and sharing of knowledge and experiences. Such coordination should bring together all parties involved in human rights education in Australia in an effort to combat divergence and the confusion this leads to in achieving the goals of the decade. This issue of coordination of human rights and good governance education initiatives should have been addressed at the beginning of the UN Decade for Human Rights Education in 1995. It is with this in mind that the committee believes the development of a discrete national plan of action for human rights education should be a priority for government, HREOC and the National Committee on Human Rights Education.</para><para>The committee has noted that the role played by HREOC in domestic human rights education is an important one in Australia, and supports HREOC's continuing focus and responsibility in this area. The committee believes human rights education should be provided to all Commonwealth public sector employees, particularly those whose work is affected by international human rights. This should include predeployment training provided by the Department of Defence, including a specific human rights education program focusing on international human rights law. Further, the committee recommends that human rights education be incorporated into all levels of civics and citizenship education initiatives in Australia. </para><para>At a regional level, there are many activities being undertaken in the Asia-Pacific in the broad area of human rights and good governance education. However, again, this work is generally not well coordinated between states or organisations. The committee also recommends that human rights and governance education be clearly identified as a key component and outcome in the strategies and objectives of AusAID's governance programs and projects. Although Australia continues to support progress towards a regional human rights mechanism and to ensure that human rights education is central to any such agreement, the committee believes much effort needs to be applied to better utilise existing regional structures in meeting the goals of the decade.</para><para>Australia is involved in human rights and good governance education across a broad spectrum of activities. As one of the world's oldest democracies—and arguably one of the most successful—Australia is in a strong position to make a contribution to the promotion and protection of human rights and the development of good governance in the Asia-Pacific region through its efforts in human rights and good governance education.</para><para>The committee identified the media as an important instrument in the provision of human rights and good governance education. It is therefore suggested that AusAID review its definition of good governance to include a reference to the role of the media, and that the NCHRE work with professional bodies and tertiary schools of communication to develop and implement a specific human rights awareness program for the media.</para><para>In response to calls for a second UN Decade for Human Rights Education, the committee recommends that the Australian government call for the United Nations to conduct a rigorous evaluation of the effectiveness of achievements of the current decade at the earliest possibility and prior to further discussion on an additional decade. In conclusion, and on behalf of the committee, I would like to thank the range of groups and individuals that contributed to this inquiry and I would like to thank the secretariat for their support. I commend the report to the House.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>31570</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund Committee</title><page.no>31570</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>31570</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>31570</page.no><name role="metadata">Secker, Patrick, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SECKER</name><name.id>848</name.id><electorate>Barker</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of the Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund, I present the committee's report on the examination of annual reports 2002-03, together with evidence received by the committee.</para></talk.start><para>Ordered that the report be printed.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>848</name.id><name role="metadata">Secker, Patrick, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SECKER</name></talker><para>—by leave—This report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund on the examination of annual reports for 2002-03 reviews the performance of the National Native Title Tribunal, the Indigenous Land Corporation and the land fund in the reporting period 2002-03. The committee has a statutory duty to examine these annual reports and held public hearings on 12 February 2004 with the National Native Title Tribunal and on 2 March 2004 with the Indigenous Land Corporation in Canberra. </para></talk.start></continue><para>I would like to outline briefly some of the issues which have arisen in the course of the committee's examination of the annual report for the National Native Title Tribunal. In the year covered by this report, the High Court and the Federal Court delivered a number of landmark decisions, including Western Australia v. Ward, Wilson v. Anderson, and Members of the Yorta Yorta Aboriginal Community v. Victoria. These af-fected a range of tribunal activities, including the registration and testing of claimant applications, the mediation and settlement of claimant applications, the areas over which native title might or might not be found to exist and hence the areas where procedural rights under the Native Title Act may or may not be exercised.</para><para>One consequence of those decisions was a slowing down of some activities and some lower than expected outputs. An additional consequence was an increased need for assistance to parties who wished to clarify their positions in the light of the implications of these decisions. The main concern the committee had was the estimating process for the tribunal's work, as well as the associated expenditure. While the committee appreciates that there are uncontrollable variables which affect tribunal outcomes, the committee would like to see closer relationships between expectations and results. However, I hasten to add that the tribunal has presented the parliament with a comprehensive and meticulously prepared document, which not only complies with the formal requirements of reporting, but includes useful information over and above the basic legislative and regulatory requirements.</para><para>I now turn to the report of the Indigenous Land Corporation, which also includes the report on the operation of the Indigenous Land Fund. The Indigenous Land Corporation presented a report which complies with the annual report requirements. The corporation purchases and manages properties for eventual management and ownership by Indigenous people. The corporation's work in the past year included a shift in focus to capacity building for the management of pastoral properties in conjunction with individual Indigenous groups. There is a particular aspect of this which the committee hopes will be featured in next year's ILC annual report: this is the resumption of a stock strategy to feed prime breeding stock from Roebuck Plains Station to other Indigenous owned pastoral leases in the Kimberley. Although the strategy was temporarily suspended, the committee considers that it would assist in the improvement of Roebuck Plains as well as the other properties. </para><para>The committee notes that the requirements for the Indigenous Land Fund under section 192I of the ATSIC Act have been complied with and that the financial statements for 2002-03 have received an unqualified audit report. The Land Fund is at a crossroads in its development. The last payment from government was received last July and strategies are being explored to support the land fund in providing ongoing income for the ILC. It was encouraging to observe that the real return on investments exceeded the 2 per cent per annum previously identified as required, as at 30 June 2002, to reach the June 2004 target balance of the fund.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Transport and Regional Services Committee</title><page.no>31571</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>31571</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>31571</page.no><name role="metadata">Neville, Paul, MP</name><name role="display">Mr NEVILLE</name><name.id>KV5</name.id><electorate>Hinkler</electorate><party>NATS</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Although this particular item is not on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>, on behalf of the Standing Committee on Transport and Regional Services, I present the committee's report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Train </inline><inline font-style="italic">illumination</inline><inline font-style="italic">—inquiry into some measures proposed to improve train visibility and reduce level crossing accidents</inline>, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence given before the committee. </para></talk.start><para>Ordered that the report be printed. </para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>KV5</name.id><name role="metadata">Neville, Paul, MP</name><name role="display">Mr NEVILLE</name></talker><para>—by leave—I thank the House for the opportunity to present this report today. Its contents need to be on the record. Our examination of the question of train lighting followed a briefing that the committee received about a level crossing smash that occurred in Western Australia in July 2000, with the tragic loss of three young lives.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The details of the accident were outlined to the committee by two people, Mrs Merrilea Broad and Mrs Karen Morrissey, who were both closely touched by this tragedy. On behalf of the committee I thank those ladies most sincerely for bringing this matter to our attention and for the valuable contribution they made. Recounting those horrific details must have been a very distressing experience for them, but we appreciate the wonderful job they are doing in trying to raise national awareness of the problems at level crossings.</para><para>We may never fully understand all the factors that contributed to that accident in Western Australia but it demonstrates the need for trains to be more conspicuous at level crossings. The argument is sometimes made that when a train is already part way through the crossing the unmarked wagons are too hard to see, especially in the dark. However, we found the lighting of the front, rear and sides of trains is not that simple a matter.</para><para>Surprisingly, we found that serious accidents occur during daylight hours and at active crossings—those are crossings that are lit or have mechanical devices on them, like boom gates—not just at passive, unlit crossings during the night. A majority of accidents involve a collision with the front of a train. Specifically, we found studies that showed that approximately 70 per cent of vehicle-train collisions in Australia occur during daylight hours; that most crashes occur where the driver has local understanding of the crossing; and that only 32 per cent of crashes occur at passive crossings. Road vehicle hits to the sides of trains occur in only 36 per cent of cases at passive level crossings. Nevertheless, we found that more could be done in a cost-effective way to improve the visibility of trains and we believe that this could make some significant contribution to reducing the number of accidents. </para><para>Sadly, the lighting of the sides of all rolling stock would be a prohibitive cost and, in light of the foregoing figures, unjustified. Our principal recommendation is that all locomotives and rolling stock in the Australian rail industry be fitted with standard reflective—by that I mean iridescent—strips or reflective paint, and that all locomotives be fitted with rotating beacon lights. This should significantly increase the visibility of the sides and fronts—respectively—of trains and help prevent collisions at passive crossings. We have also recommended that a level crossing risk scoring system, based on the Queensland model, be adopted as a national standard. Our other recommendations deal with the installation of rumble strips on the approaches to level crossings and the need for a level crossing education program for vehicle drivers. Thanks are extended to our secretariat leader, Ian Dundas, to Tas Luttrell, the inquiry secretary, and to Shane Read, the research officer, who compiled this excellent report. I commend the report to the House.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>SURVEILLANCE DEVICES BILL (NO. 2) 2004</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>31572</page.no><id.no>R2126</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>31572</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill presented—by leave—by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ruddock</inline>, and read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>31572</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>31572</page.no><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name><name.id>0J4</name.id><electorate>Berowra</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Attorney-General</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>First, I thank the House for its indulgence in relation to moving the motion at this time. I hope it will facilitate the progress of activity in this House and also secure passage of this measure which might otherwise have been delayed because of government amendments—sought, I might say, by the states and others, and which I am proposing in this measure—and by reintroducing a bill that has already been through the House in an amended form. Securing its passage may help in securing prompt passage elsewhere. There is some urgency associated with this matter, on which I will elaborate.</para><para>Australia's law enforcement agencies rely on a variety of law enforcement tools to catch and prosecute serious criminals.</para><para>One important tool is the use of surveillance devices, which could be anything from a hidden microphone to an ordinary video camera.</para><para>Today, however, the powers available to Commonwealth law enforcement for the use of such devices lag sadly behind what technology makes possible and what other jurisdictions permit.</para><para>This bill began as an initiative of the Leaders Summit on Terrorism and Multijurisdictional Crime, held on 5 April 2002.</para><para>A joint working group of Commonwealth, state and territory officials was established by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General and the Australasian Police Ministers Council.</para><para>The joint working group developed comprehensive model laws for all Australian jurisdictions to improve the effectiveness of cross-border criminal investigations in the areas of controlled operations, assumed identities, protection of witness identity and electronic surveillance.</para><para>These model laws were released in a public discussion paper to solicit feedback from groups and individuals on the suitability of these proposed powers.</para><para>The <inline ref="R2126">Surveillance Devices Bill (No. 2) 2004</inline> (the bill) implements the electronic surveillance model bill, tailoring it to the needs of the Commonwealth.</para><para>This bill differs in a number of respects from the <inline ref="R2010">Surveillance Devices Bill (No. 1) 2004</inline>, which is currently before the Senate, and is being introduced for the purposes of expediency so as to ensure that this important legislation is passed before the winter recess.</para><para>The bill will consolidate, expand and modernise the now somewhat outdated surveillance devices powers available to the Commonwealth and provide law enforcement agencies with access to the surveillance tools necessary to protect Australians and to investigate and stop crime.</para><para>The bill allows law enforcement officers of the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Crime Commission or a state or territory police force or other specified agencies investigating a Commonwealth offence to use a greater range of surveillance devices, including data surveillance devices, optical surveillance devices and tracking devices.</para><para>The bill also allows for a surveillance device warrant or authorisation to be issued in relation to a wider range of offences.</para><para>Surveillance device warrants may be issued under this bill, where a child recovery order has been issued by the Family Court to assist with the location and safe recovery of any child who is subject to an order. </para><para>The bill also permits emergency authorisations to be given by a senior executive officer of the law enforcement agency to a law enforcement officer for the use of a surveillance device in circumstances that are characterised by urgency.</para><para>The bill provides for three such situations: where there is an imminent threat of serious risk to a person or substantial damage to property, to recover a child who is the subject of a recovery order, and where there is a risk of the loss of evidence in relation to important specified Commonwealth offences, including terrorism, serious drug offences, treason, espionage and aggravated people smuggling.</para><para>In recognition of the privacy implications of this bill, the bill imposes a range of strong accountability measures.</para><para>The most intrusive types of surveillance must be subject to the scrutiny of a judge or AAT member be-fore the surveillance begins, or, in the case of an emergency authorisation, shortly after the authorisation has been given.</para><para>The subsequent use, disclosure or communication of material gathered by, or relating to, a surveillance de-vice is subject to stringent restrictions.</para><para>Record-keeping requirements ensure that documents relevant to surveillance devices must be kept to estab-lish compliance with the law.</para><para>Chief officers of law enforcement agencies using Commonwealth warrants and authorisations must submit detailed reports, both after a warrant or authorisation has expired and also annually.</para><para>The bill also imposes a duty on the chief officers to destroy surveillance device material when it is not longer relevant to one of the permitted purposes in the bill.</para><para>The role of the Commonwealth Ombudsman as an oversight body is reinforced by this bill. The Ombuds-man must report on a six-monthly basis to the Attorney-General who in turn must table these reports in parliament.</para><para>Importantly, the Ombudsman has the power to com-pel law enforcement officers to answer questions or produce relevant documents.</para><para>This bill will greatly increase the capacity of Austra-lian law enforcement agencies to investigate serious offences, including terrorism, while maintaining an appropriate respect for the privacy of all Australians.</para><para>This bill differs from the Surveillance Devices Bill 2004 in a number of important ways.</para><para>	First, the bill provides for the inclusion of state law enforcement agencies, such as the New South Wales Crime Commission and the Western Austra-lian Corruption and Crime Commission, in addition to state and territory police forces who may obtain Commonwealth surveillance device warrants for the investigation of Commonwealth offences.</para><para>	Second, the bill implements three of the recom-mendations of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee report to provide:</para><para>	for a requirement that surveillance device material held for more than five years be destroyed unless the Chief Officer certifies that it is still needed for a permitted purpose;</para><para>	that the period before which an emergency authorisation must be brought before a judge or AAT member for approval be reduced from `two business days' to `48 hours'; and</para><para>	for a new civil remedies provision which allows those who have suffered loss or injury as a result of illegal use of a surveillance device by the AFP or ACC to sue the Commonwealth. </para><para>	Third, the bill allows the Queensland Public Interest Monitor to have a role with respect to Commonwealth warrants that is consistent with its role regarding state warrants.</para><para>	The bill also allows non-law enforcement officers to record conversations to which they are a party under the direction of a law enforcement officer. This means that an informant may wear a `wire' during a controlled operation.</para><para>	Importantly, the bill allows for a recovery order issued by a court other than the Family Court or with respect to a child removed from another country to be the basis for a warrant or authorisation and adds child sex tourism offences as offences for which a `loss of evidence' emergency authorisation may be obtained.</para><para>	Finally, the bill includes provisions designed to clarify and refine the operation of the surveillance device regime by:</para><para>	allowing for the substitution of an officer primarily responsible for the execution of a warrant or authorisation;</para><para>	making the definition of `state offence with a Federal aspect' consistent with other legislation;</para><para>	improving the operation of tracking device authorisations;</para><para>	marginally changing the definition of `appropriate consenting official' to make extra-territorial use of surveillance devices more feasible;</para><para>	allowing the Commonwealth Ombudsman to dele-gate to equivalent state bodies which are not actually ombudsmen; and</para><para>	giving the Commonwealth Ombudsman respon-sibility for the oversight of all ACC SD use, under either Commonwealth or state law.</para><para>I urge that this bill be passed as a matter of priority, as these are important investigatory tools that need to be made available to law enforcement officers as quickly as possible.

It is also beneficial to the privacy of Australians, in that it brings regulation for the first time to the use of many kinds of surveillance devices under federal law.

They were anxious about this matter. The government was anxious also to facilitate it, and the bill does provide a comprehensive regime covering the use of surveillance at a Commonwealth level. The range of devices is very much wider than it has been. The range of offences has been broadened, and that is important as well. For the first time, we have a proper framework for conducting extraterritorial surveillance. The bill will provide a wide range of powers to law enforcement agencies to fight serious criminal offences, including terrorism. As always in these matters, we seek to include appropriate safeguards, as the member for Barton has noted.

This will enable the important reforms to the livestock export trade to be implemented through the measures in this bill to be put in place as soon as possible. The Senate amendment requires some additional reporting. It is consistent with the government's intention to increase the accountability of the livestock export trade, particularly with respect to the welfare of livestock on voyages to ports outside Australia.

I think it does tighten up this piece of legislation, particularly the accountability mechanisms in the legislation. Both houses of parliament have succeeded in making the livestock export sector more accountable by requiring the tabling of detailed reports in both houses of parliament of shipments that experience high rates of mortality. We have successfully moved those amendments in the Senate to require the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry to provide to the minister a detailed report on live animal exports. According to that amendment, the report must provide the following information: the name of the exporter; the month and year of each shipment; the port where the loading took place; the duration of a voyage; the ports where the animals were unloaded; the types and numbers of animals shipped; the mortality rates; and any action taken by the secretary in relation to the exporters as a result of the reports. Labor's amendment also requires the minister to table that report in each house of parliament. </para></talk.start><para>As I expect to be the minister after the next election, I do not regard these provisions as being very onerous at all. I think it is important that the industry is accountable, not only to this parliament but also to the community. This is an issue that is of real concern now to the Australian community. No doubt the minister's emails have run hot, as mine have, following every media program that has sought to highlight deficiencies in the live export trade. I need to put on the public record again that if this situation had not been allowed to drift as it has been drifting under this government then the situation faced by the meat industry generally as a result of problems in the live export trade might not have occurred. We have moved these amendments to give comfort to the Australian community, and to the rest of the meat industry, that we take this issue seriously and it is really time that the live export trade looked to its practices. I am pleased to say that after promptings by the community and the opposition, the minister has finally moved to get the live export trade to take this criticism seriously and to involve itself in some practices to clean up the trade.</para><para>With the introduction of this legislation, the industry is now on notice that if it does not perform there will be consequences. I do not think anybody ought to have any illusions about the fact that the live export trade is now on notice. I am pleased that the government has brought in legislation in the wake of the Keniry report, as it undertook to do, and I am pleased that this legislation has had a chance to be debated. The full intellect and practice of the parliament has been brought to bear upon it, and in the spirit of making legislation better the government has come to the table to agree to this amendment. I think it is one that can be borne by the secretary of the department, by the industry and by the minister, whoever he or she might be sitting in the chair. At the end of the day, it will be an improvement to the legislative framework that now sits across this industry to ensure that we not only address the concerns of the community, but that we protect the good reputation of the meat industry and farmers in it generally.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BUSINESS</title><type>Business</type><page.no>31578</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Rearrangement</title><page.no>31578</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Mr ROSS CAMERON (Parramatta—Parliament-ary Secretary to the Treasurer) (5.36 p.m.)—I move:</para><motion><para>That business intervening before order of the day 15, gov-ernment business, be postponed until a later hour this day.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>EXTENSION OF CHARITABLE PURPOSE BILL 2004</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>31578</page.no><id.no>R2056</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration of Senate Message</title><page.no>31578</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill returned from the Senate with an amendment.</para><para>Ordered that the amendment be considered forthwith.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Senate's amendment—</inline></para><quote><para>(1)	Clause 4, page 2 (line 9), after “child care”, insert “and playgroup”.</para></quote><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>31578</page.no><name role="metadata">Cameron, Ross, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ROSS CAMERON</name><name.id>3K6</name.id><electorate>Parramatta</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the amendment be disagreed to.</para></motion><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>GT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Truss, Warren, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Cameron, Ross, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ROSS CAMERON</name></talker><para>—I thank the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry.

The concept of child-care services is drawn from the findings contained in the charities definition inquiry. The inquiry noted that the common law had long accepted the care and protection of helpless and vulnerable aged people as charitable, but there was no judicial precedent relating to the charitable status of child care. The inquiry considered that it should therefore be clarified that organisations looking after children should be treated as charities in the same way as organisations looking after the aged. The government has fully responded to this recommendation in the current bill. Accordingly, those playgroups which provide care, protection and support of children in the absence of their parents or guardians would be considered charitable.</para></talk.start></continue><para>However, the common law has never considered looking after your own elderly relatives to be charitable. For the same reason, caring for one's own children has never been considered charitable either. Accordingly, playgroups that involve the provision of facilities for parents and children to meet together and socialise do not meet the long-established meaning of `charitable purpose'. As community service organisations, all playgroups are currently income tax exempt and have access to the fringe benefits tax rebate—that is, all playgroups currently have access to the most significant benefits available to charities.</para><para>While other tax and non-tax concessions are available to charities, many of these are of little practical relevance to playgroup organisations. For instance, many playgroups would be below the voluntary GST registration threshold. It is therefore unlikely that the prospect of additional GST concessions being available to charities would encourage playgroups to register for GST purposes. In those circumstances, the additional concessions would be of little practical relevance to most playgroups. Therefore, the government disagrees with the Senate amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>31579</page.no><name role="metadata">Cox, David, MP</name><name role="display">Mr COX</name><name.id>83U</name.id><electorate>Kingston</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We on the opposition side feel that the government is drawing an unnecessary distinction in trying to characterise playgroups as analogous to somebody looking after their own children in a non-playgroup type environment. I am sure that the definition of `child care' does not prohibit a parent from being involved in a child-care centre and assisting with the provision of long day care in a not-for-profit child-care centre. According to the definition of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, I think that, if they did, that might jeopardise the child-care centre's treatment as a charity under the government's proposed amendment. I find the distinctions rather ridiculous. I accept the parliamentary secretary's comments about the benefits that are already available to playgroups by way of tax exemptions. I think that, as this amendment is not going to pass in this place, it is something that we on this side of the House will have a further look at down the track.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Mossfield, Frank (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Mossfield)</inline>—The question is that the amendment be disagreed to.</para></talk.start><para>Question agreed to.</para></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>31579</page.no><name role="metadata">Cameron, Ross, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ROSS CAMERON</name><name.id>3K6</name.id><electorate>Parramatta</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I present the reasons for the House disagreeing to the Senate amendment and I move: </para></talk.start><motion><para>That the reasons be adopted.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>31579</page.no><id.no>R2118</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION (CUSTOMS TARIFF) BILL 2004</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R2111</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>31579</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Mossfield, Frank (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Mossfield)</inline>—The original question was that this bill be now read a second time.

Unlike the Howard government, I believe that any free trade agreement with the US or, for that matter, any country should benefit Australia. It should in no way have a negative social, economic, cultural or environmental impact on Australia. It is the role of the Australian government to protect Australia's interests. To this extent I do have some concerns. There is a process in place at this particular time. The government has chosen to ignore that and play cheap politics by bringing this matter on for debate before the winter recess.</para></talk.start><para>Before question time I was discussing the possible impact of a free trade agreement on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. If my concerns are verified I do not believe that Australia should sign the agreement. As I said earlier, intellectual property regulations like those discussed in the free trade agreement have led to the extension of pharmaceutical monopolies by delaying and preventing the entry of low-cost generics into the market. The PBS analysis data indicates prices of brand name—that is, patented—drugs fall by an average of more than 20 per cent after the patent's expiration and the entry of generic medicines into the market. Therefore, delays will significantly increase pharmaceutical expenditure in Australia over time. This is one of the elements of the free trade agreement that is causing me considerable concern. Delays weaken the PBS reference pricing system. Studies estimate that the PBS pricing controls save Australia between $1 billion and $2.4 billion annually; therefore IP provisions in the free trade agreement have the capacity to create upward pressure on co-payments and threaten the sustainability of the scheme in the long term.</para><para>IP reforms in the free trade agreement will also have an impact on the prices of over-the-counter medicines. Therefore additional over-the-counter costs as a result of the pharmaceutical IP provisions will be directly borne by patients. For example, Claratyne—an over-the-counter medicine—is one drug that would decrease in price. But, if that patent is extended, then the Australian people will be asked to bear a significantly higher cost. Australian negotiators are under significant pressure to make concessions in this regard. I am hearing from the Australian people I meet that these are concessions that they do not wish made.</para><para>Reforms that threaten the sustainability of the PBS and transfer costs directly to patients are a high price to pay for possible gains in other sectors of the economy. Changes to the PBS and IP regime will increase financial uncertainty for the ill and ageing and create economic barriers for access to essential medicines. The inclusion of such a chapter in the free trade agreement means that subsequent governments could be blocked or sued by US corporations if they attempt to pass legislation to improve the PBS or regulate the supply of medicines in Australia. We in Australia would like to be able to determine that ourselves. I have very serious concerns about this matter. The PBS has served the community for some 55 years very well and has enjoyed bipartisan support. It is a crucial component of Australia's universal health system—a component that should not be allowed to be jeopardised by the free trade agreement. </para><para>I would like to very quickly turn to the implications of the free trade agreement on jobs. We have heard from the government that it is going to create many jobs within the Australian economy and society, but experience overseas has thrown a question mark over this. Much of the information I have read on this matter also creates concerns. Large-scale job losses can and will be experienced—you just need to look at the Canadian free trade experience of 276,000 jobs lost between 1989 and 1997. That is not something we want to see here. Windscreen manufacturer Pilkington has already announced a reduction of the work force due to losing a 70-year-old contract with Holden due to the increased import competition arising from the Australia-Thailand free trade agreement. Previously, Pilkington lost a contract with Ford Australia, who chose to source from China. The impact on Victoria would be over 1,100 full- and part-time jobs lost from the motor vehicles and parts industry. These are serious concerns—this is one little area that I am touching on and bringing to the attention of the House—that we need to consider. They are concerns that are being considered by the Senate Select Committee on the Free Trade Agreement between Australia and the United States of America. I worry that we are rushing through legislation when we should be allowing the proper processes to take place.</para><para>I will quickly touch on the area of agriculture in the free trade agreement. For Australia, all agricultural imports will be duty free from the signing of the agreement. For the United States, this is not the case. The United States maintains both quota and out-of-quota tariff regimes over a variety of agricultural products. These are called TRQ regimes. The TRQ regimes of particular interest to Australia are beef, sugar, dairy products and other crops. I do not think that we can enter into an agreement until this system is fairer. This will become really apparent during the Senate select committee's deliberation. There are also issues relating to quarantine where there are some extremely sensitive aspects and legitimate community concerns. Once again, I feel that these need to be addressed.</para><para>I am also quite concerned about cultural diversity and the impact it will have on our performing arts and cultural industry, particularly the film industry. The US is the largest exporter of cultural content in the world, dominating both screen and box office time. In 2001-02 Australia imported $518 million worth of film and television programs from the US. US films comprise 80 per cent to 90 per cent of gross box office takings. Australian content on television is a concern for our film industry. </para><para>I believe that this is an industry worth protecting. I believe that this industry would be jeopardised by the proposed free trade agreement. These issues need to be fully examined and reported on by the Senate select committee. The full democratic process should be observed—the process that has been allowed to take place in the US but has been denied us here in Australia, simply because we have a government that has only one thing in mind: winning an election and trying to promote itself at the expense of good government and what is good for Australia. </para><para>There are many other areas of great concern: issues of libraries and education and paying for what is now free, copyright issues, and the implications that all these changes will have if you look at the DMCA and consumers' fair access and use. All these issues have been brought out in submissions to the Senate committee.</para><para>Introducing this legislation is a desperate act by a government that believes playing politics and staying in power are more important than protecting Australia's interests. A free trade agreement with the US must benefit Australia. It must not be a one-sided agreement which benefits the US and not Australia. The government must allow full and thorough examination of the agreement. If it disadvantages Australia then it must not be signed.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>31581</page.no><name role="metadata">Gillard, Julia, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GILLARD</name><name.id>83L</name.id><electorate>Lalor</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Like other members who have spoken during this debate on the <inline ref="R2118">US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2111">US Free Trade Agreement Implementation (Customs Tariff) Bill 2004</inline> and like the member who spoke before me, the member for Shortland, I would like to add my voice to the central call that this House does not need to be dealing with this legislation today. Indeed, it is precisely the wrong process to have this legislation before the House today, because the matters, the subject of the free trade agreement, are the matters and the subject of a substantial Senate inquiry. The obviously correct process is to hear from that inquiry before any member of parliament is required to debate or vote on the legislation. The only reason we know that the Howard government has brought these bills on in such an urgent flurry in the last sitting week is that it smells some political advantage. It is not that it is rationally processing a trade agreement it believes may be in Australia's economic interest but that it smells some political advantage in trying to force the debate on today. </para></talk.start><para>Australians are right to be suspicious of that process. They are right to be suspicious of what the Howard government has said about the free trade agreement.

I know my friend over there would be substantially embarrassed about the way in which the Howard government has not told the truth about the interrelationship between the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and the free trade agreement, and the nature of her embarrassment is being laid clear. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The start of untruths was during the negotiation of the free trade agreement. We were told by the Howard government and its representatives that the PBS was not on the table, that there was no cause for concern because the PBS was not on the table. Indeed, in Senate estimates in June 2003 the then Minister for Health and Ageing, Kay Patterson, when asked about the matter, said, `It has not been put on the table.' We know that is not true, because the Australian negotiator for the PBS had said as early as March 2003 that it was on the table and the concerns of the US drug companies about the PBS had been well known, with US drug companies saying things like the PBS had adopted increasingly draconian regulatory and budgetary cost-control schemes.</para><para>The PBS was always going to be on the table: the pretence by the Howard government that there was a point at which it was not going to be on the table was always a pretence. Minister Vaile sought to further this pretence by pretending at the start of this year that suddenly the PBS had been `brought onto the table out of left field by the American pharmaceutical industry'. It was always on the table, and the Howard government did not tell the truth about it. In those circumstances, we need to get clear answers from the government or, if they are incapable or unwilling to give them, independent experts, to a series of questions about the PBS before we are required to make a final decision about whether or not the free trade agreement ought to be supported.</para><para>The principal intersections between the free trade agreement and the PBS as we understand them from the free trade agreement documents are these. There are the questions of the review mechanism, the ongoing working group and the impact on generics. On the question of the review mechanism there is no person in the world who could tell you what the impact of the review mechanism on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is going to be, because the review mechanism is not agreed.</para><para>This House is being asked to deal with this legislation before we can assess what the impact of the review mechanism is on the PBS. There is no way of assessing that impact today because the review mechanism is not agreed. That was made very clear in today's <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>. I think it is a matter that was known to people who have been following this process more generally, but it was reported today in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>. The <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> records:</para><quote><para>An Australian expert panel is still haggling with drug company representatives over the proposed review process, which critics say gives companies more scope to undermine Australia's capacity to restrain the prices it pays for drugs listed on the $6.2 billion-a-year Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.</para></quote><para>So the most basic of questions about the impact of the FTA on the PBS cannot be answered by anyone tonight—no member of the government, no member of the opposition, no person in this parliament and no person in this nation—because the review mechanism is not agreed. How can we rush to judgment on the free trade agreement when we cannot tell what impact that review mechanism will have on the PBS? My call to the government would be to fully disclose, as soon as it is agreed, the complete nature of the review mechanism proposed and to be truthful about the consequences of that for the PBS. That is the challenge for the government. Perhaps, through the Senate select committee process, they might acquit that challenge for basic honesty with the Australian people about what is in this agreement.</para><para>The second cause for concern is the ongoing medicines working group that the free trade agreement creates. The FTA text says that the purpose of the group will be the `continued improvement of health care outcomes'. It also says:  </para><quote><para>The Working Group shall comprise officials of federal government agencies responsible for federal healthcare programs and other appropriate federal government officials.</para></quote><para>We really cannot ascertain from that description what the purpose of the group is, what the items on its agenda will be and what the long-term consequences for the PBS will be. There is an interesting question. It is the case now that our PBS rules apply to drugs generated by drug companies from whatever nation. If this medicines working group agrees a set of changes, will they only apply to drugs manufactured by US drug companies or will they apply more generally? We do not know the answer to that. On the face of it, it appears that there is no ability for stakeholders in the PBS—doctors and patients—to have any input into the medicines working group process. Once again, this House is being forced to debate this legislation in circumstances where we have the scantest of information about what it is that this medicines working group is to do and what the impact of that would be on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. No rational person could rush to judgment on the FTA without that information.</para><para>Thirdly, and very concerningly, we do not really know, sitting here today, what the impact of the FTA will be on the ability to access generic drugs. I think we are all aware that when new drugs are invented they are subject to patent by the company that invented them. The company sells those drugs for a period at a price that is agreed. When the patent runs out, other manufacturers can make the identical drug—and often make it much cheaper. It is very important in our PBS system that we are able to access the cheaper generics as soon as branded drugs come off patent. That is the current way in which the scheme works. We know that is going to change, because it was one of the matters caught up in the legislation today. But we do not know what the effect of those changes will actually be.</para><para>The central concern here is that the immediate impact will be that a generic manufacturer who is intending to produce a drug once a brand name drug has come off patent will now be required to give notice of its intention to the patent holder, whereupon the patent holder may engage in a set of litigation to stop the generic company going into the market and producing the drug. That is not the case in Australia now. In Australia now a generic company can start up and can be in the market as soon as a patent has expired. If it is required to give notice to the patent holder, that means that the patent holder could create litigation and other hurdles to prevent the generic manufacturer bringing their drugs to market.</para><para>If that happened in even the smallest of ways, it could have catastrophic consequences for the PBS. I will give you some feel for that. We know that under the PBS currently a whole class of medication is very shortly to go off patent, and cheaper generics should be available. That class of medication is the anticholesterol medication—the cholesterol-lowering medication—known as statins. It is a huge class of medication that is coming off patent together. If Australia can access the cheaper generics as soon as the patent has expired then it is anticipated that the savings for the PBS over four years could be as high as $900 million. If there is something in the FTA that in any way delays that transition to the cheaper generic then obviously you are jeopardising access to that $900 million worth of savings.</para><para>We have written to the government. I have written to my counterpart, the Minister for Health and Ageing. My colleague the member for Fraser has written to his counterpart, the Minister for Finance and Administration. We have said, `Please tell us whether you think the US FTA will in any way delay access to or ultimately prejudice access to these savings of $900 million.' Of course, we have not received a reply. In those circumstances, I think we have to be very concerned about the impact of the FTA on our access to generic drugs. As I say, the smallest variation in the ability to access generic drugs—a delay of a year or a delay of two years—can mean hundreds of millions of dollars worth of difference and can fundamentally jeopardise our PBS. We want, and are entitled to, answers to those questions before being forced to make a final judgment about this decision.  </para><para>The PBS issues are enormously significant. The ones that I have outlined are the most significant of them, but in the health area there is another very important issue which I believe has not received sufficient public recognition and needs to be taken into account in our decision making processes about the FTA, and that is blood plasma fractionation. The fact that the FTA opens the door for a trade in blood and blood products I think was a surprise to everyone—but it does. I understand that it was certainly a surprise to CSL, which current manufactures blood products for the Australian market. As we all know, the Red Cross is responsible for blood collection in Australia. Volunteers go and donate their blood to the Red Cross, and the Red Cross is funded by the states to do those blood collections. CSL uses that Australian blood to make a range of blood plasma products, some of which have quite small markets. The main purchaser of these products is the state hospital system.</para><para>The Review of the Australian Blood Banking and Plasma Product Sector, conducted by Sir Ninian Stephen in 2001, found no grounds—I repeat: no grounds—to open up the plasma fractionation industry, despite the dominant market position of CSL. During the review by Sir Ninian, considerable emphasis was placed on the importance of Australians having a national plasma fractionator, with the capacity to do research, as a means to meet domestic needs and safeguard the national interest. The Plasma Fractionation Agreement that the government signs with CSL provides certainty of both supply and price. If tenders are opened up, and especially if a competitor chooses not to manufacture and market the whole range of products but picks only the most profitable of them, then CSL will lose market share and viability. Oversight of safety and quality, which is obviously critical for these products, becomes a whole lot harder.</para><para>As we understand it, it is proposed to change the current Australian situation with regard to blood plasma products basically for the benefit of one US company, and that is Baxter. I think the government should verify whether or not that is its understanding of the real implication of this. We need to understand what is being talked about here. What I think is being talked about, and what the Howard government needs to confirm, is that there would be a tender process, which means that it is conceivable that Baxter, based in the United States, would win a share of the blood plasma product production market in Australia. Where are Baxter then to produce those blood plasma products? There are only two choices: they could come and build a plant here to do it or they could take Australian blood to the United States and do it in their current facilities. I understand—though this needs confirmation from the Howard government—that the idea is that Australian blood would be collected and that plasma products used in Australia would still be made from Australian blood, but that the processes to achieve those plasma products could be done by Baxter here or, more likely, in the United States. So we would have the spectre of Australian blood being shipped offshore to the United States for further processing into plasma products. </para><para>The consequences of this are diabolical, in my view. They are very important. What we know about the US blood supply is that it is less secure than ours. It is less secure partly because the blood is collected from people who are paid to donate it, not from volunteers. Those people in the United States who are routinely blood donors are often people on the margins of society who are desperate for the money. They are often people struggling with drug addiction and other issues. The very fact that they are struggling with those issues and so are desperate to sell their blood for money tends to imply that they are people who are more likely to have the sorts of diseases that can go into the blood supply. It is well known that the US blood supply is less secure than ours.</para><para>In addition, the US has had exposure to mad cow disease. We have not. We are one of four nations in the world that remains free of the human variant of mad cow disease. If Australian blood is to be taken to the United States for processing, the critical question is: will it be processed in lines that are dedicated solely for the production of Australian blood products? Will no blood ever go through those lines except Australian blood? If that is the case, provided it is lived up to time and time again, that would prevent Australian blood being contaminated by any of the blood-borne diseases in US blood. But if that is not the case and the intention is that Australian blood would be processed through the same lines that American blood is currently processed through, that clearly leads to disease risks. The most pressing of them in this debate is the risk of CJD or the human variant of mad cow disease, which we know can live on and can pass from person to person through equipment. People would be aware that there have been major issues requiring the destruction of surgical equipment in some cases to prevent the same equipment that has been exposed to CJD giving CJD to another person.</para><para>I think this is the most basic of questions for the government to answer. If a government cannot provide answers about the security of a nation's blood supply when we have known in this nation the tragic consequences of HIV-AIDS and hepatitis C in relation to the blood supply, the last thing in the world a responsible government would or should do is put this nation at risk of known diseases like CJD or the other diseases that may be around the corner. This is not a static picture. Over time there will be other blood-borne diseases that come onto the planet, I suspect, in the way that HIV-AIDS did, and we will have to struggle with them. Until the government answers that question about the safety and quality of the blood supply, there is no-one who should be forced to make a judgment about the FTA in the way that this House is being forced to make a judgment. It is a fundamental question, like the questions I have raised about the PBS, which ought to be answered before anybody is required to articulate a final view about the FTA. I challenge the minister to come into this House tonight and give the assurance that I am seeking on blood products. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>31586</page.no><name role="metadata">Grierson, Sharon, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GRIERSON</name><name.id>00AMP</name.id><electorate>Newcastle</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—With regard to the free trade agreement with the US that we are debating today with the <inline ref="R2118">US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Bill 2004 </inline>and the<inline ref="R2118"></inline><inline ref="R2111">US Free Trade Agreement Implementation (Customs Tariff) Bill 2004</inline>, it is important to remember that the earliest date that the US congress has been required to make a decision on this is the middle of July. But, in this country and under this government, democracy John Howard style says: `Ram it through. Indulge in fear and smear. Wedge everyone possible and make sure the advertisements and cheques keep flowing.' So here we are today being forced to debate the free trade agreement with the United States even though the verdict from our own Senate inquiry is not in yet. It is correct that our position is that we should await the Senate committee's report and we should see that the concerns that have been raised by all parties have been assessed and evaluated. We do look for a decision that says the free trade agreement is in the national interest. We should not be bullied but, unfortunately, this government does wield its power of incumbency like a bludgeon.  </para></talk.start><para>What do we know so far about this Australia-US free trade agreement and what are those economic benefits that we would anticipate from such a lengthy process? There are three economic studies of the Australia-US free trade agreement by economic analysts. One estimates it will raise Australian incomes by $52.5 billion over the next 20 years. A second says it will make us $47 billion worse off. And a third expert report estimates that, at best, the free trade agreement with the United States will generate maybe $53 million a year. They are all experts and they all predict very different outcomes, so certainly a decision is not something that we should rush.</para><para>The first report—the one with the biggest bang for Australia—was prepared by and on behalf of the Australian government. Its argument rests on the diminished operation of the Foreign Investment Review Board. Professor Ross Garnaut says that even this fails the laugh test in the real world and that you certainly could not get new greenfield investment of $3 billion a year from a minor change to investment rules. The second report, by contrast, was commissioned by the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union. Its argument rests on opportunity costs—that is, what we give up by signing up for the free trade agreement. I think everybody understands that and, generally, we always give up something. The AMWU's concerns about this free trade agreement are that Australia will be prevented from developing into a knowledge based economy, that the agreement will compromise our research and development capabilities and that the intellectual property provisions in the agreement will compromise Australia's ability to build a first-class knowledge based economy, compromising our manufacturing and production industries that are state of the art. We do not want to depend on agreements; we really want to depend on excellence. I consider that the free trade agreement's restrictions on industry policy have not been given enough attention. The third report was released last week. It was put to the Senate committee by Philippa Dee, now at the Australian National University. For her, the bottom line was a fairly devastating $53 million a year—a very tiny harvest from a major political and bureaucratic endeavour.</para><para>I must say that there has been some belief in my electorate that manufacturing industry would benefit greatly from this trade agreement. That would not be the case. In our region, we already export to the US Navy submersible vessels that are state-of-the-art. We have not needed trade agreements with the US to gain those markets. It really does come down to an excellent product, and we have skills and expertise in this country which we must retain. Often they do come from R&amp;D processes, which also appear to be certainly at risk in this agreement.</para><para>Labor have looked at this agreement and obviously there are some major lessons for us in history. Whilst in office from 1983 to 1996, Labor governments were twice confronted with US proposals for a free trade agreement. The proposals came from the US. Interestingly, this time it is John Howard's idea to have this free trade agreement—no-one else's. On both occasions, those Labor governments decided against bilateral trade agreements in favour of emphasising multilateral negotiations. But the agenda is clearly set by the government and the opposition are inevitably in the position of having to respond and react to the government's very managed and very controlled agenda. I remind people that we have had to endure and pay for this process of selling a free trade agreement with the US in many ways: trips to America by our Prime Minister so he can address the American Congress on the FTA; a US presidential visit; forums around the country by our trade and industry department, selling the benefits of globalisation; and specific forums around the country about the benefits of this free trade agreement. I could go on. You only have to go to the web site and look at the many free fact sheets and guides. Selling this free trade agreement has certainly been big business. </para><para>Obviously, when you are in opposition it is much harder to analyse, counter and perhaps criticise what is projected. One of the best tools we have is public debate, and that is why we successfully moved—and the Senate resolved on 13 May—to set up a select committee on the free trade agreement. I am told 525 submissions have been received; yet, according to this government, we should make a decision before we even look at the final report. Such is democracy Howard style. Our general position has always been that this free trade agreement does need to pass some tests. Those tests were and are that it has to deliver significant and comprehensive benefits to Australian agriculture in a reasonable period of time.</para><para>Let me say what the bottom line is on agriculture in this free trade agreement. If, over time, the American farmers find they cannot compete with the cost of the goods coming from Australia, they can spit the dummy, basically. They can say, `Sorry, the deal is off with regard to agricultural products.' The tariff barriers would then go straight back up in America and our farmers can just say goodbye to their products being exported to America. That is a fairly one-sided approach, I would have thought.</para><para>We do want to make sure the FTA delivers significant employment and investment gains, again, particularly for manufacturing and service industries but without that knowledge-edge base and the threat that this free trade agreement has to R&amp;D. Our scientist groups are saying that the investment this country has made into CSIRO and other research has been public moneys—which has resulted in research that has benefited all industries and all manufacturers—and that is now at risk because that research will be shared, free of charge, with the United States. Of course, we have not seen them investing in our R&amp;D in the past. We would certainly like to see that the FTA does not undermine the capacity of our government to protect Australian culture by regulating for local content.</para><para>We also have major concerns about the health area. And it is the health area that is particularly important to me. I think it is the issue that the Australian public feel most strongly about at the moment. We are very concerned obviously that the free trade agreement will compromise some of the things that we hold dear. We do have concerns about the PBS and about the ability of a review board to decide whether the listing of drugs on the PBS is a good or bad thing and to boycott that. We did have great faith in the PBS system until this government decided that the advisory council should include drug companies. As the previous speaker has said, the cholesterol drugs—the statins—that have been available extensively under the PBS have certainly resulted in greater cost to the PBS. We all know that there are other options that are cheaper for us—exercise, lifestyle, important health changes in treating high cholestrol. </para><para>The PBS was a system that we would have had great confidence in, but under this government we have seen it corrupted. The costs have been allowed to blow out. They are willing to play politics with something I think the Australian public have always had great faith in.</para><para>The previous speaker also mentioned the risk to blood products, and that is of particular concern. I am a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit. We held a public hearing in March, and we looked at the negotiated agreement for the provision of blood products. At that hearing, we were actually looking into a new agreement that had been entered into for the supply of blood products. That new agreement with CSL, who had been and is the main provider of blood products to Australia, is now a short-term contract. The original contract had an option to be renegotiated and extended for a considerable time at the same cost. The inquiry found that the health department actually made no attempt to exercise that option, even though it would have clearly been the most cost-effective for this country.</para><para>The blood review by the National Blood Authority has said that CSL were the preferred partner for the Commonwealth. They recommended that that partnership should continue in the national interest for Australia. The review report concluded that Australia's future plasma fractionation needs would be best met through the national facility opened by CSL. But that was not the outcome from the health department's contract negotiations. The new short-term contract that was negotiated with CSL is much more expensive for us, but it does allow for one thing: the Commonwealth government can close down the contract whenever it wants. I suspect that they will want to do that in 2007 when, under the free trade agreement, they have the opportunity to review the arrangement for blood products. As we have heard the member for Lalor say, one of the options would put blood products up for tender. We are not really sure why the government would give up one of the best deals we had, one that has delivered very well for the Australian public. Obviously, the 2007 trigger point means free-market politics again could compromise the standards that this country has held dear.</para><para>Clearly, the Australia-US free trade agreement does have direct interest in gaining US access to specific areas of health-related products—that is, blood products and pharmaceuticals. In Australia we have had a system that has worked in both cases. We have delivered affordable health products to consumers, and we have allowed health practitioners to provide those products and, therefore, save our health system considerable cost. For me, the bottom line is that unless those health needs can be met—as they have been—and not compromised, we certainly should not be passing this free trade agreement.</para><para>With regard to the PBS, I am not into cringe politics. I know that in my electorate Labor's decision this week on the PBS has been a very difficult one. The copayment decision will see costs increase for people. This government has legislation before the House to bring that into effect as fast as it can. I remember very clearly as a new member of parliament opposing the decision to increase that PBS copayment. At that time, the budget in this country was in surplus big time. It was very easy to say, `Hey, let's not hurt people when we have got money to spare.' We held tight at that time and for two years we were able to protect those people that this government always overlooks. I regret that, at this stage, we have not been able to continue with that protection from increased financial burden. </para><para>I remind people that increasing the PBS copayment is not our policy; this is a policy of the government. We are now into the worst time of all in the running of this country, when wedge politics and dirty tricks influence the decisions made in this place. We also know that the government have now spent much of that surplus, and they have spent it by giving out pre-election cheques in the mail to as many of the voters they need as possible, and tax cuts to those who earn over $52,000. In my electorate that is only 10 per cent of the population who will qualify for that. By spending so much money in this period leading up to the election—and I must not forget $150 million for advertising—I think the Australian public see that that is a fairly mean and tricky way to spend their money. Let us campaign fairly and decently, and let us not use public funds to do that. We face a situation now, after 8½ years of this government, where public education has virtually been compromised to a point where the public are saying, `Come on, let's save it once and for all.' We have seen public hospitals and public health systems compromised. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 8.30 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BUSINESS</title><type>Business</type><page.no>31589</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>31589</page.no><name role="metadata">Abbott, Tony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ABBOTT</name><name.id>EZ5</name.id><electorate>Warringah</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Health and Ageing</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On indulgence, I suggest a course of conduct for the rest of this evening's sitting.

I was drawing attention particularly to areas such as public education, public hospitals, universities, Telstra, aged care, and, of course, the PBS. Fortunately, although there has been some tough debate on that issue this week, Labor have identified that by cleaning up the PBS by facilitating generics and perhaps removing the commercial interests of drug companies from the PBS Advisory Council we would be able to afford, and effect in government, considerable savings—that, of course, is our hope—and perhaps avoid a very unpalatable decision to increase copayments. Of course, that option is only at our disposal should we be in government.</para></talk.start><para>However, to add to the concerns that we feel about the US free trade agreement, today it has been revealed in the interim report that those concerns do very much run to manufacturing and industry. It is suggested that under the US free trade agreement most tariffs would be reduced to zero. The interim report says: </para><quote><para>... since US manufacturing tariffs are generally lower than Australian manufacturing tariffs, Australian tariffs will have further to fall. This will eliminate any obvious benefit to the Australian economy ...</para></quote><para>Those are the sorts of concerns coming out of the interim report. Without seeing the full report, we do not know the impact on the Australian nation. In any discussion regarding free trade it must be remembered that the trade barriers that are the greatest threat to countries who have considerable economic domination, like the United States, are the things we in Australia perhaps value most: our government regulated and subsidised health sector; our government regulated and subsidised education sectors; and our research sector, communications services and utilities, which are all subsidised by government in some way. Historically these direct subsidies have allowed services and associated infrastructure to be delivered with some sort of equity across this very vast nation, overcoming distance, isolation and the wealth divide. In many ways, our government-provided or government-regulated services—particularly the ones we would see as essential, such as the provision of blood products, and the PBS—would also be seen as anticompetitive by countries such as the United States of America. In fact, there are often inbuilt monopolistic tendencies in our public service provision, but they are, after all, publicly funded through the contributions of Australian taxpayers, and they exist for the national interest—they have also delivered well in the past for the national interest.</para><para>Finally, the opposition have considerable concern that until the Senate report is studied in detail we certainly cannot make an informed decision for the Australian public about the worth and benefits of the FTA. I remind the Australian public, though, that any decision made has to be an informed one. Even though we approach a very controversial and difficult time in the political cycle, decisions like the free trade agreement certainly do result from government policy. As I have said, this one was initiated personally by John Howard. It was not initiated by industry, business sectors or agricultural sectors. It was asked for by our Prime Minister—perhaps he felt there was some payback needed. It has certainly dominated the activities of many departments. It has cost us a great deal of money so far. As I said, prime ministerial visits to America and presidential visits to Australia do not come cheap. Let us hope that, when we do get the opportunity to review the free trade agreement and the Senate inquiry into that, we will make the best decision for this country.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Katter</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>SUPERANNUATION LAWS AMENDMENT (2004 MEASURES NO. 2) BILL 2004 </title><type>Bills</type><page.no>31591</page.no><id.no>R2050</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration of Senate Message</title><page.no>31591</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Message received from the Senate returning the bill and acquainting the House that the Senate insists upon its amendments disagreed to by the House.</para><para>Ordered that the amendments be considered forthwith.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Senate's amendments—</inline></para><quote><para>(1)	Clause 2, page 2 (table item 3), omit “2010” (twice occurring), substitute “2005”.</para><para>(2)	Clause 4, page 3 (line 2), omit “2010”, substitute “2005”.</para></quote><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>31591</page.no><name role="metadata">Cameron, Ross, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ROSS CAMERON</name><name.id>3K6</name.id><electorate>Parramatta</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><para>That:</para><para>(a)	the House insists on disagreeing to the amendments insisted on by the Senate, and</para><para>(b)	in place thereof, the Government amendments, as set out in the schedule circulated to honourable Members, be agreed to. </para><para><inline font-style="italic">The schedule read as follows—</inline></para><quote><para>(1)	Clause 2, page 2 (table item 3), omit the table item, substitute:

The government again opposes the Senate amendments to the <inline ref="R2050">Superannuation Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 2) Bill 2004</inline>. These amendments would bring forward the commencement of a measure contained in the bill relating to the superannuation guarantee earnings base from 1 July 2005 to 1 July 2010. The government believes that this proposal is impractical. It also runs the risk of reducing employees' wage growth more sharply to offset increases in superannuation payments. The House considers that a longer transition period would provide greater capacity for employers to increase superannuation payments through increased productivity, thereby not adversely affecting employees or employers. </para><para>I am moving amendments on behalf of the government to the Superannuation Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 2) Bill 2004 to insert new commencement and application clauses for the measure relating to the simplification of superannuation guarantee earnings base provisions. Amendments (1) and (2) will bring forward the implementation date for the simplified earnings base measure from 1 July 2010 to 1 July 2008. The opposition's amendment of 1 July 2005 is likely to be impossible for some businesses to meet. The government considers that the originally proposed start date of 1 July 2010 would have allowed for the smoothest transition to a simplified superannuation guarantee system. </para><para>The government is disappointed that the Senate has rejected the concerns of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry in relation to the ability of employers to satisfy this unreasonable time frame implementation period. I note the irresponsible attitude of the opposition in proposing the 1 July 2005 commencement—that is, the Labor Party believes the date is appropriate now and will leave the government to fix up the resultant problems for business at a later time. </para><para>The government is committed to increasing equality for both employers and employees in the retirement income system. The government wants to see greater equity for employees in the superannuation guarantee arrangements but recognises the need to moderate the impact on some businesses. For that reason, reluctantly, the government proposes to amend the commencement date to 1 July 2008 for this measure. A commencement date of 1 July 2008 will allow at least one industrial bargaining cycle for employers and employees to consider and incorporate these changes into the bargaining process. A transition period of less than four years runs the risk of reducing employees' wages growth more sharply to offset increases in superannuation payments. The transition as proposed provides greater capacity for employers to meet the increase in superannuation payments through increased productivity, thereby avoiding adverse effects to employees and employers. </para><para>When the superannuation guarantee system was introduced, the rate increased gradually over 10 years to ensure that the labour market was not undermined and that the increases in superannuation costs could be paid out of productivity increases. I note that even businesses with access to grandfathered earnings bases still faced increasing superannuation costs over this period as the rate rose. The approach of the government is consistent with the original superannuation guarantee approach. In the interests of ensuring passage of the Superannuation Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 2) Bill 2004 and its very important measure to simplify the superannuation guarantee earnings base provisions, the government moves the amendments to bring forward the date of effect from 1 July 2010 to 1 July 2008.  </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>31592</page.no><name role="metadata">Cox, David, MP</name><name role="display">Mr COX</name><name.id>83U</name.id><electorate>Kingston</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I think it is important to recognise first that these employers have been enjoying something of a holiday from paying the full superannuation guarantee levy equivalent paid for other workers and that the employees in these occupations will in fact suffer a lower standard of living in retirement for the relatively long period over which they have not received superannuation guarantee contributions paid at an ordinary times earnings base. We had wanted this anomaly corrected as quickly as possible, which was the reason for proposing an effective start date of 2005. </para></talk.start><para>I am painfully aware that, on previous occasions in the last couple of years when we have set relatively short transition dates or the government has acceded to relatively short transition dates for similar measures, they have not been met; we have actually been back here extending transitional arrangements for an extra year to accommodate other arrangements where special situations are being brought into line with general case. So I do accept that there may be some employers who would have difficulty dealing with this. </para><para>The parliamentary secretary has said that a 2008 effective date will provide sufficient transition to ensure one bargaining cycle, and one bargaining cycle ought to be sufficient for correcting this anomaly. I was not impressed by his suggestion, and I do not believe that the member for Rankin, who is the shadow minister for workplace relations, would have been impressed by his suggestion that these employees may suffer smaller pay increases as these employers seek to make this adjustment over a shorter period than before 2010. I do not think that that is a reasonable assumption for the government to make.</para><para>I note the parliamentary secretary's comments that the original 2010 start date was approved by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. It would have been more reasonable if the government had consulted with the ACTU as well. The government has a very comfortable relationship with the Executive Director of ACCI, Mr Peter Hendy, who was an adviser to them in opposition and to ministers in this place before he took up his current position, but I do not see Peter as being the font of all wisdom on industrial relations policy. I have not had an opportunity to consult with the shadow minister for retirement incomes, Senator Sherry, because these amendments were only shown to me by the parliamentary secretary while the member for Newcastle was finishing her speech. Senator Sherry went to Hobart today for Jim Bacon's funeral and has not returned.

I am not familiar with the industrial side of the WTO agreement—with manufacturing—but I am familiar with the agricultural side of the agreement. Every country that was a signatory to the WTO agreement agreed that their average support levels would be reduced by 30 per cent. So the first question is: did the OECD countries reduce their support levels? In 1987, at the commencement of the WTO agreement, the average support level was 55 per cent. The average in 1999 was 59 per cent. It is now 49 per cent. Do not get excited, because they are actually reducing. They have guaranteed prices, so when the world price for commodities comes down then the support levels go up. In any event, the OECD countries most certainly did not reduce their support levels for agriculture. The European Union went from 55 per cent to 66 per cent and, because of high commodity prices in 2003, they are on 50 per cent at the present moment. The US was on 48 per cent and went to 51 per cent. Their level has not reduced—it has actually gone up.</para></talk.start><para>So ask yourself the question: is the US going to honour this trade agreement? The answer is there for you. They have already committed themselves to a 30 per cent reduction in their support levels with the OECD. This is not some idea that I have pulled out of the sky; it is from the agricultural policies report from the OECD—a very heavy document, as you can see, Mr Deputy Speaker Hawker—and they upgrade it every year. Anyone can pick up this report and verify for themselves just how much this trade agreement was honoured.</para><para>A very popular and wide-selling book at the moment, on the shelves in just about every newsagency in Australia, is Paul Krugman's book <inline font-style="italic">The Great Unravelling</inline>. There are many things that I disagree with, but let me quote from the book:</para><quote><para>When the Bush administration imposed steep tariffs on imported steel—</para></quote><para>and this comes from a rabid free marketeer. Krugman is one of the leading commentators. He is the <inline font-style="italic">New York Times</inline> op-ed columnist. He continued:</para><quote><para>... it demonstrated an unprecedented contempt for international rules. When the Bush administration decided to give the steel industry the protection it required it was in effect saying ... that the rules don't apply to yours truly ... What good are new agreements if we won't honor the old ones?</para></quote><para>Those are not my words. This person was appointed to one of the leading economic tribunals in the United States by Ronald Reagan and was subsequently appointed by Bill Clinton, and he is one of the leading columnists in the United States. He is, as I said, a very unapologetic free marketeer.</para><para>Let me turn to the figures. Mr Keating had generously given it all away, even before Australia went into the WTO. We were down to 11 per cent, but we have reduced that to six per cent. So we have cut our support levels clean in half. But the average agricultural tariff in the United States is 1.8 per cent. The 49 per cent support level is not coming from tariff protection; it is coming from subsidies—this is the World Bank <inline font-style="italic">World Development Indicators</inline> for 2003. If you take out the 1.8 per cent, that leaves the American farmer with a 47 per cent subsidy. If you take out the Australian tariff protection—which ironically is a bit higher than that of the United States: 3.9 per cent—then the support for Australian farmers by their government is two per cent. So the American farmer has a 45 per cent advantage in the marketplace over the Australian farmer. If you think that our farmers can beat the Americans over a 100-metre race when we are giving them a 45-metre start, I am afraid you have a different attitude from mine. That is the agricultural position. It has to be a colossal and monumental stupidity to provide your opponents, your competitors, with a 45 per cent advantage in the marketplace over yourself. I emphasise that these are not my figures but those of the World Bank and the OECD. </para><para>Moving on to Broken Hill, BHP are the big Australian, as you have seen on television in the advertisements. But BHP have gone. BHP Steel are now BlueScope Steel. BHP have got out of steel. After manufacturing steel in this country for probably a century, they are no longer there. The reason—they have made no secret of it—is that when the free trade deal goes through they will not be able to compete in the long run against the United States. I have to be honest and say that they also do not think they will be able to compete against China, either. Without any help from government, they have no hope of surviving. So the steel industry has gone.</para><para>Statements that we now have the American market available to us intrigue me greatly. I am quite fascinated by how our motor vehicle manufacturers are going to compete against the United States motor vehicle manufacturers. They have the massive backup from the R&amp;D that is put in—and I have seen this on many occasions in my lifetime: the magnificent R&amp;D that the United States has through the military industrial complex. In solar energy they were so far ahead of the rest of the world that there really was no comparison, when I was a minister in the Queensland government and we were pricing out solar energy in the rest of the world.</para><para>Their motor vehicle plants are set up for economies of scale that will service 431 million people. Under NAFTA they have the Mexicans at 100 million, Canada at 35 million and the United States at 295 million people. They are servicing a market of 430 million people, and their plants are set up for economies of scale to serve that market. Our plants are set up for a tiny little economy of 20 million people. And yet, are people seriously saying that we are going to be able to compete against the Americans in motor vehicle manufacture? I do not represent motor vehicle areas. In fact, there may even be some advantages in the motor vehicle industry closing down as far as I am concerned. But as a patriotic Australian I wonder about a country—and I will come back to that subject in a moment.</para><para>This country has had a wonderful record in building ships, particularly medium-sized ships, patrol boat sized ships, fast cats—that sort of area—and there is no doubt, as anyone who knows anything about the military knows, that this country needs 100 patrol boats with guided missile capacity, interception capability and helicopter facilitation. That will happen. There will be a government in Australia that will do that. And the fast cat service, just from Darwin to Jakarta and Singapore alone, with a seamless railway system, will happen again in Australia. </para><para>In days past, that small- to medium-sized boat manufacture in this country saw Evans Deakin with 16,000 employees and NQEA in North Queensland with some 3,000 to 5,000 employees. It will see shipping virtually vanish in this country because, once again, the Americans have their own rules. The Jones Act guarantees that all of their coastal shipping of this variety will be built by Americans. The Jones Act will stand, notwithstanding this so-called trade deal, which really is an American free trade act, if you like—and that is the way that it should be described.</para><para>We saw the great tragedy in Queensland of Austoft, the last of our cane harvester manufacturers. All the world's cane harvesters were built in Australia once upon a time; now none of them are built in Australia. If there are any tractors being manufactured in Australia, I am not aware of it. No-one that I know has Australian tractors anymore.</para><para>So whether it is steel, motor vehicles, shipping, tractors or cane harvesters, none of these things will be available in this country when this legislation goes through. That should be glaringly obvious to everybody. Are the government—and arguably the opposition—seriously putting the proposition to the Australian people that our car manufacturers are going to compete in the United States market against people who are servicing a market of 430 million people? Is that seriously a proposition they are putting before the people of Australia? And is it any wonder that the people of Australia are rejecting that proposition?</para><para>This document was conceived, as far as Queenslanders—particularly North Queenslanders—are concerned, in deceit. I do not like to say that, because I have many friends—I would like to think of them as friends—in the government. I hope I have some on the other side of the House too. But we went to the polls in Queensland, and I worked very hard to get some Independents up in that election. Those people went to the polls believing, because they were told four times—I think maybe five times—by Minister Vaile and twice by The Nationals leader, Mr Anderson, that there would be no free trade deal without sugar. They did that all the way up to the day of the election. And on the Monday after the election they announced that sugar would not be in the free trade deal. Those members of parliament who were elected for The Nationals in Queensland must feel absolutely abominable if they have a conscience, because they know they were elected upon a lie.</para><para>On bananas, we had a decision made by AQIS that bananas from the Philippines would not be allowed into this country. Again, I make reference to <inline font-style="italic">The Great Unravelling</inline>, because we have got some insights into how the American economy works. I again quote Paul Krugman, who said:</para><quote><para>Cronyism is hardly novel in America; the Clinton administration took us to the edge of a trade war on behalf of Chiquita bananas, a major campaign contributor.</para></quote><para>Chiquita, Dole and Del Monte are the three groups that sell fruit and vegetables in the United States. They massively dominate the American market. One of those companies, Dole, is in the Philippines. They are the Philippine banana producers. They will not be Filipino bananas that will be coming in here; they will be American bananas, produced by workers in the Philippines working for about $800 a year versus $12,000 a year for Australian workers, at the time at which the World Bank produced those figures.</para><para>If you carefully read what the Americans are saying to their people, phytosanitary arrangements are very much part of the banana decision. Similarly, with the drug issue and the pharmaceutical benefits arrangements, exactly the same is happening. There will be another body set up that is acceptable to the Americans and it will make the decision on what will come into this country and what will not. That is what the Americans have told their people; but it is not what the Australian government has told our people. If you close down the sugar and banana industries, you take about $2½ thousand million a year out of the Australian economy—and that is what is happening at this very moment on the policies that are being pushed forward. I simply cannot believe that the Dole company, and its influence with the Republican administration that are in there at the moment—not that I am sure they would not have similar influence with a Democratic administration as well—do not have exactly the same influence as the sugar lobby. Listening to the banana growers at their big meetings in North Queensland, there is no doubt left in my mind that it was part of a dirty deal that was done with the Bush administration in the United States. The fact that the announcement on the bananas was made an indecent nine or 10 days after the Queensland elections again means that this document was born in deceit. </para><para>Let me just go back: I sit in my office under a picture of the great John McEwen. He was the man who presided over the most successful economy in Australian history—and I have not got time to reel out the figures here tonight, but if you look at some my past speeches you will see them and they speak for themselves. As a very young man I was mentioning that I did not think that tariffs were such a good idea, and I had afternoon tea with the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia. This is what he told me, a very young man at the time: `Firstly, there is no such thing as a tariff, there is only a nursery tariff. Secondly, if our agricultural industries are to survive and prosper then they need the security of a relatively large home market—' something that this government clearly does not understand, `to allow them to ride the roller coaster of the international trade cycle. To achieve this we need population—'and this is another concept that both sides of this house do not agree with, `and this population must have jobs, so we need a protected home market for the industries that will provide them jobs. Thirdly, though you are too young to appreciate this, I will never see my country plunged into another war without the ability to build a main battle tank.' I doubt whether we can build a rifle now, let alone a main battle tank. Most certainly, without a steel industry and a motor vehicle industry, there would be absolutely no hope.</para><para>The two most prominent figures in trade negotiations in this country's recent history have been Colin Teese and Professor Garnaut. These two men have condemned, in the strongest possible language, this deal. I am not an expert in international trade relations, but both of these men are. Professor Garnaut said it does not pass the laugh factor, but Mr Teese was not quite so humorous in his remarks about it. They were both the Australian negotiators in past trade negotiations.</para><para>Other concerns that I have include the fact that there have only been two other reports done on this—one by ACIL, one by CIE. ACIL has said it is bad for Australia; CIE has said it is good for Australia; and the government will not go to the Productivity Commission. One must really ask the question as to why they will not go to the Productivity Commission. Why is this thing being rushed through this place with indecent haste and not being put before the Productivity Commission? We have continuously seen statements in the national media that the trade negotiators advised the government not to proceed with this deal. Clearly, the fact that the Productivity Commission has not been introduced is because there is a large body of opinion in the public service in Australia that simply will not buy this deal. </para><para>I do not know, nor has the government claimed, that a single, individual commodity will be improved. It is presented to us on a general basis that we will have access to America. My family have sold clothing in this country for about 150 years. Groceries were not our core business, we should never have gone into them and when we did we got a big black eye because we could not compete. If you have somebody you cannot compete against the last thing you want to do is get into a competition with them but, by abolishing our tariffs, by abolishing a huge part of Australia's sovereignty, we have done just that. There is no doubt in my mind that we are going to get the same black eye as my family did in our own minor way.</para><para>Let me finish on this note: one of the great families of agriculture in Australia is the Mackay's, who, to some degree, dominate the banana industry of Australia. Robert Mackay was talking with a very important person in this country and the person said, `There is a trade-off in Philippine bananas. We've got to worry about milk here; we've got to worry about cattle.' Mr Mackay replied, `Well, we are very big cattle producers so we have a foot in both camps.' This person said, `I will answer you this way: the reason the Philippines buy our cattle is because they are cheaper, they are better quality, they are handy, and we are reliable suppliers. Those are the same reasons, regardless of what anyone says, why that country will buy those cattle tomorrow.' Trade is about making a quid and that is the way it is going to operate whether it is the steel industry that the United States has completely ignored in the WTO, or whether it is agriculture, which the American media claim they have doubled the support for when they were supposed to reduce it by 30 per cent. Let me say this: people like Mr Mackay have their brains in gear and their feet are solidly planted in Australian soil. That is more than I can say for the Australian government in this dreadful deal which will take away from our country so much of its sovereignty.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BUSINESS</title><type>Business</type><page.no>31598</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>31598</page.no><name role="metadata">Lloyd, Jim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LLOYD</name><name.id>IK6</name.id><electorate>Robertson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr Deputy Speaker, on indulgence, I have some information which would be of interest to members and other occupiers of the House.

During the eighties, and prior to coming into politics in 1991, I was very much involved with the New South Wales Farmers Association and the Grains Council of Australia. I was one of those who, during the eighties in particular, argued that one of the problems we had with agricultural exports in particular was that we were dealing with a corrupt world market which was establishing most of the prices for our products. We also had as a basis for our business activity in agriculture an artificial cost structure domestically. That was driven by a number of things, not the least of which, in my view at the time, were the union movement and others within our community who were driving some parts of our productive sector to accept a higher cost of production that was not economically sustainable. </para></talk.start><para>I think that over time there has been a drift and drive towards service provision so that we could utilise some of the offshore impacts of service provision and other financial services et cetera to try and bolster the economy. I think that one of the things that the member for Kennedy hinted at during his speech was that we have, in a sense, in agriculture in particular, suffered as a consequence. We are out there struggling against the global marketplace. We are quite often called the most efficient farmers in the world, and I believe that we are. I think that a number of factors indicate that in our position within agriculture, particularly within the dry lands sector of agriculture.</para><para>But our farmers are struggling. I think there are a number of areas that we really do need to address. One of those, as I said, is the artificial cost structure that we have built up over time and this constant barrage directed towards the farming community that says: `Get bigger or get out—if you can't compete, you're not in the game. You are not required in this economy anymore because we have moved towards a more globalised economy.' During the eighties, as I said, when I was involved in various organisations, there was a constant thrust towards liberalising the global marketplace so that our farmers would have a better go in that community. I was one of those who believed that, and I believed it quite passionately. I campaigned for that to happen. I do not believe that anymore. It is only in recent years that I have stopped believing in Santa Claus as well. It is not going to happen.</para><para>I am not going to support the <inline ref="R2118">US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2111">US Free Trade Agreement Implementation (Customs Tariff) Bill 2004</inline>. It hurts me to say that. I am glad that the Minister for Trade is here tonight, because I think there are a number of factors that have become very clear in the way in which this legislation has been dealt with by the parliament. The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties was set up to investigate this agreement. I cannot call it a free trade agreement. It is a trading arrangement—there is no doubt about that—but it is not a free trade agreement by any stretch of the imagination, and I think that anybody who suggests that to the people of Australia is being quite untruthful in its interpretation. It is an arrangement. There are certain benefits for Australia, there are certain benefits for America and there are certain unknowns in the process.</para><para>I would like the Australian people to be fully aware that yesterday JSCOT—the treaty committee of this parliament—made a report to this parliament about this 1,000-page arrangement. Within an hour a debate started on the arrangement that the committee had reviewed, various views were expressed by the committee members about the committee and, within 24 hours or a bit more, we are making a decision on something that took two or three years or perhaps even decades to drive towards.</para><para>There have been a number of assessments made of this process and people have spoken of them. The CIE assessment made certain predictions about the outcomes of this arrangement before Minister Vaile went to America and made the arrangement. That suggested that Australia was going to be significantly better off—I think it was to the extent of $6.1 billion. That was before an arrangement was struck. After that, there was a reassessment of the process, which indicated another number. When various commentators were asking questions about the way in which those numbers had been struck, there were indications that various assumptions had been made on various factors within the economy. I notice the differences between the CIE, for instance, and ACIL in assessing the impact of the arrangement. CIE had 24 sectors for their economic activity and the assumptions that were made. They came up with a good scenario for Australia in their modelling. </para><para>ACIL also did some modelling on the process. They used 57 industry sectors for their assumptions on the economy. They came up with a bad scenario of outcomes for the Australian economy—industry and agriculture et cetera. I have not run into anybody in the agricultural sector who has said that this is going to have a significant positive impact on their capacity as a farm business other than possibly some of the wine producers. The beef producers are very disappointed and, obviously, the sugar producers are devastated that they were left out. In all fairness to Minister Vaile, I think he was probably devastated that he could not drive a harder agreement. But, at the time, given the international circumstances and the relationship between Australia and America there would have been obvious political pressures brought on him to come up with an arrangement that looked as though we were going to be a major beneficiary from the trading arrangements between the two nations.</para><para>I think it is unfortunate that he has had to bring this legislation before the parliament and, within a day, drive it through. As the members for Calare, Kennedy and Cunningham have pointed out, there is a requirement for the Australian people, through their parliamentary representatives, to sit down and examine this. The Senate Select Committee on the Free Trade Agreement between Australia and the United States of America was one of the committees put in place to do that. I am told that it will not report until 14 or 17 August, so the outcomes from one of the structures that the parliament has put up to assess the ramifications of this arrangement will not even be known until after what is supposedly going to happen here tonight when I think the lower house of the parliament endorses the free trade arrangement. That is disappointing and is something that this parliament does not really have to do. The main reason I will not be supporting this legislation tonight is that I do not think we have to rush into it. I do not think we have to make a decision within one day of the committee reporting on this 1,000-page document.</para><para>A number of people who have done modelling using a number of assumptions have come up with different determinations as to the net impact of benefit to the Australian community. I was interested that the member for Kennedy and the member for Calare raised the issue of the Productivity Commission not being engaged in a way in which it should have been to assess this matter. I asked the Prime Minister a question in this parliament on 14 February. I do not want to verbal the Prime Minister, but essentially the question was: given the fact that there were different views being expressed as to the benefits and disbenefits of this legislation—or the arrangement to the Australian people—would the Prime Minister look seriously at giving the Productivity Commission, as an independent assessor of the benefits and disbenefits, the opportunity to look closely at this piece of legislation? That has not occurred to the degree that it should have, and I think that says a number of things—the member for Kennedy may have hinted at those a moment ago. Obviously the government would have made some approaches to the Productivity Commission. There were probably some people within that commission who indicated privately that this arrangement was not as good as was being proposed by the government. I think it is extremely disappointing that the Productivity Commission has not been engaged. </para><para>I noticed recently that JSCOT—and I notice that the committee chair, the member for Boothby, is in the chamber now—heard evidence from Dr Philippa Dee. She indicated that Australia, under the assumptions and parameters that she proposed, would be $53 million better off under this arrangement. I think that displays to many that if there are benefits at all—and, personally, I think there probably are going to be some benefits from the arrangement—then they are marginally close for the beneficiaries. The benefits need to be examined in a much more considered way than they are being now.</para><para>The American people are not been rushed into making a decision on this. I have a number of documents from various parts of the American community, and I will not go through them at the moment, which indicate that they are going to have a well-reasoned look at this and examine very closely some of the biosecurity issues, from their point of view, that Australia has embraced or will have to embrace under the arrangements that would be put in place if there were a free trade agreement. They are not rushing into this; they are looking at the import rules and looking very closely at some of the sanitary and phytosanitary issues that they believe will have to be addressed by Australia before they will enter into this arrangement.</para><para>As I said a moment ago, Dr Philippa Dee believes there is a $53 million benefit to the Australian community in this arrangement. In an article in today's <inline font-style="italic">Land</inline> written by that great journalist Alan Dick, who I am sure the minister is quite knowledgeable of, the headline says `Chickens' $3.5b import fear'. It goes on to say that there are a number of issues being raised—biosecurity issues and free trade agreement issues—about the chicken industry's fear that it will possibly be wiped out by overseas imports into this country. It also raises some of the phytosanitary and sanitary issues that could have dramatic implications for the industry.</para><para>In one industry there is some degree of risk—$3.5 billion—and according to Dr Philippa Dee's assumptions a positive of a mere $53 million. What that suggests to me is that we have to slow this process down and have a real look at the implications. Forget about whether we are at war in Iraq, Minister, and about George Bush and the election of Labor and all those little things that are happening around you that paint the political picture. This is much more important than that. This is much more important than having something you can stick on the back of the toilet door saying, `We signed a free trade agreement back in 2004 and I was minister.' It is much more important than that. You may be right, but paint the toilet door and give it a few more months to dry before sticking things on the back of it. This needs some further consideration.</para><para>I often wonder how serious we are in looking at trade in this nation when we have gone through the fiasco in only the last few days of looking at fuel. We as a nation have a 50 per cent tax on fuel and we are talking about comparative advantage and accessing markets, coming to grips with globalism and all these sorts of things. We sit here and impose a 50 per cent tax on the fuel that we have produced and import. Even worse than that, when we look at some of the renewable energy sources—the replacements for fuel within this nation that we could employ—we could utilise agriculture to a great extent. We would then not be reliant on overseas nations for 80 per cent of the produce that we make. The ethanol producers of this nation—the renewable energy producers of this nation—spent 18 months trying to convince the Nationals, the Minister for Trade, who is at the table, and others in this parliament that they should not tax a new industry at the same rate as the oil industry. </para><para>We have gone through this ridiculous arrangement in the last couple of days whereby the minister responsible for energy has white-anted the processes of the renewable energy capital grants that were put in place by this government to encourage renewable energy. I do not believe the government or the opposition are serious about looking at some of these things. We are a nation that is dependent on overseas imports of fuel. We are a nation that is at war in that area and we have great concerns about the reliability of supply into the future. We are a nation that is very efficient in agriculture. We are a nation that can compete globally in terms of our efficiency. We are a nation that needs fuel and we can grow it at competitive rates—whether that be through grain production or sugar cane production. We are a nation that is prepared to spend $400 million in the sugar industry to get rid of it, but we will not spend much money at all to encourage the very same people to produce energy. What the government expects them to do is suffer the same taxation regime that the oil companies that have been round for 100 years have suffered within this place.</para><para>I do not think we are serious. We are in here arguing about a free trade arrangement when we are making it much more difficult for our own people to compete. What we are saying to many of our industries through this document is, `You're not required in this nation. We will access our food from other parts of the world which can produce it at lower costs.' I remember a few years ago, when this debate on globalism was happening. The Minister for Trade would be fully aware of this. At that time, Dick Smith made a whimsical comment when he asked, `When are we going to start paying Bangladeshi wages? If we want to be part of the global community, when are we going to start to engage in that?' Obviously, we are not going to engage in that and nor should we. But we have to have some recognition that the people who do produce food and other products within this country are entitled to a fair share. If there are opportunities for those same producers to move away from food and into renewable energy they should be given the option to do so and not be seen as some sort of taxation revenue source for the future. That is exactly what the Minister for Trade, the minister responsible for energy and the Deputy Prime Minister have done. They have allowed these people, who are out there and have responded to the renewable fuel policy of this government, to look at investing in a policy mix that they have constantly changed. To me that says that they are not serious about this issue at all.</para><para>In conclusion, I will be opposing this legislation. The member for Calare has proposed an amendment which, because of the procedural activity within the parliament, will not be voted on. I will not be supporting this legislation on the grounds that I do not think enough time has been given for full consideration of the issues. This is a groundbreaking area and we need more time to consider and make decisions. I am sure the Australian people will agree with that.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>31602</page.no><name role="metadata">Beazley, Kim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEAZLEY</name><name.id>PE4</name.id><electorate>Brand</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Trade, having listened to the debate on the <inline ref="R2118">US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2111">US Free Trade Agreement Implementation (Customs Tariff) Bill 2004 </inline>for most of the day, would assume there would be few friends of this legislation in this House. From this side of the chamber there has been a degree of intelligent criticism and questioning of both the process and content of the legislation. The views that have been expressed deserve to be heard. The call for a more leisurely consideration also deserves to be heard. </para></talk.start><para>Within the confines of the Labor Party I will be supporting this legislation. I am doing so conscious of the fact that the Labor Party will determine in its own conclaves whether this legislation stands or falls. That is the simple fact of the matter. It does not matter whether this legislation is put before or after the next election. That will be the case—it will be determined by the Labor Party whether or not this legislation carries. That is obvious to members of the government, as it is obvious to me.</para><para>Why do the members of the government make it so darn hard for members of the Labor Party to support this legislation? We have been subjected to vilification in question time after question time; the supporting base of the Labor Party has been subjected to vilification in question time after question time in this place. It is almost as though those who proposed this legislation do not believe in it—that those who proposed this legislation, having entered into those negotiations, are in fact disappointed with their handiwork. They felt that they could have done much better and felt they deserved to do much better and so, if it is not going to be a good trade agreement for this nation, it might as well be a useful tool to whip the Labor Party with in the period three months before an election. It is as though they believe that. One of the reasons I will be supporting this legislation—and it is a minor reason—is that I know the trade minister does not feel that way himself. But by golly his colleagues do! There are many of his colleagues along that front bench who are deeply disappointed with what the United States has been prepared to lay on the table in dealing with us now.</para><para>We are approaching this legislation very much as though we are the frog at the bottom of the pond looking upwards and not the fellow outside the pond looking down to those within it. From an American point of view, looking at this legislation and looking at the current trading arrangement with Australia, there is scarcely a product the United States cannot place in this country at a competitive price. There is scarcely a thing the United States cannot do in this country in terms of its investments and in terms of the product that it sells that it cannot do with as much ease here as the average American can do in the United States. That is why there is a trade imbalance in favour of the United States in the global trading system in relation to us that makes up to a very considerable degree for the poor trade balance the United States earns with many other countries with whom it trades. So there is, from the American point of view, very little to be gained in a trade agreement with Australia. Why bother, when you can place anything you want to place in Australia, make any investment you want to make or sell anything you want to sell to this country at a competitive price? Indeed, many in the United States say precisely this. We know that it is very hard to get many Australian products on a competitive basis in the United States market—particularly manufactured products, particularly if they are defence related products, particularly if they are products that compete with a major, powerful American industry. We know this. We know that we are the subject of anti-dumping laws and all other forms of treatment which makes life extraordinarily hard for us.</para><para>I attempted from time to time, when I was defence minister, to get products sold into their market. I almost always failed. It is a very difficult thing to do, even with this agreement going through—and it would much improve the situation. One of the biggest industries in my electorate—and it borders my electorate and that of Carmen Lawrence, the member for Fremantle—is shipbuilding. We do that, in niche terms, massively competitively in an unsubsidised way. But if the firms who are now offering to the United States what they call their littoral ships are to deliver them to the American Marine Corps and the American navy, which they probably will do, they have to enter into partnership with General Dynamics and produce them in the United States. The Jones act still applies, no matter what the fate of this legislation here or of legislation in the United States. So great Australian intellectual property, great Australian naval architects and great Australian naval engineers, will place their brains on the banks of the Mississippi, and American workers will produce the product of their brains. </para><para>But many in the United States do fear this agreement. They fear it because they know their situation is vastly more protected in dealing with us than ours is in dealing with them. They know that, over time, this will permit penetration of the American market by a first-class economy, not a second-class economy. They have their trade relationship with Canada, but I would place that on exactly the same plane as ours with New Zealand: there is an issue there of kin and there is an issue there of geography. They are a single economic entity as we are a single economic entity with the New Zealanders. So exclude Canada. When you take Canada out of the equation, this is the first trade arrangement of this type they have done with a first-class power: a power with workers as skilled as theirs or better skilled, workers more multiskilled than their workers, researchers more effectively niched than their researchers and engineers more effectively educated than their engineers—and all at about one-third of the price of theirs.</para><para>The people you talk to in the United States about this trade agreement cannot believe that there would be any opposition in Australia. I can think of a whole variety of good reasons why there should be. But they cannot believe it. They cannot believe there would be any opposition in Australia, because they assume that, once this is put in place, every barrier that is left will be torn down at some point of time over the course of the next decade. They would regard the disappointing result for agriculture as a foot in the door—a door that will ultimately be kicked wide open. In the United States they know that they are going to have some of their most treasured protections stripped away by a nation that is capable of ripping the veil right off when it comes to dealing with the many and varied different mechanisms for protecting the position that have been organised by different American industries over the years. Once we are in the door, it is an Australian Trojan Horse that has just marched in. </para><para>Having said that, obviously any agreement like this needs to be viewed not simply in terms of long-term prospects—because in the end, in the long term, we are all dead—but in terms of what it delivers right now. It is true that this parliament has not had a proper opportunity to evaluate this. It is true that there has been a committee process under way in the Senate which should have been concluded before we concluded on these matters. So everything I say carries with it this caveat: I have not seen the good advice of the quality individuals who are serving on that Senate committee, and I certainly would want to before I took any ultimate decision on this legislation before us now.</para><para>But one aspect of the debate which is not going to influence my vote at all unless it is in a slightly hostile direction is this: this has nothing to do with the United States alliance and ought to have nothing to do with the United States alliance. This has nothing to do with Australian participation in the Iraq war and ought to have nothing to do with the Australian participation in the Iraq war. We Australians do not buy with our blood economic opportunities. We Australians make decisions on these matters on the basis of what we believe is the right thing to do globally and the right thing to do in defence of the Australian national interest. </para><para>As a person who was an assistant defence minister and defence minister of this country for seven years and then served on the security committee of cabinet for another six years, I cannot convey to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, the sense of disappointment and frustration that I feel that this is placed within the context of the alliance relationship with the United States. In defending the joint facilities and the critical role they played in the global balance during the era of the Cold War—and still play in the defence of this nation and the defence of the United States—year after year I was obliged to go out there and argue with Australian farmers and the many others who have reasonable grievances, economically, against the United States about their demands. They argued that I should incorporate those demands within our discussions on renegotiating the ANZUS alliance, as the responsibility fell to me and Bill Hayden, after the New Zealanders wrote themselves out of it. At that point of time it was seen as a decisive opportunity by many in our farming community to ramp into those negotiations their really genuine, heartfelt grievances about the way in which they were treated by the United States collectively in terms of the perversion of international markets in which they were so strongly competitive. I had to say to them, `Listen, I do not mind talking to our American counterparts about these matters, and of course I will. But don't think for one moment that it is going to enter my conversation with them that if they not do what we ask them to do I'm going to pull the plug on Pine Gap. That will not be said by me.'</para><para>Nor would it be said by me in the contemporary era that we will decide to go to war in Iraq or we will go into Afghanistan if you do the right thing by us in this trade agreement. This trade agreement is not worth the life of a single Australian. Other issues may be worth those lives and historically have been, but not the trading arrangements between Australia and the United States—or for that matter global trading arrangements generally. To me it is an extraordinarily damaging thing to go out there now and argue that somehow or other we do not have the freedom to arrive at reasonable judgments on this matter because, if we arrive at a judgment in some way hostile to or critical of this, it will collapse the relationship with the United States. </para><para>While the two ought not to be interlinked, we have to accept the fact that, whether or not we feel happy about the character of the relationship, it is always going to be there in any argument about a military relationship with a power. If scores of Australians walk away unhappy with this and with a feeling that the government signed on to it only because it was a reward for a war with which they disagree, or if they feel that they are obliged to bear a burden as a result of the unsatisfactory features of this agreement because it was necessary to do it to uphold that alliance which was deemed important for other reasons, there will be no alliance with the United States within a decade. It will not stand. That alliance relationship stands because many in government make judgments about the Australian national interest and the fact that it serves it. But it also stands because Australians believe their relationship with the United States is a matter of fair dealing. Australians believe that, in entering a relationship with the United States, we are entering a relationship with a people who are roughly compatible with us in outlook and views about life. </para><para>If you do not like the government of the day in the United States, they might not like ours. If you do not like their opposition, they might not like ours. But you know that at the end of the day the process will produce from time to time governments in the United States which every single Australian will have agreements with. But suppose you put a poison into that relationship. Suppose you tell a sugar farmer that, whatever the government has been prepared to give them to come on side, and despite their disappointment with it, they have to lie down in their disappointment. If they come to believe that in lying down with their disappointment they will have to sell their farm and leave it, that is connecting this directly with the alliance, and that means that there is one individual out there poisoned against the totality of the alliance relationship instead of simply the character of this agreement.</para><para>I think Australian actors misconceive in many of their views about the potential impact of this agreement. The United States could sell a great deal more in entertainment product to this country. We way exceed in our television and film industry regulations any criteria put in place to protect Australian content. The Australian people have made decisions and will always make decisions in favour of Australian-produced content, so those views are misconceived. If those very influential actors and actresses believe—however misguidedly—that they are being sacrificed on the altar of a power play which is outside the character of this agreement, watch out!</para><para>We will not always find things so easy, in dealing with the United States, as we have found now. And we are finding it less easy these days than we have for the last few years. If we create a constituency of intelligent people in this country whose participation in the work force and capacity to earn their living is in some way hampered by arriving at this agreement then we create a constituency which, in a certain set of circumstances, could well undermine an alliance which is critical to us for other reasons.</para><para>I am about to support these bills—and, as I said, there are caveats in this—because, on balance, I think it allows us to more effectively penetrate the American market than we can at this point in time. But I am going to look at the provisions on pharmaceuticals very carefully when the Senate reports. As far as I can see, the Americans can pretty much do anything they please in this country as things stand now, so the balance of benefits has to work in the long term for us in those circumstances. That is the reason I am considering supporting these bills and arguing within the party conclaves that we all should.</para><para>I will miss no opportunity to deprecate those in the government who in this place—and I do exempt one of the ministers at the table from this—have said to us that this is a test of where we stand in terms of the military relationship this country has with the United States. That has nothing to do with it. If this treaty falls in a Senate or House vote in the United States in the next three weeks, I will think no less of the alliance. If the American people rejected this, I would be disappointed but I would not assume that their rejection meant that we would not have a military relationship with them, and I think the reverse consideration applies. We should discuss this in the next month on the merits of the proposition before us and on no other grounds.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>31606</page.no><name role="metadata">Vaile, Mark, MP</name><name role="display">Mr VAILE</name><name.id>SU5</name.id><electorate>Lyne</electorate><party>NATS</party><role>Minister for Trade</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—in reply—In concluding the debate in the House on the <inline ref="R2118">US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2111">US Free Trade Agreement Implementation (Customs Tariff) Bill 2004</inline> that will enable the entry into force of the free trade agreement that has been negotiated with the United States, I would like to thank all the members from both sides of the parliament and the Independent members who have participated in the debate in the parliament on what is quite a historic piece of legislation underpinning a historic agreement that has been struck with the largest and most dynamic economy in the world. </para></talk.start><para>I will take a brief moment to outline some of the background of the objectives of the government in pursuing this from the outset. As is well known within this place and across Australia, historically there has been very strong bipartisan support for the trade policy that we have pursued as a nation, regardless of who has been in power. Overwhelmingly, that policy has been focused on the multilateral system and, as we continue to argue in this place and outside, our policy perspective is still heavily weighted in pursuit of improvements in the multilateral system—that is, the global rules based trading system.</para><para>The frustration following the failure of the WTO meeting in Seattle caused a number of countries, including Australia, to rethink that strategy in terms of what could be achieved and what should be pursued in the shorter term in the interests of economic growth and development and economic integration across the world and the way it was globalising, if you want to use that expression. As a government, we took a decision that we would pursue with a number of our major trading partners opportunities, if they presented themselves, that would deliver faster, broader and deeper opportunities for our exporters. We did that with Singapore, we did that with Thailand, and we asked ourselves: why should we not do this with our largest trading partner? Why should we not do this with our second largest export market? Why should we not do this with the largest and most dynamic economy in the world? Why should we not do this with a country we are closely aligned with culturally and in a security sense? Why should we not pursue a better economic relationship with one of our very close allies?</para><para>We took that proposition forward from there. Of course, from the outset there has been a lot of opposition, a lot of cynicism and certainly a lot of pessimism about the prospective outcomes of a negotiation with the United States. There has also been a lot of pessimism about the possibility of getting such an agreement through the very complicated political processes in Washington and the United States generally. Guess what? As is often the case with us Australians—whether it is in international affairs like this, whether it is in business negotiations or whether it is in sporting endeavours—we set the bar much higher than we think we can jump but we manage to jump it. And I certainly believe we have done that in this case.</para><para>There is no-one in this country who believes that this is the perfect deal that delivers everything, but it is also not a perfect deal that delivers everything to the other side. In my former professional background there was an often-used description of `what is market value?'—that is, when you have a willing buyer and a willing seller but neither is anxious. I applied that principle to a finely balanced, politically and economically, trade agreement that we negotiated with the United States. We embarked upon this exercise with very ambitious and strong offensive positions in the things we were pursuing, as well as a very tight mandate—not just from the executive or the cabinet, but from the Australian people—in terms of the defensive position that we had to take in those very sensitive areas of public policy such as the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, the audiovisual sector, the intellectual property sector and the state-trading enterprises in the agricultural sector. We ran into some very heavy weather in the negotiations in a number of those areas. But we came through that and we succeeded in achieving what we were asked to achieve. We succeeded in delivering what we were asked to deliver in terms of those public policy issues that are so important to the entire Australian nation. At the same time, in so many areas—quite clearly enunciated by the member for Brand—we are going to gain significant new market access where our exporters desperately need it. Whether you argue that it is going to take place over time or not, the facts of the matter are that it is going to take place, we have arrived at that point ahead of our competitors and we have been able to displace them from that market for many years to come. </para><para>I can assure all members in this place, as I have done publicly, that there would not be anybody in this nation more disappointed than myself where the outcome for Australia's sugar industry is concerned. We had a realistic look at what might have been possible. Might we have been able to negotiate 50,000 tonnes? Might we have been able to negotiate 100,000 tonnes? What would that be worth to the industry? Would we actually get delivery on that? Would we get an agreement through the US congress that contained sugar? We obviously deliberated at length over those questions. At the end of the day, when the agreement that was to be accepted or rejected was on the table and it did not include sugar—and on the other side there were some things that the Americans had been pursuing vigorously that the agreement did not include either—we had to make a decision in the national interest. As the government we had to make the decision as to whether we walked away and did not pocket the opportunity for so many other industries—be they agriculture, manufacturing or services—or we went ahead to take advantage of those opportunities and open the door for future generations to move into this major market in the world. Of course, in the end, after consideration, we took that decision.</para><para>I know there has been debate about the economic modelling and others can get other economic modelling done that might produce different figures. But the modelling that has been done indicates that this is worth $6 billion to the bottom line after the first 10 years of operation. We will know about that—whether it delivers that—after the first 10 years. All we can do is work on the expert advice that we have been given. But there are billions of dollars worth of extra access for beef and dairy producers. There is tariff free access for Australian lamb. There is the removal of the tariffs for the auto sector. There is a tariff free access for all seafood exports. There is a liberalisation of service providers into the market where we get national treatment. That means that our service providers are treated exactly the same as American service providers in the marketplace.</para><para>Most importantly, we are given designated country status to be able to compete in the government procurement market in the United States—a $200 billion market federally in the United States, plus another $200 billion from the 27 states that have signed up to the government procurement chapter. We believe that was worth pursuing. We believed it was worth making the commitment to sign up, notwithstanding some of the disappointments that came in this agreement.</para><para>No trade deal, whether it be bilateral, regional or multilateral, is ever going to be perfect. We supported the outcome of the Uruguay multilateral round. There were gaps in that and there are things that we are still pursuing out of that round. We knew it was not perfect, but we supported it as opposition parties at the time. We believed it was moving forward. We believed it was giving us an opportunity to go through the next door to pursue that beyond the actual outcome of the agreement at the time. </para><para>I will address some of the concerns that have been raised during the debate in a number of areas. Firstly, issues have been raised over the PBS. We have debated this publicly and in this parliament. We have been through that. I know that JSCOT was very forensic in its analysis during three months of deliberations, 11 days of hearings, of over 200 submissions—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>CK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hardgrave, Gary, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>SU5</name.id><name role="metadata">Vaile, Mark, MP</name><name role="display">Mr VAILE</name></talker><para>—JSCOT is the representative body within this parliament to analyse what is in this agreement. JSCOT forensically analysed what was in the agreement in regard to the PBS. I want to make one point very clearly on the concerns about what we have agreed to as far as a review mechanism for the PBS is concerned: it does not require any legislative amendment to the PBS. Therefore, it will not open up the PBS. It will not mean that medicines on the PBS are going to cost consumers more. As far as the other side of the debate in pharmaceuticals is concerned—the generics—I can tell the House that we went to great lengths to ensure that nothing in this agreement was going to delay the movement of generic drugs onto the marketplace once patents have expired on the original medicines. We have ensured the future of the generic medicine industry in Australia and its access into the PBS and into the marketplace.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I go to a couple of other points that have been raised along the way. One issue that I know has been debated, and a little confused by some, is the extension of copyright. At one stage in some public comments the extension of copyright was confused with a cost that might be loaded onto the PBS. They are two separate issues. Some have said that the extension of copyright from 50 to 70 years would cost $700 million. Independent reporting suggests there will be no measurable cost to Australia from this change. Copyright value declines over time as newer works overtake older ones. But there is another important point on copyright, and that is that it also protects Australian intellectual property holders and gives them extended value for their work. We should not lose sight of that fact.</para><para>One of the members, it might have been the member for Wills, raised the concern about the investor-state dispute mechanism. He asserted that US companies would be able to sue if government decisions reduce their profits in Australia. This is another furphy. This was an issue that was raised by the United States, but we knew if we agreed to it that no state government in Australia would support this agreement. If we had that mechanism in there, it would enable foreign direct investors—if they were aggrieved about a decision taken by a local government body or a state government—to seek a remedy extraterritorially. We do not believe that is necessary in an agreement between two highly developed economies with very transparent legal systems that provide the opportunity for remedy within the state where the dispute may exist, so the investor-state dispute mechanism does not exist in this agreement. It does not apply to Australia and it does not apply to the United States. Therefore, if foreign direct investment coming into this country has a concern about a decision on their investment that has been made by a local government body or a state government body, then they seek remedy within the domestic laws within this country in exactly the same way that Australian companies do. That is something that we very avidly defended and argued from the outset—and, I say again—knowing from the outset from our consultation with the state governments before we entered into these negotiations that that was one of the criteria that they would not agree to having in this agreement, and it is not in this agreement. </para><para>Some comments have been made with regard to concerns about scrutiny and the ability to analyse and debate this agreement in this parliament since it was negotiated, I reiterate that I concluded these negotiations in early February this year. We made immediately public the outcome of those negotiations. We then tabled the agreement on 4 March, over three months ago. We tabled it in this parliament; it has been publicly on display on the DFAT web site; it has been available. We provided a national interest analysis which was tabled on 24 March—three months ago—in this place, and it has been readily available.</para><para>As I indicated a while ago, the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties—which has been in existence only since 1996—has had over three months of deliberations on this. This is the body that represents every political party and every member of this parliament in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. That is why it is called a Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. It is not a House of Representatives standing committee, it is a Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. It has been working for three months on its deliberations, it has had over 200 submissions, it has had 11 days of hearings and it has tabled its report this week, prior to the debate of this legislation in the parliament.</para><para>This parliament, and particularly this House of Representatives, has had ample time to analyse every individual element of this agreement. We have had a massive public debate across Australia about the pros and cons; the advantages and the disadvantages. We have tried to be as totally transparent as we possibly can about getting the Australian nation to understand what was at hand, what we had negotiated and what we as the government are recommending to the Australian people that we should be supporting. Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, I put it to you that we have done that, and we have done that in a very open and transparent manner.</para><para>I say again, as is the case with every bilateral, regional and multilateral trade agreement that any nation is likely to negotiate, it is not perfect, but it is well worthwhile supporting in terms of what it will deliver to the Australian economy immediately on entering into force on 1 January 2005 and for every year thereafter to eternity, generating opportunity for Australians and Australian workers in the new Australian jobs as we get into that American market. In relation to some of the comments from the previous speaker, it is not just the here and now. We can quantify the here and now; we can make a decision about the here and now; but we have to cast our minds forward 10 years, 15 years and 20 years, and that is what we are doing. That is what the economic modelling has tried to do in terms of what this delivers to the Australian nation. It does not clear away all the hurdles to getting into the American market, but it does clear away some.</para><para>The agreement that we have achieved has been modelled to produce a $6 billion benefit to the bottom line of the Australian economy after 10 years; it has been modelled to produce 30,000 jobs in the Australian economy. The most important element that I ask members to focus on when deliberating how they are going to vote on these bills is the fact that this agreement enters into force on 1 January 2005, and we know exactly what happens then, but that is not the end of a process. That is not the end of the work we have done for the last couple of years. That is not the end of the deliberations here.</para><para>That is not the end of the opportunity for the Australian economy and Australian exporters; it is just the beginning, because it opens the door—it opens the door on an annual basis for continual improvement and refinement of the economic relationship between Australia and the United States in exactly the same way as we have used the CER agreement between Australia and New Zealand to refine that relationship over the last 20 years.

Adoption of this amendment would effectively see the implementation of additional reporting requirements for advertising and communication projects, as per an order passed by the Senate on 29 October 2003 on government advertising. It would also have the effect of implementing the Australian National Audit Office's guidelines, which have not previously been enforced by the government.</para><para>One of the main impacts of the requested amendment is that it would prevent agencies from spending money on advertising and public information projects until the minister has presented a statement to the Senate. However, the government notes that the requested amendment does not provide the Senate or another party with the power to veto the project upon the tabling of the ministerial statement. Mr Speaker, it will not come as a surprise to you to know that the government does not believe that a reporting requirement of the sort proposed by the amendment, which has the potential to delay unnecessarily advertising and public information projects, is an appropriate way to enhance transparency of these projects.</para><para>As to the question of whether there is any need to strengthen transparency, the government is of the view that a suite of existing whole-of-government transparency mechanisms already provides significant visibility of advertising and public information contracts. In this context, I am referring not only to the Senate order on departmental and agency contracts but also to mandatory reporting requirements for contracts and agency agreements with a value of $2,000 or more, as well as the requirements in relation to annual reports.</para><para>Given the existence of these mechanisms, any new mechanisms specifically for advertising and public information projects will result in duplication and impose additional administrative costs on agencies for limited benefit. Moreover, the government does not consider Appropriation Bill (No. 2) to be an appropriate vehicle for the implementation of additional reporting requirements. The government would also like to remind honourable members that it continues to observe the guidelines for Australian government information activities that were implemented by the previous government in 1995. </para><para>In conclusion, the government's position on reporting advertising and public information projects remains as outlined in Senator Hill's response to the Senate order on government advertising delivered on 12 February this year. Specifically, the government believes the existing levels of scrutiny and accountability are sufficient and is opposed to the introduction of further reporting requirements. On that basis, I commend the motion to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>31614</page.no><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name><name.id>DT4</name.id><electorate>Hotham</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Labor Party support the requested amendment to <inline ref="R2036">Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2004-2005</inline> and urge the House to agree to it.

The current Prime Minister was a member of that government when it blocked supply to a previous Labor government. We do have to put a break on this wasteful government advertising. Their advertising is rampant. People see it on their TV screens. They are just being bombarded with it at the moment.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83Q</name.id><name role="metadata">Schultz, Alby, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name></talker><para>—I will come to that in a minute. I do not say that governments should not be able to advertise. What I am saying is that, if they are going to advertise, they should do it in accordance with guidelines—guidelines which ensure that the information being conveyed in the advertisement is essential for people to gain knowledge. That is what the guidelines have got to do. I say to the member for Hume: we do not argue that governments should not be able to advertise; we are saying that we need guidelines to ensure there is probity, accountability and no wasteful expenditure by the government, as we are seeing at the moment.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We all know that families are hurting. They are asking why, if the economy is so good, they are missing out. One of the reasons they are missing out is that this government are into waste and mismanagement, and nowhere is this more evident than in relation to the advertising being undertaken by them. The sum of $123 million will be spent in government advertising between now and the election. It is nothing more than pre-election advertising at the public expense—to buy votes, to buy themselves out of trouble. Just think what $123 million could buy as an alternative. It could buy well in excess of four million bulk-billed visits. Don't you think the Australian public would be much better served if they could get greater access to doctors who bulk-bill rather than have the government waste their money on the nature of these campaigns?</para><para>Let us take two examples of the advertising that is being undertaken at the moment, because our argument is that this is not about communication. One TV advertising campaign on at the moment—and it is costing $16 million—is about Medicare. But the advertising campaign on TV does not tell Australian families that they have to apply for something to get the benefit of the safety net. You would think that, if there was a piece of information that the government were wanting to convey, it would be contained in the advertisement. It is not. That is a $16 million spend. </para><para>There is another campaign, at $20 million, for family benefits, where people do not have to apply for a thing. The $600 payment comes to them automatically. They do not need to apply. But what the advertisement does not tell them is that the $600 can be clawed back by the government in certain circumstances—people find themselves in a debt trap. Why aren't they told that important piece of information? So we have $16 million being spent on a campaign where people have to do something to get the benefits but are not told about it, and $20 million being spent on a campaign where people do not have to apply, because the money is paid automatically, but are not told of the clawback. The problem with this advertising is that there should be guidelines that require the information to be conveyed and that require the government to explain in advance the purpose of the advertising. Where people have to make a request, the Auditor-General should be able to say: `Why doesn't the ad contain the information? Why doesn't it tell them about the clawback?' That is essentially what this amendment is all about. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline></para><para>The member for Hume asked a question about whether previous Labor governments advertised. Yes, they did. Of course they did. But let us look at the record on this. I would be pleased to table an extract from the Auditor-General's report which goes to the pattern of advertising by previous governments as well as by this government, and I seek leave to do so.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name></talker><para>—This is the Auditor-General's report up until the 1998 election. The argument is that Labor used to undertake these campaigns. The very interesting demonstration from this table is that, yes, when a Labor government was last in office, it did in 1995 undertake a number of advertising campaigns. I was involved in one of them—the Working Nation program.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83R</name.id><name role="metadata">Edwards, Graham, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Edwards</name></talker><para>—A good program.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name></talker><para>—It was a very good program. The advertisements were designed to tell employers that, amongst other things, they could get substantial subsidies if they were prepared to take on long-term unemployed people. As a result of that advertising, plus the campaign, we significantly reduced the number of long-term unemployed people. We actually got people connected with the work force, because employers, through the assistance that we advertised, were prepared to take them on.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The interesting thing when you look at that period—and I commend this to the member for Hume—is that Labor's advertising started to tail off very significantly in the middle of 1995. The election was not until the beginning of 1996. The pattern of advertising for information was there but not in the lead-up to an election, not just before the election was conducted. I urge the member for Hume to have a look at it. Contrast that with the 1998 election. There was a peak in the middle of the government's term but also a dramatic jump just before the 1998 election. That jump saw a spend of $32 million. Nothing that Labor advertised, in any peak, came anywhere near that. That is what the graph shows. But that was 1998—$32 million spent just before that election.</para><para>In 2001, before that election, the $32 million jumped to $66 million. As we have now established in the estimates, in the period between now and the next election—whenever that is—it will double again to $123 million. What sort of a gambling game is this—double you, see you, double you again—spending $32 million, $66 million, $123 million on advertising, all before you go to an election? It is all about vote buying, and nothing about information, nothing about informing people how they can benefit and what they can get from it. </para><para>Just to put it all into context, since this government was elected it has spent $780 million on advertising, and the concentration of that spend has all been around election times. Don't you think we need guidelines to oversee that? Don't you think we need some independent assessment as to whether this is an appropriate spend or a wasteful spend? Doesn't the parliament have the right to be able to say to the government of the day: `You can't do it. There is a better way to spend this money'? The fact is that, at the moment, 21 advertising campaigns in the media are either happening or in the pipeline. Last Sunday night, when I got home from this place relatively early, I turned on the TV and there must have been 10 ads during the movie. And they were not just on the one station: when you flicked the channels, they had lined them all up.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83V</name.id><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Dr Emerson</name></talker><para>—You could not get away from them.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name></talker><para>—You could not get away from these damned things!</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>0V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Slipper</name></talker><para>—They are good ads.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name></talker><para>—They are not good ads, because they do not convey information.

In addition to the $123 million that the Senate identified in the estimates process, it also revealed the new campaigns to be rolled out. A further $8 million is going to be spent on the superannuation co-contribution piggy bank advertisements—more pork in the pig in terms of the advertising campaign. There is to be a campaign on philanthropy costing $2.7 million, and that is only the placement costs, as we understand it. There will be a Commonwealth regional information service campaign with booklet distribution, costing $2 million, pitched at rural Australia. Again, that only covers the placement costs. There will be a new campaign on national security costing almost $1 million.</para></talk.start></continue><para>To top it all off, just this week the Prime Minister signalled that the farcical `be alert, not alarmed' campaign is to be resurrected.

Because they want to play to fear in the nation, not to hope or to our future. The government are in trouble and the only thing they know what to do with is fear and smear, and we have a campaign of extension to do it.

More than eight years later the Auditor-General is still waiting for the call from the Prime Minister.</para></talk.start></continue><para>To his credit, after the taxpayer funded advertising campaign on the GST in 1998, the Auditor-General took on, on his own initiative, the task of drawing up some guidelines and issuing them. They are a very good start. Labor have consistently argued that they are a good start and what the government should base its principles around. The requested amendment which is before the House only requires that the government comply with the Auditor-General's guidelines on government advertising, to hold the government accountable. That is all the amendment does. What can be wrong with that? What can be wrong with a process that the Auditor-General has put forward, having given this issue scrutiny? What can be wrong with his conclusions and with the guidelines he has drawn up being adopted by this government? Labor have consistently called for the government to sign up to these guidelines. That is what this amendment does and that is why we are supporting it.</para><para>The Prime Minister has been asked a simple question in the House again this week: do the advertisements that the coalition are now bombarding the TV airwaves with comply with the guidelines? <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> He refused to answer that simple question. It is not about advertising; it is about advertising that meets the decent standards that are laid down. The government's pre-election advertising breaches good governance. It is not targeted. It does not inform people about what they really need. It is all about fixing a particular problem that the government has, a problem rooted in its tiredness, in its lack of vision and agenda. It is just about trying to win government. Political parties should not benefit from blatantly political advertising which uses taxpayer funded money. Blatant political advertising is what we want to stamp out. Governments that do it do it in breach of the guidelines and should have to pay. That is what we are saying. We want these guidelines implemented. That is what this amendment does and that is why Labor are supporting it. It goes to a test of honesty and integrity, and it goes to probity—something that this government has been sadly lacking in. I urge it to support the amendment. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>31618</page.no><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Dr EMERSON</name><name.id>83V</name.id><electorate>Rankin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This is a case of three spikes and you are out—three spikes of political advertising, each before a federal election. As the member for Hotham, the shadow Treasurer, said, $32 million was spent before the 1998 election. That was doubled to $66 million before the 2001 election. Now it has been doubled again to $123 million in the spike before the 2004 election. To give some perspective on that, the party political advertising campaigns typical of a federal election cost around $10 million. So 12 times the cost of party political advertising is being required of the Australian taxpayers; $123 million is being fleeced from the Australian taxpayers to fund this government's propaganda and re-election campaigns. It is a case of three spikes and you are out, and you will be out through this scandalous waste of taxpayers' money.</para></talk.start><para>For month after month, the Minister for Health and Ageing resisted all requests and campaigns on our part—and all urging on behalf of young children and babies in this country—to have the pneumococcal vaccine provided so that struggling parents would not have to find up to $500 for that vaccine.

The government certainly did have other priorities—$123 million of taxpayers' funds being used on a propaganda campaign for the re-election of the Howard government.</para><para>Now we have more campaigns. Obviously, the Medicare campaign is on right now.

But it realised that it could not take a scalpel to Medicare in front of people, because they would be horrified. As a consequence, the government has been dismantling Medicare by stealth and then spending $20-odd million to try to persuade the Australian people that it is not dismantling Medicare by stealth.</para><para>I refer to the press release that the shadow Treasurer tabled. This is absolutely blinding, breathtaking hypocrisy. It is from John Howard—from before he became Prime Minister—and it refers to a $14 million advertising campaign under Labor.

It is unfortunate that the opposition here is seeking to criticise this government when the opposition's record in government was one where it, from time to time, saw fit to notify the Australian people when it made changes. In other words, the opposition is saying that there ought to be one rule for the Howard government and another rule for a Labor government.

Listening to the member for Hotham and the member for Rankin huff and puff over public money, one is simply amazed, especially when one considers the amount that the Australian taxpayer is currently paying for rent at Centenary House. If they want to criticise the government, then they ought to come into this place with clean hands.

I respond to the Minister for Health and Ageing by saying the following: since the May 2002 budget the opposition has sought to be in dialogue with the government about better ways of making savings on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme than simply increasing copayments. We on this side of the House understand the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. In fact, it is in Australia as a result of a set of measures originally put in place by a Labor government way back when. Of course, most health measures of any significance in Australia have been introduced by Labor—like Medicare, Medibank and the antecedents of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. All these things have always been fought against by the coalition, up hill and down dale, until they have thought it was in their political interests to backflip and adopt them, which is the sort of pretence that this government is engaging in now on Medicare. </para></talk.start><para>Rather than talk about that, I will explain the position on the PBS. We have always understood that the PBS needed to be sustainable. Since May 2002 we have sought dialogue with the government about better and smarter ways of making the necessary savings on the PBS—rather than increasing copayments. My predecessor as shadow minister for health opened that dialogue; the government never responded. Here we are, two years later. I myself have written to the minister for health and have received no response on what I think would be up to a $900 million saving on the PBS. If we had some form of cooperation with the government, I think there would be a set of savings measures which would mean that these copayment increases would be either wholly unnecessary or minimised. But the government has not cooperated and the opposition acknowledges that some things can only be done with the resources of government. There are some major savings to be made on the PBS which we can only crystallise as savings with the resources of government.</para><para>The argument we are having today is the following argument basically, and it ought to be understood by the Australian people: if the Australian people vote for the coalition government with John Howard as Prime Minister—and whoever he chooses to make health minister after the election, because I will warrant it will not be the current person holding the job—then there will certainly be a 30 per cent copayment increase on the PBS on 1 January. That is what people will be voting for. If people vote for and elect a Mark Latham Labor government, the incoming Labor government will crystallise the major savings we believe can be made on the PBS. That might mean that there is no need for any copayment increase on 1 January; if there is the need for any copayment movement, it will be a very minimal movement. So we understand that we need to make the savings. We believe there is a better way. We believe that we may be able to make those savings entirely without any increase in copayments. Any increase that may be required, if we cannot wholly make those savings through other measures, will be a very modest increase.</para><para>The choice could not be clearer: vote for the coalition and get a 30 per cent increase in Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme copayments and, of course, the continued destruction of Medicare, once they get out of the electoral cycle and go back to their normal behaviour—which is the destruction of Medicare. They pretend, Mr Speaker, as you would be aware, to support Medicare, but they only do that in the run-up to elections, when it is convenient to put ads on the television; the rest of the time they go about the business of destruction. So a vote for the coalition government will be a vote for a 30 per cent increase in copayments and the destruction of Medicare; a vote for a Latham Labor government will be for no increase in copayments or a very modest increase in copayments and a revitalisation and strengthening of Medicare for the long term—by the political party that created it and is the only political party that has continuously believed in it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>31622</page.no><name role="metadata">Abbott, Tony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ABBOTT</name><name.id>EZ5</name.id><electorate>Warringah</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Health and Ageing</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I do not wish to long detain the House on the Latham-Gillard-McMullan bill, the <inline ref="R1685">National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits—Budget Measures) Bill 2002 [No. 2]</inline>, which we are now debating, but it seems that we now have a third position on it from the ALP. Their first position was that they opposed these copayment increases tooth and nail and would never support them—`Not now, not ever,' in the immortal, deathless words of the member for Fraser, the shadow minister for finance. Then we had the mother of all backflips earlier this week when, desperate for money—and didn't their tune change when they suddenly needed some money themselves—they said, `Yes, these increases are necessary and this is responsible, and we are going to support the bill; in fact we begged the government to put it into the Senate.'

The reality that the minister seems to have forgotten—and it is a sad reality for Australia, and we would all like to forget it from time to time, so I forgive him for his forgetfulness—is that the coalition is actually the government. Just so he is absolutely clear, let me remind him that the Prime Minister is actually John Howard and the Minister for Health and Ageing, although I know it is a constant surprise to him, is actually the member sitting there—he wakes up every morning wondering what his portfolio is, but he is actually the minister for health—and the bill before the House is a government bill. The bill is here because it is the policy of the government and, if the government is re-elected, PBS copayments will go up by 30 per cent on 1 January.</para></talk.start><para>The position of the opposition is that, with the resources of government, we will endeavour to make all the necessary savings through better and smarter ways of saving on the PBS—ways that we have raised with the government but that they have not in any way cooperated with us on.

The government is blaming the opposition here, but the fact is the poor, the sick and the unemployed in our community are going to be severely affected by this.</para></talk.start><para>There is hypocrisy on both sides of parliament. We have a poverty crisis in this country. Just yesterday I attended the launch of the Vote [1] No More Poverty campaign by the Christian churches in this country, and here we are today in the parliament putting through a $4.90 increase in scripts. This is going to have a severe impact on ordinary Australians, and it is something that the Greens cannot condone at all. Forget about the politics, forget about the election campaign: we are talking about an extra $4.90 each time families have to get a prescription. This is going to have a severe impact on the poor, the sick, the unemployed and the elderly in our society, and I think the government and the opposition should be condemned for it.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>31624</page.no><id.no></id.no></debateinfo><para>The following bills were returned from the Senate without amendment or request:</para><quote><para><inline ref="R2037">Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2004-2005</inline></para><para><inline ref="R2040">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2004-2005</inline></para><para><inline ref="R2041">Appropriation Bill (No. 5) 2003-2004</inline></para><para><inline ref="R2042">Appropriation Bill (No. 6) 2003-2004</inline></para></quote></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>SUPERANNUATION LAWS AMENDMENT (2004 MEASURES NO. 2) BILL 2004 </title><type>Bills</type><page.no>31624</page.no><id.no>R2050</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration of Senate Message</title><page.no>31624</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Message received from the Senate returning the bill and acquainting the House that the Senate does not further insist on its amendments disagreed to by the House and agreeing to the amendments made by the House in place of those amendments.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>TEXTILE, CLOTHING AND FOOTWEAR STRATEGIC INVESTMENT PROGRAM AMENDMENT (POST-2005 SCHEME) BILL 2004</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>31624</page.no><id.no>R2073</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration in Detail</title><page.no>31624</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill—by leave—taken as a whole.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>31624</page.no><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Dr EMERSON</name><name.id>83V</name.id><electorate>Rankin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Clause 2, page 2, table item 2, omit the table item.</para></quote><para>Labor see a very positive future for the textile, clothing and footwear industry in this country.

We cannot compete against very low cost imports from China, where labour costs overwhelmingly determine the price of those products, but we are much more competitive in areas where there is a high skill content and a high innovation content. It is a tribute to the adaptability of the textile, clothing and footwear industry in this country that, against fierce international competition, many of our TCF facilities are going pretty well. But they do need ongoing support to make the transition to the high-skill, high-innovation content, and that is why we support the SIP funding and we would like to see that funding flowing to the textile, clothing and footwear industry at the earliest possible date.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>31625</page.no><name role="metadata">Macfarlane, Ian, MP</name><name role="display">Mr IAN MACFARLANE</name><name.id>WN6</name.id><electorate>Groom</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The government will be opposing the amendment to decouple tariff reform from the program—a very generous program, as the member for Rankin outlined.

The reality is that what the government is proposing under the textile, clothing and footwear amendments to existing arrangements is a balanced program to ensure that the industry moves forward—there is no argument with that. As part of moving forward, the industry has accepted that tariff reform is vital. The industry unanimously supports the certainty of this package. The Council of Textile Fashion Industries of Australia said:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>We expect the combinations of measures, including the tariff pause for a further five-year period, will place us well to be internationally competitive.</para></quote><para>The council accept that there has to be tariff reform, they accept the certainty that this government bill will provide, they accept the $747 million that this program is made up of, they accept that tariff reform is a part of that, and they accept that tariff protection does not work for their industry. In fact in the time that I have been negotiating these changes with the textile, clothing and footwear industry, we have seen fluctuations of 15c in the dollar. That has had a far bigger effect on the textile, clothing and footwear industry than any change in the tariff.  </para><para>It would be remiss of me not to mention the changes which the Labor Party introduced when it was in government. In government, the Labor Party cut the tariff rate from 55 per cent to 25 per cent in 10 years. This government have applied a tariff freeze. We have a step-down coming in 2005, followed by a further step-down in 2010. For the clothing and finished textile industry there will be a final step-down in 2015. These measures proposed by the government have the full support of the industry. </para><para>As I have said earlier, I am a proud wearer—I will not go back into the detail—of many of the garments made by the industry in Australia. I, like the member for Rankin and all those who sit on this side of the House, believe that the textile, clothing and footwear industry has a very strong future. Most importantly, the textile, clothing and footwear industry wants the certainty of the 10-year program which our bill provides.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>31626</page.no><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Dr EMERSON</name><name.id>83V</name.id><electorate>Rankin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will not detain the House much longer—though I think we will be detained for quite a long time on other matters in any event. But I thought I would take the opportunity to point out that Labor's position on this legislation has been well articulated by Senator Kim Carr in the Senate as the shadow minister for industry. I would pay tribute to a number of Labor members of parliament who have stuck up for this industry through thick and thin. They are the members for Bass, Braddon, Bendigo and Ballarat, the various members from electorates in and around the cities of Melbourne and Sydney, and those from electorates in the Illawarra. They have strongly represented this industry in the parliament.</para></talk.start><para>They have strongly advocated on behalf of the industry because they know it is a significant regional employer. Sometimes that is lost in the debate: the importance of the textile, clothing and footwear industries in creating regional employment. That is why we urge the government to make sure that the money from the strategic investment program flows without any further delay. There is great opportunity at the high-value end of this industry, and we would like to see that money flowing forthwith.

Students of the West's prosperity regard as a great step forward in our history the placing of the wealth of the community in the hands of a class of professional managers and directors who owed fiduciary obligations to shareholders, rather than the wealth being held in the hands of nepotistic, family based enterprises. But that separation of owners and managers created also the pot-ential for a conflict of interest between the professional class of managers and directors and the owners of a company.</para><para>Neoclassical economics rests on an assumption of perfect information, which is never achieved in practice. While we do not achieve perfection it is important, if we are to maintain the trust and confidence of shareholders in those who run their enterprises, that there should be the greatest possible transparency and the highest levels of independence in the creation of economic data and that directors and executives ought to be very directly and immediately accountable to their shareholders. The confidence and trust upon which our financial system and Australian free enterprise rest, have suffered at various times from major corporate collapses here with HIH, OneTel and Ansett—as we have seen in other parts of the world with companies like Enron and Parmalat.</para><para>This bill before us today is the next iteration of the government's Corporate Law Economic Reform Program, dealing specifically with disclosure, enhanced auditor independence and improved enforcement arrangements for corporate misbehaviour. It is a major reform package which will set Australia at the forefront of international practice in corporate governance. The bill implements a number of the recommendations of the HIH Royal Commission and represents the government's response to Professor Ian Ramsay's report <inline font-style="italic">Independence of Australian company auditors</inline>.</para><para>As honourable members would know, however, the bill is much broader than audit regulation and financial reporting; it contains significant measures to promote accountability of company directors to their shareholders in the area of remuneration. It also contains a mech-anism for infringement notices to be issued by ASIC for breaches of the continuous disclosure requirements. Continuous disclosure is described by Karen Hamilton at the ASX as `the jewel in the crown' of the Australian Stock Exchange, guaranteeing that there is no gulf in knowledge between insiders and outsiders and that all investors have access to the same information at the same time.</para><para>A number of amendments were made by the non-government parties in the Senate last night which relate to disclosure requirements regarding executive and dir-ector remuneration, questions to auditors at company annual general meetings, changes to the disclosure requirements regarding the true and fair view and the disclosure of company secretary qualifications in annual reports. The government did not oppose these amend-ments. While the government consider that some of them were unnecessary, and we really stand behind the unamended bill, the changes do not undermine the overall policy of the bill and they reflect the principles of disclosure and accountability. We ought to acknowledge that no-one has 20/20 vision in the area of corporate governance; it is an evolving science. None of us have a perfect view, and probably in a decade we will look back and think that we may have been acting imperfectly today, but the government are very proud of this series of measures and we want to thank those in the other place who have cooperated in its passage. </para><para>The bill has been the product of extensive consultation, and it has been one of the pleasures for me in this job as Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer to work with a truly motivated, professional, thoughtful, reflective and constructive financial services industry. The bill has benefited greatly from the input of so many members of that industry. In particular, I want to thank the members of the Business Regulation Advisory Group, who have been involved in the development of not only the technical aspects of the bill but also the broad policy. They had been invaluable in giving a practical business perspective to the measures contained in the bill. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> I know that the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services have made a number of recommendations relevant to the bill. The government intends to respond to the committee as soon as possible.

The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations told us that this bill is necessary because it is the only option available to rectify a flawed decision of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The minister maintains that the vast majority of small businesses covered by federal awards will eventually be subject to redundancy payments for their employees unless this bill is passed, and he told us:</para></talk.start><quote><para>The government strongly believes it is parliament's responsibility to use its legislative power and authority to shield small businesses from the AIRC decision.</para></quote><para>The government proposes to do this by removing from the AIRC's jurisdiction redundancy pay for small businesses with fewer than 15 employees. Just why this magic number of 15 has been selected is not explained, and that is why I say the bill enshrines inequity in Australian industrial law. It is an inequity which my local South Coast Labour Council rightly labels a disgrace. This is how labour council secretary Arthur Rorris sees it: </para><quote><para>It makes the ridiculous assumption that somehow workers in smaller enterprises have got different needs, bills to pay and other financial commitments than other workers that are fortunate to work in larger enterprises. We say that you if you employ someone you cannot negate your responsibilities to that worker simply as a result of the size of your business.</para></quote><para>And you know what? He is right. Certainly the Industrial Relations Commission of South Australia came to that conclusion back in 1987, when they found that it would be:</para><quote><para>... unjust to grant an employer an automatic exemption from the redundancy provisions simply because he employs less than fifteen employees.</para></quote><para>But wait, there is more—this is what they went on to say:</para><quote><para>It seems to us that the rationale behind such an exemption must assume, we think incorrectly, that an employer who employs less than 15 employees cannot afford to pay the redundancy benefits to his retrenched employees. It may well be that he has not the capacity to do so. But many employers who employ only a small number of employees have very lucrative businesses, whilst employers of a larger number of employees might make a relatively small profit . . . A provision of that kind is arbitrary and in our view is devoid of merit. All employees who are made redundant for whatever reason, are likely to suffer the same adverse effects no matter whether they were employed at a small enterprise or by a multi-national company. In our view all employees who are made redundant should prima facie be entitled to the same benefits.</para></quote><para>That sounds remarkably similar to my local South Coast Labor Council secretary's view, doesn't it, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley? The South Australian decision was not a flash in the pan either. The Western Australian Industrial Relations Commission had expressed very similar views two years earlier in 1985. It said:</para><quote><para>The claim to exclude from the redundancy provisions employers who employ less than 15 employees appears hard to rationalise and no real attempt was made by the applicants to do so. It is surely not the case that an enterprise that employs fewer than 15 people will generally not have the resources to meet redundancy payments and the like. Some enterprises forced to retrench 100 employees may find their resources taxed to a greater degree than an enterprise employing 14 people, and dismissing just one employee through redundancy. In the absence of argument to justify it this arbitrary exclusion appears to us to be unnecessarily and illogically discriminatory.</para></quote><para>To this one can only say, `Hear, hear.' Isn't it interesting that the legislation now before us is similarly devoid of argument to justify it? All the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations could tell us was:</para><quote><para>Small businesses tend to be chronically undercapitalised and in general do not have the financial resources to cope with large, unpredicted commitments such as redundancy payments. Small businesses are twice as likely as larger businesses to go out of business in the earlier years of operation. Even after 15 years of operation they are still 1.7 times more likely to cease than larger businesses.</para><para>In the government's view, the AIRC's decision seriously underestimates the impact that redundancy pay would have on small businesses. For instance, a typical retail small business with seven employees, each with six years continuous employment, would now face a contingent liability for redundancy pay of nearly $30,000.</para></quote><para>Never mind the internal inconsistency of the minister's statement in regards to `large, unpredicted commitments' and `contingent liability'—we will let that through to the keeper. Never mind the fact that somewhere around 70 per cent of new small businesses fail in the first two years of operation. Never mind the fact that the Minister for Small Business and Tourism told this House, on the same day that his workplace relations ministerial colleague introduced the legislation before us, that 70 per cent of Australia's 1.1 million small businesses operate from home and many of them have a turnover of less than $50,000. Why is the government more concerned with protecting 270,000 small businesses than the three-quarters of a million people, minimum, that they employ? The South Coast Labor Council secretary is spot-on in his assertion that: </para><quote><para>... if you employ someone you cannot negate your responsibilities to that worker as a result of the size of your business.</para></quote><para>This bill would entrench inequity in Australian industrial relations law and therefore I feel it must be rejected.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>31633</page.no><name role="metadata">Schultz, Alby, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SCHULTZ</name><name.id>83Q</name.id><electorate>Hume</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank you for the opportunity to speak today on the <inline ref="R2055">Workplace Relations Amendment (Protecting Small Business Employment) Bill 2004</inline>. Before I get into the general thrust of the bill, I was interested to hear the views of the member for Cunningham, as a Greens representative in this place, because I did read the attitude of the Greens through their policies, which I extracted from their web site. I would like to make the point that I was also interested in what he had to say as a person who worked as an employee in large and small businesses and then as a manager in large and small businesses over my lifetime. I was also interested to hear from him because I thought back on my times when I attended the Australian Industrial Relations Commission as a witness on many occasions on both sides of the fence. It is true to say, from my experience, that some of the decisions that came out of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission were at best deplorable and at worst influenced by personal political views—rather than their making an impartial decision.</para></talk.start><para>As an example of what I am talking about—and I do this to illustrate the difficulties that employees have in dealing with some of these issues—in my capacity as a supervisor on a slaughterhouse floor at one stage, I sacked about 11 people for failing over a four- or five-day period to take a direct instruction from me as a supervisor. That went to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. After days and days of hearing, at considerable cost to the company, the industrial relations commissioner of the time made the astounding statement that the company was absolutely proper in the way in which it went about warning those employees and was absolutely proper in the way in which it went about dismissing them. In other words, the company was absolutely right in the way in which it went about exercising its right to operate as an employer. But the industrial relations commissioner of that time then went on to say, `However, given the long-term employment record of these particular people, I strongly recommend to the company that they reinstate them.' That is just one illustration of the sort of thing that I have experienced as a person working in the system both as an employee and as an employer.</para><para>Before I get back to the base of the bill, I would just like to quote from the policies of the Australian Greens in relation to their principles on work, which this bill does affect. They say:</para><quote><para>The Australian Greens distinguish between work, defined as any purposeful activity, and employment, defined as paid work. We support the principle of full employment, meaning the availability of safe, socially useful, environmentally benign, adequately paid work for all those who wish to engage in it.</para></quote><para>I will just finish with some more words to illustrate the approach that the Australian Greens have to work and small employers. About three paragraphs further down, it reads: </para><quote><para>The Australian Greens realise that the logical consequence of the present conditions is that less formal work is needed and more free time becomes available for everyone's chosen pursuits. Thus the Australian Greens will work towards shorter standard working hours and a reversal of current trends towards increased unpaid work.</para><para>A radically new perspective needs to be taken. The green vision is one where work, leisure and income are all shared equitably. In a green society, everybody is the master of her/his own time. People must have time for leisure as well as for shouldering the responsibility of the family, society and the environment. People must also have time to keep better informed and to participate in politics.</para></quote><para>Some of those ideals are well intentioned but are not conducive to the economy of a free and open society such as ours. I conclude my comments in that respect by saying that it is unfortunate that the great Prime Minister of this country, Bob Menzies, who did all the work to ensure that the Communist movement was removed from this country, has failed to the extent that we see a re-emergence of it through the ideals of the Australian Greens.</para><para>I have to congratulate the workplace relations minister on taking such swift action on this issue of redundancy payments. I say that in the context of the misguided decision by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in March to impose redundancy pay obligations which have had a crippling effect on small businesses—and will continue to have a crippling effect on Australian small businesses if left unaddressed. It is this government's responsibility to protect small business from this decision, because these businesses have nowhere else to go due to the potential impact it would have on their future.</para><para>If this bill is not passed, the vast majority of small businesses covered by federal awards will eventually be required to provide redundancy payments for employees in accordance with the AIRC's decision. If this bill is not passed, small businesses that are constitutional corporations and that are covered by state awards will become subject to redundancy payments if the AIRC decision flows on to state jurisdictions. Many small businesses operate on an overdraft or without the luxury of idle cash reserves. This is an additional cost and operational pressure they can do without. I illustrate that point by saying this: small businesses are normally made up of families that pool their money, go into business and employ as many as 15 and as few as one or two workers. In the current environment, they are subjected to unfair dismissal laws, superannuation impositions, holiday loadings and occupational health and safety issues.</para><para>All those things are commendable, but they have to be affordable for small businesses to be able to operate profitably and continue to employ people. They are also subjected to pressures from local government, which many people forget about. As an example, they are required to have certain pieces of equipment or facilities within their small business, under the umbrella of local government requirements—as you, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, would know as a former minister of the Crown. They are subjected to significant financial impositions—for example, they are required to provide disabled toilets whether or not they are ever going to employ disabled workers. There is nothing wrong with that, but I am just stressing the issue of the cost of putting such facilities in these businesses. It is significant.</para><para>As a further example, they are subjected to significant pressures with relation to `Exit' signs—and they are not just ordinary signs; they cost a significant amount of money and they are required to have five, six or seven of them at particular doors for obvious safety reasons, such as in the case of fire. The point I am making is that there are those sorts of pressures on small businesses that could be covered by businesses with larger profits, but small businesses find it extremely difficult. That is one of the reasons that I say many small businesses operate on an overdraft or without the luxury of idle cash reserves. </para><para>By supporting this bill, members of the House will be removing redundancy pay for small businesses with fewer than 15 employees from the jurisdiction of the AIRC. They will be cancelling the effect of any variations that were made by the AIRC to awards from the time of the decision until the legislation commences and they will be protecting small businesses covered by state awards from the expected flow-on effect of this AIRC decision.</para><para>We have more than 1.2 million small businesses in this country and we have a responsibility to support and protect them because they are making a significant contribution to the economy of this great nation of ours. Small businesses do not have the financial resources to cope with large commitments such as redundancy payments. Small businesses are twice as likely as larger businesses to go out of business in the early years of operation. The member for Cunningham commented on the point made by the minister that, after 15 years of operation, they are still 1.7 times more likely to go out of business than larger businesses.</para><para>For the three million or so people employed in small businesses, this move by the government might seem harsh. However, small businesses can still reach a one-on-one agreement with their employees in the event that they can afford to do so. That, as far as I am aware with my continual contact with small business, is a very relevant issue and it is working extremely well. The last thing they want to do is have people putting more and more pressure on them. In addition to the points that I made earlier, they have significant pressure put on them by trade union officials, who have access to all sorts of things that impose on businesses.</para><para>Recently, as somebody who has been down that track over the years, I gave some advice to small and medium-sized businesses in my electorate: get yourself one of those nice little tape recorders that you can hold on your person and, when a union official comes and threatens you like they have done, turn it on. You do not have to put up with that sort of nonsense. Turn it on and tape them, and use it against them legally. That is the sort of pressure that small businesses have been subjected to and I, for one, will not tolerate it. I, for one, will share with small businesses any experience that I have had over my years in dealing with that sort of activity to help them stay viable.</para><para>This bill has been supported by key businesses and farmers' groups, who agree that the burden of redundancy payments would break small businesses. The National Farmers Federation called the AIRC decision ludicrous and short-sighted. As they rightly point out, the commission ignored evidence presented by state governments and employers that supported the exemption of small businesses from redundancy payments. No-one other than trade unions supported its removal. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry estimated that, if the exemption was not reinstated, Australia's small businesses would be required to find about $190 million more each year for redundancy payments—on top of termination pay and unfair dismissal requirements which I have already mentioned.</para><para>Let us talk about Labor's proposed streamlining of incapacity to pay provisions. Labor has conceded that many small businesses should be exempted from redundancy pay, but the exemption mechanism proposed by Labor will not work. The Labor mechanism has been tried and tested and has proven to be a failure. It would not protect small businesses from redundancy pay, and small businesses that even Labor concedes should be protected would be pushed to insolvency. Labor is willing to sacrifice the 30 per cent of Australian small businesses that it says cannot afford redundancy pay because they are not profitable at the time they make retrenchments. </para><para>We know that the Labor exemption mechanism is a failure because it has been available to larger businesses for 20 years and it does not appear to have produced even one exemption. A search of electronic databases of federal and state decisions by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations did not reveal any cases in which an employer had been exempted from redundancy pay decisions. This is despite the fact that many thousands of larger businesses have failed since the exemption mechanism was first established in 1984 and demonstrably have not had a capacity to pay redundancy pay.</para><para>Simplifying and streamlining the exemption process as proposed by Labor will be equally ineffective at saving small businesses. Again we know this because streamlined `incapacity to pay' mechanisms have been tried very recently and have failed. In 2003 the AIRC established a streamlined process for farmers to seek a delay in the imposition of safety net review wage increases if they were in an exceptional circumstances declared area and in receipt of exceptional circumstances relief payment benefits. This mechanism has failed to exempt even one farmer from the wage increases. This is an extraordinary failure given that the AIRC had accepted that, where a farmer met the defined criteria, the farmer would be prima facie entitled to relief on the grounds of economic incapacity.</para><para>The National Farmers Federation outlined the reasons why farmers rejected the process in its submission to the 2004 safety net review case. The NFF pointed to the requirement to provide detailed financial records that could be considered by the union even if none of the employees were union members, and the capacity for a hearing to be held which may require the farmers to be cross-examined by the union. The reasons given by the NFF for the failure of the process are not rectified by the Labor proposal. Allowing electronic lodgment of applications and similar changes to the `incapacity to pay' process does not address the elements of the process that were unacceptable to farmers and will be unacceptable to small businesses. In fact, electronic lodgment has been available for applications to the AIRC since March 2003. Electronic lodgment was available for the farmers who wished to make an application for delay in the imposition of the 2003 safety net review wage increases. Electronic lodgment has been tested, and it has failed to overcome the notorious ineffectiveness of `incapacity to pay' processes.</para><para>Labor has finally conceded that small businesses need to be exempted from redundancy pay, but its proposed exemption mechanism will not work. Even with Labor's gross underestimate of the numbers of small businesses that cannot afford redundancy pay, Labor's proposal would have 161,000 small businesses, or 30 per cent of small businesses, having to go cap in hand to industrial tribunals and to unions to get the exemption they need and deserve. This is a ridiculous proposition. Worse still, Labor's proposed exemption mechanism will not protect small businesses that cannot afford redundancy pay. </para><para>Let us now address the issue of the government allegedly riding roughshod over the AIRC. This legislation is necessary because it is the only option available to rectify a flawed decision of the AIRC. Members have a clear choice here of whether they support small business or support a flawed decision. The government has decided that it will continue to support small businesses, the vital ingredient to our economic and employment prosperity. Opposition members have attacked this legislation for dealing with small businesses that are constitutional corporations and that are covered by state workplace relations jurisdictions. Yes, it does, and the government makes no apologies for this. To protect small business employment, as intended by the bill, it is essential that the AIRC's decision be prevented from flowing to state workplace relations systems. This bill is about protecting employees working in small businesses and those small businesses that are currently excluded from the cost burden of redundancy payments. Employees of small businesses will not benefit if the AIRC's decision costs them their jobs. </para><para>The AIRC's decision concedes that some small businesses cannot afford redundancy pay. But it grossly underestimates the impact that the decision will have on small businesses. More importantly, I do not think they care about it. There can be an impact even on those that are profitable. Even profitable small businesses tend to be undercapitalised and generally do not have the financial resilience to cope with large, unpredicted commitments such as redundancy payments. They do not have unencumbered assets. Often, as I said earlier, the family home has already been mortgaged to finance the business. They are family businesses run by families, and in some cases they have got to the point where they will no longer employ people and are taking on family members and encouraging family members to work in the business because that is the only way they can survive. Is that the sort of society we want in this great country of ours? I think not. </para><para>In closing, I strongly support this legislation and I sincerely hope the minor parties will ensure its passage through the parliament. The consequences of ignoring this AIRC ruling would be disastrous. Small business is too important to our economy for us to simply sit back and allow this decision to run small businesses into the ground. Again, I congratulate workplace relations minister Kevin Andrews on this bill and, on behalf of the small businesses in Hume, I thank him for his efforts. I thank the House for the opportunity of making those pertinent points in the chamber today.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>31637</page.no><name role="metadata">Andren, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDREN</name><name.id>KL6</name.id><electorate>Calare</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R2055">Workplace Relations Amendment (Protecting Small Business Employment) Bill 2004</inline> is another example of the undermining of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to oversee the fair working of federal awards and workplace relations. Either we have an umpire in our industrial relations system or we do not. Back in 1996-97, during the debate on the workplace relations legislation, compromises were made regarding the legislation to retain what I believe most Australians would regard as the necessity of there being a strong, continuing and independent role for the AIRC in workplace relations legislation in this country.</para></talk.start><para>This bill seeks to overturn the redundancy test case decision of the full bench of the AIRC handed down on 26 March this year. This decision put in place a new scale of redundancy payments for employees covered by nine different federal awards. Briefly, the new scale states that there will be no severance payment to those who have been employed for less than one year; for those employed between one and 10 years, the scale of redundancy slides up from four weeks pay to 16 weeks pay; and for those employed for more than 10 years, their redundancy payout is 12 weeks wages, taking into account long service benefits that this group may have already received. The new scale is also to be applied to employees of small businesses under the still current definition of a business with 15 or fewer employees. But redundancy payments made to small business employees will slide up from four weeks pay to eight weeks for those with service of between one and five years and are capped at eight weeks pay for any employee with five or more years service—that is, eight weeks pay for 5½, 10, 15 or 20 years of working for the same organisation. </para><para>The redundancy payments have not been extended to casual employees of any sized business. In an economy where casualisation is steadily increasing, for those who want the flexibility, as well as for those who find themselves with no other choice, the impact of this test case decision may not be as great as the government anticipates. But, then again, increasing casualisation of the work force may be a symptom of increasing redundancies. This AIRC decision has, in effect, put in place a safety net for redundancy payments. The minister argued that overturning the AIRC's redundancy test case decision will encourage employers and employees to negotiate between themselves to come to an agreement on redundancy payments. This can still happen. The AIRC has done no more than provide a minimum benchmark for this process.</para><para>I believe redundancy to be quite a different scenario to dismissal in the workplace. I have consistently supported the government's proposals that small businesses with 15 and now 20 or fewer employees should be exempt from unfair dismissal laws but certainly not from unlawful dismissal. That is the compromise I am prepared to make to ensure that small businesses can operate without the threat of protracted litigation when the proper processes have been followed to counsel, warn and remove underperforming or disruptive staff. There is never a case for diluting unlawful dismissal provisions that relate to issues such as gender, race or religion. Small businesses in country and regional areas do need that protection and, no doubt, they need it elsewhere.</para><para>However, I do not support a bill that will remove redundancy payments for small business employees. Redundancy is not about dismissal for nonperformance, misconduct or criminal behaviour. As I understand it, redundancy is a result of organisational change. It is about business restructuring to better meet challenges in the marketplace, and to improve profitability, no doubt. The other side of the House continues to push the ogre of the union bogeyman, when statistics show that union membership is falling away dramatically and workers are rejecting unionism. They are more and more left to their own devices when seeking and, indeed, when holding on to and losing employment.</para><para>Recent statistics that I obtained from a Parliamentary Library research paper that found its way into the press a month or so ago showed the extent to which the workplace is being casualised and the uncertainty that now pervades the workplace. That is why many people are not relaxed and comfortable with what is close to what the economists call a full employment economy, because five per cent unemployment does not mean that 95 per cent of people have as much work as they want. It did mean that perhaps 25, 20 or 15 years ago but it certainly does not mean that these days. Indeed, it statistically means that a person has to work for only an hour a week to not appear in the statistics. Underlying those figures is a great uncertainty and insecurity in the community about whether or not they will have a job in some cases next week or next month and in many cases certainly by the end of any particular six-month or 12-month period. </para><para>It is fair enough that a business, regardless of its size, makes some contribution to those employees who find their services are no longer needed as a result of restructuring. These workers are forced to make transitions of their own, as a result of being made redundant, either by finding new employment or, as often is the case for older workers in shrinking industries like manufacturing, by facing long-term unemployment. In my electorate this has been an all too regular occurrence in recent years, especially around Lithgow. This region was once renowned for a strong manufacturing base, but the number of jobs in that sector has been steadily shrinking. In the case of Berlei and others, jobs have been lost to overseas, and unemployment in midlife is becoming more and more a fact of life. Those left out of work for the most part are middle-aged, male and unskilled, without the skills and education to make a transition to the few available opportunities in the new technology and service based economy.</para><para>Eight weeks pay is not too much to ask for workers who have performed to their employers' expectations for more than five years and yet are made redundant as a result of restructuring. At paragraph 272 of the test case decision, the AIRC concluded that `the nature and extent of losses suffered by small business employees upon being made redundant is broadly the same as those employed by medium and larger businesses'. Those in support of this bill may say that this does not account for the capacity of small business to pay. At paragraph 273, the AIRC counters that, based on data from 1997-98—which is the most recent data available—some 70 per cent of small businesses are indeed profitable. There has to be a trade-off, somewhere, between the realistic expectations of small business—and the fact that they generate work—and the fact that the employees generate the revenue and indeed the profits. There must be some trade-off in which those people, particularly those who are middle aged and do not have much expectation of further employment, can have some sense of security. As little as eight weeks pay strikes me as a fair compromise.</para><para>Paragraph 273 of the AIRC's conclusions provides an avenue of relief for those businesses that are unable to meet their redundancy payment obligations under an `incapacity to pay' provision. The AIRC's test case decision therefore already provides adequate protection for businesses that may be adversely affected by their obligations. The AIRC also made a supplementary decision which took into account some of the issues raised by the employer groups that made submissions to the test case. It determined not only that small businesses will only be obliged to pay a maximum of eight weeks wages in redundancy payments but also that length of service will only be counted from the date of the decision. This effectively defers any maximum eight-week redundancy payouts to mid-2008 or later. That certainly gives small businesses the opportunity to provide for the eight-week payout that we are talking about.</para><para>The government contends that it is running a strong economy. In respect of the national accounts for the March quarter this year, the Treasurer stated that business and consumer confidence are at high levels—that is, notwithstanding that so much spending is through credit cards—employment growth is robust, and again, I counter that the unemployment figures hide massive underemployment in our economy; and price and wage pressures remain contained. We now have such flexibility in the work force that you can bring in and get rid of labour at the drop of a hat. We now regard employees as units of cost. On that point, I make an exception of most small businesses in my electorate. But, in the modern economy more broadly, employees have more and more become a unit of cost that can be injected into an enterprise when needed and taken out of that enterprise when needed. That is the tension we have in the brave new world of employment, where casualisation offers the flexibility that business demands in a globalised economy. </para><para>We heard yesterday in the debate on the free trade agreement that we will soon be obliged to take in North American fruit in far greater quantities. Fruit picked by whom? Good luck to the Mexican people who can go up to the US and get those jobs on special dispensation from President Bush and send money home to their poor families; I certainly have no objection to that. But I have an objection to the fact that it forces down the cost of that product, which is then landed here under the guise of free trade, while our orchardists are battling to provide that product at a similar price, notwithstanding the considerable difficulties in the marketplace, as it stands, through the marketing chain.</para><para>We are faced with a situation where there is more pressure on local small businesses, orchardists and so on to seek every avenue to cut costs. Of course, they would say that they cannot afford redundancy payments. But I think we have to look at the fairness of the whole process and of suggesting in this bill that we dramatically reduce the surety that people can have after having worked for an extended period for an employer. This is symptomatic of a slant towards the workplace that is so flexible that it tends to forget the victims, the one-third of the work force that are casual—and many of them are not there by choice. Surely, under such conditions, a basic standard of redundancy can be determined for employees of small business by the AIRC, the body charged to determine such things, without the interference of the government?</para><para>Since my first day in this place, I have strongly defended the need for the AIRC's role in the industrial process. Legislation such as this strengthens my belief that that should be the case, particularly with the increasing casualisation of a work force that is more and more vulnerable and deserves at least the surety of secure redundancy outcomes. I cannot support the government's intention in this bill to overturn the work and decisions of the AIRC, especially when such decisions have been made with due consideration and attention to the realities of the modern economy and the operation of our system of workplace relations within it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>31640</page.no><name role="metadata">Hull, Kay, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs HULL</name><name.id>83O</name.id><electorate>Riverina</electorate><party>NATS</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is a great pleasure to rise to support this government's interest in and commitment to ensuring that small businesses are able to actively operate their businesses in an environment that can give them some kind of insurance and security. I for one support the <inline ref="R2055">Workplace Relations Amendment (Protecting Small Business Employment) Bill 2004</inline>. I would like to see the maximum number of staff in a small business increased from 15 to 20, because I think there is some misunderstanding at many times as to what actually constitutes a small business—that is, how many employees you have before you then enter the realm of a small to medium enterprise and then a large business. There is always some confusion about that.</para></talk.start><para>We have been asked to restrict our speaking times today in order to move legislation through, so I have cut short what I would like to present to the House in support of this bill. Now that I have listened to the member for Calare's speech, I would like to make some comments on his thoughts that redundancy takes place when there is going to be a restructure for growth or to benefit the company, perhaps financially. Redundancy can also be a sink or swim decision for a small business. Many times a redundancy means that the owner needs to take stock of their business because, through no fault of their own, conditions of the small business may be declining and the profits may be declining. That is something they might have to confront. Redundancy is not only about restructuring for growth. Clearly, it can be about survival. That is often forgotten. Sometimes in small business you do have to restructure, but it can be a restructure downward in order that you can survive the ensuing period—maybe not to employ four or five people, or 10 or 12 people, but to employ three people or six people, respectively. To ensure ongoing employment for them, you have to make some hard decisions so that your company and your small business can continue in operation at all. </para><para>We heard about how employees work and provide services in good faith to an employer and that they need to be rewarded for that. When does the time come for recognition and reward of the good faith that an employer enters into and provides to employees? An employer provides a working wage in good faith and commitment to their staff. They take people on and take enormous risks. It is the employer who has the overdrafts and the many sleepless nights. It is the employer who is constantly working out how they need to look at or change their business and keep up with the ensuing market areas so that they can be competitive. It is the employer who has their house mortgaged and who owns very little of value because everything is tied up in their business. And everything that they do make goes back into making that business even better and, hopefully, bigger so that they can employ more people.</para><para>There is a constant call for other operators to ensure that the small business person is living up to standards. There is constant hassle about OH&amp;S, and a whole host of impositions are put upon a small business without remuneration—things that a small business owner or operator has to absorb and accept, taking out more finance and, perhaps, a larger overdraft to ensure that their business can continue to employ. Meanwhile, the employee goes to work, dutifully does a day's work and dutifully leaves. That is where their responsibility stops. But an employer's responsibility never stops. Who can tell where their responsibilities start and stop? It is one of those things; and they are absolutely committed. The member for Calare said that 70 per cent of small businesses are profitable. What defines a profit—a few hundred or a few thousand dollars in the black? The only measure of being profitable in a small business is that you are not in the red, but there is no account of how little you have in the black.</para><para>There needs to be clear recognition, real recognition, of the contribution of small business operators and owners as small business workers. There is some assumption that small business owners and operators are not workers. They are out there working on the floor, working at the counter, delivering whatever they have to deliver in whatever type of business they have. If you have a medical practice, you are operating a small business and you are working right alongside the staff for enormous hours. Doctors are still there for many hours after the staff have signed off for the night, closed the computer down and gone home. If you are in a business like a smash repairer, like my family business, it is a 24 hour a day, seven day a week job—it never ends. When your staff leave at five o'clock in the afternoon, after having come in at eight o'clock in the morning and after having had morning tea and lunch, you stay there and go on duty to ensure that, when accidents happen in the night, you are up and about to bring in the work so that the staff have a job the next day. Where is the recognition of the contribution of the small business owner and operator to the people that they employ? There is a significant lapse of understanding, particularly in this House, as to just what constitutes a small business. A small business owner and operator works on the floor. They do not sit around all day. It is a 24 hour a day workload mentally, physically and emotionally for anybody to run a small business. </para><para>I know business owners who keep people employed when, because they are going out backwards, they should not, and they do this because they are absolutely dedicated to their staff and will do anything and spend any money they have in their own reserves to ensure that they are doing the right thing by their staff. But how many times do you hear recognition that owners and operators of businesses do the right thing by their staff? You only hear about the consequences in the cases of the small minority of people who may do the wrong thing.</para><para>Small businesses continue to be the lifeblood of many communities, including those in rural and regional Australia. In this current period of drought, it is small businesses that have continued to keep their staff employed and have battled on, knowing that they are playing an incredibly important role in their local economies. Unemployment in the Riverina is the lowest it has ever been, yet we have the worst drought in history. I have to congratulate—and every time the employment figures come out I congratulate again—those farmers, small business operators, small to medium enterprises and large businesses that, through adversity and through these very difficult times, continue to keep those people employed in order to ensure that their communities remain strong and viable. There is no doubt that the last few years have been extremely difficult for rural and regional communities that have been affected by the drought, but it is the government's strong economic management that has seen our economy continue to grow and has given our small businesses the knowledge that they need in order for us to continue to support them into the future.</para><para>I recently had the pleasure of attending and speaking at a local chamber of commerce function which was attended by chambers throughout my electorate. The message that was given to me by small businesses was that there is a need for less red tape for small business—and the issue of compliance costs also came up. I recognise that, and I recognise there are many ways in which the tax system can be simplified in order to ensure small business owners and operators have quality of life, rather than just quality of business. It takes a lot of what would otherwise be quality of life hours for small business operators to comply with many of the conditions that are put upon them by the tax system and many other systems. </para><para>Small businesses also spoke about issues of payroll tax. One thing they said was: `Where is the abolition of payroll tax—a tax on employment? If you would abolish payroll tax, we would be able to employ more people.' The federal government, of course, does not have a payroll tax. It does not tax people on employment; the state governments are taxing people on employment. I think it is time that some of these issues were confronted in the state government arena as well.</para><para>This bill, which proposes to amend the Workplace Relations Act 1996 to maintain the exemption for small business from redundancy pay by overturning the decision of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, which did not take into account the many burdens that small business must already deal with, is the right bill. It is the proper thing to do for small business. As I said, I would like it to include those businesses with 20 employees or less. The purpose of the bill is to protect small business employers from redundancy payments that would otherwise adversely impact on their capacity to provide employment. Seriously, there cannot be any argument with that. </para><para>As many people in the House know, I have a small business background. My family is in small business. My youngest son now owns and operates a significantly large small business. It is obviously a large one, because he does not come into this realm of having fewer than 15 employees. His business is certainly over and above that. Both he and my eldest son have experience—at 23 years of age—of owning and operating businesses employing in excess of 25 people. They have been able to do that because they have been encouraged to go and get a trade. That is another thing that happens in the House. We get this constant moaning and whingeing about HECS and university places—looking at academic performances and outcomes et cetera—and I feel there is definite discrimination against those people who go into trades, becoming panel beaters, mechanics, electrical engineers, fitters or turners. It seems to be assumed that those people were not capable at school—that they were not academic performers. In fact, they were academic performers, but they chose this most difficult pathway—they chose to go out and be a price maker, instead of being a price taker for the rest of their life in academia. They chose to move out there and involve themselves and then to provide employment for other people. Both my sons, at 23 years of age, have owned and operated very large businesses, with the very strong issues that confront them every single day in the realm of business. They have been quite successful, but that has involved an absolute commitment to their staff.</para><para>Basically, I want to say that small businesses are committed to their staff. The owners work over, above and beyond the call of duty to ensure that staff have pay in their pay packets on the Wednesday or Thursday of every week. They have no security, because that is all tied up with banks. There is a commitment from small businesses to their employees, and this is one bill that can provide a commitment from government to small business. In supporting this bill, could I say that there is a very strong need to ensure that at some stage in the future the unfair dismissal legislation that impacts on occupations—and certainly on employment opportunities—in small business is also looked at and addressed. There is a very strong need that we in this House recognise that all small business operators are not rich and are not creaming off all of these profits and then perhaps not delivering back to the people that they employ. In fact many times they give very significantly of their own money, resources and security to ensure that they are providing their employees with an opportunity for a future in their jobs.</para><para>Obviously, those who will not support this bill at the end of this debate are very remiss. They do not understand the issues that redundancy can create for the majority of small businesses. Small businesses with fewer than 15 employees generally do not avoid making redundancy payments in order to grow stronger, bigger and brighter and to cream off more profits. Generally it is a question of survival. When they are looking to survive, small businesses cannot afford redundancy payments, and it would be to the benefit of all employers if this bill were to be moved through the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>31643</page.no><name role="metadata">Mossfield, Frank, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MOSSFIELD</name><name.id>MK6</name.id><electorate>Greenway</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to support the amendment moved by the shadow minister for workplace relations and the public service. The purpose of the <inline ref="R2055">Workplace Relations Amendment (Protecting Small Business Employment) Bill 2004</inline> is to exempt small business from having to pay redundancy pay. The bill is another example of the government trying to overturn the decision of the independent umpire in workplace relations matters, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, the full bench of which in a test case decision awarded employees improved redundancy provisions. </para></talk.start><para>The position that the Labor Party takes with this bill is to uphold the rule of law in this country. The decision of the AIRC is the law of the country, just as any other court decision is, and it should be abided by. There are forms by which people can challenge a decision of the AIRC, but such a decision should not be overturned by an act of parliament. It should also be recognised that a decision of the AIRC is not made lightly. It is not taken after a couple of hours of discussion. It is taken after probably weeks of submissions being put to the AIRC—and, in this case, being put to its full bench, comprising a president, a vice-president and two commissioners. There are four people, and they are eminent people who no doubt have some experience in industrial relations or some economic background. They are the people who have come up with this decision.</para><para>It is quite extraordinary that the government is trying to overturn this decision. It runs against the argument that the government has put up time and time again in this House that what people should do, particularly those in industry, is abide by the law. That is what they are doing on this occasion, yet the government is trying to change the law. This bill will exempt employers with fewer than 15 employees if they are covered by a federal award or are constitutional incorporations covered by state awards, overriding any future state industrial relations tribunals that may seek to flow on an AIRC decision. The government is also calling on state governments to legislate to maintain exemptions of small business from making redundancy payments. Once again this government believes that, if you work for a small business, you should have fewer rights than other workers—you should be discriminated against solely on the basis of the number of co-workers you have.</para><para>The background to this bill is that, in August 2002, the ACTU applied to the AIRC to vary redundancy provisions in awards which were previously set in the federal 1984 Termination, Change and Redundancy case. The ACTU application sought to increase redundancy entitlements for employees with more than four years service and to remove the exemption from redundancy for small business. On 22 March 2004, the AIRC decided: not to alter redundancy arrangements for employees with four or less years service—so that was a loss for the ACTU; to increase redundancy payment for employees with more than four years service, scaling up to a maximum of 16 weeks pay for an employee with nine years service; and to remove the exemption for small business but to limit the redundancy payment for small businesses to eight weeks, which is half the amount that would apply to large businesses.</para><para>In its decision the AIRC said:</para><quote><para>While some small businesses lack financial resilience and have less ability to bear the costs of severance pay than larger businesses, the available evidence does not support the general proposition that small business does not have the capacity to pay severance pay.</para></quote><para>It continues—and this is important: </para><quote><para>For those businesses which are unable to meet their redundancy pay obligations the incapacity to pay provision, as amended by this decision, provides an avenue for relief.</para></quote><para>We recognise that this is a complex issue, and it should be noted that the commissioners would have made their decision after very careful consideration of all the issues involved and of the submissions put by various parties, including those from representatives from small business. Indeed, the full decision, as handed down, runs to some 103 pages. It should also be noted that there is a need to balance the needs of small business with the rights of employees, regardless of where they work. </para><para>Responding to the Howard government's decision to override the independent umpire's decision, ACTU secretary, Sharan Burrows, has said that the overwhelming majority of small businesses, around 70 per cent, are profitable when they lay off workers. This is supported by submissions to the commission. This is another important aspect that we should not overlook: the evidence presented by the commission, based on submissions by all parties, shows that some 70 per cent of small businesses that retrench people are profitable at the time they do so. This is supported, as I have said, by submissions to the hearing.</para><para>In all over 200,000 Australian workers are retrenched each year, I think; possibly half of those, maybe 100,000, are those retrenched from small businesses. Redundant workers face an average of five months unemployment—that is 22 weeks. They must get some form of monetary compensation for being dismissed, because they have to exist for a period of time before getting another job. Large numbers of older workers drop out of the work force entirely after being retrenched. They are forced into early retirement.</para><para>The ACTU's concerns for older workers are supported by a report published by Mission Australia in conjunction with Macquarie Bank. It is entitled <inline font-style="italic">Unemployment among older workers</inline>. I will refer to a couple of statements in that report, which really shows how vulnerable older workers are when they are retrenched. It is an independent report, brought down, as I said, by Mission Australia and Macquarie Bank. The report says:</para><quote><para>... older workers are now one of the most susceptible groups to both early exit (eg retrenchment) from the labour market and long term unemployment. The cascading impact of unemployment and underemployment on older workers and their families can be severe. Not only can unemployment result in acute financial difficulties, but social participation can be restricted ...</para></quote><para>This is an issue that no doubt the Australian Industrial Relations Commission took into consideration.</para><para>Further, in that same report by Mission Australia, it says:</para><quote><para>Retrenchment and downsizing have contributed heavily to high unemployment among older workers. An Australian study found downsizing decisions impacted most on workers aged between 40 and 60 years. Older workers have greater difficulties obtaining another job after retrenchment (than those aged under 45) and are more likely to become discouraged jobseekers and leave the labour force ... A third of retirees cite job loss as the main reason for ceasing their ... fulltime job ...</para></quote><para>Once again, that shows quite clearly why a redundancy scheme is appropriate for workers in Australian industry, whether they work for large or small companies.</para><para>We continue to hear from the government that unions need to accept the umpire's decision and the law must be obeyed. The previous minister for workplace relations, the member for Warringah, was very fond of reminding this parliament of that. He was literally forcing down people's throats that the law is the law and, even if it is unfair, it has got to be abided by. Now we have a law that to some extent has come out in favour of the trade union movement and workers in industry, and the government is trying to overturn it. It is quite unfair, and I know the member opposite would not be supportive of an unfair practice, so I am hoping that we might get some commonsense. </para><para>So, as I have said, here we are, with the government trying to change the law. In its decision removing the exemption of small business from the legal requirement not to pay redundancy, the commission noted the inequities in the current scheme. I want to refer to those that have been spelt out in the AIRC's decision. The decision quotes evidence given by a Mr Albury, who said:</para><quote><para><inline font-style="italic">“9.	On 20 November 2002, I was given notice that my employment would be terminated in five weeks time. I was not told prior to this time that the shop was being closed down.</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">10.	Two of my colleagues were also made redundant.</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">11.	We were told that the owner was closing the business down on 20 December 2002. The remaining business would be passed on to a Print Broker and the machinery would be sold.</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">12.	A Webb &amp; Sons is a profitable business and has been for a long time. I have been asked to work overtime in the weeks leading up to the closure of the business to meet the workload.</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">13.	Around seven or eight years ago, there was a reduction in staff due to the introduction of new technology. At the time there were sixteen staff employed in the business. The person with the shortest length of service was made redundant and paid a severance payment. A short time later, a number of other staff were made redundant and ... did not receive severance payment—</inline></para></quote><para>because the employment figure had dropped below 15. He went on to say:</para><quote><para><inline font-style="italic">14.	A Webb &amp; Sons have said that, as they have less than fifteen employees, the Award does not require them to make a payment of severance benefits, regardless of our length of service.”</inline></para></quote><para>So I think the Industrial Relations Commission were quite right to draw attention to the unfairness of the current arrangements, and I think they were quite right to introduce the decision that they have.</para><para>In the redundancy decision, reference was also made to the decision made in 1982 by the full bench of the commission to remove the exemption of small business from its legal requirement to pay redundancy in the clothing industry award. The commission also heard considerable evidence concerning the impact that hav-ing to meet redundancy payment obligations would have on the financial position of small business. I will quote from section 222 of the commission's decision, which, let me remind the House, is a decision of the full bench of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, which is staffed by qualified people—a president, a deputy president and two arbitration commissioners—with immense experience in industrial relations. In that section the commission said:</para><quote><para>It seems to us that the available evidence does not support the general proposition that small business has a relative lack of financial resilience and has less ability to bear the costs of severance pay than larger businesses.</para></quote><para>That was the evidence that came through.</para><quote><para>We accept that this is true of some small businesses ...</para></quote><para>To paraphrase, the commission accepted that some small businesses did not have the capacity, but did not uphold the general proposition that `small business does not have the capacity to pay severance pay.'</para><para>There were three considerations supporting the commission's conclusions:</para><quote><para>The first is that small business is generally profitable.</para></quote><para>As I have said, 70 per cent of them are profitable when they lay off workers.</para><quote><para>The second is that some small businesses make severance payments—</para></quote><para>in spite of the absence of legal obligations to do so, and they are to be congratulated for that—they are operat-ing very fairly. </para><quote><para>A third consideration is the absence of evidence from those jurisdictions where the small business exemption does not exist, or in those industry sectors where it has been removed from the relevant federal award, that small business is less profitable or more likely to fail.</para></quote><para>Quite clearly the evidence is there: it is a good decision of the arbitration commission. This parliament should uphold the good decisions of the arbitration commis-sion and not try to pull down the arbitration commission. For that reason the Labor Party is quite right to oppose the bill and support the amendment before the House, which states:</para><para>That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</para><para>“the House declines to give the Bill a second reading and:</para><para>(1)	condemns the Government for undermining the independence of the industrial relations commission, and</para><para>(2)	calls on the government instead to investigate measures to assist those small businesses that do not have the capacity to pay redundancy payments, to obtain individual exemptions from the AIRC”.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>31647</page.no><name role="metadata">Barresi, Phillip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BARRESI</name><name.id>ZJ6</name.id><electorate>Deakin</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The small business sector looks to governments of all persuasions, state and Commonwealth, for support and protection. Why does it do that? It is very simple: we all recognise that small business is the engine room of our economy. It employs 3.3 million Australians. A sector of that size with so many people working for it needs protection and security from government, rather than being simply dismissed. We know where the ALP stands on small business—we know from two simple facts. First, at the last ALP national conference in January—I am sure that the member for Hunter was there and voted in support—various motions were passed to empower the ALP to adopt draconian measures against the business community. One such measure was to allow union officials the right of entry into small businesses at any time. That includes home based business and it applies regardless of whether union members are employed there. Union officials will have access to your business records. That is just one example of how the ALP does not understand small business and what it is about.</para></talk.start><para>The second reason that the ALP does not understand why this bill needs to be supported is the make-up of the ALP. Yesterday, during the debate on the MPI, I mentioned that union membership in this country has now dropped to 17 per cent in the private sector, yet 74 per cent of the ALP caucus is made up of former union officials. Why is that important in the context of the <inline ref="R2055">Workplace Relations Amendment (Protecting Small Business Employment) Bill 2004</inline>? It is important because members opposite have no empathy with or understanding of what it means to set up a small business and then have policies such as those passed at the national ALP conference or decisions like that made by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. When those policy decisions are made they have a dramatic, negative effect on small business.</para><para>If members on the other side could only understand what it is like to go to a bank or to face your spouse and say: `I'm going to leave the job that I have had for five or 10 years and set up a small business'—whatever it may be, whether it be a corner milk bar, a hairdressing salon, a consultancy company, a service station, a takeaway stall—`This is something that I want to do. I want to run my own business. I want to do something which is mine, which will employ people and which will grow.' There is then the realisation that you have to put up your house as security for a bank loan. You have to weather the anxiety every month as the statements come in. You look at your bank statements and the amount of money going out versus the amount of money coming in. That is what small business means. Members on the other side will never get it—they will never understand. Maybe one or two have had partial exposure to it but the 74 per cent of the ALP caucus who are former union representatives have no understanding of the pressure on small business, the pressure on the families or the pressure on mum and dad to put on a brave face as their children go to school and they have to feed them. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>8K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZJ6</name.id><name role="metadata">Barresi, Phillip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BARRESI</name></talker><para>—I said that there may be some exceptions, member for Hunter.

The coalition government is proud to stand by small business and to support it against policies and decisions which will make it even harder for small business to survive.</para></talk.start></continue><para>There are three main effects of the bill. They impose changes which will enhance our position as the only party that is concerned about small businesses in Australia. Small businesses enable local people to engage in activities in their local community. Strong communities rely on strong local business networks. I am very fortunate and proud that in my electorate of Deakin many local businesses are dedicated to our community, and they are well represented by five or six chambers of commerce and traders associations. Next week I will bring together representatives of each of those groups to discuss issues of concern such as barriers to and constraints on their businesses. No doubt I will do something which the ALP will not do: inform them of the effect that voting for an ALP federal government will have on their small businesses. I will deal with some of those effects later if time permits. </para><para>The member for Greenway said: `The law is the law. The Australian Industrial Relations Commission has brought down a judgment that we have to abide by. We don't like it and we are trying to overturn it.' The member for Greenway I know is in his last few months in this House. He has been a good contributor to this parliament. He would understand that this parliament makes the laws. It is our job when a court in any of the various jurisdictions makes an interpretation or a decision which goes against the intention of what was meant to take place—in this case with the Australian Industrial Relations Commission overturning a decision it made 20 years ago—to use our power to change the law. We make the law. Until then, we abide by it.</para><para>That is in stark contrast, may I say, to some members of the union movement, who often have a total reckless disregard for decisions of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission if they go against them. There are countless examples of the union movement standing up and saying, `This is wrong. The Industrial Relations Commission got it wrong. We're going to fight it. We're going to take our people out to the street. We're going to boycott and still go out on strike.' The government is saying, `We don't like what took place with that decision by the Industrial Relations Commission. Obviously the law will be abided by until such time as the law can be changed.' That is exactly what we are doing here today. I look forward to the member for Hunter, as a self-proclaimed champion of at least one small business in his electorate, supporting this bill.</para><para>This bill is the only alternative following the decision by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission that imposes redundancy pay obligations on small business. Without this legislative change, small businesses with fewer than 15 employees would fall under the jurisdiction of the commission. This would compel the businesses to comply with the ruling, which would impose greater risk and place a significant financial burden on smaller operations. While this bill also seeks to cancel the effect of the variations made by the commission to awards from the point at which the decision was made, the bill will not change the pay redundancy provisions made prior to the commission's decision. </para><para>The third mechanism of this bill is to prevent the flow-on of the commission's decision to small businesses that are constitutional corporations and that are covered by state awards. This issue has arisen because of the commission's decision that changed the exemptions for small business. The decision resulted in severance pay for businesses with fewer employees becoming mandatory. This exemption was actually established by the commission some 20 years ago.</para><para>Should this decision be allowed to stand and the impost on smaller businesses remain, significant financial monkeys will be placed on the backs of small business owners around the country. For example, the local strip shopping centre convenience store with seven employees who have been with the business for six continuous years would face a $30,000 redundancy liability. That is a $30,000 liability on top of the second mortgage that they have taken out, on top of the uncertainty of supply in some case, on top of anti-competitive practices and on top of the costs of recruitment and termination. This is an unsustainable cost and an unsustainable expectation to place on the thousands of small businesses right around this country. It needs to be redressed.</para><para>Our reforms to the workplace relations system have created a fairer, more flexible system. I am proud of the fact that the Howard government has embarked on wide ranging reforms to the industrial relations system to allow greater flexibility. That flexibility arises out of an ability to negotiate working conditions and the freedom to choose whether or not to belong to a union. We have taken steps to protect youth wages, which are under threat by many on the other side who I know at the last national conference also moved to abolish junior wage rates, which will cost 200,000 jobs, according to the Australian Retail Association.</para><para>This bill further enhances our position of opposing unnecessary restraints on small business which make it harder to employ people. The owners and operators of smaller businesses should have the confidence to employ people without the cloud of large payouts hovering over their heads. The alternative to this bill being passed would be to leave the majority of small businesses subject to redundancy payments in accordance with the commission's decision. This would hamper their capacity to grow and employ more people. It would threaten them with having to meet large payments with a relatively low turnover.</para><para>Another impact of the commission's decision would be a domino effect through the states. It is important to note that just last week UnionsWA applied to the Western Australian Industrial Relations Commission to extend similar redundancy provisions to small businesses in Western Australia. This bill is taking the only course available to prevent small businesses with fewer than 15 employees from being compelled to pay redundancies.</para><para>While this bill is seeking to remedy the ruling of the AIRC, it in no way makes agreements to include redundancy payments void. It simply removes the standardisation or the regulation of the redundancy pay provisions. In other words, redundancy payment for small businesses will be by choice rather than the norm—if a small business has the capacity and there is an agreement. I will certainly be encouraging a lot of small businesses in Victoria—as we approach the 1 January time period when many of those on state awards will be moving to federal awards—to take out Australian workplace agreements as a form of protection against any increased costs in entitlements that they may have to pay by moving to a federal award. </para><para>What has become the norm is Labor's aversion to good policy. The opposition is again siding with those opposed to this bill, and those opposed to it are essentially their union colleagues. They are opposing a bill that will alter a law that would otherwise cripple small business and possibly restrict job opportunities. The party for the worker being against jobs does not add up. I do not understand it. I wish that members on the other side who understand small business, such as the member for Hunter, would be far more influential and persuasive in their dealings with their colleagues. The member for Hunter should get up there and argue with passion the cause for small business in front of his colleagues to bring them on side on this issue. I am quite happy to help him out in that cause.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>8K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Fitzgibbon</name></talker><para>—Be careful: I am speaking next.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZJ6</name.id><name role="metadata">Barresi, Phillip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BARRESI</name></talker><para>—He is speaking against.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>8K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Fitzgibbon</name></talker><para>—I am speaking next.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZJ6</name.id><name role="metadata">Barresi, Phillip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BARRESI</name></talker><para>—He is speaking next.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

Yet the opposition would have struggling small business owners cough up for legal fees to fund a case before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Federal Labor would be happy for jobs to be threatened and for the growth of small business to be hampered, while it would expect the owners of those businesses to front up to the costly legal system to put a case for an exemption. I would have thought the commission would have enough on its plate already. This is just another example of shoddy ALP policy. Had the ALP done its homework, it would have realised that an exemption system will not work. There has been an exemption system in place for larger businesses for 20 years and, from what we have seen, it has not produced one exemption. One is forced to ask whether the state governments are backing this proposal by the ALP. Not one of the four state governments involved in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission test case has come on board and supported the ALP's plan for an exemption system. Therefore, it would appear that federal Labor is on its own, and I look forward to federal Labor changing its view on this matter.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In speaking to this bill, I believe it is important to look at the context within which it is set. In my electorate of Deakin, there are over 6,500 small business. When you use the national average, that equates to almost 20,000 people employed by small businesses in Deakin. To say the small business sector is important to my area is an understatement. No-one says that running a small business is easy, and those of us on this side know that it can be very difficult and stressful. At times it is all-consuming both personally and for the family. Small business owners and managers rely on the bigger picture to set their scene. A strong, growing economy is essential so that families and individuals have a greater capacity to become active in their businesses and in the engagement of their services. Today, families are in a better position to think about the things that are important in their lives, such as financial security and personal security, than they were prior to 1996. </para><para>As small business owners know, sound management of their books is vital. Our 1.2 million small businesses have been fortunate that the coalition has occupied the Treasury benches during the world's economic downturn and that we have been able to weather the global economic storm. Our economy is one of the strongest in the region, and it outshines many economies around the world. For the first time in 35 years, the unemployment rate is below six per cent and the inflation rate is below three per cent. This is good news for small business. But this is an economy and a situation that will be in jeopardy if the other side get their way in running the economy and industrial relations policy.</para><para>Yesterday, I participated in the MPI on industrial relations, and one aspect of industrial relations which is important to small business is casual and part-time employment. The member for Hasluck yesterday was decrying the fact that there is much casualisation taking place and was saying that this government should be doing more to attack casual employment and to reverse it. If you look at the ALP national platform you can see where they stand on those things that are important to small business. Labor will give casual employees the right to demand to be made permanent. This will make it much harder for small business to employ people at times when they need them. It will also greatly increase costs by making casuals eligible for redundancy payments and leave entitlements, as proposed by the Industrial Relations Commission.</para><para>Casual employment is not something that has been foisted upon people out there; it is something that employees want. They have demanded it. Half of all casuals are young people, students in their first jobs—there are women going back into the work force, mature age people who are entering the work force after perhaps being laid off from a job that they had for many years. The notion of lifetime employment, from both the employer and employee perspective, has long gone. We do not have that these days. People do look to casualisation as an alternative. So why have on your platform an attack on casual employment?</para><para>We saw an example recently where the metal trades industry award allowed people who were casual to move to be permanent. If you take the ALP's proposition, all of those who were offered that opportunity would have moved across to permanent employment. What did we find? Was it 100 per cent of those who were casual that moved to permanent employment? Was it 50 per cent? Was it 40 per cent? Was it 25 per cent? Two per cent of the casuals moved across to permanent employment. This is an indication that the ALP and their union mates have got it wrong with small business and with the work force in general. Their opposition to this bill is a further indication that the ALP have got it wrong. They need to reverse their decision, to allow small business to grow, prosper and employ people who want to be employed on terms that they have negotiated with small business operators. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>31651</page.no><name role="metadata">Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP</name><name role="display">Mr FITZGIBBON</name><name.id>8K6</name.id><electorate>Hunter</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr Speaker, you probably have worked out that this opportunity for me to speak on the <inline ref="R2055">Workplace Relations Amendment (Protecting Small Business Employment) Bill 2004</inline> is unexpected, but I am happy to fill the void. I more than welcome the opportunity, particularly given some of the pronouncements just made by the member for Deakin. I find it interesting that day in, day out those who sit opposite dwell so often on the fact that they have more people who have worked in small business or who have had small business experience than we have on this side. Some might see a point in that. I have some difficulty with this concept that to understand properly small business policy you had to work at some time in the small business sector. I note that yesterday during question time the Minister for Small Business and Tourism devoted a fair bit of his time to making this spurious point himself yet he was unwilling to share with the House his own small business experience. I am not aware that the minister for small business has had any direct experience in the small business sector. If that is not true, I invite him to come into the House and share his experiences with us. </para></talk.start><para>I will put aside for the moment whether that is a valid argument. The fact is that I have had experience in small business. I ran my own small business for around 12 years. My wife continues to run a small business and has done so for, I think, more than 20 years now. Not a day goes by when, in discussion over the dinner table—or, more likely, over the telephone given the nature of our employment—we do not discuss some aspect of her small business; the challenges she is currently facing, the constant hurdles she is required to leap over to maintain the profitability of that business—and it is really tough. There are many things that play on her mind and play on the minds of every Australian small businessperson. They cover things such as uncertainty about tax obligations—whether the bill at the end of the year is going to end up bigger than expected; they worry about time consuming red tape.</para><para>Most people in what I would call the old small business sector—the basic retailing and services sector, as compared with the high growth, exporting dynamic type small business that we have seen emerging in later years—have a background in the skill in which they apply their business. They might be a plumber who was an apprentice, who worked for someone and went on to start their own small business. They might have had retailing experience in menswear and after some extensive experience, and having enjoyed that work, went on to buy their own retailing business et cetera. So they generally enjoy their work. They have chosen a vocation and they like the work per se, but they do not like the paperwork that comes with being in business. One of the biggest challenges for government is to keep that paperwork down, keep that red tape down, so people can concentrate on what they enjoy most—that is, their business, the actual work they do, whether it be selling goods or maintaining or repairing someone's house. That is what they want to be out there doing, not being bogged down by red tape.</para><para>I have never had my wife or any other small businessperson in my electorate express concern to me about the Industrial Relations Commission's determination on redundancy; that may come. I have said in the House before, and I am happy to acknowledge it, that I am aware that for some small business people unfair dismissal plays on their mind. They have all heard a horror story or two about someone having great difficulty in discharging a staff member who has done something which is quite deserving of dismissal, but because of all these hurdles they have had some difficulty dismissing that person. However, I do not see it as being the priority in small business that the government does. My experience is that most of these horror stories emanate out of a period prior to 1996, when I think the hurdle was raised too high for small business. That was addressed in the 1996 Workplace Relations Act. I remember very vividly the minister for small business at the time, the Hon. Peter Reith, describing the changes to the unfair dismissal laws as representing a fair deal all round. In other words, having made the changes, Minister Reith declared that at that point we had the balance pretty much right—and these things are a balance. If I get back to my electorate this weekend at some point and someone asks me about the move on redundancy, I will give a balanced response. I will say that I understand some people might be concerned about these matters and it is a constant challenge for the legislature to get that balance right. </para><para>When I look to what is the correct balance in this case, I do look to the independent umpire. The member for Deakin was talking about the people who make up this place and the place across the way. That causes me to reflect on who makes up the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Of course, after 8½ years in government the Howard-led government has had some opportunity to have an impact and influence on the appointments to that commission. No-one in this place could surely suggest that it was a commission that had some form of bias towards the employee as opposed to the employer. So in this case I look to the Industrial Relations Commission: a learned body which has taken a range of submissions on this case and determined that it was time that small business employees had the same opportunities to secure redundancy as those who have a greater number of work mates.</para><para>It is a considered decision and, while I think it is entirely appropriate for the legislature to set direction and change legislation in order to determine policy, I do not believe that in this case it is being done for the right reasons. I really think this is another attempt by the government to create an election issue. They have been running on unfair dismissals now for 8½ years, having said originally that they had fixed the problem. This is just the next step: let us create this scare campaign in the broader Australian community about this redundancy thing; let us bring a bill in to override the independent umpire's decision; and let us run all the way to election day on this issue. That is what I think this bill is about. The Australian Industrial Relations Commission has made a considered decision. As a society, as a community and as a legislature we should allow some time for that decision to flow through and see what impact that is having on the Australian community. If it is not having the desired outcome that the commission was looking for, or if indeed the legislature decides it is not the desired outcome, well, let us come back and have a look at it. But let us not jump on it immediately like this as a means of creating an election issue.</para><para>I have got to say that whether you have worked in small business or not, small business is complex. It is a funny and changing beast and we do rely on research to better understand where small business has been, what it is doing now and where it is going. That is why the small business longitudinal study was so important. It was a five-year program established late in the days of the Keating government to study small business over a considered period of time—five years in this case—to get a better understanding of its needs and ambitions.</para><para>I was just amazed when this government cut that program after, I think, four years—and I think it had one year to run. I do not remember what the savings were in cutting funding to that study for the last year, but they would not have been much. There were academics right around this nation relying on that longitudinal study and that final year in particular for their PhDs and research papers, and it was just cut. I think that is an absolute tragedy. If the government wants to claim small business credentials, it cannot do so while at the same time running around and making very small savings on a matter that is so important to the small business sector.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—I am grateful to the member for Hunter, who has in fact allowed the debate to continue, as he conceded, and he has had little time for preparation, but it might be helpful if he were to relate the longitudinal study to the bill in order for the relevance clause to stand. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP</name><name role="display">Mr FITZGIBBON</name></talker><para>—I am happy to, Mr Speaker. The point is that none of these decisions, whether they be the redundancies or unfair dismissals, can be made in isolation. Every item affects another and you cannot hope to put these things into effect correctly if you do not understand where small business has been and where it is going, and that is what the longitudinal study was all about.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The other problem for the government in terms of credibility on these small business matters is that the biggest issue of all for small business—the biggest issue that goes to the survival of the small business sector in this country as we know it—is, of course, the threat from bigger business. This, in my considered view, is what plays on the mind of the small business sector most. It is interesting that, in recent years, the High Court brought down a few rulings that are of particular concern to small business—rulings that question the capacity of the Trade Practices Act to give small business the protection it needs from the potentially aggressive tactics of larger businesses which might be seeking to increase their market share.</para><para>Of course, the government has recognised this and, in doing so, commissioned the Dawson report into the effectiveness of the Trade Practices Act, and the Senate Economics References Committee has since extensively inquired into Dawson and those same trade practices issues. A range of recommendations were made that the small business sector has been requesting for a long time. Yet, despite introducing a bill earlier this week with a package of changes to the Trade Practices Act, the Treasurer still has not addressed the main issue flowing out of both Dawson and the Senate committee—namely, section 46 and, in particular, the misuse of market power provisions.</para><para>So you cannot come in here and talk about unfair dismissals and the Industrial Relations Commission's determination on redundancies and feign this great eagerness to support on every occasion the small business sector when, at the same time, you are denying the small business sector what it requires most—that is, those changes to the Trade Practices Act. The inherent problem for the conservative parties is that they like to rant about their commitment to small business but the reality is they are a big-business party. The Liberal Party, in particular, is a big-business party. They like to talk about us sourcing funds from unions—yes, we do: we source money from unions. But most of their money comes from the big business sector, and we all know that the largest business moguls in this country have a hotline to the Prime Minister's desk—that is no secret. So this is the inherent difficulty for the government when dealing with these issues: how do you continue to represent yourself as the natural party of small business and at the same time keep happy those big business leaders on whom you rely most for your oxygen?</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Once again I remind the member for Hunter to come back to the question of employment in small business.

I was most surprised that, in the week we are debating this bill that addresses redundancies in small business, the Treasurer should come into this place and introduce a bill to amend the Trade Practices Act that does not pick up the key issues of concern for the small business community. He says that there is another package of bills coming somewhere down the track—I welcome that fact. I have to say that I hope they reflect more of Labor's view about what is required in terms of amendments to the Trade Practices Act—in particular, issues going to predatory pricing, cease and desist orders, and jail terms for corporates who do the wrong thing—but I fear they will not. It just intrigues me that we have to examine the redundancy bill in this place today—we have to get this all fixed up before the election—but we potentially have to wait till after the election for the government to address the key issues in trade practices, which are key issues of concern for the small business sector. I think there are some pretty blatant and obvious inconsistencies in that approach. </para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>31655</page.no><name role="metadata">Moylan, Judi, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs MOYLAN</name><name.id>4V5</name.id><electorate>Pearce</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Speaking of inconsistencies—and I am going to talk to the substance of the <inline ref="R2055">Workplace Relations Amendment (Protecting Small Business Employment) Bill 2004</inline>—the member for Hunter's words cannot go unchallenged about the inconsistencies, because here he is coming into this House and chiding our minister for bringing forward a bill that protects the interests of small business. He chides the minister for having dared to question a decision by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and, yet, in the next breath he himself challenges the three High Court judges who came to a decision in the Boral case. If you go back to pre-1996 days, the then Labor government certainly did nothing to address the considerable concerns about the Trade Practices Act. We have had an inquiry—the Dawson inquiry—and there are plans. Our side does recognise the particular challenges that confront small businesses.</para></talk.start><para>I want to say that, despite some of the difficulties of small businesses when they come up against very large businesses, it is unhelpful to set small business against large business. When I publicly supported Woodside against a takeover bid, the people in my electorate of Pearce and in Western Australia who rang me were the plumbers, the electricians, the gasfitters and the food suppliers—all small businesses, sometimes one-, two- and three-man or woman businesses—and they did that because they relied on a big company like Woodside for their financial wellbeing and for their businesses to be able to operate. It is often big business that affords small business the opportunity to grow, to thrive and to be economically viable. So we have to be very careful when we pit the small businesses against the big businesses.</para><para>I will come to the substance of the bill that we are debating today. This Howard government is a strong supporter of small businesses. It is evident from the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry's June quarter National Survey of Business Expectations that, although economic growth has steadied—we have had enormously rapid growth—it remains strong and the business community was very optimistic about the future. The survey of business expectations is, I understand, the only private sector survey in Australia that provides a comparison of expectations for firms of different sizes. I think it is important that the public understand and people in this House understand the definitions. Small businesses in this survey are those with between one and 19 employees; medium businesses are those between 20 and 100; and large firms are those with 100-plus employees. Small business was particularly upbeat about the general business conditions and its expectations over the next three months were cautiously optimistic. Employment growth has been very strong across businesses of all sizes and further improvement in business growth is anticipated by all categories of business. This is one of the reasons why we are here debating this bill today: to ensure that that vibrancy, that upbeat mood, that optimism and that commitment to continue to employ continue.  </para><para>Employment growth has been very strong across businesses of all sizes, and the positive outlook of small business has been a particularly important feature in the battle that Australia has had to reduce its unemployment levels, particularly its youth unemployment. Since coming to office the Howard government has had a great commitment to reducing unemployment, especially youth unemployment, and the employment figures released just recently told the story. The rate has fallen to 5.5 per cent, which I think is the lowest in about 27 years or something in that order. To achieve this result, though, the government has had to carefully manage the economy, and in the eight years under the Howard government we have seen low unemployment, low interest rates, low inflation, increased real wages, industrial relations reform that has been very significant in freeing up businesses to ensure that they can grow and expand and have flexibility, and of course waterfront reforms. It is this climate of greater certainty and sound economic management at a federal level that has provided a key to our economic growth and prosperity. We have got many young, enthusiastic and innovative business people in Australia today. They are prepared to take reasonable risks because they believe in their own ability to build and develop a business that provides for their own financial future and for the people that they employ.</para><para>The small business community exists in a very volatile world and it is a world where small changes can have very dramatic effects on the operation and success of a small business. I was interested in the member for Hunter's recollections about unfair dismissal, because this is an area where Labor got it badly wrong and in fact the then Prime Minister, Paul Keating, was forced to come to the table to make changes. I was the shadow minister for small business and I made jolly sure that people out in the community understood how this unfair dismissal legislation was affecting small businesses at that time. I did some very public interviews on it and I also addressed the business community of Newcastle from the back of a truck in the Newcastle markets in the freezing cold. The Labor Party were not even going to be represented at that. The minister was ducking for cover because those guys in the Newcastle markets were furious and they were ready to have the then Prime Minister and his ministers on the plate for dinner, so he was not too keen on turning up. When I said yes, I would go up and talk to them, I understand the Prime Minister ordered the then small business minister to that meeting. There were television programs drawing attention to just how devastating this legislation was to small businesses and finally some minor changes were made to it. But we have tried I think over 40 times in this place to get further changes accepted exempting small businesses from those measures. </para><para>These kinds of changes, given the volatility of the small business sector, can be devastating to small business, so we need to be very careful about how we structure this. I understand this because I started my small business 25 years ago from the living room of my home. I know how difficult it is. I started with $500. My desk was the dining-room table and it had to be cleared off every night so that my kids could actually sit down and eat. That little business grew and grew and I employed quite a few people in the end and provided job opportunities for many who might not have been directly employed but who got work as a result of the work of my business. I know how tough it is at times and how finely tuned and finely balanced the day-to-day profitability can be. It can get to the point where you actually have to be checking the figures every day to make sure you can keep going. They were not easy times. So I understand how finely tuned this is, and having to pay out $30,000 in redundancy for staff some of whom may not have worked for terribly many years would have been a huge impost and in fact would have driven me out of business in those early development years. I think that is also why this decision by the commission could be so damaging to small businesses. </para><para>I must congratulate the ACCI because they recently put out a paper about policy positions and made suggestions to strengthen small business, improve workplace conditions and create more job opportunities. I do not think any of us in this House—and certainly none of the responsible business leaders—want to see employees being treated badly or not being given what they are entitled to. The ACCI put out their paper called <inline font-style="italic">Modern Workplace: Modern Future 2002-2010</inline>. It is a blueprint and a practical working document on how workplace reform can best be implemented. In a bulletin on termination of employment and redundancy, the ACCI outline termination of employment measures. The bulletin includes reference to both redundancy and unfair dismissal. The policy outlines what a redundancy is. The document says:</para><quote><para>Termination of employment occurs when an employer dismisses an employee, or where an employee resigns from their employment.</para><para>Sometimes termination of employment occurs due to business restructuring or business failure. Where a job an employee is doing is no longer needed to be done or able to be done, and the employment is terminated, then this is a redundancy.</para><para>Redundancies often occur due to cost or competitive pressures on a business or from a general economic downturn. Often the causes of redundancies are beyond the control of both the employer or the employees.</para></quote><para>The bulletin also went on to explain what an unfair dismissal is. It is probably quite relevant to bring up the distinction. It says:</para><quote><para>`Unfair dismissal' describes a termination of employment that is `harsh, unjust or unreasonable'. Employment legislation gives some employees a right to sue employers for `unfair dismissal'. These laws differ around the country. Unfair dismissal cases are dealt with by industrial tribunals, usually through a conciliation process and (if unresolved) by a trial (arbitration). If a dismissal is judged to be unfair, re-employment, back-pay and/or compensation may be awarded.</para><para>Unfair dismissal cases are different from claims for unlawful dismissal. An unlawful dismissal is where termination occurs in breach of a specified law (such as dismissal because a person is pregnant, or dismissal without required notice periods).</para></quote><para>We all know a lot about the unfair dismissal legislation in this place. As I said, we have tried many times to amend the unfair dismissal laws to ensure that small businesses—that is, business with under 20 people—are annexed from the legislation, and for good reason. The University of Melbourne research carried out in 2002 demonstrated the negative effects of unfair dismissal laws on small business. In essence, what the study shows is that the unfair dismissal legislation causes small businesses to hold back on employing new staff and it denies the unemployed about 70,000 new job opportunities. In a similar vein, the latest decision by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to substantially increase minimum redundancy payments will have a very negative effect on small business confidence to employ.</para><para>For 20 years, small business has been exempted from paying redundancy payments, and for good reason. This is in cases where the business employs fewer than 15 people. The estimated cost of this change to small business is, according to the ACCI, around $190 million. Many small businesses only earn from $30,000 to maybe $100,000 at the top end. Many small business people earn a very basic wage and they work extremely long hours. When they are finished at the shop, they go home and do their book work at night. So $190 million spread over many small businesses is not an insubstantial amount of money. It would drive many of them out of business. We do not want to drive small businesses out. These are entrepreneurial people who drive this economy. They are the engine room of the economy, and they are big employers of young Australians. </para><para>The federal government opposes the decision by the AIRC. This bill amends the Workplace Relations Act 1996 to protect small business employers from redundancy payments that may affect employment opportunities, business viability and, indeed, future business growth. This bill has three effects. The first is to remove redundancy pay for small businesses with fewer than 15 employees from the jurisdiction of the AIRC. The second is to cancel the effect of any variations that were made by the AIRC to awards from the time of the decision until the legislation commences. It will not, however, affect any redundancy pay provisions that were in awards prior to the AIRC's decision. The third effect will be to prevent the flow-on of the AIRC's decision to small businesses that are constitutional corporations and that are covered by state awards. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations said in the second reading speech:</para><quote><para>The small business sector is performing very well—it is very much the engine room of the continued growth and strength that our economy is enjoying. And without doubt many small businesses are profitable.</para><para>But we can't afford to confuse this profitability with an ability to make redundancy payments. Small businesses tend to be chronically undercapitalised and in general do not have the financial resources to cope with large, unpredicted commitments such as redundancy payments. Small businesses are twice as likely as larger businesses to go out of business in the earlier years of operation.</para></quote><para>That is true: the pressure is really on in those early years of development of a small business—</para><quote><para>Even after 15 years of operation they are still 1.7 times more likely to cease than larger businesses.</para></quote><para>It has generally been acknowledged that small businesses operate in a precarious environment and are very sensitive to additional cost pressures. Many small businesses are established on a low capital base, often consisting of equity in the family home, and small business owners are much more heavily constrained in capital raising than medium-large corporations. That is a very significant issue. I cannot tell you how many times small businesses, particularly those located out of the central business areas of the cities, tell me just how difficult it is to raise capital, particularly if they do not have equity in their own family home. Building on this small capital base, the development of a small business often takes years and years of hard work, careful financial management and flexible employment options. Small businesses have the potential to become our medium and large corporations of the future, and with a solid foundation they can go on to provide greater benefits to employees.</para><para>Of course, the lack of black-letter law has not inhibited many small businesses in being excellent socially responsible citizens and offering many benefits to their employees well above anything that any black-letter law has ever required. This is often forgotten in these debates, as is the enormous contribution in goods, time and money that many small businesses make to their communities. That is very evident in my electorate of Pearce, where I see time and time again that when there is a social problem or disaster within the electorate it is the small business community that are called on to make contributions to fixing that problem. Very often it is done through the service organisations such as Lions, Apex and Rotary, but it is these many small businesses that contribute tremendously to the social cohesion of our communities. I suspect that is the case all around Australia. </para><para>One is always hopeful that all businesses will treat their employees fairly, and vice versa. But what this measure is likely to do is inhibit the opportunity small businesses afford many in the community to have access to paid employment. The decision by the AIRC was a retrograde step against the interests of small businesses and against the interest of job creation in the small business sector. I certainly congratulate the minister for having taken the decision to bring this bill to the House to improve the outcome for small businesses that employ fewer than 15 people.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>31659</page.no><name role="metadata">Hunt, Gregory, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HUNT</name><name.id>00AMV</name.id><electorate>Flinders</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is a pleasure to follow my esteemed colleague the member for Pearce and, more than that, a genuine friend and mentor. In rising to speak on the <inline ref="R2055">Workplace Relations Amendment (Protecting Small Business Employment) Bill 2004</inline> I do so knowing that I came to this House with a passion. I came to this House with a passion for people who create, who establish, who lay themselves on the line, who give of themselves and who make Australia what it is. Those who enter into small business do so with no guarantee. There is no guarantee. They put themselves at risk and they put their financial futures at risk. But they do so because of an ineluctable, unbreakable human spirit which says, `We will give this a go. We will do everything in our power to take something which is unformed, to mould it, to shape it, to build it and to grow it.' They do this to establish something which represents them, which represents their activity, which contributes to the country and which helps to create and make that which we are.</para></talk.start><para>That is why, when I say I came with a passion, it is a passion for the very notion of enterprise and incentive. It is a passion for innovation, for creation—for all those things which take us forward, which bring us into the modern world and which represent the prow of the boat which sails us into history. That is what new businesses, small businesses and the creation of new ideas are about. It is about the movement forward. It is not about a stagnant or static society; it is about a modern, progressive, creative, developing society. It is a privilege to represent people who have that view. It is an honour to be part of a Liberal Party which has as its core philosophy the promotion of enterprise, the creation of new things, the establishment of things to be and, above all else, respect for the fundamental notions of human enterprise, human initiative and the freedom and flowering of the human spirit.</para><para>Small business is not just a little economic thing; it is about what we are. Above all else, it is about what we can be. So that is the passion. What about the history? The second thing I want to talk about in speaking to this bill is the history of how we got to where we are today. The last century has been a century in which liberal democracy has triumphed. It is not over, but it has established itself as the paramount system which allows people to live, allows societies to work and allows communities to flourish. We have seen that liberal democracies have predominated and have been successful because they operate on the basis of both respecting the human spirit and providing the most efficient and successful means for society.</para><para>The collectivist notions have failed because they fail to recognise the spirit that is necessary. They take a mechanistic view of society. They fail to honour the notion of individual enterprise. It is not a bad thing. It is not about greed and it is not about selfishness; it is about creativity. Those collectivist notions have fallen by the wayside. Those which would deny individuality and which frown upon individual freedom have failed. What we have seen again and again is that the element of liberal democracy which has been most successful is that which emphasises human freedom and the capacity to create. That is why liberalism in its classical sense, which emphasises freedom, is something which I align myself with, identify with, believe in and endorse absolutely. </para><para>The most flexible labour systems for the most part have been the deliverers of the greatest advances in economic progress and human freedom. When people talk about economic progress, sometimes they look upon it as a negative, as if economics equals greed. It does not. Economics means the efficient delivery of services so that we can create hospitals, schools and kidney machines and all of those things which allow people to live effective lives as well as to pursue the spiritual and the creative.</para><para>My view is that there are three fundamental conditions for allowing these values and examples of small businesses to thrive: firstly, there must be basic freedoms; secondly, there must be protections for workers; and, thirdly, there must be incentives. This bill is about ensuring a balance between those three conditions. One of the things we have seen over the last century has been a dramatic increase in the protections which should be afforded people who are not working in their own employ. I am absolutely committed to the notion that people should be able to organise collectively. That is one of the fundamental freedoms that we believe in, but in ensuring that there are protections we never want to ensure that those protections become a synonym or a Trojan horse for cutting away at the basic freedoms which underpin economic society. What we have seen of late are attempts to do that. The protections have displaced some of the basic freedoms and we have moved to a situation where there is a presumption of guilt amongst those who would employ or those who would take responsibility. Numerous teachers talk about the fact that they feel frightened to teach because of the fear of the Salem-like accusations which can be launched against them. They have real responsibilities, but they must also have a presumption of innocence. The same occurs in the workplace. That is why, on this side of the House, we have fought against unfair dismissal laws which are palpably structured in such a way so that the accuser has all on his or her side and the presumption of innocence is effectively stripped away.</para><para>Against that background, this bill seeks to overcome a decision by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission which removed the exemption of small businesses with fewer than 15 employees from redundancy payments. Why would we seek to overturn that decision? That decision in itself reversed an existing position. The reason it is a problem is that it removes the capacity of a small business to plan, to establish itself, to grow and to provide for more employment. If a small business feels that it is unable to plan with any certainty for its future and that the risks of entering into business are too great, the social message is extraordinary. Each member of this House will at some stage have come across those who wish to establish a business but are too afraid of the conditions which would act against them. In that situation, we very clearly come to this House with a desire to establish a basic freedom for genuine small businesses to pursue their work, to establish their place and to move forward in the way they plan and prepare for the future. </para><para>In that context, the specific things we worry about are Australia's 1.1 million non-agricultural small businesses. Over three million employees work within that sector. A small business is twice as likely to go out of business as a large firm. That is nobody's fault; that is the very nature of the risk that you undertake when you establish a small business. Even a small business operating for more than 15 years is still 1.7 times more likely to cease than a larger business counterpart. So there are risks. If you establish a situation here where there is an unacceptable, impractical and overly heavy burden on a small business—such as would occur if the AIRC decision were allowed to stand and reverse the existing and previous situation—it would crush the life of so many small businesses, both existing and, perhaps even more frighteningly, those which are yet to have been born or established. That is why we support the changes within this bill.</para><para>Let me conclude by focusing on the fact that establishing small businesses and encouraging the freedoms in the workplace which will allow for efficiency and effectiveness is not some ideological pursuit; it is a practical way of creating a better, more effective society. Why do I say that? Because over the last eight years, as we have introduced flexibility into the workplace, we have seen real growth that has led to the lowest unemployment within the last 13 years and some of the lowest long-term figures in unemployment in more than a decade. We now have an unemployment rate of 5.6 per cent, a record number of Australians employed and a record number of 1.3 million jobs created since 1996.</para><para>These are real changes with real benefits to individual lives because 1.3 million jobs means 1.3 million people employed. Significantly, the type of employment which we have seen over the last couple of years has been overwhelmingly full-time, not part-time work. This is about people's hopes, it is about their aspirations, it is about their futures; and from that comes a better and more sustainable society. For all of these reasons, I believe in this bill passionately. I believe in the notions of enterprise passionately and I believe that we have a responsibility wherever possible to provide the conditions for freedom and growth and to provide the conditions where individuals can get out and create the opportunities for the future. I passionately commend this bill to the House and urge its passage.</para><para>Debate interrupted.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BUSINESS</title><type>Business</type><page.no>31661</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>31661</page.no><name role="metadata">Abbott, Tony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ABBOTT</name><name.id>EZ5</name.id><electorate>Warringah</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Leader of the House</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On indulgence, I update the House with the state of play.

The redundancy payment argument is fundamentally about the payment now for a future responsibility. Historically, weak managements have bent to union demands on the basis that some future payment would not interfere with the quarterly report of the company. In the case of small business obviously this incurs a debt that is unknown in the future and not related to this year's or this quarter's profits. The redundancy payment adds yet another overhead to the wages bills of small companies, small operations and small business. Long service leave has to be paid at the termination of employment, as does holiday pay and of course the nine per cent for superannuation. These overhead costs and components of wage determinations are very much part of small business, and small businesses are committed to paying them. </para></talk.start><para>What really upsets this side of the parliament and people in small business is the imposition of redundancy payments. Under the Hawke government, of course, when unemployment was running at 11 per cent, the possibility of redundancy—the uncertainty of jobs—made the redundancy argument all the more important. Currently, under the very good economic management of the Howard government, obviously redundancy is much less of a possibility because unemployment is running at under six per cent and people have confidence that they will maintain their jobs.</para><para>Small business has been horrified by the decision by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to remove their exemption from the obligation to make redundancy payments. Redundancy payments would be quite horrific, in my view: for one year to less than two years service there would be four weeks severance pay; two years to less than three years, six weeks severance pay; three years to less than four years, seven weeks; and four years and over—which is really the key argument—would be eight weeks severance pay. So if you have been working in a job for four years then you will get eight weeks severance pay, let alone the other entitlements.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>849</name.id><name role="metadata">Sidebottom, Sid, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Sidebottom</name></talker><para>—That's shocking, isn't it, Stewie?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>VH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McArthur, Stewart, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McARTHUR</name></talker><para>—The member for Braddon would understand that; he has been in small business and he has a lot of small businesses in Braddon—</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>849</name.id><name role="metadata">Sidebottom, Sid, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

In Corangamite there are about 5,000 small businesses, and they are very unhappy with this current decision. Let us look at some actual examples of what this decision would do to small business. If you had three staff working in a small business, each on approximately $517 per week with three years service, the redundancy liability would be $10,000. If you had one employee at $644 a week with seven years service, the redundancy liability would be in the order of $5,000. Added to this at termination, of course, would be the cost of annual leave, long service leave and the accumulated superannuation. This represents a cost burden to small business, the contingent liability, which adds a very high percentage to their wages bill.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The AIRC decision has been opposed by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and other business groups. The Australian Industry Group, a representative body of businesses in Australia, had this to say:</para><quote><para>There are approximately 1 million businesses in Australia with less than 15 employees, who employ around 3 million Australians or more than 40 per cent of the private sector.</para></quote><para>The member for Braddon and others ought to be very aware of that. Small businesses are the big employers, as we have said on a number of occasions, and if they have this imposed upon them they will have less capacity to find jobs for Australians. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry reacted negatively to the AIRC decision. They said it was `a massive kick in the guts for Australian employers'. They also said: </para><quote><para>Employers and small businesses will be penalised for doing what commercial commonsense demands—restructuring their business to keep them efficient and competitive.</para></quote><para>At the announcement of this decision, they also went on to say:</para><quote><para>Today is a bleak day for the small business sector and the thousands of Australians who rely on it for their jobs.</para></quote><para>As members are aware, this bill seeks to overturn the AIRC decision. It is worth looking at some of the other examples of the cost of redundancy to business. In the Ansett collapse—as members of this House would be fully aware—millions of dollars worth of staff entitlements were owed to their employees. These generous arrangements were negotiated in more prosperous times, because of the undue influence of unions within that organisation. They made it very difficult for Ansett to restructure their operation. It was obvious that Qantas and Ansett needed to rearrange their operations to withstand international competition and remain profitable. Of course, they were not able to do that, particularly in the case of Ansett—and inevitably it went broke.</para><para>As Robert Gottliebsen, a very respected commentator in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>, said, `Inherent weakness in many Australian organisations is a result of their lenient bargaining with unions. This leniency has resulted in redundancy provisions that have forced companies such as Ansett to their knees. These organisations have been unable to reduce their staff to viable levels. Effectively, huge liabilities on the balance sheet, including worker entitlements, made Ansett, once an Australian icon, a “no-go zone” for many prospective buyers.' So there you have it. Robert Gottliebsen is making it quite clear that these entitlements were negotiated by management, particularly in the case of Ansett, in the hope that their quarterly and annual reporting would look better, but those massive liabilities remained on the balance sheet.</para><para>I would particularly like to draw the attention of the House to the redundancy provisions in the US steel industry. The US steel industry maintained a high tariff barrier to stop the importation of steel from Australia and throughout the world. As I understand it, so great was the build-up by the unions—there is a very strongly unionised work force in the US steel industry—that the US steel industry were unable to readjust their work force to make sure that they became efficient. Many of those steel firms had huge or excessive legacy costs that were incorporated in their balance sheets and liabilities for exit of their workers. Some of these worker entitlements went into billions of dollars, so the steel industry could not reduce their staff numbers to make their industries more viable. The industry had to produce more to cover their overhead costs and, of course, they had to put up the tariff barriers.</para><para>I do put on the record that the Hawke government, to its credit, did adjust the employment arrangements in BHP Steel under the Button-Hawke steel plan. Certainly here in Australia BHP Steel—Blue Scope as it is now known—was able to make the necessary adjustments with some government help so that it became internationally competitive. If that action had not been taken, then Australian steel, I think, would have suffered a similar outcome to the one that the US steel industry is now facing.</para><para>The retail motor vehicle industry employs a number of people in small businesses. There are shortages of skilled labour because of the cost of that labour and the overheads. As I have said before, those costs are superannuation, workers compensation and, of course, their wage rates. The removal of the small business exemption in this area would make sure that, in the retail motor vehicle industry, the capacity to hire new staff would be reduced, they would not take on business risk or business expansion and they would not become more innovative because of the fear of this accumulating redundancy debt in the future. </para><para>The March quarterly survey conducted by the Victorian Automobile Chamber of Commerce said that 43 per cent of associated businesses found increased labour costs limited their performance. One VACC member commented that the new Industrial Relations Commission ruling regarding severance pay for small businesses would destroy small business, especially in the smash repair sector. Many VACC members said that the small retail motor outfits do not have the luxury to offer staff redeployment as do some larger companies, which can often absorb redundant staff in other parts of the business.</para><para>It is interesting that, in Western Australia, Mr Peter Fitzpatrick, CEO of the Motor Trade Association of Western Australia, commented that small businesses simply do not have adequate resources to foresee how their environment will unfold. While bigger businesses can access industry consultants to assist with business modelling and planning, small businesses are unable to develop such models due to cost barriers. Small businesses are not as resilient as larger companies and often are required to downsize at short notice due to sudden changes in conditions or in response to loss of work due to a withdrawal by a major client. Mr Fitzpatrick says that the IRC decision flies in the face, as he puts it, of the Queensland industrial relations decision six months ago which ruled that redundancy pay could result in insolvency for small businesses.</para><para>Queenslanders and Western Australians understand that, in small business, if you accumulate these huge redundancy commitments, you are very restricted in the reality of your business. In the farming community, members of which are always small businesses—many of them employ only three or four personnel—they are very concerned. Mr Duncan Fraser of the National Farmers Federation had this to say:</para><quote><para>Like many Australians small businesses, farmers face exceptional difficulties in sustaining their business. An increase in costs, including the need to take into account potential liabilities such as redundancy, will have a significant negative impact on the viability of small business.</para></quote><para>It is interesting that the state industrial relations tribunals—those that are left—have highlighted the vulnerable position of small businesses, particularly in relation to redundancy payments. No state government has supported the removal of this business provision. So we on this side of the House have some trouble understanding why the Australian Industrial Relations Commission decided to make this very unfortunate decision. The Western Australian government, which is a Labor government, is not in favour of the removal of the exemption for employers who have businesses employing fewer than 15. It supports that and so does the New South Wales government. The New South Wales government said:</para><quote><para>The proposal ... is inconsistent with the New South Wales standard ... Furthermore, it is inconsistent with major awards under which redundancy provisions are only applicable to employers who employ 15 or more persons ...</para></quote><para>So we have a situation, and I strongly support the government's position, where the decision of the IRC has flown in the face of all of the evidence. The evidence is that this increased cost for small business has a contingent liability which is unknown and it creates a capital cost at the end of employment so that employees will be less likely to be taken on by small business because of the impact of final redundancy payments. </para><para>I personally have always been concerned that redundancy payments were the work of weak managements and strong unions. In times of buoyant economic activity—as I have said, under the Howard government—possibly people can find other jobs with unemployment at a lower level. Under the Labor government, with 11 per cent unemployment levels, obviously when people lost their jobs it was much more difficult to find another job. So redundancy is an argument, I think, that is not important in the Australian context.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>849</name.id><name role="metadata">Sidebottom, Sid, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>VH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McArthur, Stewart, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McARTHUR</name></talker><para>—We need to have a dynamic economy and small businesses need to have the ability to make changes—to put people on and off as their conditions change. Even the member for Braddon would understand that. If you have that capacity, people can seek a job elsewhere without the great fear that the redundancy payment would wipe businesses out, as it has done with the US steel industry, as it nearly did with the steel industry in Australia and as it has done with a number of the textile and other industries. The member for Braddon is very aware of that. He knows that the redundancies in the textile industry are fairly extravagant. That has been an impediment upon their readjustment in the workplace. I strongly commend the legislation and I commend the philosophical thrust that the minister has put before the parliament. It would be my earnest desire that the legislation passes both houses.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>31665</page.no><name role="metadata">Baldwin, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BALDWIN</name><name.id>LL6</name.id><electorate>Paterson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Over the past few weeks in this House we have heard a lot of talk about the magic pudding. The Labor Party believe in the Lindsay philosophy that there is a magic pudding, but they have an inability to determine fiction from non-fiction. The way that they talk about small business and its ability to afford anything is as though every small business has its own magic pudding: they can just rip off a bit more to pay for things and it will reappear again, like a never-ending bank account.</para></talk.start><para>The reality is that the Labor Party do not understand small business and do not understand about employment, because small business and employment are linked together. Today I join my colleagues in the government in debating the <inline ref="R2055">Workplace Relations Amendment (Protecting Small Business Employment) Bill 2004</inline> and expressing our support for the 1.1 million small businesses in Australia which employ over three million people. The decision of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in March this year to remove the small business exemption for redundancy pay will cost jobs. There is no doubt that it will cost lots of jobs because, as I said, small business does not have a magic pudding to rely on. It does not have its own version of Centenary House, as an endless bucket of money that the Labor Party would have. This action by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission will make running a small business more difficult and more costly, and, in the end, it will limit their ability to provide the employment that we need in this country. The decision turns on its head a system which has served this country well for the last 20 years, and the price at the end of the day will be a direct cost to small businesses.</para><para>Like my colleagues, who know what it is like to run a small business—something that the Labor Party know nothing about or, in fact, even care about—we understand the impost that the commission's decision will have. The commission handed down a test case decision to remove the exemption of businesses with fewer than 15 employees from redundancy, so the redundancy pay scale that was determined in 1984 for larger businesses now applies to small businesses. The scale is four weeks pay after one year of service and eight weeks pay after four years of service. For example, for a small business that had to make a redundancy payment to an employee who was on the minimum wage before the commission's decision the payment would have been about $1,340 after four years of service. But, because of the commission's ruling, that business is now liable to pay around $5,000. If you have a small business, like a mum and dad small business, which is paying above the minimum wage then these costs blow out even higher. So, understandably, when the decision came out small business organisations were horrified, just like I was. </para><para>Peter Anderson from the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said that the decision was `a savage hit on Australia's small business sector and their capacity to employ'. He said that small businesses would have to find an extra $190 million to cover the redundancy. That is not $190 million out of some magic pudding; that is $190 million out of the back pockets of those business people. Importantly, that is $190 million that will not be spent on jobs and opportunities, particularly for young people, as my friend and colleague the member for Dobell knows only too well. Despite all the evidence that was put before the commission, it still made this decision, which will have a devastating effect on the ability of small businesses to create jobs and to keep their businesses running.</para><para>From the Australian Industry Group, Heather Ridout, in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline>, wrote:</para><quote><para>A large number of small business people gave evidence to the AIRC in the redundancy test case.</para><para>	...	...	...</para><para>Many of the businesses were operating with marginal or negative profitability and in some cases the proprietors earned less than their employees.</para><para>Many of the owners had been forced to give guarantees to the banks over their personal assets, in particular family homes, and many were very worried about the impact of redundancy pay obligations upon their ability to obtain further finance.</para></quote><para>What is quite unbelievable is that, just before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission made their decision, the Queensland Industrial Relations Commission made their decision on a similar redundancy case, but the Queensland commission decided to keep the exemption for small business. Peter Beattie must almost be a member of the Liberal Party or The Nationals, because he supports small businesses, jobs, growth and opportunities, unlike the members opposite. The Queensland commission found that, because of the lack of financial resilience, smaller cash reserves and the potential for redundancy payouts to lead to insolvencies for small business, it would not support the removal of exemptions for small business in redundancy payments.</para><para>The very same information was before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, and yet the decision was made to put this impost on a growing sector of our economy which creates jobs and has been a significant driver in the reduction of the unemployment rate. In my area, in the Hunter in 1994 the unemployment rate was 15.4 per cent. Today the unemployment rate in the Hunter is down to 6.7 per cent. The Howard government have introduced this legislation today because they know about the burden that the decision will place on small businesses. We are not talking about multinational companies here; we are talking about local family businesses. The thousands of small businesses with fewer than 15 employees in towns like Raymond Terrace, Dungog, Lemon Tree Passage, Nelson Bay, Shoal Bay, Tea Gardens, Hawks Nest, Bulahdelah, Karuah, Forster, Tuncurry and Gloucester—indeed, all over Australia—will be affected by the decision of the commission. </para><para>Given the nature of the industry in the electorate of Paterson, you can see how far this decision will spread. We have farmers who employ farmhands to work on their dairy or beef properties; we have tourism operators who offer all sorts of activities, from the Stockton Sand Dunes right up to the Barrington Tops and through to the waterways of Port Stephens and the Great Lakes; we have people who run accommodation services, such as motels, hotels, and bed and breakfasts; we have small business operators in every single community in my electorate who run businesses like bread shops, butcheries, newsagencies, convenience stores, local nurseries and car yards; and we have the local mechanics and even a small manufacturing business. The list goes on and on. There are thousands of small businesses in my electorate who will be devastated by this action.</para><para>In Labor-held electorates, how many businesses have fewer than 15 employees? And why is it that their local members are not supporting this legislation, which opposes any attempt to apply redundancy pay obligations to these businesses? If this legislation is not passed, the majority of small businesses covered by federal awards will eventually be subject to redundancy payments for their employees, and small businesses that are constitutional corporations and covered by state awards will also be subject to these redundancy payments.</para><para>This bill will remove the redundancy pay for small businesses with fewer than 15 employees from the jurisdiction of the commission, it will cancel the effect of any variations to awards that were made by the commission from the time of the decision until the legislation commences and it will prevent a flow-on of the commission's decision to small businesses that are constitutional corporations and covered by state awards.</para><para>What I find very hypocritical—and something that, as a former small business operator, I cannot understand—is that Labor will not support measures like this to support small businesses and, in fact, will not support these measures to create more jobs, more employment. They claim they want to help people climb the ladder of opportunity, but when it comes to putting words into practice they run for the hills. In fact, they pull out those very rungs from that ladder of opportunity. They are more than happy to let small businesses pay more and more until their businesses are not viable but, then again, from the way the Labor Party ran this country when they were in government, I can understand that they do not know how to be good economic managers.</para><para>All of this is being controlled by the union arm of the Labor Party. Members opposite comply with what the unions want, just like marionettes, even though membership of unions in this country is plummeting. Even though they know that small businesses are totally against this redundancy decision from the commission, and even though they represent small businesses in their electorates, nothing has reduced the stranglehold that the unions have on the Labor Party. The opposition are blind to the damage that they cause by not supporting measures like this and other unfair dismissal laws.</para><para>Labor have opposed almost every attempt by the coalition to increase flexibility in the labour market and to provide more jobs. As I said, in 1994 unemployment in the Hunter was 15.4 per cent; today, it is around 6.6 per cent. We have established that ladder of opportunity, and the Labor Party not only want to pull out the rungs from that ladder but want to push the ladder over. They have no idea what it is like to run a small business and to lay down the policies necessary to get small businesses to thrive. When small businesses thrive, they employ people and develop our economy—Labor have no idea. </para><para>What do Labor have to say about small business?

The one that really concerns me is also on page 39 and is in relation to secondary boycotts. It says:</para><quote><para>Labor will scrap protection for small businesses from lawful industrial action by removing the secondary boycott provisions from the Trade Practices Act.</para></quote><para>What this amounts to, because union membership has dropped so low in this country, is that the bullyboys of the Labor Party and the union are going to team up to demand that people join a unionised work force. I thought life was all about freedom—freedom of association, freedom to join. But the Labor Party want to take that freedom away. They want a unionised work force. Why would they want a unionised work force? They want a unionised work force to bump up their money. They want to bump up their money because they know that there is no way that the lease on Centenary House will ever be renewed. It is the dearest rental property in the world. They have been milking the Australian taxpayer, pocketing over six grand a day, which has been going into their coffers. These people need to find an alternative source of revenue. I am sure people in the gallery would agree that there is no place for union demands and bullying in society. Page 39 also says:</para><quote><para>Labor will force employers to pay the long service leave to workers who have accrued that entitlement in previous jobs under different employers.</para></quote><para>We have discussed that before in this area. Long service leave is a reward for long service with one employer. But the Labor Party and the unions are not content with that and want to be able to transfer that across different employers. Again, this is a direct attack on small businesses. </para><para>The Labor Party want to take superannuation contributions paid by small businesses from nine per cent to 15 per cent. This is not out of the employee's pocket but out of the employer's pocket. If people want to contribute to their own superannuation—and we encourage that—that is good. But why should there be another penalty placed on small business people—the people who employ people? Labor members have never been in business and they have never had their own dollars or their own home on the line, so they have no understanding of what it is like to be in business. The opposition could say, `Maybe we're not going to do that,' but the reality is that their ideas on this have all been enunciated and detailed in their ALP policy documents. </para><para>When it comes to tax on business, the Labor Party will introduce a new federal payroll tax. They will impose a federal payroll tax—the first payroll tax since 1971. They will put a fund in place to tax small businesses. In fact, Craig Emerson—the spokesman for workplace relations and the Public Service—on 2 April said, `Labor will impose the first federal payroll tax since 1971 with a 0.1 per cent levy on payrolls to fund a national insurance scheme for worker entitlements.' There is already a state payroll tax—a tax against jobs—and the Labor Party, being determined to drive up unemployment, would introduce a new tax on jobs.

This government has tried hard—and perhaps it could have done a little more—but Labor has rejected over 40 bills to change industrial relations in this country. If those changes had gone ahead, how much lower would unemployment in Australia be than it is today? I think the unemployment figures today are the lowest they have been in around 30 years. But how much lower could they be? Labor's target is to get unemployment back up again and make sure that people are back on the dole, because that is the way Labor likes it. Labor loves people to be unemployed, and that is why it presided over the highest unemployment this country has ever seen.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>849</name.id><name role="metadata">Sidebottom, Sid, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LL6</name.id><name role="metadata">Baldwin, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BALDWIN</name></talker><para>—The member for Braddon is extremely proud of that.

This country cannot afford to have a Labor government, a government that would never support small business or support the creation of jobs.

They seem to think they can keep putting these cost imposts on the small business sector—indeed, any business sector—believing they all have the money to pay for it.

I do not know how the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer could maintain a straight face as he stood there and said this was not an embarrassment for the government. There will be a $1.2 billion a year budget hole from 2006-07, $2.3 billion over the forward estimates and $12 billion over that 10-year period—and Peter Costello said this was about competence.

This bill proposes to amend the Workplace Relations Act 1996 to maintain the exemption for small business from redundancy pay by overturning a recent decision of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to impose redundancy pay obligations on small business. </para></talk.start><para><inline font-style="italic">Government members interjecting—</inline></para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00ANF</name.id><name role="metadata">Ticehurst, Kenneth, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TICEHURST</name></talker><para>—This is important, fellows—you need to listen. If this bill is not passed, hundreds of small businesses in my electorate will be required to make redundancy payments to their employees. Statistics show that more than 70 per cent of all new jobs are created by small business. In my electorate of Dobell, with unemployment in Wyong shire well above the New South Wales average of 5.5 per cent, job creation is a key issue being addressed by local, state and federal governments. This decision by the AIRC to make small business liable for redundancy pay will cost many permanent jobs on the Central Coast. It will add a huge burden to the thousands of small businesses that can create new jobs. It will make the lives of small business people unnecessarily harder and will make them more reluctant to give new apprentices and disadvantaged groups like unemployed people the opportunity to work.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The Australian Labor Party does not understand this. The Labor Party that is beholden to union bosses does not understand that most small business people are ordinary, everyday people who have gone out on a limb to try and make a decent living for themselves and their families. Small businesses need greater flexibility, because they do not have the same access to financial and human resources as larger businesses do. Unplanned expenses can threaten the viability of businesses and, importantly, the jobs of those working in those businesses. The commission's decision is not about equity, not by any means.</para><para>The editorial in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> on 5 April depicted the inequity clearly. It said:</para><quote><para>Unlike industrial relations fat cats, small business people operate in a highly competitive environment, so the new AIRC ruling is essentially a $190 million tax on the restructuring they need to undertake regularly just to survive.</para></quote><para>The editorial went on to say:</para><quote><para>Australia has prospered though two decades of international economic vicissitude by reforming the way it does business, including with a more flexible labour market. This makes it all the more disturbing that a regulatory body charged with resolving industrial disputes can impose a new cost burden on the largely non-unionised small business sector at the behest of the ACTU.</para></quote><para>The Australian Labor Party simply cannot purport to support permanent jobs and then oppose this important legislation—and, in doing so, oppose much of the significant workplace relations reform that has taken place over the last decade. It is a highly ironic move by the ACTU to make small businesses liable for redundancy pay when this will only lead to an increase in the casualisation of the work force that the unions, and of course the Labor Party, are constantly complaining about. The casualisation of the work force is a national trend and is of concern to me and my electorate of Dobell. The AIRC decision will most definitely exacerbate the problem.</para><para>The Labor Party does not really care about the challenges small businesses face and the potential for the increased casualisation of the work force. The truth is that the ALP is indifferent to small businesses and job creation. Why else did the Labor Party decide earlier this year to increase the AIRC's powers? Big companies, big governments, big unions—that is the ALP mantra. Labor never seems to make decisions that will help small businesses. Most frustrating for small business people have been Labor's unfair dismissal laws that restrict job creation by discouraging employers from employing people, in case they face the risk of an unfair dismissal claim. Many Labor MPs have never had a real job. They joined a union at university, they pushed the Labor line for a job in the union movement and then they aspired to a place in parliament as a reward. What do they contribute to the Australian nation? Absolutely nothing. Former Whitlam minister Barry Cohen was right when he said that current Labor MPs have no real world experience and no real hope of creating good, workable policies. </para><para>With a background in small business I understand what the AIRC ruling means for small businesses in Dobell. I know that there are businesses in my electorate that are struggling to make it from day to day—businesses operating with minimal profitability, if that. Then there are the many businesspeople who have been forced to use their family home and assets as a guarantee to their banks. I had to do the same when I was operating a small business. I also had to live through Labor's 17 per cent home mortgage rates and 23 per cent business overdrafts. Forcing small businesses to make redundancy payments will only serve to push these businesses into insolvency. The Howard government is the only government that is committed to helping small business grow and develop—the only government that recognises that you cannot make a one size fits all approach with small business, because each small business is so different. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline></para><para>Last weekend, at Mingara Recreation Club in my electorate, I held a small business forum with the Hon. Kevin Andrews, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, to meet with local businesspeople face to face to gauge their concerns and to discuss how the operation of their businesses on the Central Coast can be made more efficient and more competitive. One of the main concerns small business people raised at the forum was that Labor will not support the government's effort to protect small business from redundancy payments under federal awards. Small business people simply cannot afford this potential increase in the cost of running their businesses and, as a result, the Central Coast's economy will suffer.</para><para>Reforms to the workplace relations system since the Howard government came into office in 1996 have assisted in the creation of more than 1.3 million jobs and an increase in real wages of more than 13 per cent for ordinary Australians. Reforms to the workplace relations system have not only created more jobs for Australians; they have resulted in fewer strikes, lower inflation, higher productivity and lower interest rates.</para><para>If the Australian Labor Party are serious about wanting to govern Australia, they need to understand what small Australian businesses need—and what they need are laws that support them. Labor must support this legislation and put jobs in my electorate first, particularly permanent jobs. When we look at the number of ALP members in parliament who belong to unions, it is understandable if they do not. That stands at 71 per cent; 71 per cent of Labor members of parliament have union links.

The government will continue with its policies, despite the opposition's protests and despite its opposition to the sound economic policies of the Howard government.

The Howard government has been very consistent and strong in its support for small business. It recognises that one of the biggest threats to job growth and to a very strong economy in this country is the unnecessary impediments that make it very difficult for small business owners and operators to employ more of our fellow Australians. That contrasts very strongly with the opposition's view. I remind the parliament and the people of Australia of what the former Leader of the Opposition, the member for Brand, once said. On 7 July 2000, when he was interviewed on Radio 6PR in Perth, he said:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>We have never pretended to be a small business party, the Labor Party. We have never pretended that.</para></quote><para>That is a very instructive point to be made in this parliament. It sends a strong, unequivocal message to the people of Australia. Small business is certainly not an area of genuine interest to the Labor Party.</para><para>The AIRC's decision on 26 March overturned a two-decade exemption from severance pay for businesses with fewer than 15 employees. This exemption was established by the AIRC's predecessor in 1984. This amendment will not affect any redundancy pay provisions that were in awards prior to the AIRC's decision. It is very important to make that point. It is absolutely critical that the climate for economic growth and for job creation in Australia continues to exist. It is essential for the 3.3 million people employed by small businesses around the nation to be aware of this and to support policies and programs that will ensure continuing job opportunities for our fellow Australians. </para><para>This bill does not prevent small businesses from reaching agreements with their employees to include redundancy provisions in their terms of employment. It is about preventing the imposition of a one size fits all type of regulation which many small businesses will be unable to afford. We know that there is a lot of regulation and red tape that businesses already have to cope with, and this government is working very strongly to address those issues. It certainly will not be getting any help from the opposition.</para><para>The Howard government is opposed to unnecessary restraints on small business which, as I have said, make it very hard for small business people to employ more Australians. If this bill is not passed, the vast majority of small businesses covered by federal awards will eventually be subject to redundancy payments for their employees in accordance with the AIRC's decision. More importantly, this decision is also going to flow through to state jurisdictions, so it is very important that this bill be passed in this parliament.</para><para>More than 540,000 small businesses are going to be affected by this decision, if it is not redressed, at an estimated cost of $190 million—a totally unreasonable burden to be imposed on small businesses. The decision will impose totally unreasonable financial burdens on small businesses throughout the country. For instance, a typical retail small business with seven employees, each with six years continuous employment, is going to face a liability to the extent of some $30,000. That is not a trivial amount of money for the small businesses of Australia. This decision has the real prospect of small businesses being strongly discouraged from employing more staff. More than that, it has the very real danger of sending small businesses right out of business. That is something that the Howard government cannot support. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline></para><para>I support the Howard government's support of small business. It just shows that the Labor Party opposite are not interested in hearing very strong, clear words from this government—through members on this side—that support good policies that contribute to employing more of our fellow Australians.</para><para>It is very important that members of the public who are here in the parliament today can see for themselves that, while the government is on about making laws for the country, all we have from the opposition is this sort of nonsense which in no way proves to the people that they are capable of government. The member for Lalor wants to be a minister of the Crown, yet all she can do is go on about calling quorums. The member for Lingiari has just called a quorum. Why doesn't he go and think about policies for the alternative government?</para><para>I am pleased that the opposition spokesman is here in the parliament because he is going to be severely embarrassed in a minute. This government is all about creating jobs for Australians. The opposition is totally uninterested in that. Let me take this opportunity to severely embarrass the shadow spokesman on this topic. I know that the minister will be pleased to hear this. On 11 August 2003 the member for Rankin put out a press release saying that he was going to abolish GEERS which, for those in the parliament and for those witnessing proceedings from the gallery, is the General Employment Entitlements and Redundancy Scheme. This is a very important scheme that the government has in place. This is what the member for Rankin, the shadow spokesman—and this is a man who wants to be a minister of a future Labor government—said on 11 August 2003: </para><quote><para>GEERS is fundamentally flawed. It was a hastily cobbled-together sham to distract from the Prime Minister's special one-off deal for National Textiles ...</para></quote><para>This is a shadow minister bagging a very important government initiative that exists to protect and to help small businesses and their employees. What did he propose? He said that he is going to use GEERS to allow small businesses to help their employees when those businesses are in trouble. So, when these small businesses get into trouble and their employees are made redundant, he is going to use GEERS as the mechanism to help them. That is quite remarkable. He has two different positions—a sign of complete hypocrisy. This is an opposition very unfit for government.</para><para>I know that the government wants to continue to make this place work very effectively. So I am going to take this opportunity once again to compliment the government very strongly for this bill. I strongly call on the opposition to support small businesses, especially small businesses in the Ryan electorate, which have the capacity to employ more people. I very strongly call on the opposition to support this bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>31680</page.no><name role="metadata">Andrews, Kevin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDREWS</name><name.id>HK5</name.id><electorate>Menzies</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R2055">Workplace Relations Amendment (Protecting Small Business Employment) Bill 2004</inline> will ensure that small businesses covered by federal awards are not burdened with redundancy pay obligations. The bill will amend the Workplace Relations Act 1996 to maintain the exemption for small business from redundancy pay by overturning the recent decision of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission.</para></talk.start><para>In his comments on the bill in this House on Tuesday the member for Rankin again put forward the idea of an exemption for small business which could not pay. This would mean that these businesses would have to go through the process of running a case before the Industrial Relations Commission to convince it that the business should be exempt. In doing so, Labor has again conceded that the Industrial Relations Commission decision seriously disadvantages small businesses that cannot afford redundancy pay. It accepts that many small businesses need to be exempted.</para><para>The government's answer is very simple. It will exempt small business from the new redundancy pay obligations and will enable employers and their employees to negotiate redundancy pay through workplace bargaining where a small business can afford it. This is to maintain the status quo which has been in place in this country for 20 years. The type of incapacity to pay exemption mechanism proposed by Labor has been tried and tested and has proven to be a failure. An incapacity to pay mechanism has been available to larger businesses for 20 years and it does not appear to have produced even one exemption from redundancy pay. This is despite the fact that many thousands of larger businesses have failed since the exemption mechanism was first introduced in 1984 and demonstrably have not had the capacity to pay redundancy pay.</para><para>Incapacity to pay exemption processes have always failed because industrial tribunals are very loath to exempt employers from awards, because businesses are understandably unwilling to signal to their creditors and suppliers that they are experiencing financial difficulties and because they are unwilling to expose their financial affairs to third parties, including unions. Labor has finally conceded that small businesses need to be exempted from redundancy pay, but its proposed exemption mechanism will not work. Labor wants the 160,000 small businesses that are not profitable to, when reducing staff, go cap in hand to industrial tribunals and to unions to get the exemption they need. </para><para>Labor has suggested that employees of small business which cannot afford redundancies should be protected by GEERS, yet as the member for Ryan was pointing out this is the same GEERS—one which, I should add, has paid out nearly $170 million to some 30,000 employees who have been made redundant where there were not adequate redundancy provisions in place—which the Labor opposition has promised to abolish and replace with a payroll tax on businesses in Australia. The problem is clear. Labor acknowledges the problem, yet it now also wants to pass the buck to a Senate inquiry to find ways to fix the decision. The simplest and most appropriate way, we submit, is to pass this bill.</para><para>It is the prerogative of the parliament to set policy. It has always been the policy of the government to prevent small businesses from being hit with job-destroying expenses and regulation. Even the member for Burke in the House on Tuesday acknowledged that it is acceptable to override an Industrial Relations Commission decision in very exceptional circumstances. What, I ask, would be more exceptional and would more justify government intervention than a decision that threatens small businesses and their capacity to provide employment opportunities? The 1.1 million small businesses in Australia are the great engine room for the growth in jobs in this country. The member for Burke, therefore, is being disingenuous in suggesting that the decision would impact only on a small proportion of small businesses because only a small proportion are covered by federal awards. </para><para>A test case decision of the AIRC such as this would normally flow to state jurisdictions and would eventually cover most relevant employment. This flow-on process has already begun for the AIRC's redundancy decision. UnionsWA has applied to the Western Australian Industrial Relations Commission for a flow-on to businesses in that state. The Labour Council of New South Wales has lobbied the New South Wales state government to remove the small business exemption from their Employment Protection Act to enable redundancy pay to be applied to small businesses in New South Wales. It is therefore simply a nonsense to suggest that the impact of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission decision will be restricted to small businesses covered by federal awards. We are seeing the flow-on already commencing.</para><para>The member for Rankin has misrepresented the position of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. He said that ACCI indicated that if the AIRC agreed with their proposition that only future service should count in determining the redundancy entitlements of small business employees then the need for any legislation would be minimal or effectively removed. This, I submit, is blatantly inaccurate. ACCI's press release issued on 8 June confirms the need for legislation. It states:</para><quote><para>Parliament must now pass the <inline font-style="italic">Workplace Relations Amendment (Protecting Small Business Employees) Bill 2004</inline> which seeks to reinstate what, up until today, has been the total exemption of small business from compulsory award redundancy obligations.</para></quote><para>This is something that ACCI has repeated to me in conversations. The government have been clear and consistent in their support for small businesses. These businesses should continue to have the exemption from redundancy pay that they have traditionally had in Australia. The government are about creating jobs. We have had some 1.3 million extra jobs in this country over the last seven to eight years. Not only have we got more Australians in employment but Australians are being paid higher wages. This is proof our policies are working. The opposition's proposal would fail to provide the protection that small businesses need. Instead of being confident that they will not have to bear this burden, small businesses would have to go through the bureaucratic process of proving incapacity to pay.

Labor will not be opposing the bill being given a second reading in the House. The bill essentially makes amendments relating to four issues: first, confiscation of foreign travel documents; second, associating with terrorist organisations; third, transfer of prisoners between state and territory prisons on security grounds; and, fourth, use of forensic procedures in disaster victim identification and investigation. The bill was introduced on Thursday morning of last week and we received a briefing on the bill that evening by representatives of the Attorney-General's office and the Attorney-General's Department.</para></talk.start><para>To facilitate public consultation on the bill, the opposition has referred the bill to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee for inquiry and report before parliament next resumes in August. However, we understood that schedule 5 of the bill dealing with the use of forensic procedures in disaster victim identification and investigation follows a recommendation for urgent reform from Mr Tom Sherman AO in the course of the review of the Crimes Amendment Bill 2002, which members will recall was passed after the Bali bombings. In light of this urgency expressed by Mr Sherman—who essentially advised that the offshore victim identification, if you like, was in order, but there were serious questions in respect to domestic identification—I wrote to the Attorney-General after our caucus meeting, which was on Tuesday of this week, indicating that Labor would support the immediate passage of amendments to schedule 5 as a separate bill through the parliament this week. Although it appears at the end of the bill, I might address the background of that schedule before I address the others. In October 2002, as I have indicated, Labor and the government agreed to pass the Crimes Amendment Bill 2002 to enable DNA databases to be used for victim identification and criminal investigation in connection with the Bali bombings, and any other incident of an equally horrific nature that, regrettably, may occur outside Australia, as determined by the minister. The Crimes Amendment Bill 2002 mandated an independent review of these provisions after one year. That review, chaired by the former Australian Government Solicitor and Chair of the National Crime Authority, Tom Sherman, is an ongoing review. However, we understand that Mr Sherman, with his considerable experience, has written to the government expressing concern that existing legislation is inadequate to facilitate disaster victim identification should, regrettably, a mass casualty incident such as a terrorist attack occur within Australia. As Mr Sherman indicated, this is important and, indeed, urgent. We believe it should be addressed before the conclusion of Mr Sherman's review.</para><para>Schedule 5 of this bill would amend the Crimes Act to enable the national DNA database to be used for disaster victim identification and criminal investigation in connection with incidents within Australia determined by the minister to be: firstly, suspected to involve the commission of Commonwealth offences, such as terrorism offences, or state offences with a federal aspect, such as offences affecting interstate or international aviation; secondly, suspected to involve victims who are persons with respect to whom the federal parliament can make laws, such as foreign nationals or persons receiving pensions, benefits or other allowances—obviously that would include a substantial proportion of the Australian population—or, thirdly, considered to be or to have created a national emergency. </para><para>As I have said, in light of the urgency expressed by Mr Sherman, as soon as caucus had considered the bill on Tuesday morning I informed the Attorney-General that Labor would facilitate immediate passage of the amendments in schedule 5 as a separate bill through the parliament this week. Given that offer, made in writing by the opposition, I was disappointed when the Attorney-General responded not by introducing a bill that included schedule 5 but by adding to those provisions the equivalent of schedules 1 and 2 of the bill we are now considering. While we acknowledge that those measures do appear to have merit, they are not without their complexity and, indeed, some controversy.</para><para>As a legislative principle, the opposition believes that except in demonstrated pressing circumstances this parliament should not legislate to create penalties, including terms of imprisonment, without appropriate scrutiny either by a legislative committee such as the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee or, indeed, at the very least, the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. As it stands, the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee will report before parliament next resumes and parliament can legislate in respect of those measures on the basis of the advice it obtains from that committee after consultation with members of the public. Nevertheless, in light of the respect we have for Mr Sherman and the significance of his recommendations, we again repeat our offer to the government with respect to passing separate legislation containing the provisions of schedule 5 dealing with, as I have indicated, the issue of DNA identification.</para><para>Dealing with the other issues—schedules 1 and 2, to which I briefly referred, dealing with the confiscation of foreign travel documents—I should indicate that schedule 1 would amend the Passports Act 1938 to give Commonwealth agencies the same powers over foreign travel documents as they have over Australian travel documents. We understand the bill arises in part from a DFAT review of the Passports Act, which will eventually result in a division into an Australian passports act and a foreign passports act. Indeed, we understand that work is quite advanced.</para><para>This bill would empower competent authorities to request the minister to make an order authorising the confiscation of foreign travel documents in three circumstances: first, where the person is subject to an Australian law enforcement matter; second, where the person is subject to an international law enforcement cooperation matter; or, third, where the person may engage in a specified type of harmful conduct such as terrorism. I should indicate, and as pointed out by the departmental representatives, we are not simply here talking about potential terrorism offences; we are talking about offences that could include, for instance, international paedophile offences, which of course would be condemned by all members of the parliament and which we believe justify measures of this nature.</para><para>We note, however, that failing to comply with an order is an offence carrying a maximum penalty of $2,200 or one year imprisonment. Clearly there need to be penalties associated with noncompliance but, again, the introduction of additional criminal laws with penalties including imprisonment, we believe, should require further scrutiny than has been availed to the House as a result of the recent notification of these provisions, as I indicated, on Thursday of last week. We acknowledge that the bill makes decisions of the minister subject to merits review by the AAT, and nothing in the bill empowers an agency to enter premises in the absence of lawful authority, such as, in particular, through the issuing of a warrant. </para><para>The bill also extends existing offences concerning Australian passports to foreign travel documents, such as: making false or misleading statements; giving false or misleading information; producing false or misleading documents; improper use or possession of foreign travel documents; or possessing, making or providing false documents. Schedule 2 would amend the ASIO Act 1979 to require persons who have been notified that the Director-General of Security has sought the consent of the Attorney-General for a questioning warrant not to leave the country without the Director-General's permission and, as part of the process, to surrender their passport to the Director-General of Security. Failure to comply with this requirement is an offence with a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment.</para><para>Again, we concede that these penalties are of some significance, but, again, we believe introducing penalties including penal servitude of five years justifies further consideration by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee. I should add that the Director-General must return any passport as soon as practicable if consent or a warrant is refused. This extends changes to the ASIO questioning regime passed at the end of last year. We understand this amendment has been prompted by concerns held by ASIO that, without these measures, the time taken to apply for a questioning warrant perhaps afforded an opportunity for a person to exit Australia.</para><para>The more controversial aspects of the bill involve a proposed new offence or range of offences of associating with terrorist organisations. Schedule 3 of the bill would create a new offence of associating with a terrorist organisation; indeed, a listed terrorist organisation, if members can recall the passage of legislation dealing with the proscription of organisations by way of a listing process undertaken by the Attorney-General. This offence contains a number of elements which the prosecution would be required to prove beyond reasonable doubt. I indicate for those interested in this debate that there is an essential element of intent that must be established as part of the prosecution process. The elements include that on two or more occasions the accused intentionally meets with or communicates with a person who is a member of, or promotes or directs the activities of, a terrorist organisation. A further point of knowledge is that the accused knows that the organisation is a terrorist organisation and the meeting or communication provides support to the terrorist organisation. Further, the accused intends that support to assist the terrorist organisation to expand or to continue to exist and the accused knows that the person is a member of, or a person who promotes or directs the activities of, the terrorist organisation and, as I have indicated, the organisation is listed in Australia as a terrorist organisation. The maximum penalty is less than those which we have previously passed with respect to terrorist offences. The maximum penalty set out in the bill is three years imprisonment. It is noted that a person cannot be convicted twice for separate acts that are less than seven days apart. In other words, acts within that time are regarded as part of the one course of conduct or offence. </para><para>The offence also contains a number of exceptions and does not apply if the meeting or communication is with a close family member, defined as a person's spouse, de facto spouse, interestingly a same-sex partner, parent, step-parent, grandparent, child, stepchild, grandchild, brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister, guardian or carer, and relates only to a matter that could reasonably be regarded as a matter of family or domestic concern. But in that context, and appropriately, the legislation requires that, in determining whether it is communication of that nature, it is necessary to take into account the person's cultural background. </para><para>The next exemption is that the meeting or communication is in a place that is being used for public religious worship and takes place in the course of practising a religion. Obviously it would not include, for instance, discussions regarding a potential terrorist attack, which could not sensibly be argued to be taking place in the course of practising a religion. The third exemption is with respect to where the association is only for the purpose of providing aid of a humanitarian nature. This will include, we understand, for example, doctors or pharmacists or where the association is only for the purpose of providing legal advice or legal representation in connection with criminal proceedings or proceedings relating to criminal proceedings, including possible criminal proceedings in the future, or proceedings relating to whether the organisation in question is a terrorist organisation.</para><para>While the prosecution bears the legal burden in respect of establishing the offence, an accused seeking to rely on those exemptions which I have summarised bears an evidential burden in relation to those exemptions. This means that, if the accused points to evidence that suggests a reasonable possibility that exemption applies, the burden shifts to the prosecution to prove on the balance of probabilities that the exemption does not apply. </para><para>This proposed offence gives rise to a number of issues which it will be appropriate for the Senate committee to consider more fully with the benefit of public submissions. Firstly, there is the question of penalty. The proposed offence carries a maximum penalty of three years. That is less than the maximum penalties applying to existing terrorism offences, which range from 10 to 25 years. However, it is fair to say that the substantial purpose and intent of those terrorism offences that we have introduced through this parliament relate to the perpetration of terrorist acts, whereas these offences, while no doubt equally deserving of public condemnation, are of the nature of supporting or sustaining the organisation as opposed to involvement in the actual perpetration of those terrorist acts. Nonetheless, these offences require appropriate sanction, we believe, from the parliament and law enforcement authorities. </para><para>However, in that context we do note that the three-year maximum term of imprisonment is considerably more than the existing maximum penalties for consorting, which the proposed offence resembles and to which the Attorney-General has often referred in public statements. By way of example, the maximum penalties for the offence of consorting are three months in the Northern Territory, six months in New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania and Western Australia, and in Victoria one year for a first offence and two years for a repeat offence. It must be recognised that the proposed offence we are dealing with in this legislation, that of associating with terrorist organisations, differs from traditional consorting offences in that it contains more stringent fault elements and therefore applies to more serious behaviour. But the question of penalty will no doubt be something that the Senate committee will consider in the context of those other precedents.</para><para>A second issue is the scope of the exemption for lawyers. The opposition has raised with officials of the Attorney-General's Department whether the exemption needs to be broadened to cover other forms of proceedings which might arise in the context of a terrorism investigation, such as proceedings relating to ASIO questioning warrants, administrative proceedings relating to confiscation of travel documents or civil proceedings seeking a remedy for wrongful use of telecommunications interception or surveillance devices, or damage caused by searches or controlled operations. This will no doubt also be looked at by the Senate committee. </para><para>Another matter in which the media always takes an interest is the position of journalists. We note that the proposed offence requires proof that the accused provides support and intends that support to assist a terrorist organisation to expand or continue to exist. Also, one of the exemptions to the offence refers to the implied constitutional freedom of political communication. However, this is also a relevant issue for the committee. It is difficult to see how the public reporting on the activities of an organisation could fall within the definitions of the offence. Nonetheless, I believe that the media is entitled to have that matter clarified beyond any reasonable doubt.</para><para>The final issue I will discuss in my contribution is the interaction of this proposed offence with the new bail laws introduced as part of the first Anti-Terrorism Bill 2004 just a few weeks ago. That bill, members will recall, provides that bail will not be granted in relation to a terrorism charge unless exceptional circumstances exist. These offences, as I understand it, although they carry a maximum sentence of three years imprisonment—considerably less than the other offences—would still be part of that presumption against bail regime. Again, whether that was the intention of the department is something that I believe the Senate committee will consider in its deliberation of these matters.</para><para>The stated purpose of this measure—that is, the associating offence—is to deter people from associating with persons known to direct, promote or, indeed, be members of the activities of terrorist organisations. That is an important aim. Appropriately, it expresses both public condemnation of these sorts of organisations and, if you like, it is part of a strategy to dry up the sustenance of these organisations. But, when we are talking about offences of this nature, we must tread carefully. Winning the fight against terrorism will require cooperation of the whole of the Australian community. We will not get that cooperation if there is a perception that particular communities are being singled out for oppressive treatment or harassment. We know that feelings of alienation and exclusion cause communities to close ranks and, at worst, push even more people towards extremist responses. I will take the unusual step of quoting the former Attorney-General, the member for Tangney. He wrote a very cogent article in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun </inline>on 21 August last year which I would commend to members. It was titled, `Our diversity our strength'. Among other things, the former Attorney-General Daryl Williams said:</para><quote><para>We must remember our fight is with extremists and fanatics, not with the Muslim faith.</para><para>We must not be tempted by the terrorist threat to turn against each other.</para></quote><para>That is one quote out of a very commendable article.</para><para>Along with many members, I was disturbed by the report of increased discrimination against and vilification of Arab and Muslim Australians since 2001 which was published last week by the acting Race Discrimination Commissioner, Dr Bill Jonas, in <inline font-style="italic">Isma—Listen</inline>. Indeed, I was saddened to read that the Muslim prayer hall at Annangrove in Sydney was desecrated this week with pigs' heads impaled on stakes, animal blood and offal. Such actions have no place in our society. Not only must such actions against Muslim Australians be condemned; I know many Australian Muslims share similar disdain and revulsion for those who have similarly desecrated Jewish places of worship. It is vital that we bring these voices of reason from all communities forward. Returning to the report of the Human Rights Commissioner, the commissioner concluded: </para><quote><para>These experiences are having profound impact on Arab and Muslim Australians. The biggest impacts are a substantial increase in fear, a growing sense of alienation from the wider community and an increasing distrust of authority.</para></quote><para>Those are warning bells. Yes, we need to dry up the sustenance of potential terrorist organisations but, equally, we have to guard against alienating sectors of our community so that it makes those who would otherwise not have the propensity to perhaps be more inclined to listen to those extremist points of view. Dr Jonas and his team have undertaken a valuable project and I take the opportunity on behalf of the opposition to thank them for the service they are providing and, indeed, to thank Dr Jonas for his service to the Australian people generally as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner and acting Race Discrimination Commissioner. We wish him all the very best for the future. </para><para>I for one do not think we are doing enough as a parliament to address the problems of prejudice and alienation that the commissioner has identified. I strongly urge the government to respond positively to that report and the recommendations it contains. As a start, the government might like to think about adopting the Racial and Religious Hatred Bill that I introduced last year and that has been further advanced by my colleague Nicola Roxon so that we can combat the deliberate incitement of racial or religious hatred with the strongest possible legal actions, whether the incitement is against Australian Jews, Muslims, Christians or any other group in our society. We need to bring forward those from all communities who espouse reason and not fanaticism.</para><para>Finally, I will deal with the issue of transfer between state and territory prisons. I note that, in that respect, the state and territory governments expressed concern last year to the Commonwealth that currently legislation does not permit prisoners to be transferred on security grounds—for example, where a suspected terrorist is detained in a place where facilities are inadequate to meet the assessed security risk or where a prisoner may be a witness requiring additional protection. While the measures proposed by the government on their face appear to be appropriate, I am concerned that there has been a lack of consultation with state and territory governments regarding the drafting of these amendments. In particular, state governments, as I understand it, are concerned that the measures proposed in this bill may actually add a layer of unnecessary bureaucracy and hence cause delay in respect of a very significant security issue—namely, the security issues associated with the detention of those persons charged with terrorist offences. I understand that the federal government has not even considered it. Indeed, I understand that it was the states who expressed their concern about the lack of facilities to the federal government, as I have mentioned.</para><para>The measures set out in the bill effectively mandate the involvement of the Commonwealth Attorney-General in respect of a situation that may be resolved more expeditiously and efficiently between state agreements regarding the transfer of prisoners. The introduction of these measures without consultation is all the more surprising because I have been informed that the states are less than a week away from formalising an arrangement for transfer between states, based on unified national principles that they have been negotiating. </para><para>The concern expressed to me by state governments is that the measures contained in this bill will require the approval of the federal Attorney-General whether or not a prisoner being moved has been charged with a federal or state offence. I have been informed that quite often security concerns mean a rapid response is necessary and prisoners may need to be moved in a matter of hours, not days. I am not sure that the Attorney-General was aware of the advanced state of the measures that have been developed between state governments and the fact that mandating his involvement in those measures may actually cause delay and hence retard the ability to urgently respond to a security situation.</para><para>Clearly, any number of urgent situations could arise where a prisoner is a security risk—for instance, in circumstances where they face a security risk because they are a significant witness in a prosecution or in other situations such as where a prison officer or, worse still, a prison officer's family was the subject of a threat. In short, the opposition fully supports the need for there to be mechanisms in place for prisoners to be transferred between jurisdictions on the basis of security requirements. However, it is disappointing that the Attorney-General has not engaged in greater consultation with the states so that a more efficient system can be implemented. Again, this is clearly a matter of whether states deserve to be consulted. In light of the Attorney-General's failure to consult the states, the parliament should require that to be done through the processes of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee. An amendment may be necessary and appropriate to preserve the operation of any agreements reached between state governments for the transfer of prisoners, perhaps with a requirement that the Attorney-General be notified when any such transfer has occurred. Again, this is clearly something that would benefit from consideration by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee.</para><para>In conclusion, the opposition will not oppose giving the bill a second reading in the House. I have indicated that we believe the bill would benefit from public examination by a Senate committee. In the meantime, we repeat our offer to facilitate the passage of schedule 5 through the parliament this week. Regrettably the government has not accept that offer, but again we put it on the table should the government decide to accept that in what we hope are the closing hours of this parliament.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>31690</page.no><name role="metadata">King, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KING</name><name.id>00AMQ</name.id><electorate>Wentworth</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R2107">Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2004 </inline>contains one law and three law-enforcement measures. I am pleased that the honourable member for Barton, who has just spoken in some detail about the matter, lends his support. The bill arises out of an increased understanding and heightened awareness in our community of the need for new measures to deal, on a national security basis, with the war against terrorism and issues relating to the war against terrorism. I have had some familiarity with that heightened awareness even in my own electorate. Two weeks ago we held a community crime forum. As a result of that crime forum, I have developed in consultation with elements of the community a security plan to deal with a possible terrorist attack in my area, the eastern suburbs of Sydney, in the event that that should occur. That plan involves linkages between the emergency wards of the two large hospitals in the area and police and emergency units in the event of a catastrophe occurring in our part of Sydney. Some might say that is alarmist, but it is not. I think we all need to be prepared in the event of such a horrific attack occurring in any part of the country, particularly where a risk has been identified, as it has in my electorate. </para></talk.start><para>I would like to deal firstly with the law measure, the proposed new provision at division 102.8 of the Criminal Code. It provides for an offence where on two or more occasions the person intentionally associates with another person who is a member, or a person who promotes or directs the activities, of an organisation; and the person knows that the organisation is a terrorist organisation; and the association provides support to the organisation; and the person intends that the support assists the organisation to expand or to continue to exist; and the person knows that the other person is a member, or a person who promotes or directs the activities, of the organisation; and the organisation is a terrorist organisation as defined. The penalty is imprisonment for three years.</para><para>The offence is rather turgidly expressed but, at the end of the day, when one examines the wording of the offence it becomes reasonably clear that the purpose is to enact an offence where a person intentionally associates with a person who is a member, or who promotes or directs the activities, of a listed terrorist organisation, where that association provides support that would help the terrorist organisation to continue to exist or expand. It is in short a form of `consorting' offence. In the nature of those offences, it is important that the offence be clearly and tightly defined, because vagueness around the edges generally leads to acquittal where often the accused has been involved in activities very closely associated with the charge, and also because it can sometimes work against the interests of people who in truth are innocent.</para><para>I want to draw attention to a couple of matters. The first is the requirement in clause (1)(a)(i) that:</para><quote><para>... the person intentionally associates with another person who is a member of, or a person who promotes or directs the activities of, an organisation.</para></quote><para>This element of the offence does, it is true, require that there be an intentional association, an act which is coupled with an intent. But that only goes so far, because the other person has to be a member of, or a person who promotes or directs, the organisation but it does not necessarily follow from that that the offence is committed if the person who commits the offence did not know the other person was a member of the organisation. However, clause(1)(a)(ii) does require knowledge to that effect and clause (1)(a)(iv) requires that the person who is charged with the offence intends that the support assist the organisation. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline></para><para>Consorting with a terrorist organisation has four exceptions: families, clergymen, lawyers and charities. The whole question of feelings of prejudice and alienation, which has arisen in relation to recent protests from members of the Muslim faith in our community, is addressed by this aspect of the bill. But our concern ought not be simply to list in a bill such as this those very specific exceptions. We must do more than simply by the legislation accept those people, especially where there may be a connection with people of the Muslim faith, who have expressed in my office recently their concern as to what they see as targeting of their community. I would not for one moment want to suggest that, but the unfortunate events at the Muslim prayer hall at Annangrove recently give some substance to their concern.</para><para>I would suggest that the Attorney and his department, in administering this proposed act, should ensure that there be a process of public education and, indeed, assistance to the communities who might otherwise feel targeted by such a bill as this. I am sure that the Attorney, whom I am very pleased to see is in the House today, will work closely with some of those communities, as he did when he was the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, and ensure that they do not feel in any way targeted, victimised or as though they are being addressed by a measure such as this. At the end of the day, what we really want to do is ensure that terrorism and acts associated with terrorism are the real target of this proposed legislation. That is why I support it. It is a necessary measure and, because it is a necessary measure, it deserves the support of the House. </para><para>The three law enforcement measures that I mentioned deal, firstly, with transfer of prisoners. That is a matter of some moment, but it is not critical for present purposes. They deal, secondly, with the issue about passports and, thirdly, with an issue regarding forensic procedures. Cooperation between all jurisdictions in Australia is of course important, particularly in the use of the national DNA database system which this bill provides for.</para><para>The measure relating to law enforcement that I want to address in a little more detail is the passports question. When we talk about passports, we think of the small booklet that we use to go in and out of the country. But, for many people who perhaps have become citizens for the first time or who are new migrants obtaining their first passport, that document is a matter of great moment. I think it is very important that the passport laws—which have not had a revision for many years; this is the first revision of its kind for many years—be administered in a way that is not going to, as it were, take hold of people or entrap them where they made an innocent mistake in the completion of the documents leading to the issue of a passport to them.</para><para>Let me give an example. Clause 15, relating to potential for harmful conduct, provides:</para><quote><para>If a competent authority suspects on reasonable grounds that:</para></quote><para>(a) unless a person's foreign travel documents are surrendered, the person would be likely to engage in conduct that:</para><para>(i) might prejudice the security of Australia or a foreign country—</para><para>et cetera. That provision, which is the enabling provision conferring power upon the minister to actually withdraw the passport, is hedged around with the test `suspects on reasonable grounds' and refers to a person who `would be likely to engage in conduct that might prejudice the security of Australia' et cetera. It certainly confers a very wide discretion upon the minister—one which I am sure he would only exercise upon sound advice and after making sure that the matter was intently looked at before any such drastic measure was taken.</para><para>Regarding the measures I am particularly concerned with—clauses 13 and 14, relating to the precise terms of the passport to be forfeited—it should be noted that, if there is any mistake whatsoever in connection with or in relation to an application for a foreign travel document, it can lead to imprisonment for 10 years, or 1,000 penalty units, where that statement is false or misleading. It does not appear that there is any exception if that error is unintentional. However, there is a qualification in clause 18(2) requiring the statement to be not false or misleading in a material particular. I would say this about the administration of this part of the proposed statute: it needs to be carefully monitored. Such a drastic measure as this, brought in at a time of heightened awareness of acts of terrorism, both in this country and overseas, may well be necessary, although in my view it is not as necessary as the consorting offence about which I have already spoken. I urge those who will be administering this aspect of the legislation to do so with some care, especially in the initial stages, so that processes are put in place and protocols are established which will ensure that this legislation protects the Australian community and does not act as a tyranny in relation to its administration. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>31692</page.no><name role="metadata">Andren, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDREN</name><name.id>KL6</name.id><electorate>Calare</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On the face of it the <inline ref="R2107">Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2004</inline> looks reasonable, indeed necessary, but the devil is in the detail. The member for Wentworth alluded to some areas of concern that he has. I am seeking some clarification to reassure me that innocent people will not get tangled in this net, particularly in relation to part 3, offences relating to foreign travel documents, and schedule 3, associating with terrorist organisations. If people are identified as being under warrant for serious offences or as having been legally ordered to not leave Australia or, indeed, if they are suspected of engaging in actions that will cause harm to others, then it certainly makes sense to prevent those identified people from leaving Australia and disappearing into the anonymity of the world community. The amending of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 achieves this.</para></talk.start><para>The changes to the Passports Act 1938 are similar to those that already apply to Australian passports and close a loophole that allows a person to leave Australia on a foreign passport, despite the cancellation and seizure of that person's Australian passport on security or law enforcement grounds. The bill also provides redress, in that an application can be made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for a review of a decision by the minister to order the surrender of foreign travel documents. I have no problem with this. However, other changes to the Passports Act—in part 3, clauses 18 to 20 of the bill—insert new offences for making false statements, giving false information or providing false documents in relation to foreign travel document applications. These offences also extend to the improper use or possession of a foreign travel document and making, possessing or using false foreign travel documents.</para><para>While the intent of these particular changes may be to combat the increasing, well-recognised problem of identity theft and fraud, especially in the current context of an amorphous terrorist threat to the worldwide community, I am worried that innocent people may be caught up in these provisions. It appears that those very people who flee terror and danger, often without bona fide papers, their only belongings having been gathered up in the dead of night, could be entangled in this net. There exist many tyrannical governments, corrupt officials and anarchic situations around the world that in fact necessitate using false travel documents or false information to allow a person to flee and consequently seek to arrive in a place of safety. While a not so small irony exists that such people seeking refuge are in fact already held in imprisonment by our government—as opposed to what should be a briefer mandatory detention for security purposes—I would not want to see their situation further worsened with the threat of a further 10- year imprisonment.</para><para>Clauses 18 to 20 create as offences the making of false or misleading statements, the giving of false information and the production of false documents in relation to an application for a travel document. At first this sounds okay. After all, it is prudent to not allow falsity in such important documents, and one assumes these provisions are rightly aimed at people whose actual business is to make money out of false travel documents. The Criminal Code ensures that geographical jurisdiction will only apply where the conduct or the result of the conduct occurs wholly or partly in Australia, unless explicitly stated otherwise in the legislation. As confirmed by the Attorney--General's Department, if a person makes a false or misleading statement in, say, Iraq, to a person in Iraq, and the travel document is issued in Iraq or any other country outside Australia, then that person is not committing an offence under this legislation. </para><para>There already exists in the Passport Act anyway the offence of having in one's possession or under one's control within Australia a falsified passport from a foreign country. However, this section, section 9A(1)(f) of the Passports Act is being repealed by this bill and replaced with the provisions in the bill—with the 10-year penalty—and the provisions within clauses 18 to 20 could conceivably apply to asylum seekers who have had to make false or misleading statements, give false or misleading information or produce false or misleading documents when applying for travel documents in the very countries from which they were trying to flee persecution and danger.</para><para>The Attorney--General's Department has informed me that, if any part of the result of the conduct constituting the offence occurs in Australia or on an Australian aircraft or ship, then that person falls under the net of this legislation. That is, an asylum seeker who used false or misleading information in their application for travel documents in, say, Iraq or elsewhere could be imprisoned for 10 years, or fined 1,000 penalty units, under the bill, because, if they are fished up by an Australian boat and offer their false or misleading travel documents, those documents or that information is part of the result of their original application for the document—whether that application was made in Iraq, Indonesia or wherever. I would like the minister to correct me if I am wrong.</para><para>Further, the defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to these matters under the Criminal Code. While I hope and assume that it is not the intent of the government to further persecute asylum seekers—certainly that is not allowable under the 1951 convention relating to the status of refugees, which, I remind the House, Australia is not only a signatory to but was instrumental in drafting—I would not want to support the possibility of that happening. Certainly the recent history of government action in relation to sad people arriving on leaky boats and requesting protection prior to an election does nothing to encourage confidence that an abuse of these provisions could not occur.</para><para>I certainly support the tenor of the amendments proposed earlier by the member for Cunningham but, I understand, withdrawn. They were designed to insert a statutory defence of `reasonable excuse' in relation to clauses 18 to 20. I hope such amendments are considered before this bill passes all processes. Clauses 21 and 22 in part 3 of the bill allow a `reasonable excuse' clause in the application of the legislation. The extension of `reasonable excuse' to the previous three clauses, 18 to 20, would certainly allay my concerns somewhat.</para><para>I note that schedule 3 of the bill, association with terrorist organisations—and its penalty of imprisonment for three years—explicitly states under proposed section 102.8 that this does not apply, to the extent that it would infringe any constitutional doctrine of implied freedom of political communication. The EM explains that this means a person can point to evidence suggesting a reasonable possibility that the association was a purely political communication for the purposes of the Constitution, with the example of a journalist interviewing a terrorist given. That journalist would be able to make use of this exception. That obviously begs a few questions about the security of the individuals concerned too. I am a passionate supporter of freedom of speech, but it seems to me that we may be building in possible contradictions around this while there seem to be other areas where innocent—perhaps more innocent, if there is such a thing—people may be caught up in the net of this. </para><para>I point out that this bill seems to include also a person such as someone who perhaps had links with the African National Congress during the dark days of apartheid in South Africa. I suggest that, had our terrorist laws existed at that time, the ANC would have been proscribed and young people I know who did knowingly associate with those who had links with that organisation would have been committing an offence that carried with it the penalty of three years imprisonment. Again it begs several questions. These include: what exactly is terrorism and what is freedom fighting, and when does one become the other; how do we differentiate between the two; who could get caught up in the net of this, being so easily branded as terrorists, as we have seen, or potential terrorists, while having very legitimate reasons for seeking asylum? Of course, all these things are exploited by the forces of darkness, who want to hide behind their rights and so on, but there are forces of darkness, believe me, on both sides of this current scenario.</para><para>I support schedule 4 of this bill, which amends the Transfer of Prisoners Act 1983 to include `security' as a third ground for transfer between state or territory prisons for federal, state and territory prisoners, as well as for persons charged with and remanded in custody for an offence. The definition of security relates to the protection of Australia and Australians from espionage or politically motivated violence, as well as other forms of harm similarly defined in the ASIO Act. The other two grounds are `transfer for prisoner's welfare' and `transfer for the purposes of trial.'</para><para>Under this bill the Attorney--General is provided with the discretion to make a written order for the transfer of a prisoner or remand prisoner imprisoned in a state or territory to another state or territory in the interests of security, but he or she must have written consent to the transfer from all relevant ministers in the states or territories. Under these provisions, the Attorney is also required to make an order for the return transfer of a prisoner or remand prisoner where, after review, it is reasonable to believe there is no longer a basis for the security transfer order or where it is necessary for court proceedings. Obviously one should have no objections to these provisions.</para><para>Finally, provisions of the bill in schedule 5 relate to forensic procedure. Their stated aim is to amend the forensic provisions of the Crimes Act. Currently these procedures apply to overseas incidents. As noted in the EM, they establish a framework for a cooperative legislative scheme with states and territories. They are entirely appropriate and easily supported.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>31695</page.no><name role="metadata">Georgiou, Petro, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GEORGIOU</name><name.id>HM5</name.id><electorate>Kooyong</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Sometimes debate in this House involves people just shouting at one another, but I am glad I have sat here through debate on the <inline ref="">Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2004</inline>.

The terror attacks of September 11 and the Bali bombings crystallised our recognition of the terrorist threat and our vulnerability to it. The government has responded strongly to these threats. Part of the government's response post-September 11 was to introduce legislation to strengthen our antiterrorism laws and the antiterrorist powers of our security organisations. </para><para>The legislation, as originally proposed in 2002, loosely defined and severely punished terrorist acts and terrorist crimes. It overturned the presumption that people accused of a crime are innocent until proven guilty and it gave the executive unprecedented detention and interrogation powers. The original legislation negated the right to silence, the privilege against self-incrimination and the right to legal representation. Understandably there were grave concerns about the impact of these measures on our democratic values and institutions. As I said in debate on some of these amendments in 2002, ultimately the responsibility of democracies is to defend both the security and the freedom of their citizens. We have to recognise terrorist dangers and we have to respond in a measured, effective and proportionate way.</para><para>A great deal of consideration is required to achieve the difficult balance between maximising our safety and security, while defending the core values of our society, and it has to be underscored that those values are the very values that the terrorists seek to destroy, and they are ultimately the reason our society is being targeted. They are: the rule of law, due process, civil liberties and freedom of speech. I believed that some of the measures originally proposed in 2002 would have fundamentally and unjustifiably eroded the protection given to Australians by the law. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BUSINESS</title><type>Business</type><page.no>31695</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>31695</page.no><name role="metadata">Abbott, Tony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ABBOTT</name><name.id>EZ5</name.id><electorate>Warringah</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Leader of the House</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker.

These concerns and the people expressing them were marginalised by some, as naive and as underestimating the danger of terrorism and the imperative for sweeping security measures. However, ultimately—to the credit of our society and of our parliamentary system—fundamental objections to the initial proposals were examined seriously, not least by parliamentary committees, and very substantial amendments were made to the proposed legislation. These amendments included restoring the usual criminal burden of proof—that is, that the prosecution prove its allegations beyond reasonable doubt; limiting the definition of terrorist acts to those intended to cause or threaten serious harm to coerce or intimidate the government or the public in the pursuit of political, religious or ideological goals; and requiring intention, knowledge or recklessness for a person to be guilty of a terrorist offence.</para></talk.start><para>It is important to note that the legislation introduced after September 11 did include reference to guilt by association. After considerable discussion, we did criminalise membership of a terrorist organisation, but in a significantly modified form. The association offence was restricted to people who are intentionally members of an organisation that they know to be a proscribed terrorist organisation. The current bill revisits this issue of association but goes even further than the proposals that were rejected in the past. This bill, and specifically the provisions relating to associating with terrorist organisations, raises fundamental challenges to the appropriate balance between freedom and security in Australian society. The bill criminalises associating with a member, director or promoter of a proscribed organisation. A proscribed organisation is one which is specified and actually regulated as a terrorist organisation, if the minister is satisfied on reasonable grounds that the organisation is directly or indirectly engaged in preparing, planning, assisting or fostering the doing of a terrorist act. </para><para>It is important to note that most terrorist organisations have various activities. The Australian government, in fairness, has sought to focus on the military wings of such organisations. Thus, for example, Australia has proscribed the Hezbollah external security organisation—in this it followed the United Kingdom. I note in passing that <inline font-style="italic">Jane's Islamic Affairs Analyst</inline> said:</para><quote><para>Britain, Bush's strongest ally in the war against terrorism, put `Hizbullah's external security organisation' on its first-ever list of proscribed organisations in February 2001—a name which no-one in Lebanon had ever heard of before and which the London government apparently made up.</para></quote><para>It is beyond doubt that the bill intends to cover multiple purpose organisations having a terrorist component. Under this bill, an individual who associates more than once with a proscribed organisation can be sentenced to three years in jail even though: the person did not know that it was a proscribed organisation—although there are literally hundreds of terrorist organisations only 17 of them are currently proscribed under the Criminal Code; the person associated with a promoter of a terrorist organisation—being the promoter of a terrorist organisation is not in itself a crime; the person did not intend to further or support any violent or illegal act but rather intended to support non-violent activities; the person had no more than two meetings or communications with a member, director or promoter of a terrorist organisation.</para><para>Let me give some examples of how such guilt by association would work. Firstly, say, for example, that a journalist writes in support of the non-violent activities of an organisation he knows is a proscribed terrorist organisation. The journalist thereby intends that his support will assist the organisation to continue to exist. This journalist is not guilty of any offence. If, however, an ordinary member of the public communicates twice with the journalist about the article and expresses agreement with the journalist's views, thereby providing support to the organisation's activities, I believe that that person can be found guilty of associating with a terrorist organisation and be liable to three years in jail. Of course, if the organisation were just a terrorist organisation and not a terrorist organisation proscribed by legislation, no offence would have been committed. I reiterate that paradoxically the journalist who writes in support of a proscribed terrorist organisation is not guilty of an offence as long as he does not associate with a member of the organisation on more than one occasion.</para><para>This brings me to my second illustration, which is pertinent to the issue of freedom of expression. A journalist who is briefed twice by a person he knows is a member of a terrorist organisation may write an article that supports the organisation's non-violent activities, intending thereby to assist the association to extend those activities. This has the effect of supporting the organisation. The journalist on this reading would then be liable for three years in jail for associating with a proscribed organisation. </para><para>This brings me to my third illustration. Say, for example, that a member of a proscribed organisation writes to a newspaper condemning the proscription of the organisation as undemocratic. Say that he is responded to twice in the newspaper's columns by a member of the public who agrees with the letter writer and advocates that the proscription be removed. The member of the public therefore knows that he is communicating with a proscribed terrorist organisation. Axiomatically, the letters provide support to the organisation because the writer wants the organisation to be unproscribed. In this view, he too is liable to three years imprisonment.</para><para>A final illustration was provided to me by the Attorney-General, who said that an example might be of a community leader who has considerable status. He or she may appear at a meeting next to a terrorist leader in a gesture designed to garner support for the terrorist organisation. The person may not have in mind helping the organisation engage in the terrorist act. The person may be supporting the organisation for other reasons—for example, political reasons or because the organisation has been generous to the poor. However, the appearance would be intended to support the organisation or assist the organisation to expand or continue to exist. But it is clear that the intention of this proposed legislation is that such a person would be liable to three years in jail, despite the fact that he merely shared a platform with a terrorist leader.</para><para>What of the cousin, the uncle, the schoolteacher, the caterer or the person who rents the hall to a member of a terrorist organisation, all of whom may have multiple contacts with a member, director or promoter but have no intention of promoting or furthering a terrorist act or any illegal activity? What of the religious leader, the social worker or the lawyer? There are a series of exemptions to the operation of the offence. I will run through them briefly in the time that is left to me, but suffice to say that they underscore the magnitude of the problems inherent in this bill rather than resolving them.</para><para>First, I turn to the exception for a close family member. The exception applies only to specific family members listed in the bill. It applies only when the association relates to a matter that could be reasonably regarded as `a matter of family or domestic concern'. Assuming that a wife or mother who does the cooking or housekeeping constitutes an associate for the purposes of the bill and undertakes these activities for a husband or son who is a member or promoter of a terrorist organisation, they are protected by the exemption. But the exemption relates only to a family or domestic matter. If the wife drives the husband to the court if he is on trial for a terrorist offence, is that a family or domestic concern or a culpable association? Is the wife guilty of association if her husband even discusses the organisation with her? Other people who may have close contact with members of a proscribed organisation may include an aunt, uncle, nephew, niece, mother-in-law or father-in-law. These people do not fall within the definition of a close family member—but I have to admit a same-sex couple does—and so they are not protected unless their behaviour is covered by another exemption. Does the bill make it a crime to communicate about family and domestic concerns if you cannot come within the definition of a close family member? If it does not, then why does the bill require such a heavily qualified exemption?</para><para>Secondly, there is the religious exemption. To fall within the religious exemption the association must occur in a place being used for public religious worship and occur in the course of practising a religion—for example, a church or mosque. However, what is the restraint on the definition of a place of `public' worship? Does this indicate that there are places of private worship which do not fall within the exemption? </para><para>Thirdly, the bill exempts association that is for the purpose of providing aid of a humanitarian nature. This might be consistent with a community leader discussing support for welfare activities but the explanatory memorandum says it is intended to apply to persons undertaking humanitarian aid. This suggests that it excludes those who are not directly involved in the delivery of aid and excludes those communicating about the welfare needs of particular populations.</para><para>Fourth, the legal advice and representation exemption applies where the association is only for the purpose of providing legal advice or representation and even then only in limited circumstances. For example, a lawyer whose association is only for the purpose of advising a client about existing or potential criminal charges would not be caught, but a lawyer associating with and advising a person about civil proceedings or royal commission proceedings does not appear to be covered. Discussions among people other than legal professionals about criminal proceedings or judicial review proceedings would not be protected. While the Criminal Code provides for organisations to be de-proscribed if they change their goals or activities, the exemption appears not to extend to legal representation to the minister to de-proscribe an organisation.</para><para>Finally, there is the implied freedom of political communication exemption. High Court decisions have established that there is a constitutionally protected implied right of political communication in Australia. The bill provides that this may be a defence. However, the implied freedom is not absolute, so it would be difficult for a person to ascertain whether their activities would be protected by this exemption, let alone to prove it—which they actually have to.</para><para>Earlier I remarked on the need to maintain the appropriate balance between freedom and security. The maintenance of the safety and security of our society and its citizens is fundamental to any government. The fight against terrorism is part of that fundamental obligation. But we also need to realise that part of what the terrorists are attempting to destroy are our democratic values, freedoms and institutions. We may on occasion need to qualify our civil liberties in the fight to defend our security. The plethora of anti-terrorist bills adopted by this parliament has shown that we are capable of doing so. When it becomes apparent that the cost in civil liberties and legal protections far outweighs any increase in security then the government has in the past been willing to rethink and to make changes.</para><para>It needs to be recognised, I believe, that the provisions of this bill relating to guilt by association do come at a high cost to our society. Any legislation creating an offence which has as its first leg a mere association with someone who is a member of a proscribed terrorist organisation, which criminalises free speech and which impedes questioning and debate of some government decisions once they are made, ought at the very least to make a very significant contribution to our national safety and security in order to be justifiable.</para><para>I do not think that the proposed offence of association does make such a contribution. Imprisoning someone for three years—someone who had no intention of assisting in a terrorist act, no intention to pursue illegal actions or purposes and whose behaviour would have been entirely permissible, had there been no meeting with a promoter, member or director of a proscribed organisation—is a most extreme case of guilt by association. I earnestly hope that the Attorney-General will consider the issues that have been raised in the course of this debate, and I know that he will, particularly in the context of the fact that this bill will apparently be the subject of public consultation and referral to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>31699</page.no><name role="metadata">Hunt, Gregory, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HUNT</name><name.id>00AMV</name.id><electorate>Flinders</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In rising to address the <inline ref="R2107">Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2004</inline> I note that it comes within a context of two things. Firstly, it comes within the context of a type of threat which is different to that which we in the West have faced over the last half century—it is a very different type of threat. Secondly, it comes within the context of the reason we face that threat, and we face that threat because of the very nature of who we are, what we believe in and how we practice that—that is, we are free societies that believe in free speech, freedom of movement and the basic freedoms of belief. So there is always a difficult and careful balance in protecting against the threat of those who would seek to destroy those societies while at the same time managing to protect the freedoms which are the very essence of what we are and the very essence of what those who would seek to cause havoc wish to destroy.</para></talk.start><para>I want to put this bill, which I believe balances those challenges, in its historic context, to understand the magnitude of the threat we face today. I do not want to overstate that threat. I want to put it in the context of what we have seen in the last century. The history of the 20th century has perhaps been characterised above all else by a combination of dynamism on the scientific, social and economic fronts, against a series of threats which have been existential in their nature. There have been three great existential threats which we have had to face, as a society, as a set of beliefs and as Western civilisation over the last three-quarters of a century.</para><para>The first of those existential threats was posed by fascism. In essence, it was state sponsored racism combined with the most virulent militarism. It was a totalitarian ideology that attempted to conquer by force and to impose itself, and it did not shirk from exterminating not just individuals but entire peoples. The catastrophe which came about in the form of the Second World War witnessed over 40 million immediate deaths. There were 40 million souls who perished. Their lives were extinguished as a consequence of that ideology. It was defeated, but it was defeated at an enormous cost. It was defeated after repeated warnings by many throughout the 1930s that we had to take steps to deal both with the idea and with the force which was backing it.</para><para>The second of the great existential threats was in the form of aggressive militaristic nationalism, something which we saw in the First World War and—perhaps most notably from Australia's perspective—in the aggressive militaristic nationalistic regime which governed Japan's actions in China and in the Pacific during the course of the Second World War. This was a threat which Australia faced directly, and it was a threat which came from an ideology that equated nationalism and the superiority of a particular nation with the right to use force, with the right to conquer territory and with the right to exterminate freedoms in other societies—and even with the right to exterminate the very notion of those societies throughout Asia. Again, that was defeated. Unfortunately, it took the terrible cost and consequence of war to do so.</para><para>The third of the great existential threats which precede this bill and give it context is communism. The very nature of communism during the 20th century was, firstly, an absolute belief in the idea, secondly, that there could be no brooking of dissent to that idea, thirdly, that it would impose a notional absolute equality through absolute force and, fourthly, that it would seek to spread itself through the use of violence as a constructive force, under the mistaken and tragically false notion that it would assist human progress. For the most part, this force was defeated through resistance, recognition of the threat and acting early to prevent a repeat of the tragedies that befell the world through fascism and nationalism. Whilst those who suffered under the yoke of communism suffered an extraordinary burden, the existential clash, which perhaps could have manifested itself in a nuclear exchange, thankfully for all of us did not come to pass. The system was confronted, the idea was defeated and it collapsed under its own weight. There has been an extraordinary transformation, with only four societies still notionally adhering to that belief. </para><para>Where does that leave us today? I do not want to overstate what we face. I do not think that as a Western civilisation we face an existential threat, but I do believe that terrorism, in the form of a civil war raging within the Islamic world, brings us today a dangerous and corrosive threat. It represents the capacity of extremism to spread across the globe, to have an impact on individual societies, to try to cut away at their leadership or to wreak havoc amongst their population while at the same time trying to force them to diminish their own freedoms and decrease their own rights. That is the notion that we face today in looking at the threats which Australia—along with all of the other countries of not just the Western world, or the developed world, but also the Islamic world—has to address.</para><para>Let me try to explain this threat, because it underpins fundamentally the steps we take in this Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 2). Al-Qaeda's philosophy is simple: it is the idea of a Taliban style world with an absolutely extremist form of Islam—which is nothing more than a perversion of the beauty of that religion—and a 100-year vision or time frame. It is expansionist, callous and uncaring. That is in no way a reflection on Islam; above all else, it is an attack on the great religion of Islam. It is a direct and frontal assault on elements of that religion which, in many ways, represent some of the best things in the different religions in the world. With the growth of the al-Qaeda movement, which had a base in Afghanistan and manifested itself in the Taliban regime, we see an expansionary, violent force. (<inline font-style="italic">Quorum formed)</inline></para><para>The 30-year goal of al-Qaeda is simple: its strategic objective is to take the four largest Islamic countries—Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Indonesia—and create chaos, drive out any international connections, break down the leadership and either cause the country to fragment or bring about a regime change and slip into the vacuum. That is the goal of al-Qaeda. That is what it seeks to achieve. In pursuit of the 100-year vision it has a very clear 30-year strategic vision. We see this in al-Qaeda's activities in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Indonesia. As neighbours on the doorstep of Indonesia, we have witnessed tragic violence on our own people, on our own youth.</para><para>Then, beyond just the strategic step, we see that there is the nightmare possibility of terrorism, and this is why the bill that the Attorney has introduced carries such weight and such importance. The nightmare possibility we know, not just from interviews with people from al-Qaeda, but from their documentation, from their publications and from every element that we have discovered about them, is that they still aggressively seek to obtain some form of chemical, biological or, worse, dirty bomb capability—and they will use it. The nature of their attacks has been to use incendiary devices in crowded populations to bring about maximum human death and suffering. It is clever and utterly amoral activity. There is no concern other than to bring about human pain and suffering. So, if by any chance they are able to obtain access to chemical, biological or dirty bomb capabilities, they will use them. </para><para>As I predicted in the House a year ago, our Western cities are at risk. At that time I predicted that a Spanish city was at risk. Similarly, cities in the UK, France, Germany, the United States and closer to home are all at risk. Tragically, we saw in Spain that this prediction was accurate. It is a threat which we will continue to face during the course of our lives. That threat is there, and it must be confronted on two fronts. Firstly, it must be confronted in Afghanistan and the Middle East; and, secondly, within Iraq. These are staging posts. These are home bases for such activities. In Afghanistan, we have seen that the nations of the world combine to help drive the Taliban regime from being in control of that country. It had both an enormous human rights consequence, and it had an incredible role as a platform for the actions which occurred on September 11. So we have a responsibility to deal with a society such as that which occurred under the Taliban. We have a responsibility to rid the world of a platform at a state based level for a group such as al-Qaeda.</para><para>Secondly, in Iraq—the second great front; they are inseparable in terms of the action—we saw a society which was not only unparalleled in its abuse of human rights and in the savagery that it had carried out against its own people over the last decade, but which had also used and applied chemical and biological weapons against its own people and against its neighbours. Without a doubt, no matter what the other debates are, it was also working to develop new programs for chemical and biological weapons—and it had connections with a series of groups. Whether it was the Mujaheddin-e Khalq, the PLF, the Abu Nidal organisation or other terrorist organisations, the combination of chemical programs and terrorist organisations was there. History will tell whether or not there was a link with al-Qaeda, but we do not need to assert that. What we saw was an abusive regime and, in addition to that, an extraordinarily violent regime which was willing to use force, which was developing chemical and biological weapons, and which, without question, had links with all of those organisations that I have outlined. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline></para><para>What we are witnessing in Iraq today is an attempt by these very same people to undermine the prospect of a free society through bombings, through executions, through the attempt to create general chaos and inspire fear in those who would place themselves in harm's way, and through the systematic killing of leaders. That is what we have to fight against because it threatens to spread. The consequences of failure on the international front and here in Australia are significant. So we have to use hard power to respond and we also have to use soft power. We will not win unless there is a triumph of ideas. We will not win unless we are able to provide development. We will not win unless people are able to understand that we bring education and empowerment. We believe in the freedom of those countries in the Middle East. We believe in the validity of moderate Islam, and this bill is part of that. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>31702</page.no><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name><name.id>0J4</name.id><electorate>Berowra</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Attorney-General</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank the honourable members for Barton, Wentworth, Calare, Kooyong and Flinders for their contributions in this debate. I will endeavour to deal with the points raised, and constructively, because it is important to recognise that this bill is a further contribution to the development and consolidation of counter-terrorism laws that are essential to deal with the scourge of terrorism that we are confronted with—and we need to deal with it in a determined way. </para></talk.start><para>The <inline ref="R2107">Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2004</inline> reflects the reality that, in achieving justice, the safety and integrity of our society and its institutions must be ensured. Security is not an anathema to freedom and liberties. I might say, if you read the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, it gives primacy, amongst other matters, to the responsibility of governments to secure a person's right to life—a person's entitlement to live in a situation of safety and security. Of course that has to be weighed up with the other values that we see as important, but I often like to point out to people that the right to life and safety often restricts where we can go. We do not allow people to drive on the same side of the road in different directions, because we know that to give people a freedom of choice about where they might go on the road could in fact lead to the loss of life.</para><para>In this bill we are dealing with people's right to association. The right to association is very important, and it is a freedom. But, if that freedom of association leads to some people being able to come together for the purpose of undertaking the support of a terrorist organisation, you have to weigh up whether or not that freedom of association is appropriate in that instance. It is important—and I am not sure that honourable members often understand this—that the nature of our laws dealing with terrorism at the moment deal essentially with the planning of a terrorist act. That is the principal range of offences. Whether you look at raising money, at training or at membership, it is in relation to an organisation that is planning a terrorist act.</para><para>We now recognise that there are terrorist organisations about which we might not necessarily be able to prove that they are planning a terrorist act here or further afield, but they are nevertheless proscribed terrorist organisations. It is a question of whether or not people coming together and associating with organisations that are involved in those sorts of activities are giving succour and support to them—helping them to grow—so that they can further their aims.</para><para>It is in that context that we are seeking to create a new offence. It is a difficult offence—I recognise that. It is an issue that is being looked at not only here but abroad in, for instance, the United Kingdom, where they have perhaps not the same level of knowledge about the nature of the people in their own society because they have much more open borders than we have. They nevertheless are very conscious that they have people who can be coming together, associating and creating for them an enormous sense of vulnerability. It is in that situation where I saw a need—and my colleagues concur in relation to this and the government is bringing forward legislation—to create a new offence. It is not an offence that carries the same level of penalty as many of the other terrorist offences, but it complements those that we have.</para><para>I think it is important that people recognise that, as we continue to deal with the war on terror, security is absolutely an essential component in order to protect our rights and freedoms. And this is being done in accordance with the right that we often support—the right to the rule of law and the protection of the rule of law. What we are seeking to do is to legislate—a democratically elected government legislating properly to provide for the security of its own people. That is what this bill seeks to achieve. I thank the honourable member for Flinders because I think in his very balanced presentation today he brought out the nature of the threat that we are facing and those matters that we need to deal with. </para><para>The fact is that terrorist organisations do depend upon contact and integration with communities in order to survive and expand. This bill seeks to cut off this source of support from the organisations that engage in acts of terror from behind the veil of the broader community by making illegal association through which that support is gained. The bill also recognises the continuing risk a person in custody may pose to Australia's security. Where a security risk exists, the bill will enable the transfer between states for federal, state and territory prisoners and remand prisoners. Security transfer orders will be necessary and will involve a balancing of the interests of the administration of justice, as well as the prisoner's welfare, against the interests of security. These amendments are necessary to ensure that any threat to our security can be managed wherever it arises.</para><para>I understand this bill has already been referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. Obviously I will receive the views of the committee in relation to these important matters within their timing, but I would encourage them to deal with these issues as matters of urgency. </para><para>I will be moving amendments to remove the provisions of this bill dealing with foreign travel documents, persons in relation to whom ASIO has questioning warrants or warrants are being sought and forensic procedures. These measures are now the subject of a separate bill, the <inline ref="R2124">Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 3) 2004</inline>, which I introduced and dealt with yesterday. The purpose of excising those amendments is to ensure that these very important matters are processed to enactment in as timely a manner as possible. I do hope that I can have the cooperation of the opposition in relation to the range of matters included in the Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 3) 2004. I think they are of a relatively uncontroversial nature. I would expect the amendments in Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 3) 2004 to be passed without delay of protracted debate. For nearly three years the Australian government has worked tirelessly in reviewing and developing the arrangements in response to the modern threat to make sure that all that can be done is done and as quickly as possible. I am pleased with what we have achieved so far but we are continuing to identify those areas in which our laws require refinement and more comprehensive treatment and to act without hesitation to ensure that where we have identified weaknesses they are dealt with.</para><para>I will take up a number of the points made by my colleagues. The member for Barton raised particularly the issue of transfer of prisoners and asked why the states were not consulted. As I understand it, the states in fact expressed to us a desire about the need to transfer prisoners on security grounds, and it was on the basis that we wanted to be able to respond as quickly as possible to their urging that we brought this legislation forward. The amendments cover prisoners or remand prisoners who have been convicted or charged with Commonwealth, state or territory offences. The Australian government has responsibility for security issues. The definition of `security' is the same as contained in the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act and includes protection of the Commonwealth, states and territories from politically motivated violence. We think it is vital that federal agencies such as the Australian Federal Police and ASIO are consulted in such transfers and that the agencies which would have intelligence that might directly or indirectly affect a transfer can have those matters brought to the notice of the Commonwealth Attorney.  </para><para>We certainly do not want these matters, particularly the procedures, to deny a rapid dealing with these issues. The amendments require that a security transfer order must be made in writing. That enables the Attorney to consider all available advice. The consent in writing is also required from the sending or receiving state or territory minister except where a remand prisoner is transferred from trial. There is a need to record the decision due to the impact these orders can have on a prisoner or remand prisoner. I am confident that where urgent transfer orders are required it will be possible to deal with those issues quickly. Effective administrative procedures will be developed in consultation with the states and territories to achieve that outcome. I simply make the point that we were wanting to deal with this issue quickly. We believe that we can accommodate state wishes. Obviously we would welcome their communicating with us, as they did initially, any concerns that they have. But we see a need for urgency in relation to this.</para><para>The member for Wentworth expressed the need for clarity in drafting and said that the elements might be difficult to prove in relation to this matter. I think that is right and I think it is important to recognise what those elements are, because, in relation to the association offence, I think it is going to be very difficult to achieve a successful prosecution. The member for Kooyong was suggesting that it might be relatively easy. But, when you look at what is contained in schedule 3, adding to the end of subdivision B of division 102 of the Criminal Code a new section 102.8, associating with terrorist organisations, to commit an offence a person on two or more occasions must intentionally associate with another person who is a member of, or a person who promotes or directs the activities of, a terrorist organisation. The person must know that the organisation is a terrorist organisation and he must know that the association provides support to that organisation. The person must intend that that support assist the organisation to expand or continue to exist, and the person must know that the other person is a member of, or a person who promotes or directs the activities of, that organisation. Those elements of knowledge that the Crown must prove are very considerable, and I simply say to the member for Calare and the member for Kooyong that the Director of Public Prosecutions in this country takes his role very seriously. He sees it as being important not to pursue matters frivolously but to do so where there are substantial issues and where the evidence exists to sustain the particular conviction.</para><para>The member for Wentworth was concerned that in relation to these matters we should make it very clear that there is no intention for our terrorism laws to target any religious, social or political group within our community. I want to make it clear that this legislation is not seeking to target such groups. The legislation is squarely aimed at those people whose activities or intentions expose our community or our population to serious risk, the risk of terrorism. That is why we have been careful to craft the legislation to include objective criteria and appropriate safeguards. We want to ensure that only those people who intend to commit a terrorist act or be a member of or train or otherwise associate with a terrorist organisation are punished in accordance with law. I know that members of the Muslim community are as concerned about terrorist activities as anybody else. Moderate Muslims have been very adversely affected by terrorism in ways which I regard as being abhorrent. Terrorists have hijacked and killed peace-loving people within our regions many of whom were Muslims.  </para><para>I think it is important to recognise that, as far as this matter is concerned, the government will continue to make clear its intention. It will make it clear that, in relation to the freedoms of religion and association that our society respects, we do not want to see people vilified in any way because of their religion or their associations. But, where we are dealing with terrorists, terrorist organisations and the promotion of those, we see those matters as very different. </para><para>The member for Calare raised some issues in relation to travel documents. I simply make the point that there is no intention to adversely impact upon people who are refugees. We recognise that those who are in Australia and have claims that they have a need for protection should be able to bring those forward. However, we certainly do want to deal with people who are involved in obtaining travel documentation inappropriately, whether it is Australian travel documentation or travel documentation of any other country. These provisions are to deal with that. But I am sure that, in relation to those who are making asylum claims legitimately because they are refugees, regard would be had to our obligations in relation to the refugee convention where those people are involved.</para><para>The member for Kooyong acknowledged the need for balance in relation to the matters that we are dealing with, and I reinforce that. The member for Kooyong is always very eloquent in the way in which he expresses his views. Noting the purpose of the legislation that was earlier dealt with as well as this legislation, of course, the objective here, as before, is to investigate, deter and, if necessary, punish the most offensive crime of terrorism without compromising the core values which we hold most dear—that is, the rule of law, the separation of powers and, above all, democracy. That is why we must ensure that our offences are crafted in a way that set clear and objective criteria. A person cannot innocently commit a terrorism offence. They must possess the requisite intention. In the case of the proposed association offence, that intention, as I outlined earlier, is the intention of providing support to assist a terrorist organisation to expand or continue to exist.</para><para>In developing the legislation, my department has considered the types of scenarios set out by the member for Kooyong in order to prevent a case where a person such as a journalist is inadvertently caught by this offence. To avoid that situation, the criteria were carefully crafted and appropriate exemptions were put in place. A person must intentionally associate with a member of a terrorist organisation. A person must know that the organisation is a terrorist organisation. A person must intend that support to assist the organisation to expand and continue to exist. Simply sharing a podium with a member of a terrorist organisation would not be sufficient to satisfy the criteria.</para><para>The member for Kooyong set out the exceptions that might apply in relation to an association offence. Again, this is a safeguard designed to make clear the circumstances that this legislation is intended not to capture. It is not intended to apply to a mother who provides a son with meals or free rent in a home, even if a son is a member of a terrorist organisation. It is not intended to apply to a journalist who simply reports the activities of a terrorist organisation after meeting with a member of an organisation for the purposes of educating himself or informing the public. It is not intended to apply to humanitarian workers such as doctors who provide medical assistance to people who may be injured.</para><para>I simply make these points because I think it is important to recognise that we have endeavoured to provide that balance. That does not mean to say that I will not look at any suggestions that come forward for amendments. I think I have demonstrated time and again that I am prepared to respond to sensible comments and, where they are made, to take them into account. But I certainly do not want to see a situation where the willingness to do that unduly extends the time for debate and discussion so that important reforms dealing with terrorist issues are unreasonably delayed. I commend the bill to House. </para><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read as second time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration in Detail</title><page.no>31706</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill—by leave—taken as a whole.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>31706</page.no><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name><name.id>0J4</name.id><electorate>Berowra</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Attorney-General</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I move amendments Nos (2), (3), (5) and (6):</para></talk.start><quote><para>(2)	Clause 2, page 2 (table item 2), omit the table item.</para><para>(3)	Clause 2, page 2 (table item 3), omit the table item.</para><para>(5)	Schedule 1, page 4 (line 1) to page 18 (line 16), omit the Schedule.</para><para>(6)	Schedule 2, page 19 (line 1) to page 21 (line 20), omit the Schedule.</para></quote></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>31706</page.no><name role="metadata">McClelland, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McCLELLAND</name><name.id>JK6</name.id><electorate>Barton</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The opposition opposes these amendments. If I can give some background: on Tuesday of this week we wrote to the Attorney-General offering to pass as separate and distinct legislation those provisions contained in the bill as currently drafted relating to forensic procedures. The Attorney-General responded on Thursday by introducing a separate bill, the <inline ref="R2124">Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 3) 2004</inline>, which contained not only those forensic procedural matters but also those matters relating to foreign travel documents and ASIO questioning warrants, as described in these amendments as circulated. The reason we object to other than the forensic procedures being removed from the bill is that, as I have indicated to the Attorney-General, we believe that there are issues of substance in respect of the provisions dealing with foreign travel documents—and, in particular, ASIO questioning warrants—that justify appropriate consideration by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee. We believe that, wherever you are dealing with the creation of offences which, of necessity, potentially impact on civil rights—some carrying jail sentences of two years and some carrying jail sentences of five years—it is appropriate that the legislation be scrutinised, preferably by an appropriate legislative committee, in this case the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, or at least by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills.</para></talk.start><para>I am concerned that if we remove these provisions from this bill it will prevent the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee from undertaking deliberations in respect of those matters. On that basis we believe those provisions should remain in this bill, which would be supported through the House of Representatives by us, and instead only those provisions relating to forensic procedures should be excised. We have indicated that it would then be a matter of amending the <inline ref="R2124">Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 3) 2004</inline> to restrict the bill to those matters relating to forensic procedures. We would then pass that bill expeditiously, as has been offered. I think that if a terrorist event occurred in Australia—of course we all hope and pray it will not—that legislation should be passed.</para><para>I apologise to the clerks for the language I used when I found out that these amendments had been brought in by the Attorney-General, which meant that the amendments had not been notified to me. That has placed me in a somewhat difficult position which I believe has also caused the clerks some embarrassment. While my language was unparliamentary, it was off the record. I now apologise to the clerks for my annoyance and put that on the record. It is for these reasons that I think these provisions relating to foreign travel documents and ASIO questioning warrants should remain in the legislation but agree with the forensic procedures issues being taken out. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>31707</page.no><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name><name.id>0J4</name.id><electorate>Berowra</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Attorney-General</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am not sure what the honourable member is referring to. If I have in any way been complicit I apologise. I wanted him to be fully appraised of what we were seeking to do. I am surprised that the member for Barton would express himself in ways he thinks might be unparliamentary. I have never heard anything like that from him. I find it impossible to believe. I thought he was one of the exceptions in the Labor Party. I listened very carefully to the debate in relation to these matters, and I could not see where substantive arguments were advanced that require further committee review. The point of concern for me has been that we have a situation where people are restricted in leaving Australia on their own Australian passport but, particularly now that we have dual citizenship, may continue to hold or apply for a valid passport from another country, from which they could then seek to travel to Australia. Our view is that, in a situation where an Australian passport has been withheld to ensure that somebody cannot leave, we ought not to leave the opportunity open for another. I think it is a matter that ought to be dealt with quickly. When a matter was brought to my attention it was the reason I brought it forward in the legislation. It seems to me to be a matter of some moment and a significant defect in the regime that we have in place. So I would encourage the opposition to withdraw any opposition it has to this particular measure. I do not think people would see it as being unreasonable and I have not heard it pointed out where there are substantial unintended consequences that might have emerged through some fault in relation to the drafting.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>31708</page.no><name role="metadata">McClelland, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McCLELLAND</name><name.id>JK6</name.id><electorate>Barton</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Very briefly, what the Attorney-General has said has substance in terms of the purpose and intent of these provisions. On the face of it, they seem to be appropriate insofar as they treat foreign passports and travel documents—akin to the treatment we provide in respect of Australian passports and documents. The matters in respect of ASIO's powers to seek a questioning warrant have, by their nature, been controversial. Quite frankly, the difficulty is that we received a briefing on these matters last Thursday evening. There was an issue we acknowledged in respect of Willy Brigitte and a fellow called Lohdi, as I recall, who was Pakistani—he held both an Australian and a Pakistani passport. His Australian passport was confiscated, and I understand that his Pakistani passport was confiscated by the Pakistani consul general in Australia—an action which I understand is the subject of a legal challenge by Lohdi.</para></talk.start><para>Obviously, it is desirable to clarify the laws, but we have been on notice for some weeks, if not months, that that issue has been in existence, and the government has not demonstrated a pressing urgency in respect of these matters that would warrant departure from an appropriate consideration or scrutiny of legislation that is, after all, imposing terms of imprisonment of two years and five years. We are saying, as a matter of principle, that that sort of legislation should be the subject of appropriate scrutiny. Indeed, we acted even before the bill came into the House to refer it to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee for report back before the parliament resumes. That is an appropriate course of action. We all know that an election may well be in the wings and may occur before that time, but we cannot allow that possibility to make us depart from what I think is the sound practice of having these sorts of measures scrutinised by an appropriate committee. I thought the member for Kooyong made an excellent speech before in terms of the need to tread cautiously. </para><para>That is essentially the reason the opposition thinks these measures should remain in the bill. The measures could then be supported and passed by the opposition in the House of Representatives. That is essentially the reasoning. The purpose then is to enable a separate bill—Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 3)—which would then be amended to refer to the forensic procedures only, to be passed immediately. That seems to us to have the best of both worlds—having those measures advised by Tom Sherman AO as being urgent passed before the House rises, while having those measures remaining to be considered by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee before we next resume. That seems to us to be a commonsense position which should easily be accommodated.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>31708</page.no><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name><name.id>0J4</name.id><electorate>Berowra</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Attorney-General</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I move government amendments (4) and (7) together as circulated:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(4)	Clause 2, page 2 (table items 6 and 7), omit the table items.</para><para>(7)	Schedule 5, page 33 (line 1) to page 34 (line 26), omit the Schedule.</para></quote></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>31708</page.no><name role="metadata">McClelland, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McCLELLAND</name><name.id>JK6</name.id><electorate>Barton</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I again indicate very briefly that we accept these amendments.

This is very important legislation. It is legislation that was broadly supported by both sides of the House, and this bill, as amended, will assist Customs to strengthen border security and at the same time protect the rights of individuals who may be detained under these provisions. The amendments provide for a relative or friend to be notified of a person's detention, if the period of detention exceeds 45 minutes, or upon request, in the case of a minor. Importantly, there are protections here that will allow a Customs officer to prevent another person being notified, if the officer believes, on reasonable grounds, that the notification should not occur, to safeguard the process of law enforcement or protect the life and safety of any person. The amendments also ensure that the CEO of Customs will make directions in relation to suitable places of detention and other matters that the CEO considers appropriate. I commend the amendments to the House. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—The question is that the amendments be agreed to.</para></talk.start><para>Question agreed to.</para></interjection></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>SUPERANNUATION BUDGET MEASURES BILL 2004</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>31711</page.no><id.no>R2048</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration of Senate Message</title><page.no>31711</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Message received from the Senate returning the bill and acquainting the House that the Senate does not insist on its amendments disagreed to by the House and requests the concurrence of the House on amendments made in place of those amendments.</para><para>Ordered that the amendments be considered forthwith.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Senate's amendments—</inline></para><quote><para>(1)	Schedule 2, item 1, page 5 (line 12), omit “—10%; and”, substitute “and later financial years—10%.”.</para><para>(2)	Schedule 2, item 1, page 5 (lines 13 and 14), omit paragraph (d) of the definition of <inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">maximum surcharge percentage</inline>.</para><para>(3)	Schedule 2, item 2, page 5 (line 24), omit “—10%; and”, substitute “and later financial years—10%.”.</para><para>(4)	Schedule 2, item 2, page 5 (lines 25 and 26), omit paragraph (d) of the definition of <inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">maximum surcharge percentage</inline>.</para><para>(5)	Schedule 2, item 3, page 6 (line 5), omit “—10%; and”, substitute “and later financial years—10%.”.</para><para>(6)	Schedule 2, item 3, page 6 (lines 6 and 7), omit paragraph (d) of the definition of <inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">maximum surcharge percentage</inline>.</para><para>(7)	Schedule 2, item 4, page 7 (lines 10 to 15), omit paragraphs (d) and (e), substitute:</para></quote><para>	(d)	10% of the employer-financed component of any part of the benefits payable to the member that accrued after 30 June 2005.</para><quote><para>(8)	Schedule 2, item 5, page 7 (lines 22 to 27), omit paragraphs (d) and (e), substitute:</para></quote><para>	(d)	10% of the employer-financed component of any part of the benefits payable to the person that accrued after 30 June 2005.</para><quote><para>(9)	Schedule 2, item 6, page 8 (lines 4 to 9), omit paragraphs (d) and (e), substitute:</para></quote><para>	(d)	10% of the employer-financed component of any part of the benefits payable to the person that accrued after 30 June 2005.</para><quote><para>(10)	Schedule 2, item 7, page 8 (lines 17 to 22), omit paragraphs (d) and (e), substitute:</para></quote><para>	(d)	10% of the employer-financed component of any part of the benefits payable to the member that accrued after 30 June 2005.</para><quote><para>(11)	Schedule 2, item 8, page 8 (line 31) to page 9 (line 3), omit subparagraphs (iv) and (v), substitute:</para></quote><para>	(iv)	10% of the employer-financed component of any part of the benefits payable to the member that accrued after 30 June 2005.</para><quote><para>(12)	Schedule 2, item 9, page 9 (lines 10 to 17), omit subparagraphs (iv) and (v), substitute:</para></quote><para>	(iv)	10% of the employer-financed component of any part of the benefits that would have been payable to the member but for the payment split and that accrued after 30 June 2005.</para><quote><para>(13)	Schedule 2, item 10, page 9 (lines 25 to 34), omit subparagraphs (iv) and (v), substitute:</para></quote><para>	(iv)	10% of the employer-financed component of any part of the value of the age retirement benefits of the member when the fund ceased to be a constitutionally protected superannuation fund that accrued after 30 June 2005. </para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>31712</page.no><name role="metadata">Cameron, Ross, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ROSS CAMERON</name><name.id>3K6</name.id><electorate>Parramatta</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the amendments made by the Senate in place of the amendments disagreed to by the House be agreed to.</para></motion><para>The government has taken prompt action to correct an unintended consequence of an amendment to the <inline ref="R2048">Superannuation Budget Measures Bill 2004</inline> debated in the Senate last night and moved by Independent Senator Shayne Murphy. The amendment intended to reduce the superannuation surcharge to 10 per cent in 2006-07, as opposed to the government's proposal to reduce the surcharge to 7.5 per cent in 2006-07. An error in the drafting of the amendment unintentionally removed the superannuation surcharge completely after 2006-07.</para><para>The government has not sought to take advantage of this error and has put in place steps to allow Senator Murphy to correct his amendment. I note that a political opportunity has been taken by Senator Sherry and Mr Crean this afternoon in relation to this issue. They have been accusing the Treasurer, who had no involvement in the Senate last night, of being responsible for the error. What an extraordinary claim. Senator Nick Sherry's baseless criticisms are a bit rich, considering that he was not present during the debate on the most significant incentives for Australians to contribute to superannuation since the superannuation guarantee was introduced. These incentives will have the effect of injecting approximately $2.1 billion into the superannuation funds of ordinary Australian workers who are doing the right thing and making voluntary contributions in order to save for their retirement. Labor voted against allowing six million low- and middle-income earners in Australia to access the government's co-contribution.</para><para>Senator Sherry made three spectacular goofs this week. In the debate on the choice bill he moved amendments that would have abolished superannuation entitlements for employees working in small business. Another amendment sought to cap fees and charges in a tax bill, a proposal that was unconstitutional. Those goofs were closely followed by a third, when he moved an amendment to change the start date for a measure relating to earnings bases and ordinary times earnings. Senator Sherry's first attempt at an amendment to achieve this would have had no effect on the application date.</para><para>Senator Murphy's error was picked up by Senator Coonan's office and contact was made first thing this morning with opposition senators. I note that the error was not picked up by anyone else. It seems that Labor was asleep at the wheel. It was the member for Hotham's office that subsequently called Senator Coonan's office this morning—after the senator's office had alerted people to the error—to offer whatever assistance might be needed to remedy the problem with the Senate amendment. </para><para>As I said earlier, the government, with its characteristic good grace, has sought not to take advantage of this error. The Howard government is a responsible government. In fact, the Howard government thought long and hard about whether to give Senator Murphy the opportunity to put his amendments again. Fiscally, the government can afford the sorts of outcomes that Senator Murphy's flawed amendments would have created. The government, of course, has a long track record of reducing taxes on the Australian people, and this measure would have continued its work in that vein. The government, however, identified the issue and recognised a failure of intention in the Senate. This is more than Labor did. We have taken the appropriate steps to allow Senator Murphy to correct his amendment, and the government will support his new amendment. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>31713</page.no><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name><name.id>DT4</name.id><electorate>Hotham</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Labor Party opposes the <inline ref="R2048">Superannuation Budget Measures Bill 2004</inline>, which has come back from the Senate, and the way in which the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration presented the humiliating backdown that the Treasurer was forced into. It has been a long week but even the Leader of the House in this place could not hide his mirth at the explanation we just heard.</para></talk.start><para>This is a bill that proposes changes to superannuation on two fronts. First, it proposes a reduction in the super surcharge. Labor is opposed to a reduction in the surcharge. The reason we are opposed to a reduction in the surcharge tax is that only four per cent of recipients benefit from any reduction. Labor takes the view that every person in receipt of superannuation contributions should get a tax cut. That is why we have put forward a reduction in tax from 15 per cent to 13 per cent for all wage earners. That is a fair tax cut—without the narrowness and the focus just at the top end of this government's approach.</para><para>The parliamentary secretary who just spoke tried to blame this on Shayne Murphy, but it was the government of the day that put forward the amendments that we had to fix the mess on today. The government effectively abolished the surcharge by the amendment that was agreed to in the Senate last night. Do not come in here and tell us that the government can afford the abolition of the surcharge. It costs, in terms of the forward estimates, $2.3 billion. Where is the $2.3 billion that it says it can afford? We still have not seen how this government has funded the $1.3 billion that has been spent since the budget, and now it tells us it really could afford an abolition of the superannuation surcharge. That defies belief. This is a government that makes it up. It mucks it up and then it makes it up.</para><para>Obviously, we were opposed to what was done in the Senate last night—but do not blame Senator Murphy. This happened on the Treasurer's watch. That is what happened. The Treasurer was happy to have a go at Senator Sherry and accuse him of a super blooper, which did not happen, but the Treasurer hides and denies any involvement in his own mammoth super blooper, although its cost to the budget would be $1.2 billion a year—$2.3 billion over the forward estimates and $12 billion over the 10-year time frame that the Howard government likes to talk about. This is a monumental muck-up by the Treasurer, but where is he? He should come in here and offer a mea culpa. He goes out and smears Senator Sherry, but he will not own up to his own incompetence and ineptitude.</para><para>The other part of this bill goes to the question of the co-contribution. Labor have said that we believe that the government's measures in terms of encouraging low-income earners into superannuation are badly targeted. I heard the parliamentary secretary mention that there were six million potential recipients. When the Treasurer introduced the previous co-contribution measure, he said it would benefit one million people—not six million but one million. Again the parliamentary secretary is simply making it up as he goes along. It is very interesting that in Senate estimates last October Senator Coonan indicated that there were only 540,000 people estimated to receive that co-contribution. Either Senator Coonan is right or the Treasurer is right but, if the Treasurer is right, the forward estimates are wrong. They understate the cost of this measure, because Senator Coonan has said in Senate estimates that the cost is based on 540,000 potential recipients. So the parliamentary secretary is grossly exaggerating when he comes in here and talks about six million beneficiaries. The Treasurer has stated that the figure would be one million, which is more than double the estimates, according to forward estimates. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted) </inline></para><para>I will not take much longer, but these issues are terribly important, because this government are mucking up on the run. This government are not really focusing on where the real need is in addressing superannuation. Their tax cuts are only targeted at the top four per cent and the assertion that the co-contribution benefits low-income earners is simply not being borne out by the facts. The take-up that was asserted by the government is not happening, and now what we have is a change in the legislation. Whereas previously people could only benefit from the $1,000 match up if they were in excess of $450 a week and in receipt of the SGC—the super guarantee payment—now the definition has been changed, such that anyone can get this contribution if only 10 per cent of their taxable income is earned. This is not a measure targeted at low-income earners; this is a measure designed to benefit the spouses of high single income individuals. We believe that is the wrong targeting. We wanted to get further information in relation to this co-contribution, and the government denied it to us in the Senate estimates. That is why we are opposed to this dimension. We are not opposed to genuine superannuation reform that benefits people on low incomes and encourages greater adequacy for all in the work force, but the government's measures do not do that. That is why we say that both aspects of this bill are not in the appropriate direction. We oppose them. We want further information about the co-contribution.</para><para>In conclusion, going back to who is to blame, I understand that the government is trying to run around and privately blame Senator Murphy for the muck-up that occurred in the Senate yesterday. We understand that the Treasurer, Treasury and Senator Coonan signed off on the amendments last night. This was all their work, as we understand it. If they deny that it was their work, what were they doing? They were the ones responsible for considering amendments. They had the responsibility for dealing with this in the parliament. What we have is another classic example of blame shift. We have the government acting on the run—they mucked it up, got themselves into trouble and, rather than coming in here and admitting openly that they mucked it up, they have been denigrating other good people who know more about superannuation than the Treasurer and Senator Coonan will ever know. They also sought to denigrate them on previous occasions and then hid, when they were culpable for massive incompetence and massive muck-ups in their own superannuation amendments.</para><para>The Labor Party is opposed to these amendments and only Labor in government will really do something that advances superannuation for the whole work force—not just the top four per cent but the whole work force. The only time superannuation has been advanced in this country for the whole of the work force has been when a Labor government has been in power. This is a government that has dropped the ball on superannuation. The only way we can complete the unfinished business is by achieving the return of a Labor government. Superannuation will be a major issue for us for reform in government. If the Australian people want advances in this area, they should vote for Labor, because this government has never had their superannuation interests at heart at all.</para><para>Question put: </para><motion><para>That the amendments be agreed to.</para></motion></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>18:18:00</time.stamp><para>The House divided.</para></division.header><para>(The Speaker—Mr Neil Andrew)

I have been present at three, not four, of those events.</para><para>The government are disappointed that the Australian Labor Party amendments to the <inline ref="R2030">Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Enrolment Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2004</inline> do not go as far as the government would like. We are all about an open and transparent electoral system with integrity, and it is a pity that the opposition does not share our aspiration to this very important goal. It is absolutely vital that, when an election is declared and the result is known, we as a nation can be confident that the government we get are in fact the government that the people voted for. That is why this government have been quite assiduous in making sure that our electoral system has improved integrity, because we believe that the improved integrity of the electoral system is right at the heart of the democratic process.</para><para>We are disappointed that the ALP amendments do not include the alternative document provisions as recommended by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. However, one has to be aware of the realities of numbers in the parliament, and we are of the view that the amendment is a significant improvement on the current system. Quite frankly, it is easier to get on the electoral roll than it is to go out there and hire a video, which is quite an amazing situation. As a result, the government are accepting these amendments. We notice that the new identification arrangements will be reviewed after two years. I am confident that the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters will see the merit in these new arrangements. </para><para>Likewise, we are disappointed that the other place did not pass legislation that would have removed the right of all prisoners to vote. I think most Australians, including the government, are of the view that people who are incarcerated, people who have committed offences, people whom the court system has objectively put inside to serve a period of detention, ought not, while they are serving that prison term, be entitled to vote and elect the leaders of the society whose laws they have disregarded or so blatantly flouted. However, given the fact that the Australian Labor Party and the minor parties indicated that they would not be supporting this amendment, we do support the Australian Labor Party's compromise amendments on this issue, which will mean that any prisoners imprisoned for more than one electoral cycle will be denied the vote. This is a step in the right direction, but it does not go anywhere near as far as the government—and, I believe, the community as a whole—would like to see the law progressed. This is, in our view, an improvement on the current arrangement of five years.</para><para>The government is also disappointed that the Senate rejected the legislation which would have seen the rolls close the day the writs are issued for first-time voters and three days after the issue of writs for people updating their enrolment details. The Electoral Commission is flooded with enrolments and changes of enrolments whenever an election is called. It is very difficult for the Electoral Commission to exercise the same degree of scrutiny with respect to those changed or new enrolments as would be the case if the Electoral Commission were able to consider enrolments or changes of enrolments in the ordinary course of events without the extra time pressure placed on the Electoral Commission as the result of an impending election. The measure was intended to protect the integrity of the roll against the flood of over 300,000 enrolments received by the AEC in the week after an election is called. I note that the opposition was quick to label this as a cynical measure to disenfranchise voters. This was never the intention.</para><para>Regrettably, because of the opposition of the Australian Labor Party, while the electoral system for the next election will be better than what we now have, it will not be as good as the government and, I believe, the Australian people would have wished. I do commend the motion to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>31719</page.no><name role="metadata">McMullan, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McMULLAN</name><name.id>5I4</name.id><electorate>Fraser</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration says what a dubious pleasure it is to be here on a Saturday morning.

He quite clearly did not understand it. Several of the things he said the <inline ref="R2030">Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Enrolment Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2004</inline> did do it did not do, and several of the things he said it did not do it did. Let us get it clear: the Senate has prevented a great rort here. What was proposed was a shocking antidemocratic rort. The government got rolled in the Senate. They could not drum up a vote in the Senate to support the outrageous proposals they had. The bill now looks dramatically different, and it is one that we are prepared, in this form, to support. As a result of the successful Labor amendments in the Senate, the roll will not be closed early and therefore many young Australians will now have their right to vote. You do not deserve to have your right to vote impaired just because Mark Textor says most people in that cohort are not voting for the Liberals. That is not a case for affecting their right to the franchise. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Secondly, the electoral enrolment regime will be improved but it will not be made unnecessarily complicated in a manner that is clearly designed to disenfranchise the most disadvantaged in our community for whom the nature of our government is most important. Thirdly, the government's attempt to hide many political donations by raising the disclosure threshold for political donations has failed, and a number of other measures which would have made it harder for disadvantaged people to exercise their democratic right to vote have been removed. The integrity of electoral enrolment can only be assured if all Australians can easily get on the roll. If the roll is secure, electoral fraud is deterred.</para><para>We support the bipartisan measures that the Liberal and Labor members of the electoral committee supported—that all the members supported—but which the government rolled in a cynical attempt to get some partisan advantage on the eve of the election. We will not support those measures now. They would have restricted or reduced the franchise of those groups whose disadvantage makes their right to vote so important. Opposition members in the Senate have successfully defended the franchise and stopped proposals to make political parties less accountable. Therefore, we support the adoption of the amendments made in the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>31720</page.no><name role="metadata">Andren, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDREN</name><name.id>KL6</name.id><electorate>Calare</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As I pointed out in my speech in the second reading debate on the <inline ref="R2030">Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Enrolment Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2004</inline>, I too welcome the removal of the early closure of the rolls.

I understand that something like 350,000 voters would have been excluded had we gone down that path. Retaining the donation disclosure cap at $1,500 is another wise move, for the reasons I outlined earlier in my speech on the second reading. Not insisting on scrutineers to assist the disabled and the change to enrolment ID to that recommended by the parliamentary committee are very welcome.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I do have a difficulty with the provisions based on the Labor Party amendment in the Senate where there has been an ending, if you like, of the lodging or recording of names of parties that have a like name to that already in existence. As I understand it, this would mean that the terms `democratic' and `democrat' would belong to the Democrats from this day forth. Also, the Liberals for Forests would not have been registered under this process. I wonder what provision there might be for someone wanting to register `Independents' as an entity in the days and weeks ahead. I wonder too whether it might suit the government or the Labor Party if, indeed, someone had been considering setting up a party called `Labor against the free trade deal' or `Liberals against the free trade deal' as a Senate ticket in the upcoming election. That, it appears, would not get to base one and would suit the purposes of the existing system very nicely indeed. </para><para>I also understand that prisoners serving a term whose whole term coincides with an electoral cycle would not get a vote. It now depends on the length of the term they serve. It means that the Prime Minister of the day basically determines whether a person can get the vote. Currently, prisoners serving five years or more do not get a vote, and it seems that we may be denying a vote to even more prisoners. As I again pointed out in my speech on the second reading, I have had some of the most moving and passionate letters from prisoners within jails. Koori prisoners often want me to contact their people who may have come down from outback areas and want some issue attended to for their loved ones while they are incarcerated. Given the fact that something like 30 per cent of our prison population are Indigenous—and for many reasons and circumstances they have been brought to that situation—and if prisoners are contacting members of parliament who may be able to do something constructive for them, I think that is a very positive sign that they are using and respecting the system. The more we deny prisoners a vote, the more we deny them rehabilitation and the opportunity to get out of the circumstances that have brought them there. I oppose both those amendments to this legislation. I just wanted to put that on the record.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—The question is that the amendments be agreed to.</para></talk.start><para>Question agreed to.</para></interjection></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (CODIFYING CONTEMPT OFFENCES) BILL 2003</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>31721</page.no><id.no>R1839</id.no></debateinfo><para>Bill returned from the Senate with amendments.</para><para>Ordered that the amendments be considered forthwith.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Senate's amendments—</inline></para><quote><para>(1)	Clause 2, page 2 (table item 2), omit the table item, substitute:

This legislative package is one of the most significant industrial reforms in Australia since the Workplace Relations Act. On 25 March this year, I made a ministerial statement which highlighted the continuing lawlessness which pervades the building and construction industry and reaffirmed the Australian government's commitment to establishing the rule of law in this industry. This legislation is a key plank in the most significant reform of the building and construction industry ever attempted. It responds to the compelling and unassailable case for reform which was presented by the Cole royal commission. Both the Cole royal commission and the building industry task force, particularly in this report, regard these powers as essential to ensuring that the rule of law is upheld in this industry.</para><para>The <inline ref="R1839">Workplace Relations Amendment (Codifying Contempt Offences) Bill 2003</inline> means that the building industry task force will now have the essential powers to achieve real reform of the commercial building and construction industry in Australia. These new powers allow the task force to force people to provide information, to produce documents and to attend and answer questions if the task force believes that they have information relevant to an investigation. Individuals who do not cooperate face up to six months in jail or financial penalties. At last the building industry task force has the powers to tackle head-on the illegal activity, thuggery and intimidation which was clearly identified by Mr Justice Cole in his royal commission and which he found was rife in this industry. As I said, this means that those who do not obey the law in this industry, like people in every other industry in Australia are expected to, can expect to be properly dealt with. </para><para>The powers are similar to those which the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission have at the present time. Indeed, after agreement with the Democrats last night, we will model the guidelines on the ACCC guidelines that apply to the exercise of powers under section 155 of the Trade Practices Act. These guidelines will not contain additional constraints on the exercise of the coercive powers beyond those which are provided in this bill, and the government will consult with the Democrats in the formation of these guidelines. </para><para>Most people are reluctant to provide information about illegal activity in the $46 billion building and construction industry for fear of retribution. From 1 October 2002 to 31 December 2003, the task force had to drop more than one-third of its investigations because complainants were unwilling to provide information and make statements. The task force's powers were clearly inadequate. Now the task force will have the powers it needs to ensure that the rule of law is upheld in this industry, as it is expected to be upheld in every other industry in Australia. The new powers will be conferred on the Secretary of the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations and then delegated to the director of the building industry task force.  </para><para>In addition to these matters, there are a number of other important measures in this bill before the House today. Firstly, the penalties under the Workplace Relations Act are increased to $33,000 for a body corporate and $6,600 for individuals. Secondly, officials are disqualified from holding office in a registered organisation if they are convicted of a criminal offence and receive a suspended sentence. There was the case of Mr Craig Johnston in Victoria recently, who received a conviction and a suspended sentence. But for this legislation he would still be able to be an official of a union. Thirdly, there is whistleblower protection for employees of registered organisations.</para><para>Ultimately, reform of this industry will benefit all Australians. Research has shown that it will benefit and boost the Australian economy by some $2.3 billion a year. This is reform well worth pursuing. I thank in particular Senators Murray and Bartlett from the Australian Democrats for their constructive discussions over the last two months and particularly last night. I also thank the officials of my department who were involved in those discussions. I commend the amendments to House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>31735</page.no><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Dr EMERSON</name><name.id>83V</name.id><electorate>Rankin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The good news is that the Senate has prevented the passage of the vicious building and construction industry bill—the bill introduced into this parliament by the now Minister for Health and Ageing when he said: `We are going to get this building and construction industry bill through the parliament.' Minister, as always, you failed, because that legislation did not go through the parliament. That legislation was prevented by the Senate, and that is a major victory for the working men and women of Australia—and particularly the working men and women in the building and construction industry. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations referred to the ACCC. We had a debate in parliament just the other day when the minister and the government announced that there would be new provisions relating to the ACCC in the Trade Practices Act that would give businesses the opportunity to bargain collectively. Of course, this government denies the working men and women of this country the right to bargain collectively. If we come back into this place before the next election, which I doubt, why do you not put forward legislation to give the working men and women of this country the right to bargain collectively?</para></talk.start><para>The scandal of all this is that today—a Saturday at the end of a long sitting period—is the first opportunity for the House of Representatives to debate the provisions in the <inline ref="R1839">Workplace Relations Amendment (Codifying Contempt Offences) Bill 2003</inline>. These draconian, McCarthyist provisions were introduced in the Senate, and we have about 20 minutes to debate them here today. That is exactly how this government wants it. That is exactly how the government treats the parliament and its committees. The original, unamended legislation would have meant that government appointed investigators—not investigators appointed by a statutory authority but investigators appointed by the departmental secretary, who is directly answerable to the minister and who is on performance pay which will be determined by the minister—directed by the head of the department would have been able to go to any Australian who was working in the building and construction industry, ask questions and demand answers, and those people could have been punished with six months jail if answers were not given. </para><para>If it were not for the amendments that were put into the parliament last night to prevent this, and the government had had its way, government investigators would have been able to ask questions like, `Are you or have you ever been a member of a trade union? Are you or have you ever been a member of the Australian Labor Party?' If they did not answer that, they would be sent to jail. They would not even receive a financial penalty; they could be punished with up to six months in jail if they did not answer those McCarthyist questions. There were no constraints on the sorts of questions that investigators could ask. Of course, it is not just restricted to the questions that the government appointed investigators can ask, but the information that can be required of such people working within the building and construction industry extends to phone accounts, phone records, bank accounts and any other document that the investigator wants. If a working man or woman in the construction industry failed or refused to provide those documents, that would be punishable by six months in jail with no financial penalty at all. That would apply not just to someone who has done something wrong; it applies to someone who may have done nothing wrong. There may be no suspicion of this person having done anything wrong, but they may just have information about the trade union of which they may or may not be a member and the activities of that trade union, including information about whether or not they are a member of the Australian Labor Party. That was disgraceful legislation and it is a tribute to the Senate and to the Labor senators that they had the resolve to stare down this government and make sure these draconian, open-ended, McCarthyist provisions were not passed. </para><para>Senator Marshall came up with a proposal yesterday evening which has to some extent curtailed the powers that the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and the Prime Minister of this country sought. The proposal was that the scope and method of investigation of government investigators must be approved by the Senate in the form of a regulation—that is, a disallowable instrument. That means that if the guidelines for the operation of these investigators are not approved by the Senate, then any evidence gained up until the time of disallowance is useless and cannot be used. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> If they go outside those guidelines, once they are established by regulation, then any evidence gained cannot be used.</para><para>Last night, through the resolve of Labor senators, who would not buckle to the pressure of this government, at least some parliamentary scrutiny and accountability was achieved—scrutiny and accountability which this government hates, because it treats the parliament and its parliamentary committees with contempt. Through an amendment, we also ensured that there are provisions for financial penalties; otherwise, it would have been straight to jail. Go straight to jail. Do not pass go. Do not collect $200. Do not collect anything other than a jail sentence. So there are now financial penalties. However, the fact is this: as a result of the passage of this legislation, Australians working in the building and construction industry will have fewer rights than people who have information on terrorist activities. That is a disgrace. It is modern-day McCarthyism—and, of course, the minister wanted this debate stopped.</para><para>The debate on the ASIO powers in relation to terrorism spanned 12 months, and very significant protections were put in place as a result of the scrutiny of this parliament and parliamentary committees to ensure that people who may have had information relevant to terrorist activities at least had some basic civil liberties, some basic protections. That debate went for 12 months in this place—12 months—and yet the debate on this bill went for about seven hours last night in the Senate. It has never been debated in the House and yesterday the Leader of the House was saying there should be a very short debate and that Labor are filibustering because we are trying to provide some basic civil liberties for working men and women in the building and construction industry. There were 12 months of debate on the ASIO powers and seven hours debate on this. </para><para>There was another significant development yesterday. There was the appointment of a man named Jonathan Hamberger to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Who is Jonathan Hamberger? Jonathan Hamberger is the government appointed Employment Advocate who does not believe in the Industrial Relations Commission, who does not believe in collective bargaining. We know that Labor has committed to the abolition of AWAs and the abolition of the Employment Advocate. The Employment Advocate has read the writing on the wall. He said, `Oh, this is the last day of parliament. There is an election coming and Labor is going to win the election.' So off he goes to the minister and he says: `My God! Labor is going to win the election. Appoint me to a position for life.' What did the minister do? He said, `I will'—terrific. Yesterday, on what may well be the second-last day of parliament, the minister appointed the Employment Advocate to a position for life on the Industrial Relations Commission that the Employment Advocate would like to abandon, would like to demolish. He hates collective bargaining. He is a champion of individual contracts. He is a champion of AWAs—and they have put him in charge in the Industrial Relations Commission. The significance of this is that this government knows that it is on the ropes. This government knows that this may well be the last day of this parliament. It has appointed one of its mates, in the last desperate act of a desperate government, to a position for life because that particular person, Mr Hamberger, knew his number was up.</para><para>I thank the Labor senators in particular who worked so hard on getting a result and on constraining the powers of this McCarthyist government. I thank Senator Peter Cook, who spoke long and passionately last night about the activities of this government and its McCarthyist tendencies. I thank Senator Gavin Marshall for the terrific work he has done in coming up with a regulation that constrained the powers that you wanted to apply to the working men and women of this country.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

The Senate has spent seven hours, as I understand it, debating this bill. We have had no time to consider it. We are now being asked to consider a bill which, if enacted, will introduce some of the most draconian laws that will apply to any worker in this country or, for that matter, in any liberal democracy or social democracy.

That is the reality. The Building Industry Taskforce will be given more powers to examine and interview building workers than ASIO has to interview people who are alleged to have committed terrorist offences.</para><para>The government is not concerned about that. Labor are very concerned about that. We understand the government's agenda on these issues. I want the parliament to understand that if we vote for this bill we are bringing in the most pernicious provisions to affect any worker in this country in our history, even though those provisions have been in some way weakened by the amendments successfully moved by Labor senators. I am ashamed of the Democrats, who have spent a lot of time since their inception indicating, not only to their supporters but to all Australians, that they are a party that supports civil freedoms and individual rights. This is a black mark against their name. In my view, last night the Democrats failed the test of looking after the individual freedoms of the working people in this industry.</para><para>I also think it is important to reiterate the comments made by the member for Rankin with respect to the hurried appointment of the Employment Advocate, Jonathan Hamberger, to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. During the term of this government, at least a dozen commissioners have been appointed to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission from the employer side of the employer-employee table. Jonathan Hamberger, as Employment Advocate, has overseen the introduction of Australian workplace agreements—which, in the main, have been agreements signed under duress. Everybody who has lived and worked in the real world understands that most Australian workplace agreements are not `Australian', because they are not intrinsic to Australia's labour laws; they are not `workplace', because they are individual; and they are not `agreements'. The so-called Australian workplace agreements are, in the main, a case of, `Sign this or you're sacked.' I ask the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations to tell us: will Jonathan Hamberger have to sign an AWA to become a commissioner of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission? I am sure he will not. </para><para>These proposed laws should have been properly considered by this House. We have not had the opportunity to properly consider them. The way in which they have been introduced is a disgrace. It is a slur upon the government. Most importantly, I think it is important for the Democrats to realise that today they have sullied their reputation with respect to individual freedoms. I think they will rue the day that they did that.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>31738</page.no><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Dr EMERSON</name><name.id>83V</name.id><electorate>Rankin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will take very little extra time to indicate that upon coming to government Labor will abolish the Building Industry Taskforce.

He says that this is the first opportunity we have had to look at this. The reality is that these provisions are based on the provisions in the <inline ref="R1922">Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2003</inline>, which the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee has been looking into around Australia for months, even though the Labor Party are implacably imposed to it. They have had that bill and these provisions for months. The provisions are the same as those in that bill. The reality is that the Labor Party remain opposed to them, and that is the bottom line.</para><para>The member for Rankin and the member for Burke made some comments about the appointment of Mr Jonathan Hamberger to the Industrial Relations Commission.

I point out to the House that the ASIO regime focuses on detention and depriving people of their civil liberties. The Building Industry Taskforce has no such powers now, nor will it have them under this legislation. There is simply no comparison between the two. I will not go on and answer all the other rubbish we have heard from the member for Rankin. I simply commend the amendments to the House, saying that this is a significant improvement in terms of ensuring that the rule of law can apply in the building and construction industry in Australia. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—The question is that the amendments be agreed to.</para></talk.start><para>Question put.</para></interjection></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>09:44:00</time.stamp><para>The House divided.</para></division.header><para>(The Speaker—Mr Neil Andrew)

In particular, I want to highlight the case of a local school in my electorate of Oxley—St Augustine's College. St Augustine's College is a P to 12 school that operates a before- and after-school day care facility. Sadly, it will not be able to open its doors during the upcoming school holiday period because it has still not received any financial assistance from the federal government. The school made an application for assistance to operate an outside school hours care facility in May 2002, and approval was not given. </para></talk.start><para>I wrote to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs about St Augustine's case in April 2003, requesting that the minister and his department look at providing funding assistance to the school so that it can operate this outside school hours care facility. To date, the school does not get assistance from the Howard government to provide its much needed high-quality services. I can personally attest to the great level of service provided by St Augustine's, and many people in the local community also appreciate the school's commitment to providing great services for outside school hours care. These services are in demand in the local community. Without the federal government's assistance, it cannot operate effectively during the school holidays as families are forced, due to financial considerations, to take their children to another facility which receives federal government assistance through the child care benefits scheme.</para><para>St Augustine's have once again written to the department requesting assistance but they were told that it would all be finalised by 1 June this year. This did not happen. After contacting the department again, they were told that all would be finalised by 1 July. It may well be finalised by 1 July, but this will be way too late for St Augustine's and the upcoming school holiday period, and for all the parents who would use the facility during that time.</para><para>I also commend the efforts of the school and of the carers at St Augustine's. I particularly want to mention the child-care facility coordinator, Michelle Rutledge, Principal Leon Capra and all the staff who do a fantastic job at the school. The school is making an extraordinary effort to keep this child-care facility open at the lowest possible cost to parents. This is a direct cost to the school, and parents get no assistance from the government. This centre is being run at a loss to the school to ensure that this vital service is provided to parents. </para><para>I am calling on the minister and the Howard government to get their act together and provide financial assistance, as was promised, to schools like St Augustine's so that they can have some certainty and get on with providing a first-rate service for the local community and the parents of the school. Our community needs school communities like that of St Augustine's, and anything the federal government can do to help them operate should be done. It is really sad that, while there is extra funding for child care, it is not being directed into the areas of highest need. St Augustine's is a school of need and it needs to have this funding for its child-care facility so it can operate not only during school hours but also after school hours and during the school holiday period. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Ryan Electorate: Riverview to Moggill Bridge</title><page.no>31742</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>31742</page.no><name role="metadata">Johnson, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JOHNSON</name><name.id>00AMX</name.id><electorate>Ryan</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am very pleased that the member for Oxley is in the chamber today as I give my speech, because I want to alert the people of Ryan, and particularly the electors of Ryan who live in Bellbowrie and in the far western suburbs of the great electorate of Ryan, to a press release that the member put out last week advocating very strongly that a bridge be built from Riverview to Moggill. Let me quote the member for Oxley, because I am sure the good residents of Ryan will be very keen to know where the ALP stands on this. I am sure that they are also going to be calling upon the Labor candidate for Ryan to come clean on her views and tell them whether she supports the member for Oxley or whether she supports the people of Bellbowrie. This is what the member for Oxley said in his press release of Friday, 18 June 2004:</para></talk.start><quote><para>A BRIDGE should be built from Riverview to Moggill replacing the antiquated Moggill ferry service as part of the Federal Government's plans to address traffic congestion in south-east Queensland, the Federal Member for Oxley ... said today. </para><para>“A bridge from Riverview to Moggill would be great and would go a long way towards addressing the serious traffic problems that plague south-east Queensland,” Mr Ripoll said.  </para></quote><para>I am not sure that the people of Bellbowrie would be very keen to hear that the ALP is supporting the building of a bridge across the Moggill ferry route, because all that is going to do is dramatically increase congestion on Moggill Road. I think that the state government, which is responsible for Moggill Road, has got to get its act together and do something. The state Labor government has been in office in Queensland now since 1989, when Wayne Goss came to office, for all but the two short years of the Borbidge government. It is now 2004 and it is about time that the Queensland Labor government spent money on Moggill Road.</para><para>Let me go back to the member for Oxley, who, of course, represents the opposition and will continue to represent his district, if he is fortunate enough to be re-elected, in opposition following the next election. I know that the people of Bellbowrie are very keen for the Labor candidate for Ryan to clarify whether she supports the personal views of the member for Oxley that a bridge should be built across the Moggill ferry route, because that is something that is going to absolutely profoundly affect the volume of traffic on an already heavily congested Moggill Road. Suburban traffic in the western suburbs is already at an unbearable level and this proposal by the member for Oxley is not going to add one little bit to solving the problem.

In relation to health, I want to draw the attention of the chamber to the need for more public health programs, which are supplementing the moneys that are paid into the health system in various ways. It is not just about money, but it is also, if I may say so, about programs. The two that I want to mention are for schizophrenia and for sufferers of Alzheimer's disease. I am pleased to say that yesterday in this place the Parliamentary Friends of Schizophrenia group was launched. I was privileged to attend that function, at which John McGrath spoke, and he spoke very well about the suffering that people with schizophrenia have and how they are falling through the cracks in our society.</para></talk.start><para>In my area, where there are a relatively large number of homeless, especially on the western side of the electorate, those who suffer schizophrenia, according to the reports of the Brown Nurses, whom I work with on some of these issues, are amongst the most prevalent. The two problems are these. Firstly, sufferers of schizophrenia are unable to identify their problem, are often in self-denial, take drugs and alcohol and in this way become worse situated than they were before. Also, many of those who are actually homeless suffer from schizophrenia. I think we need a proper targeted public program, working with state authorities, private organisations and charitable organisations such as the Brown Nurses, to address this problem, which is particularly prevalent in our inner cities, although not only in the inner cities. </para><para>The other public health program I want to draw attention to relates to Alzheimer's disease. I am pleased to see that Alzheimer's Australia has commenced a public screening program to help potential sufferers from Alzheimer's disease, who ultimately are thrown onto the health system in their 60s suffering dementia and so on, to identify that problem through a public screening process. I would like to see more public support for that particular program because in that way not only will we be helping those people by an alert system but also we will be saving the taxpayers lots of money by addressing the issues before they become a real problem.</para><para>The second topic I want to raise concerns education. The two points I want to make briefly are these. First, in relation to HECS payments, I think we need a new program for more library allowances for our universities to help students who cannot afford textbooks because of the problems they have meeting their HECS requirements. The second is that we need special programs to promote expert overseas programs such as those for IFAD.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Holt Electorate: Order of Australia Awards</title><page.no>31744</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>31744</page.no><name role="metadata">Byrne, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BYRNE</name><name.id>008K0</name.id><electorate>Holt</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise briefly to discuss an article that was published in the <inline font-style="italic">Dandenong Journal</inline>. Its title is `Big Honours Pool but No Proposers'. This related to the Order of Australia awards that were in the 2004 Queen's Birthday honours list. Of concern to this particular journalist, Marge Stork, who is an excellent journalist from the <inline font-style="italic">Dandenong Journal</inline>—a fine paper with a large circulation in the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne—was the fact that only one local individual received an Order of Australia award. </para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WF6</name.id><name role="metadata">Danby, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Danby</name></talker><para>—How many?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>008K0</name.id><name role="metadata">Byrne, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BYRNE</name></talker><para>—Just one. Given the population base in this catchment area, where the City of Greater Dandenong has a population of 130,000 people and the City of Casey has a population of 210,000 people, the fact that only one person received an Order of Australia award is quite concerning. It is concerning because of the nomination process. Obviously there were not a lot of nominations in this region, and I have undertaken on behalf of the community in this region to advertise this particular award more fully so that more good honest battlers can apply for it. </para></talk.start></continue><para>One thing I need to alert the Order of Australia Council about is that, when you have good, decent people who nominate and nominate frequently, please make sure that they are actually granted the award. I give the example of Murray McGregor as a good community person, a person who has given 55 years of service to the community. He is a good community battler who does represent the region incredibly well and very effectively. When we have someone like Murray, who has given 55 years community service, has been a bail justice for 10 years, has served in the CFA and has served in St Johns Ambulance with aplomb and distinction, and particularly in his capacity as bail justice has been dragged out at 2, 3 and 4 o'clock in the morning, appropriate recognition should be given to someone like Murray. So I would encourage the Order of Australia committee, when we get a few more nominations, which we will do next year, to use fair criteria to determine who should be eligible for this award. I would like to see people like Carlos Lyola, the coach of the Australian soccer team for kids with intellectual disabilities, Carol Drummond, a director of the Dandenong Community Advisory Bureau, and Lindsay King, who is a fantastic promoter of tourism in the Cranbourne region, given the opportunity to be appropriately recognised.  </para><para>I say this to the House and to the community: I am establishing, in light of the fantastic contributions made by the people just mentioned and thousands of others in the region, my own community spirit award. If they do not get the recognition by the Order of Australia Council, I want to make sure they are recognised by me and by the community for their incredible achievements and their substantial contributions to the communities that keep our community ticking over.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Employment: Work for the Dole Awards</title><page.no>31745</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>31745</page.no><name role="metadata">Neville, Paul, MP</name><name role="display">Mr NEVILLE</name><name.id>KV5</name.id><electorate>Hinkler</electorate><party>NATS</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Last night in the Great Hall I witnessed a tremendous event, and I am referring not just to the excellence of the arrangements, the cuisine and the camaraderie but also to the celebration of community and personal achievement.

Today I would like to share with the committee the very sad and difficult experience that one woman had when her 91-year-old mother had to move to a high-care residential facility within the electorate.</para></talk.start><para>The northern part of the Central Coast—Toukley, Buff Point, Blue Haven, Budgewoi, San Remo, Lake Haven, Chain Valley Bay, Gwandalan and Summerland Point—is particularly poorly serviced by doctors. The lady that I speak of contacted my office in great distress because her 91-year-old mother had to move to one of the local residential facilities because she had had a stroke and had poor mobility, and her doctor, who worked in a one-doctor practice, advised that he would be unable to continue caring for her in that facility.</para><para>She makes the point in a letter she sent to me—and she also sent a copy of this letter to the health minister—that until that time she thought that it was very exasperating that she had to wait two weeks to see her overworked doctor. But she was absolutely devastated when she found that her mother could not have a doctor visit her in the nursing home. After contacting 33 doctors on the Central Coast, all those doctors advised that they would not visit her in that facility.</para><para>One practice has 18 doctors in it and not one of those 18 doctors was prepared to go and visit her mother, who is in a nursing home that is only two kilometres at the most from their practice. Many other doctors had their books closed and the few that would accept this lady's mother as a patient said that she would be required to attend their surgery. This is an impossibility, because her mother is confined to a wheelchair and it is very difficult to get somebody who is confined to a wheelchair into a car, out of a car and into the doctor's surgery. When she rang my office I made some inquiries and was given the name of a couple of doctors who could possibly assist her. But thank goodness her mother's own doctor rethought his position and was prepared to travel some distance to visit her in that aged care facility.</para><para>On the northern part of the Central Coast there is something like one doctor to about 2,500 residents. In some areas it is one doctor to over 8,000 people. It is no wonder that doctors on the Central Coast are unable to take time out of their busy practices to go and visit those people who are in aged care facilities, and who desperately need to see a doctor. In many cases, those aged care facilities will not accept residents unless they have a doctor who will visit them there. There have been occasions where residential facilities have refused to accept residents simply because they did not have a doctor who would visit them in those facilities. </para><para>The story I have told you is about one person. But it is not an isolated event. This happens all the time. This happens when aged people go to residential care facilities and they cannot get a doctor to visit them there. The other side of the story is that people are waiting two weeks and more to see their doctor in the practice in their area. This is not good enough and I want the health minister to deal with this as a matter of urgency. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Herbert Electorate: Work for the Dole</title><title>Herbert Electorate: MRI Machines</title><page.no>31747</page.no></subdebateinfo><title>Herbert Electorate: MRI Machines</title><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>31747</page.no><name role="metadata">Lindsay, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LINDSAY</name><name.id>HK6</name.id><electorate>Herbert</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Last night a Work for the Dole project in the electorate of Herbert in Thuringowa was judged the best overall Work for the Dole activity for 2003. That is a marvellous achievement. It is one that I am very proud of and one that my community will be very proud of. Rasmussen State School, under Principal Mrs Jan Metcalfe, and local unemployed people who are looking for work experience, are setting the standard for the entire nation. That is what last night's award meant. This example gives us all food for thought.</para></talk.start><para>Why do I say food for thought? That was the title of the activity that this particular group undertook. It is an outstanding achievement. Diane and Ross Taylor, who were there last night; Kim Holl; Jamie-Lee Sawrey—one of the participants; and Kylie Norris were all as proud as I was when the announcement was made that Food For Thought won the national award for best Work for the Dole activity for 2003.</para><para>The caring for people category, which this project won, covers a broad range of activities and shows that local action can make a difference to individuals. This particular project was to provide nutritious meals for schoolchildren. It is something that the Work for the Dole participants really relished being part of because they could see the results. The local council had conducted research that showed that local children's behaviour and academic performance were often related to poor nutrition. The project resulted in noticeable improvements in the children's behaviour and academic performance.

Those magnets do a fantastic job in the health system. At the Mater hospital in Townsville, Queensland's most complex regional private hospital, patients are currently disadvantaged by the lack of publicly funded MRI facilities. Patients have to be sent to the Townsville Hospital, causing extraordinary delays and inconvenience. Currently the MRI at Townsville Hospital is very busy and there are long waiting times to access that magnet. I very strongly support the MRI at the Mater hospital being publicly funded. It has been there since 1999, doing a marvellous job. Unfortunately the hospital has to charge significant dollars for its use, whereas I believe that it should be a publicly funded machine. I ask the government to look closely at this particular machine, and I hope that it gets chosen as one of the 23 machines that will be funded in the current tender. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Roads: Ipswich Motorway</title><page.no>31748</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>31748</page.no><name role="metadata">Ripoll, Bernie, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RIPOLL</name><name.id>83E</name.id><electorate>Oxley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—With all the debate about AusLink, the specific Ipswich Motorway proposal and the possibility of an alternate route as the solution, it is essential to ensure that the facts are clear. The biggest claim among the few people who think that the Ipswich Motorway should not be upgraded is that the six lanes are not enough for future needs, and that by the time the motorway was completed it would be at capacity.</para></talk.start><para>For simplicity, the upgrade is often referred to as the six-lane Ipswich Motorway upgrade, but a more accurate description would be the Ipswich to Brisbane transport corridor solution plan. Those who had the opportunity to examine the Ipswich Motorway project report in detail would understand that the upgrade is not a simple addition of two lanes. It is a comprehensive and integrated plan. Any suggestion otherwise is incorrect and plainly dishonest. In some parts of the corridor there would be six lanes and in other parts eight. But, more importantly, the upgrade is not just about adding two extra lanes; it is about a complete transport corridor package. It involves the major redesign of intersections, interconnecting roads and links between suburbs, extra service roads, removing bottlenecks, upgrading rail infrastructure, upgrading public transport options and balancing the number of lanes with required traffic flows.</para><para>The Ipswich Motorway proposal is a thorough and comprehensive plan that will deliver a safe and reliable road network with a life span of 30 years. The Ipswich Motorway project report cost $6 million and examined all requirements by the federal and state governments, with representatives from both fully involved in the full process and planning. The issue of how long it will take to complete can be an emotive matter and used for political purposes. But actually getting the job started is the crucial first step.</para><para>The upgrade will take many years to complete, but it can be done while traffic continues to flow and must be done to transform the Ipswich Motorway from its substandard and dangerous condition. Every modern road project today is carried out while traffic continues to flow. It can be done effectively with overall traffic flows being quicker and safer due to lower speeds. There is plenty of evidence from past projects, including the M1 to the Gold Coast that traffic can flow efficiently. The preposterous concept that bulldozers turn up on a Monday to rip up the road and everyone has to wait years before they can use the road again is nothing more than a smear and fear campaign from a few who are determined to derail the project. While I have never objected to more roads being funded or built, I do object to an either/or ultimatum. The priority must remain dealing with the core problem and fixing it.</para><para>If the federal government desperately wants to fund more roads to the north, south or otherwise, they will get no argument from me. The recent use of daily vehicle movements on the Ipswich Motorway—as well as average daily, average weekly and peak daily figures—by the member for Blair to discredit the merit of the upgrade highlights the desperate attempts to confuse and delay any progress. Not surprisingly, we now see some urgency by government to do something, so out goes the fast-tracking mantra for an alternate route. </para><para>The Ipswich Motorway issue is not new. I have been campaigning for it for over six years. In 1994 the Labor government committed funding to begin the process of upgrading the Ipswich Motorway in 1996. This funding and commitment to upgrade the Ipswich Motorway a decade ago was scrapped by the incoming Howard Liberal government. Labor again committed funding to upgrade the motorway in 1998, with the most recent commitment to fully upgrade the corridor as a priority and matter of urgency. In the same period, the Liberal government has made no commitment to upgrade the Ipswich Motorway and has used every political opportunity to delay and dilute its direct responsibility. Disappointingly, the Howard-Thompson team have finally confirmed the dumping of the Ipswich Motorway as a federal responsibility.</para><para>Most disturbing and astonishing is Mr Thompson's insistence on compelling all traffic from the Cunningham and Warrego highways onto his northern route directly into the Logan toll road. This outrageous proposal surely must fail—as have Mr Thompson's past options A, B, C, D and E. We are now being offered option F, being the two bridge option in lieu of the original five bridge option. People are also being told that the northern route will cross the river only twice into the leafy blue-ribbon suburbs of Moggill and Priors Pocket but will not have an off-ramp. Surely no one believes that the federal government would build a road costing more than $500 million and not provide a simple off-ramp for those needing to travel to Moggill and Kenmore. If the northern alternative is given the green light by the federal government instead of the upgrade to the Ipswich Motorway, there will be very few winners and more precious years will have been wasted waiting for more reports based on one man's personal views.</para><para>Mr Thompson should consider the following facts in relation to his recent denigration of the good people at Queensland Main Roads and the Queensland government. First, the federal government had senior representatives from its own department—the Department of Transport and Regional Services—on the steering committee that oversaw the study into the six-lane upgrade of the Ipswich Motorway. The study's parameters were expanded on several occasions at the request of the federal government; and the state government met every single request of the federal government in relation to the report. The final cost of the entire study was $6 million, not $10.6 million as stated by Mr Thompson, and was totally paid for by the Commonwealth government, because they agreed with what was done.</para><para>The final report includes 25 subsets of studies including, but not limited to concept planning and layout, bicycle plans, public transport access studies, public utility requirements, traffic reports, air quality reports, environmental impact studies, a noise impact study, a social impact study, mining subsidence studies and so on. This report is as comprehensive as one could hope to find. It was completed in early 2002 but has never been actioned or done since, because the federal government has no will. Mr Thompson has been fully briefed, chapter and verse, on the report's findings, yet he continues to misrepresent all the findings in that report.</para><para>The recent attack by Mr Thompson on the credibility of the report on the six-lane upgrade of the Ipswich Motorway is his latest trick in a very long list of tricks by the federal government to justify its decision to dump the Ipswich Motorway from its scope of responsibility. The people of south-east Queensland want action, answers and leadership on this issue, not this litany of excuses and ill-informed nonsense coming from the member for Blair, Mr Thompson, and the Howard government. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Roads: Eden Park</title><page.no>31750</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>31750</page.no><name role="metadata">Bailey, Fran, MP</name><name role="display">FRAN BAILEY</name><name.id>JT4</name.id><electorate>McEwen</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I feel like saying `correct weight' at the end of my colleague's speech. I rise today to bring to the attention of the House a very serious matter that has been raised in my electorate. Last night in the township of Whittlesea, around 120 people gathered to voice their concern at what the local council, the City of Whittlesea, is doing to the ratepayers. In particular, I am referring to the residents of Eden Park. This dispute has had a long history, and it started with the City of Whittlesea arbitrarily deciding, with absolutely no consultation, that they would seal a number of these largely country roads and the residents would pay the cost. The residents were never consulted as to whether they wanted this to happen. The council simply made a decision.</para></talk.start><para>We managed to stop them, and before the last state election the City of Whittlesea agreed that they would cease all implementation of this road user charge scheme, and in particular stage 4 of the Eden Park scheme, until there had been a reform of the Local Government Act in Victoria. Residents accepted this at face value. Independent councillor Allan Cann is the only one who really speaks up for the residents of Whittlesea. Council has sent a letter out to every resident in Eden Park telling them that they are going ahead with this scheme. They have broken their promise—they said that they would wait until the local government act had been reformed. In this letter they have had the absolute audacity to say that the resident must vote yes or no but, if a resident does not return the letter—and there are many people there whose first language is not English—that is counted as a yes. That is an interesting way for the democratic process to work. I have never heard of this before and yet this council claims to represent these people.</para><para>I think that this is an absolute disgrace, and so did all of the 120 people who attended the public meeting in Whittlesea last night. At the meeting they moved three motions: (1) that council delay implementation of its special charge scheme at Eden Park until, at least, the policy on special charge scheme guidelines is released by the state government, (2) that in the interim residents of Eden Park vote no to the Eden Park stage 4 possible road improvements special charge scheme and (3) that a committee be formed to pursue these matters with council and the state government reporting back to the meeting of local residents, known as COWRA, in one months time.</para><para>This entire debacle has simply been a bunch of local councillors trying to ride roughshod over the wishes of local ratepayers. These councillors have forgotten the most basic rule of elected representation: they were elected to represent all of the residents, all of the ratepayers. This council have set their sights on a particular course of action and, come what may, they want to implement this road user charge scheme. This is not good enough. It is simply not on. It is about time that this council realised that the 120 people gathering in Whittlesea last night to protest against this was just the start. This is going to spread. We are not going to allow these councillors to get away with such completely undemocratic practices. They owe it to all the people they represent to call a halt, admit that they are on the wrong path, admit that they have broken a promise that they made before the last state election, admit that they have to honour their promise and their responsibility and cease this futile exercise that is damaging so many of their local ratepayers. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Howard Government: Funding</title><page.no>31751</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>31751</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MURPHY</name><name.id>83D</name.id><electorate>Lowe</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I speak on behalf of both Dr Joanne Tomkins, Associate Professor and Reader in Drama at the School of English, Media Studies and Art History, University of Queensland and Ms Kate Stowell, News Editor of <inline font-style="italic">Arts Alive</inline> radio, Melbourne. I met Dr Tomkins and Ms Stowell last week as they were delegates to the inaugural Council for Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences, CHASS, conference held at Parliament House on 15 and 16 June 2004.</para></talk.start><para>As a nineteen-year-old news editor, Ms Stowell has a passion for promoting youth participation in Australia's media and strongly believes media diversity in Australia is crucial to Australia's democracy. Ms Stowell is concerned by the Howard government's failure to provide adequate support for young artists and youth media. Dr Tomkins believes a major issue facing the newly formed Council for Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences, particularly for members who are university researchers, is the government's funding parameters for federally funded research projects. These researchers in humanities, arts and social sciences represent almost half of Australia's university researchers.</para><para>The government's national research priority areas, NRPAs, for research in Australia apply almost exclusively to the sciences and related disciplines, instead of recognising research that broadens the nation's understanding of its culture and its place in the international sphere. The four NRPAs that were announced by the government in 2003 are (1) an environmentally sustainable Australia, (2) promoting and maintaining good health, (3) frontiers technologies for building and transforming Australian industries and (4) safeguarding Australia. There is almost no room in these categories for the vital research that Australia's humanities, arts and social sciences researchers conduct. The government originally stated that it would add a humanities and social sciences based priority area in 2004. Instead, the government amended the existing four areas to broaden them slightly. They remain the same. But the priority goals within two of them can possibly be stretched to include research in the humanities, arts and social sciences. These may all be worthy research ventures, but the amendment to the NRPAs does not recognise the nature of a vast proportion of arts and social sciences research in Australia. </para><para>It is essential to see that the humanities, arts and social sciences are part of everyday life and culture in Australia. They are concerned with how we read our surroundings, what media we use to get our news and how we interpret that news, and what we might read or whether we have seen the latest David Williamson play. The arts are not isolated from the rest of the world. If we believe that arts and social sciences are a vital part of the nation's wellbeing then these research parameters need to be modified. The humanities, arts and social sciences sometimes suffer from old-fashioned images of researchers in ivory towers simply doing arcane, abstract or meaningless research. This model is long outmoded. Instead, research in these areas connects integrally to the world around us. After all, the management of culture is as important as the IT management of information.</para><para>If the government is committed to maintaining and improving facilities for Australian research at international levels, surely it needs to provide parameters that are appropriate to the research that Australia's humanities, arts and sciences researchers are doing. The research that these academics carry out is realistic and pragmatic. It is time that the funding models for which they are eligible were equally realistic and pragmatic. Funding CHASS is one useful step. The Minister for Education, Science and Training announced some ongoing organisational funding for CHASS on 16 June 2004. But providing realistic parameters for the actual research in Australia in the disciplines that comprise the humanities, arts and social sciences is also essential. In concluding, I congratulate Dr Tomkins and Ms Stowell on their hard work and passion for Australian culture and media diversity and their work with the Council for Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Education: Funding</title><page.no>31752</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>31752</page.no><name role="metadata">Cobb, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JOHN COBB</name><name.id>00AN1</name.id><electorate>Parkes</electorate><party>NATS</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On Monday I had a visit from a representative of the teachers union, a teacher from Dubbo College Senior Campus and a parent who had children at Dubbo College Senior Campus. They wanted to discuss Commonwealth funding of state schools and private, or non-government, schools. While we did not agree on everything, we did agree that every Australian should have the opportunity to have the best free education at the school level. I certainly agree with that and the government does too. I would like to see us be able to put maximum funding into government schools. I do believe, as I think the majority in this House believe, that children at private, or non-government, schools also have a right to support from the general community. The issue that recently has been so dishonest—not to put too fine a point upon it—in the recent advertising by the teachers union, as I think the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Brendan Nelson, showed yesterday, was showing two schools of approximately the same size and saying that one is getting $3 million and the other is getting $1 million or so from the federal government and failing to mention that the total tax dollars going to the government school is seven times greater—$21 million or more. That is a total misrepresentation, and the teachers union does stand condemned for it. Having said that, of course the government want to give every bit of funding to government schools that we can.</para></talk.start><para>That reminds me: I am very proud of a program called the Country Areas Program, which is obviously a Commonwealth government program. In country areas of New South Wales, $1.3 million in grants has been given to country schools. I say with a lot of pride that, of that $1.3 million, $750,000 is going to schools in the Parkes electorate—and that is for geographically isolated schools. In the far west of New South Wales, in places like Tibooburra, Menindee, Wilcannia and Broken Hill, the really isolated schools are getting grants out of this program. In the central west of New South Wales, in places like Hillston, Lake Cargelligo and Condobolin, and in the south in places like West Wyalong, Barmedman, Weethalle, Tallimba and Corinella, all the schools are getting funds which they have the opportunity to use on small projects.</para><para>Regarding the announcement by the Minister for Education, Science and Training and the Prime Minister about the enormous amount of funding—up, I think, by $8 billion over the next four years in the next rollout—that the Commonwealth is putting towards primary and secondary school education in Australia, I would have to say I absolutely welcome its being contingent upon flag ceremonies and exercise. I think it is fantastic. I do not believe in everything American, but I do love their nationalism. I am sure Australians have that same nationalism, but we are much quieter about it. Whether or not the flag is your particular favourite is not the issue: it is a symbol of our country and it will give those children a sense of community and a sense of security that will stay with them all their lives. I believe, far and away, that the average parent and the average Australian will be very pleased that we are going to show that kind of commitment, that kind of belief in our nation. </para><para>On the exercise side, I am an enormous believer in sport. This is not so much about government schools; this is about all schools. By and large in New South Wales, government schools do make sure their students exercise. However, this means not just government schools, not just Catholic schools, but all schools—whether they be private, non-government or whatever they are—will have to ensure that at least two hours of exercise is carried out by those students a week. I hope with all my heart that that exercise revolves around team sports, which are such a wonderful communication tool. They help children to learn to work together, to live together, to be a team—and that is what it is about. I think it is a wonderful program, and I am also very proud of the Country Areas Program, which has done so well for my electorate. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Swan Electorate: Harold Hawthorne Senior Citizen's Centre</title><page.no>31753</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>31753</page.no><name role="metadata">Wilkie, Kim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr WILKIE</name><name.id>84G</name.id><electorate>Swan</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Over the last couple of months, I have been hosting a number of seniors information forums in my electorate. More than 500 people have been to these forums and they have heard from guest speakers from a range of government departments and service providers. I thank Steve Trevisiol from Centrelink, Len Rathmann from the Office for Seniors Interests, Graham Whitworth from the Department of Veterans' Affairs, Carole Martell from the City of Canning, and Mary Band from the Harold Hawthorne Senior Citizens Centre.</para></talk.start><para>There are over 20,000 people aged 60 and over, almost a quarter of the population, in my electorate of Swan. Community centres like the Harold Hawthorne centre in Carlisle provide a valuable service to the community. The Harold Hawthorne centre comprises a community care centre and a day centre. The community care centre is specifically designed to enable the elderly, frail and disabled and their carers to remain in the sanctity of their own home. They provide support services like Care Aide, which provides personal care to seniors in their own homes or help with transport to the bank or a doctor's appointment. They also provide  Help Aide, which provides services such as basic housework, washing and ironing. They also do gardening and home maintenance. These programs allow for seniors to remain in the comfort of their own homes. For many, it is the home they have lived in all their married life. It allows for seniors to enjoy the companionship of their neighbours and retain their independence. These services also help the elderly to avoid premature, permanent care in age care facilities like hostels and nursing homes.</para><para>The Harold Hawthorne community centre also has a day centre. It offers a safe and secure environment for not only seniors but also younger people with disabilities so they can get together on a social basis. Just as importantly, it allows for respite for carers while their patients are at the day centre. But there is more. Besides what I have already mentioned, the seniors gold mine in Carlisle offers a Meals on Wheels service as well as a dining room serving three-course meals. It also runs a pensioner league and offers a podiatry service. Seniors can also participate in other activities at the centre, like indoor lawn bowls, bingo, billiards and art and craft groups, or they can spend time in the highly popular Internet lounge.</para><para>I could go on about the myriad range of activities at the Harold Hawthorne centre, but I would like to focus on the people who work there. They are a dedicated group, and I commend them for their efforts in bringing comfort, care and a bit of fun to the elderly, infirm and disabled in the electorate of Swan. I would like to mention in particular the Hon. Dr Cheryl Davenport, who is a member of the Harold Hawthorne centre board of management and convenor of the HACC subcommittee. Cheryl works tirelessly for both staff and clients at the centre. Mick Lee, the mayor of Victoria Park, co-founded the centre with Harold Hawthorne and is a member of the Harold Hawthorne centre board of management. Graeme Prentice is the executive director of the centre and treasurer for the Home and Community Care service. </para><para>Mary Band is the HACC program coordinator. Mary manages the Home and Community Care and adult day centre. The agency's rating has risen from a basic to a high standard since Mary took over in August 2002. Client numbers have also increased by over 100 in this time. Mary has given very generously of her time to attend the seniors forums, and I thank her most sincerely for her efforts. Heather Cordy, the day centre coordinator, and Janice McCooke, the client services coordinator have both recently obtained certificates III and IV in community services, aged care. Nancy Seaman is the assessment and review officer, and Kerrie Jones is a senior administrative assistant. Gloria Del Borrello is the office support worker at the Harold Hawthorne centre, and there is also a great team of care aides, home helpers and gardeners/handypersons who are too numerous to mention.</para><para>Another employee at the Harold Hawthorne centre is Phyllis Brown, the centre's secretary. Phyllis has had 30 years experience at the centre and does a great job organising events. Another long-term employee at the Harold Hawthorne centre is Lorraine Hazeldean, who looks after the Meals on Wheels service. Lorraine has also worked at the centre for over 30 years. In the Meals on Wheels kitchen there is Belen Paet, the cook, and Jo Jay Phillips, the assistant cook. They are both long-serving employees and the real backbone of the kitchen. They are ably assisted by a great team of hardworking kitchen hands.</para><para>Finally, the crew from the seniors Internet lounge deserve mention. Jim Booker is the coordinator.

The Howard government's ninth budget is great news for Sunshine Coast residents, offering assistance to families, students and couples, with tax cuts and a boost to people's retirement savings. The budget, importantly for an area with an ageing population like the Sunshine Coast, includes increased funding for aged care, boosting the number of places available as well as improving the quality care our older residents deserve.</para></talk.start><para>This year it was my pleasure to attend the opening of a new aged care facility and the extension of another. The $11.3 million Southern Cross Care aged care facility was built as part of the first stage of the Caloundra Rise Retirement Estate. It includes 40 high-care and 60 low-care places for the region. It was opened by the Minister for Ageing. I opened the extension to the Caroline Chisholm aged care facility at Currimundi. The new facilities include 40 high-care and 38 low-care places. This means that the facility, which opened in 1996, can now provide Australian government funded residential care to 118 older members of our Sunshine Coast community, including special care for residents with dementia. Older, frail people and people with disabilities can also receive a variety of types of support to help them remain in their homes. </para><para>Just recently, the Howard government has helped to establish in the Fisher electorate a Sunshine Coast regional office of Carers Queensland, which is part of a nationwide network. The new office has received $755,000 from the Australian government as part of a joint federal and Queensland government Home and Community Care program. Sunshine Coast families will also benefit through the additional $19.2 billion, to be provided over five years, including a new maternity payment of $3,000 for each newborn child from July 2004, increasing to $4,000 in July 2006 and $5,000 in July 2008. This will be available to all families. Families will also benefit from a huge boost to child-care places to help take the pressure off families attempting to juggle the responsibilities of work and children. An additional 40,000 outside school hours child-care places and an extra 4,000 family day care places will also be provided. </para><para>Labor argues that there is nothing in the budget for Australians earning less than $51,000 a year, but there is in fact a great deal on offer through the tax cuts in previous budgets, the More Help for Families package, the government's commitment to help people boost their retirement savings and by increasing the HECS threshold for repayment from $25,348 to $35,000. Tax cuts also mean that the overwhelming majority of taxpayers, who earn between $21,600 and $63,000, will not face any increase in their tax rate as their income increases.</para><para>The Australian government is also committed to funding the infrastructure important for an area like the Sunshine Coast, which has one of the most rapidly growing populations in the nation. After successfully managing the Australian economy and paying back $70 billion of Labor's massive public sector debt, the Australian government, in this budget and through its AusLink and Securing Australia's Energy Future announcements, is providing lasting and permanent dividends, rather than spending taxpayers' money on interest payments.</para><para>I have been working with the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Transport and Regional Services to ensure that the Sunshine Coast is recognised in the allocation of infrastructure. In fact, I believe infrastructure and ensuring the Sunshine Coast's road link to Brisbane is so important that, prior to the last election, I identified seeking funding to update the Bruce Highway as one of my core objectives—an objective which I am pleased to say has been very successful. The worst bottleneck—the area between Caboolture and Brisbane—will be upgraded to six lanes, and this means that people will be able to travel to the Sunshine Coast from Brisbane much more quickly, and 80 per cent of people traveling to the Sunshine Coast do so by road. There will also be additional money to upgrade the Bruce Highway north of Caboolture, and this is particularly important. </para><para>The Sunshine Coast tourism industry will benefit not only from the commitment to upgrade the Bruce Highway to the Sunshine Coast but also through other commitments, including the gifting of the ex HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> to Queensland to be sunk as a dive site off the Sunshine Coast. This will bring 15,000 dive tourists a year and create 70 to 100 new jobs, and it will boost our local economy, including the tourism industry. I have been working on this issue for some time. I am pleased that the Premier of Queensland has finally signed the deed of gift and that all of the benefits will flow through to the Sunshine Coast as soon as the ship is sunk. Now that the ship is state government property, I urge the Premier of Queensland to sink the ship off the Sunshine Coast as quickly as possible. I think this is really important because the benefits that will flow through to our local economy will be very substantial. People will come from around the nation and around the world to dive off the Sunshine Coast—which is, of course, the most desirable part of Australia in which to live.  </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>PK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Randall, Don, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Randall</name></talker><para>—Rubbish!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>0V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SLIPPER</name></talker><para>—My friend is wrong.

It always disappoints me to see the management of a company like Qantas, whose executives receive multimillion dollar salary packages, taking the easy way to increase profits. How easy it is to shut down a number of services and employ cheap overseas labour. Any first year management student could do that. The real challenge for the management of companies like Qantas is to create a bigger company with a bigger network, employing more Australians in more locations, and to do it at a profit. Going for growth does not mean just going for a bigger profit. That is easy, and the corporate world is full of leftover hatchet men from the nineties. Their creed of firing half the staff and closing down half the business is now totally discredited. But we find that Qantas is now set on such a course, and this will inevitably end in tears.</para></talk.start><para>I condemn the Qantas decision to move 400 Australian jobs offshore, just as I condemn the Qantas decision to abandon services to the major Queensland centres of Rockhampton and Mackay. By their actions, the management of Qantas has lost the confidence of regional Australia and now, by moving 400 Australian jobs offshore, every Australian would doubt the right of Qantas to use the slogan: `Qantas—the Australian way'. As we look at this drive by Qantas management for nothing more than greater shareholder return, we find that the actions of this Howard government are giving Qantas management an excuse for some of their actions. Airservices Australia have recently issued their proposed new charges for providing aviation rescue and firefighting services to airports around Australia. If ever there were a case to make for the Howard government's policies being the root cause of loss of services to regional Australia, this is it.</para><para>The current charge on an airline for the provision of rescue and fire services at airports is measured in total cost per tonne landed, and by this measure the cost per tonne landed in Mackay is $9.98, while the cost per tonne landed in Rockhampton is $9.59. These are the two highest charges in Australia. By comparison, the cost per tonne landed in Melbourne is only $1.09, while the cost per tonne landed in Sydney is a mere 69c. There can be no doubt that the fact that Mackay and Rockhampton are the most expensive airports in Australia to land at was a factor in the decision by Qantas management to abandon some services to these two Central Queensland cities. </para><para>And the situation under the Howard government will only get worse. For the coming financial year—2004-05—the charges for rescue and firefighting services are set to rise, and the increases could only be described as staggering if you want to fly to Rockhampton or Mackay. The proposed new charge for Sydney is 75c per tonne landed, up from 69c. For Melbourne the new charge is $1.21 per tonne landed, up from $1.09. However, if you want to land your aircraft in Mackay it will now cost $19.16 per tonne landed, up from $9.98, while in Rockhampton the new charge will be $19.24 per tonne landed, up from $9.59. This makes the rescue and firefighting charges at Rockhampton the most expensive in Australia and those at Mackay the second most expensive.</para><para>Quite clearly, the Howard government does not want Rockhampton or Mackay to have air services at all, and there is no hope under this government of the situation improving. A look at the projected charges show that in the year 2008 Sydney will be at 83c per tonne landed while Melbourne will be at $1.29 per tonne landed. However, at Mackay the charge will be $21.06 per tonne landed, while Rockhampton will remain the most expensive in Australia, at $22.42 per tonne landed. I estimate that this will add an additional $20 to the price of an airline ticket out of Rockhampton or Mackay. That is an impost on the bottom line of many of our businesspeople, and it of course affects families and those people travelling for essential family and medical business. Labor's policy of network charging, on the other hand, would correct this injustice for regional airports around Australia and reduce the cost pressures on airlines like Virgin which want to service regional airports in Australia.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Electorate of Canning: Mandurah Bypass</title><page.no>31757</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>31757</page.no><name role="metadata">Randall, Don, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RANDALL</name><name.id>PK6</name.id><electorate>Canning</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It was my privilege on 5 June this year to announce the most satisfying achievement in the electorate of Canning since I have been there. Senator Campbell, the roads minister, and I announced in Halls Head in my electorate $150 million for the Mandurah bypass. The Mandurah bypass is a program which has been delivered under the federal government's new roads program—fully funded in this year's budget—called AusLink. I have been fighting for the Mandurah bypass since I was elected the member for Canning, and it is fantastic to see a project that I have been fighting for on behalf of my constituents, the region in general and Western Australia, as an important piece of transport infrastructure, being delivered. Initially, the state government had corresponded that they would like the federal government to contribute half the cost of the Mandurah bypass, which was to be about $75 million. We went further than that. We offered $150 million to complete the Kwinana Freeway and the Mandurah bypass as a continuous build—in other words, we gave 50 per cent of the total cost of this project to see that the project is built in a timely and seamless manner so that the bottlenecks et cetera that occur in the electorate do not occur again.</para></talk.start><para>Interestingly, I realised that my colleague in the neighbouring seat of Brand, Mr Beazley, has been absolutely absent on this matter ever since he became the member for Brand. Strangely, he has not been lobbying like I have. As we know, he was a very senior member of the Labor Party, and he had the opportunity to make strong representations on behalf of the Peel region to get the Mandurah bypass built—and he shares an area where the route of the road will be. In an article on 6 August 2003 in the <inline font-style="italic">Mandurah Coastal Times</inline>, Mr Beazley was quite snide in the way that he said that the federal government needed to give money quickly for these projects and that the road needed to be identified as a road of national importance. </para><para>The Minister for Transport and Regional Services, Mr John Anderson, wrote to the state transport minister, Allanah McTiernan, on 1 March 2002 asking her to put in place the measures to identify the Mandurah bypass as a road of national importance. I wrote to Mr Anderson urging him to assist in this matter and Mr Anderson replied saying that Minister McTiernan had not responded to him. Mr Anderson's letter to me was written on 29 June 2003—some 16 months later. So some 16 months later, the state transport minister had not even bothered to apply for Roads of National Importance funding. And she has now come out into the public and said that the federal government had held this up for so long because they would not respond with respect to this road. She is saying black is white. She probably thinks that, if she says this often enough, the people of Western Australia might believe that it was the federal government that was not responding and not her. But let us continue with Mr Beazley, who said:</para><quote><para>If Mr Randall is so close to the top, why hasn't he been able to persuade his colleagues of the urgency of the Peel deviation by now?</para></quote><para>I have—I have done it. I am proud to say that I did that in conjunction with others in the area—but not Labor members. The local Labor member for Mandurah, David Templeman, said that this road is 10 years away. He is not pushing to have it completed—nor are the state transport minister and Mr Beazley.</para><para>Sadly, now that the money has been delivered, the state government are saying: `We haven't got the funds to put into this. The federal government might have given us the $150 million, but we do not have any money.' But they do have the money. They have received not only the GST allocated to them but also—as Mr Beattie has stated—an extra $230 million out of the GST in this year's grants. That road could be built immediately with that GST money and they could get on with it. The state transport minister said that the planning is not in place and the design work is not in place—but main roads tell us that is not true; that they could begin work straightaway. In fact, we gave them $5 million upfront from this federal grant to get on with things immediately.</para><para>Strangely, Mr Beazley came out in this week's <inline font-style="italic">Sound Telegraph</inline> and said that he is pleased that the project has been delivered and that `It's about time that John Howard stopped spending on the Eastern States' roads and spent some over here.' The fact is that, if Mr Beazley had been helping, instead of being the absent member for Brand, we might have had some help in the past. Instead of Mr Beazley sniping and criticising from the side, some help from the member for Brand would help get this road finished. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>China: Human Rights</title><page.no>31758</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>31758</page.no><name role="metadata">Danby, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DANBY</name><name.id>WF6</name.id><electorate>Melbourne Ports</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Dr Jiang Yanyoung and his wife, Dr Hua Zhongwei, were both arrested in Beijing on 1 June and have not been heard of since. Both are aged 72. There are tens of thousands of political prisoners in the Chinese Laogai, the Chinese gulag, but Dr Jiang and Dr Hua are not just two more anonymous victims of Chinese Leninist political system. In April 2003 Dr Jiang, a surgeon with good connections in China's health system, learned that the SARS epidemic in China was far more serious than the government was admitting. The government claimed there were only 19 cases, while Dr Jiang knew that there were at least 10 times that many. He decided that it was his duty as a doctor and as a citizen to make this information public. He was not the only courageous Chinese doctor to do this, but he was the most prominent. He said at the time: </para></talk.start><quote><para>I felt I had to reveal what was happening, not just to save China, but to save the world.</para></quote><para>Indeed, the international community owes Dr Jiang a debt for the final defeat of the SARS virus. As is now known, the SARS epidemic began in China and was actively covered up by the government of that country. As a result it spread rapidly through China and then into countries such as Vietnam, Singapore and Taiwan. China sought to block dissemination of accurate information about SARS—for example, by preventing the Taiwanese authorities gaining access to the services of the World Health Organisation. Dr Jiang's courage in speaking out on SARS made him a national hero in China but it also made him a marked opponent of the regime in Beijing. His experience with SARS led him to become more critical of the regime and less willing to accept its version of history. This led him to reassess the events of July 1989, when the government repressed the pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square in Beijing. In March this year therefore Dr Jiang, supported by his wife Dr Hua, wrote an open letter to the National People's Congress, China's parliament, asking them to reverse their verdict on the events of 1989. After recounting the grim detail of those events and the bloody mayhem, he said that China's leaders had `mobilised all sorts of propaganda to fabricate lies and used high-handed measures to silence the people across the country'.</para><para>Finally Dr Jiang implored the party to reassess the 1989 student movement by reversing its verdict from `counterrevolutionry rebellion' or `political storm' to `patriotic acts that had the support of the overwhelming majority of the people of Beijing and the country'. He said, `Our party must address the mistakes it has made.' He concluded, `Anyone whose family members were unjustly killed should voice the same request.' The arrest of this 72yearold couple in China again shows that we need to understand that, despite the positive developments in the Chinese economic system, what we have there is a capitalist economy coexisting within a Leninist political system. It has an effect on even incredible heroes of China like these two famous doctors. Orville Schell, celebrated historian of China and dean of the University of California at Berkeley, recently concluded an article about Jiang by saying:</para><quote><para>Jiang may become a millionaire, wear any clothes he likes, redecorate his living room, even buy a car, but he cannot inform the public about an epidemic or write government officials an honest letter of admonition. Does it matter? That depends on whether one believes that Leninist capitalism is a viable and stable form of government for China over the long term.</para></quote><para>This issue is of great concern to Australia and goes to the stability of China. The existing conflicted state that China is in—between its economy, which is open to the world, and the kind of political system that arrests two doctors who have done the right thing not just by their own country but by the world—is an indictment of the oppressive political system that prevails there. The Australian government should formally protest the arrest of Dr Jiang and Dr Hua. We should demand their immediate release. We should make it clear to China that the continued arbitrary, cruel and, indeed, illegal arrests of people like these two elderly doctors does nothing but damage China's reputation and the prospects of good relations with countries like Australia—even under the formalist constitution that they have in China; and I would point to articles 35 and 41 of the Chinese Constitution. If the Australian-Chinese human rights dialogue has any meaning—and I have severe doubts about it being anything except a formalist and legalist cover for good relations between the two countries at an economic level—it should raise the issue of these two doctors. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Education: Higher Education</title><page.no>31760</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>31760</page.no><name role="metadata">Hull, Kay, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs HULL</name><name.id>83O</name.id><electorate>Riverina</electorate><party>NATS</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise this morning in the committee to raise an issue of concern that I have had for some time, that being the emphasis that is being placed on higher education and university education. Continually in the House we hear of HECS places, HECS costs, the issues of universities and the cost of university for students, but rarely do we hear of the issue of the value of TAFE training, technical training, the trades and services area. I have been concerned for some time that we have lost the sensitivity to understand how our children work in schools. In the past many students have gone into their education and in year 10, or even earlier, they have decided they would like to do a trade. However, now it almost seems as though it is a sin to want to do a trade and to go on and to be a builder, a mechanic, a panel-beater, an electrical engineer, an electrical fitter, or an airconditioning fitter, because people feel very strong pressure to go on to a university degree.</para></talk.start><para>It is almost as though now we do not have any respect for people who would like to do a trade. If you looked at how industries and small businesses developed and asked every small business owner that started up perhaps in the last 25 years or earlier, `Did you have a university degree? What level of education did you have?' most of the people who have small businesses and have employed people for a long period of time would say, `No, I did not have a university degree,' and many of them might say, `I had very little education at all.' Small business owners with businesses that have been operational for many years are perhaps not as widely educated as many other people, yet they have provided continuous employment for numerous years to people who may not have had any other option.</para><para>We now have a sense that we need to have a degree. If we do not have a degree we are considered lesser than somebody who does have a degree. Most of our schools focus on the academic prowess of their students rather than the assets some students might have of being able to do things brilliantly with their hands. It is time that we as a community and we as leaders in the government and in the House of Representatives should start to understand that students' worth should be valued on things other than how high their academic and UAI scores are.</para><para>It seems that schools now, both private and public, are focused clearly on an academic objective rather than on recognising the talents and attributes of each student and the very real progress that some students might be making towards going into a trade and employing people. It is worth while and it is valuable, yet it almost seems to me now that our students, if they are not academically bright and do not have grades in the 90s, are considered less worth while.</para><para>It is time the leaders of this nation looked to creating a feeling of equity for all students, all children, across Australia. Students should be able to feel that if they want to have a small business and employ people or to do a trade then they are worth while. They should not be looked down on by anybody and they should not be considered different and given less time in their educational pursuits than those who look to go to university. Seventy per cent of our children do not go to universities, yet all of the teachers' time is spent on the 30 per cent who look toward an academic career. Let us give a go to our students who want to enter trades and services, to start to employing people and to create small businesses. Our trades and services are the backbone of rural and regional Australia.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Social Welfare: Disability Services</title><page.no>31761</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>31761</page.no><name role="metadata">Melham, Daryl, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MELHAM</name><name.id>4T4</name.id><electorate>Banks</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish to draw the attention of the chamber to the circumstances of one of my constituents. This highlights the dilemma facing many in our community who have disabilities and their families and others who care for them. A constituent has been in touch with my office about her concerns over her intellectually disabled sister. Until recently the constituent's sister, Carolyn, and her mother lived together. The mother has unfortunately been diagnosed with dementia, so she is no longer able to care for her daughter and is now in a nursing home. Carolyn is 58 years old. Carolyn is unable to understand why her mother is no longer with her. Added to that is the fact that Carolyn's mother is not able to communicate with her because of the dementia, so Carolyn is confused and disoriented. In fact, Carolyn has had a breakdown. Carolyn is virtually homeless and is being cared for in the geriatric unit of a major public hospital in Sydney. While she needs specialist care, she is not geriatric.</para></talk.start><para>This lack of appropriate accommodation is one of the difficulties faced by ageing carers, and these problems will increase with our ageing population. Carers who are parents of middle-aged children with intellectual and physical disabilities will age and will become increasingly unable to care for their children. The Australian Bureau of Statistics found that in 1999 there were 162,300 people with profound severe core activity restriction in New South Wales under the age of 54. There are almost as many with moderate core activity restrictions.</para><para>Of the people in New South Wales with a severe disability, 76,000 were receiving some form of assistance or support from a parent. This support takes the form of assistance with daily tasks such as mobility, communication, health care, transport, self-care, meal preparation and housework and property maintenance. Yet there is little respite or accommodation support available to these people. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare in the 2001 report <inline font-style="italic">Unmet need for disability services</inline> found that as a conservative estimate there were 12,500 people across Australia needing accommodation and respite services. It seems self-evident that the government must give urgent consideration to the accommodation support services needed by many in our community. I repeat: the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare found that there are 12,500 people with disabilities across Australia who need but do not have access to accommodation, respite care and day care services.</para><para>The National Disability Advisory Council end of second term report in December 2003 identified priority issues to be considered over coming years. Priority 4.9 refers to the de-institutionalisation of community housing and support programs and states:</para><quote><para>A cooperative and integrated approach across governments and portfolios is needed to find practical funding solutions to housing and accommodation support options.

It is not going to go away.</para><para>The baby boomer population is ageing and it will no longer be able to care for middle-aged disabled children. Children like Carolyn will find themselves in inappropriate care facilities. Carolyn's family, like many others facing the same predicament, must ask a series of questions: `What will happen to my child when I am no longer here to care for him or her? Where can I go to get support? What sort of future is my child facing? How long will my child need to wait for assistance?' The questions are seemingly endless and the answers, sadly, are just not available.</para><para>This government must give urgent priority to the provision of the accommodation support services needed by so many in our community who are currently unable to access these services. The government must give urgent consideration to the provision of respite services needed by the families and carers of the disabled. Further, the government must address the pressing need for the provision of post-school option services needed by those currently unable to access the support they need to engage in activities during the day. </para><para>Australians with disabilities served by the Commonwealth-State/Territory Disability Agreement are among the most vulnerable in our community. Their disabilities are often lifelong and their support places ongoing strains on their families—strains which are unsustainable. This problem is not going to go away. The government does not have a good record in providing services for the disabled. Given that government is currently throwing around so much money, perhaps some of it could be thrown at those who so desperately need appropriate accommodation and respite support.</para><para>I did not need a tax cut in the last budget but I got it and many like me got it. The government would have been better placed giving that money to services such as this for disabled people and people who need that sort of care. The vulnerable in our community need assistance from government, not the top end of town.

This is something for the residents of Balnarring and for the kids at the Balnarring Primary School, under Principal Rhonda Stephens, who intend to use these facilities. It is for the children at Bittern and Crib Point primary schools. For those three towns there will be a great benefit. I commend the work that the council has done in allocating funds and I renew the promise that I made to introduce them to local service providers—Green Corps and Work for the Dole—and say, please, take that opportunity now so we can begin building these bike paths. They will be a great addition to the community. </para><para>The second issue that I want to talk about is in relation to a letter I received just yesterday from Vicki Stephens, who is the president of the Mount Martha school council. Vicki Stephens points out in her letter that parents of children attending Mount Martha Primary School feel their children are in peril when arriving at and leaving their school due to the traffic congestion and lack of parking spaces close to the school. I know this myself because, during the course of my walk, I walked directly to Mount Martha Primary in the lead-up to school hours commencing and had the same challenges as the parents and children. There is a real need there, as part of the Mornington Peninsula Shire strategy, to have Mount Martha Primary School serviced by adequate bike paths and footpaths.</para><para>At present there are 672 children at the school and this number is expected to grow to 900, so the demand and pressure will only increase. We are about making sure that these things are dealt with before there is a tragedy rather than afterwards, because there is no joy in being wise after the fact. The only value is in solving something now, before it becomes an issue. Having received this letter from Vicki Stephens, I will, firstly, be immediately writing to the Mornington Peninsula Shire Council, as I said I would. Secondly, I am raising it here in the House and, thirdly, I offer again the services of Green Corps and Work for the Dole. So, if there is an allocation from the council for a basic funding provision, we will immediately make these services available to them.</para><para>This is my town, so I speak not as a parent but as a local resident who lives within two kilometres of the school. There is a real need. I have walked those roads—I have walked them at the time of most danger—and I recognise that for the children and the parents in Mount Martha there is a need to update and upgrade the roads and walking facilities and to provide bicycle paths at Mount Martha Primary. I commend both the Balnarring-Bittern bike track and the upgrade at Mount Martha Primary School to the House. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Holt Electorate: Health Services</title><page.no>31763</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>31763</page.no><name role="metadata">Byrne, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BYRNE</name><name.id>008K0</name.id><electorate>Holt</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise today to very briefly discuss a few issues of relevance to my electorate. I want to paint a picture of the region where my electorate lies. It is an incredible growth corridor. It is within the borders of the City of Casey. It has a population of 210,000, and that population is growing by between 60 and 80 families per week. There are 40,000 children in this area between the ages of zero and 12, which is the highest rate of young people in the state of Victoria. This is an area that has a huge number of young families, and a huge number of young families need the sort of social infrastructure that they deserve to keep their communities going. One would expect, given the huge amounts of money that the federal government has put in through this budget—$52 billion over four years—that the social infrastructure that these families require—bulk-billing, access to doctors, access to Medicare offices—would be readily available. But I regret to inform this place that that is not the case.</para></talk.start><para>Over the past three years, from the year 2000 to the end of 2003, the bulk-billing rate in my electorate dropped from approximately 92 per cent to 76 per cent—a drop of roughly 15 per cent. I would like to say that we know that the bulk-billing rate has risen. However, because we cannot get the statistics from the Minister for Health and Ageing, because he is suppressing them—democracy in action, coalition style—I cannot actually tell you that. But I can tell you that I have rung the Dandenong District Division of General Practice, given that these statistics are suppressed, to try and ascertain the effects of the government's measures. At this point in time, what I am being told is that there is no discernible difference. So a huge sum of money has been put into the health budget to allegedly prop up bulk-billing, but in this area where bulk-billing doctors are needed most there has been no discernible increase. If the health minister released the statistics on this perhaps we would have a better idea. However, anecdotally, at this point in time, without the benefit of statistics, I am being told that bulk-billing has not increased—that is, that the rate has not increased from its depth of 76 per cent. </para><para>In this area, with this population of 210,000 people, you would expect that there would be an abundance of Medicare offices. For example, the City of Monash has three Medicare offices, with a population of 165,000. So one would expect, given that ratio, that there should be four or five Medicare offices in the City of Casey. They have none at this point in time. They are about to have one open next week, but they have had no Medicare offices. The Medicare office which has just been funded and will open next week will be based in the Fountain Gate shopping centre. For many years, this shopping centre was the largest shopping centre in Australia that did not have a Medicare office. We had been lobbying for five years to actually get a Medicare office and had been told by the Health Insurance Commission that it was not justified, as the population growth was not sufficient to enable a Medicare office to be placed in the Fountain Gate shopping centre.</para><para>Curiously, in a running visit in the suburb of Narre Warren North, the Prime Minister announced funding for the Medicare office—and I am very grateful to the Prime Minister and to the Health Insurance Commission for that. It would have been better if it had been delivered five years ago. However, it may have something to do with the Fountain Gate shopping centre being right on the border of La Trobe, which is a marginal seat that the government needs to hold to maintain government.</para><para>So the people of the City of Casey know this: they know that they struggled for five years to get a Medicare office and they have just got one; and they know they deserve more than one Medicare office. For example, in the suburb of Cranbourne, that has 30,000 people, roughly 60 families per week are shifting into that particular area and yet they still cannot get a Medicare office. So the City of Casey, population 210,000, just got funding; it just got one Medicare office. The City of Monash has three offices with a population of 165,000.</para><para>I will touch very briefly on doctor shortages. In the City of Casey, the ratio of patients to doctors is one to 2,000—one doctor to 2,000. The recommended ratio is one to 1,400. We have a severe doctor shortage, yet none of these measures that have been proposed by the government even addresses this particular issue. A lady that has a bulk-billing clinic in Hallam, Dr D'Argent, is urgently seeking doctors and still cannot get a doctor out there. So these budget measures that are supposedly propping up bulk-billing and resolving the doctor shortage issue are doing no such thing. In my time remaining I would also point out that 94 per cent of people in my electorate did not get a tax cut—94 per cent. I think those statistics and my discussion about health show that the people of Holt have been dudded by this budget.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Marriage Amendment Bill 2004</title><page.no>31765</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>31765</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Kerry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BARTLETT</name><name.id>0K6</name.id><electorate>Macquarie</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Last week I did not have the opportunity to speak on the <inline ref="R2123">Marriage Amendment Bill 2004</inline> so I want to take this opportunity to put my views on the record. Marriage and the family are the bedrock of our society. They provide the loving, secure and stable environment necessary for building the self-worth, the esteem and confidence of children from the early formative years through to and including adolescence. They are also important in the essential role of building values, understanding right and wrong, and the development of social skills, responsibility and direction. Yet, sadly, the institution of marriage has been under attack in Australia, as it has been around the world, over recent years. In Australia, there are over 50,000 divorces each year, with the projected divorce rate at 32 per cent of all marriages. Twenty-one per cent of Australian children under 15 years are in single-parent families—this figure was 14 per cent just 15 years ago. Marriage provides structure and stability to our society. </para></talk.start><para>The Marriage Act Amendment Bill is necessary to alleviate the growing concerns in Australia at the erosion of the fundamental institutions of marriage and the family. My office has received numerous pieces of correspondence from people in my electorate and other electorates commending the government for this important bill—commending the government for acting decisively, for responding to the needs of Australia and for protecting families and the concept of marriage shared by the vast majority of Australians.</para><para>The bill contained two key amendments. Firstly, the bill codified and provided formal definition to the understanding of marriage held by the overwhelming majority of Australians. Under this bill, section 46 of the Marriage Act formally defines marriage as:</para><quote><para>... the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life.</para></quote><para>This definition has the effect of prohibiting same-sex marriages within Australia and prohibiting Australian legal recognition of foreign same-sex marriages. This definition provides stability to the concept of marriage for all Australians and helps prevent the institution of marriage being eroded—at least in this sense. The concept of marriage held by the majority of Australians, including me, is of an exclusive union between one man and one woman. I believe this is the correct and only definition of marriage.</para><para>The second key amendment made by this bill is a continuation of the government's opposition to adoption by same-sex couples. The government has previously expressed its fundamental opposition to the adoption of children by same-sex couples, and this bill reinforces that position. The bill will prevent same-sex couples from adopting children from overseas under international agreements through bilateral and multilateral treaties. The vast majority of Australians support the government's position that all children have the right to be nurtured, all other things being equal, by a mother and a father. Both mothers and fathers are critically important to the upbringing of children. For a variety of reasons, obviously things do not always work out this way. However, we ought to be doing all we can to start from the premise of what is optimal or what is ideal.</para><para>The Labor Party's response to this bill has been very disappointing. In the Senate, the Labor Party have demonstrated their intention to play political games with the Australian people. The opposition parties have had the bill referred to a Senate committee, where it will sit until after the election. The Labor Party is now courting the minority same-sex marriage lobby by promising to conduct a full audit of all Commonwealth laws on the basis of sexuality. With one breath they are trying to placate the majority of Australians by claiming that they support this bill, but with the next breath they are leaving their options open to throw it out. I want to make the point that this legislation is not in any way aimed at discriminating against homosexual couples. Indeed, the government's other legislation to remove discrimination regarding superannuation makes it very clear that it is not homophobic. The government is committed to equal rights wherever that is possible but, equally, the government is clearly committed to doing all it can to retain the institution of marriage as the bedrock of families in our community. </para><para>In summary, marriage and families are foundational institutions for Australians. We cannot always prevent families breaking down, but we have to do everything we can, in whichever area we can, to reinforce the basis of marriage for our families. The government is committed to protecting this institution through this important bill, by providing clarity to the definition of marriage and reinforcing restrictions on the adoption of children. I am pleased that this bill has been introduced and supported by this government.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Collins, Former Senator Robert (Bob) Lindsay</title><page.no>31766</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>31766</page.no><name role="metadata">Snowdon, Warren, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SNOWDON</name><name.id>IJ4</name.id><electorate>Lingiari</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Let me thank my colleague for letting me jump the queue.</para></talk.start><para><inline font-weight="bold">An honourable member</inline>—I am quite happy with that.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>IJ4</name.id><name role="metadata">Snowdon, Warren, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SNOWDON</name></talker><para>—He is happy that I have jumped the queue. I think he is trying to collect his thoughts after a good evening. I want to inform the House of an accident that has occurred involving a former colleague of ours here in this place who is a former Hawke and Keating government minister, has been a personal friend of mine for 30 years and is a great Territorian. I am, of course, speaking of Bob Collins. Bob was a senator here from 1987 until I think five years ago. He has been involved in a rather bad car accident. This occurred while he was travelling alone in his vehicle on the Jim Jim Road in Kakadu National Park while heading home to Darwin last Sunday.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We are told that Bob swerved to avoid a pig, rolled the car and hit a tree. That is not unusual in the Northern Territory—animals cause accidents, and this is yet another one. Sadly, it has affected Bob. He was able to get out of the vehicle and was evacuated to Darwin, where they assessed the nature of his injuries. After making that assessment, they determined that he was in a serious but stable condition. A decision was then made to fly him to the Royal Adelaide Hospital. So he was flown to Adelaide for quite complicated orthopaedic surgery to his lower body. I understand that an operation took place yesterday. I was informed this morning that he is now in a serious but stable condition. </para><para>I know that his wife, Rosemary, and his children, Robbie, Elizabeth and Dan, are with him. I am sure that I speak on behalf of all who know him, and certainly those who know him around the parliament, in wishing him a speedy recovery. Our hearts go out to his family in this stressful time. My heart has been warmed by the number of people in the last 24 hours who, having heard about this unfortunate incident, have asked me to pass on their best wishes to Bob and his family and to wish him a speedy recovery. Those wishes have come from people who work in this place—people from the library, car drivers, attendants and colleagues. That is an indication of the esteem in which Bob is held in this place, and elsewhere around the country. He is truly a national character. </para><para>I know that all the people who know him will, like us, be concerned about his accident and will wish him a speedy recovery. After all, he is a very important person, because not only did he play a very important role in this place as a senior minister and as a senator for the Northern Territory but, since leaving the parliament and going back to the Territory, he has fulfilled a number of very important roles. He is currently, as you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, employed by the South Australian government to do a lot of very good work in the Pitjantjatjara lands to the north of South Australia. I think the South Australian government, the Northern Territory government and all the other people who deal with him professionally would like to see him back at work. That is not going to happen for some time as he goes through this period of recovery. But we say to him: `Don't hasten the recovery just to get back to work; take your time. Make sure your body heals. Get yourself into a frame of mind where you are ready to take up the challenge once again.' Bob, we wish you a very quick recovery. We want to see you happy and healthy, as you always were, with your beaming face, your great sense of humour and your ability to bring us good will. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>McPherson Electorate: Gold Coast Rugby League Team</title><page.no>31767</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>31767</page.no><name role="metadata">May, Margaret, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs MAY</name><name.id>83B</name.id><electorate>McPherson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On the Gold Coast, the cries of `Where's my team?' will soon be replaced by applause and cheers for the Gold Coast Dolphins if the National Rugby League grants the 16th rugby league licence to the Gold Coast city. Make no mistake, I believe the NRL will grant our city the 16th licence in the not-too-distant future. I have been a director of the Gold Coast NRL bid team for 12 months now, and I was proud to attend the national press conference and the live-to-air taping of <inline font-style="italic">The Footy Show</inline> two weeks ago at the Gold Coast Arts Centre, where the name, the logo, the mascot and the colours of the Gold Coast team were announced and paraded before a sell-out Gold Coast crowd.</para></talk.start><para>The Gold Coast Dolphins, who will wear teal, white and gold, will be represented by Davo the Dolphin. This press conference and live-to-air <inline font-style="italic">The Footy Show</inline> united the Gold Coast in a way I have never seen before. We sold every ticket for the corporate event prior to <inline font-style="italic">The Footy Show</inline> and all tickets for <inline font-style="italic">The Footy Show</inline> within an hour of them going on sale. That is support and commitment from a city that is hungry for its own football team. Some 1,500 people attended <inline font-style="italic">The Footy Show</inline> with Fatty Vautin and the team, and they all went home clutching a lift-out from the <inline font-style="italic">Gold Coast Bulletin</inline> which had the name, colours and logo of the team on it. </para><para>The Gold Coast has had a long association with rugby league, and the city just want to have a team playing in our colours for our city as soon as possible. In 1909 the first rugby league team outside Sydney was formed at Tweed Heads. While it was to be another 80 years before we were to get a national team—in the Gold Coast/Tweed Giants—rugby league was a sport that drew the Gold Coast together. From 1990 to 1998 the Gold Coast team, despite sound management, did not do too well on the field, leaving the NRL with little choice but to exclude a Gold Coast team from a revamped, smaller competition. It was a shame for those living on the coast, as well as those living in the Hunter and in Adelaide, but after years of strife it was the only way rugby league could get kick-started again. Now that uncertainty and the problems are over and it is time for the Gold Coast to again take its rightful place in the national competition.</para><para>The Dolphins are able to demonstrate strong community support for their submission. They have strong business support, including potential major sponsors and significant support from the rugby league community nationally. In fact a recent poll showed that the vast majority of rugby league players surveyed supported a Gold Coast team. I think they all want to come and live on the Gold Coast! It is very clear that a Gold Coast team has more than enough support to thrive in the world of our National Rugby League competition.</para><para>Dolphins chairman Paul Broughton said, `We've proven that our team is ready, willing and able and we can get fans to the game.' We even have a coach. John Cartwright, a former Kangaroo and State of Origin player who in recent years has been assistant coach of the Roosters and of the New South Wales State of Origin team, has accepted the role of coach of the Dolphins. This is one of the most important appointments the team can make—it is a real coup for the Dolphins. John has said that he is ready for the challenge of coaching an NRL team. It ensures that with John at the helm our team will hit the ground running if we get the green light to play in 2006. </para><para>The press conference sparked interest from all corners of Australia as the Gold Coast Dolphins web site came online. The web site, www.goldcoastdolphins.com, was one of the most accessed web sites that week. Of course, no team could be launched without a theme song—and what a theme song: <inline font-style="italic">I'm a Believer</inline>. And yes, we are believers. We believe in our city and we believe in our bid. The song will become synonymous with our Gold Coast Dolphins. The thousands of Gold Coasters who packed into Carrara Stadium during the trial matches are believers and the thousands who jumped online to the Dolphins web site are believers. Now all that remains is for the National Rugby League to allow the passionate supporters of a team that does not even exist yet to have an outlet for that passion and give the Gold Coast our own rugby league team. We have the means and we have the passion; now all we need is the team.</para><para>I warn the member for Sydney and her Roosters, I warn the member for Newcastle and her Knights, and I warn the member for Cook and his Sharks that the Dolphins are coming and they are going to make a big splash on the field in 2006.

The Deer Park bypass, for those who do not know, is a very important transport link between Melbourne and Ballarat, and it will certainly improve the efficiency of travel for freight and for personal use. In effect, it will alleviate the enormous congestion that is currently experienced by residents in Caroline Springs, Burnside, Deer Park, Ardeer and parts of Sunshine. It will also alleviate congestion in parts of my electorate that have been suffering from the heavy congestion that has grown over recent years as a result of the fast growth of the area. That region is the fastest growing area of Melbourne—indeed of Victoria.</para></talk.start><para>The Deer Park bypass, on anyone's measure, is an urgent necessity, and I am very happy to say that Labor has committed to fully fund it and to commence it in the 2005-06 financial year, if elected—and, of course, that is the big proviso. Unfortunately, the current government has not given a commitment to fund the Deer Park bypass and has chosen to look after Geelong only, at the expense of Ballarat, Bacchus Marsh, Melton and those areas I have already referred to. That is a very big disappointment.</para><para>So, whilst I can allay the concerns of my constituents by informing them that construction will commence next financial year if Labor is elected, unfortunately, if Labor is not elected, the only commitment that this current government has given with respect to that crucial transport link is that there will be up to $80 million provided—it would appear from the budget documents and from recent statements by the Minister for Transport and Regional Services—no earlier than 2008-09, with no definite decision as to the remainder; that is, the further $250 million required for the construction. In my view, there is no point giving only $80 million without giving any definite time for the balance. Given that much of the $80 million would be spent on the Leakes Road intersection, I think it would leave no more than just over $40 million for what is a $294 million construction. So, effectively, we are nearly a quarter of a billion dollars short in terms of commitments from this government with respect to what I think is the most important transport link in Victoria—certainly for my electorate. I welcome the announcement by the shadow minister, Martin Ferguson, and the commitment by Labor's leader, the executive and Labor generally.  </para><para>I pay tribute to those constituents who turned out at two public meetings I recently held. One was on 9 June at Sassella Hall in Deer Park, where over 100 people attended on a wet, wintry night. That was a testament to the concern they have that this road has not been built and their concern that, of the major political parties, only Labor has committed to the construction. At a subsequent meeting held last Thursday at the Multimedia Centre in Caroline Springs, about 100 people attended on a wet, cold night to voice their concerns, to make sure their voice was heard loudly by this government, and to say that there is a need to commit to fully fund the Deer Park bypass—as Labor has given a commitment to do—because it is so important.</para><para>For those people in Caroline Springs, it is a burden every day just trying to get in and out of their area onto the Western Highway—dropping their kids off at school, going to work or going to visit friends or family. It is becoming an increasing burden because of the growth in the area. The fact is that only Labor is committed to this very important transport link. The Howard government has been left wanting. That is another reason that we have to see a change of government at the next election. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Agriculture: Fire Blight</title><page.no>31769</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>31769</page.no><name role="metadata">Stone, Dr Sharman, MP</name><name role="display">Dr STONE</name><name.id>EM6</name.id><electorate>Murray</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On Tuesday some 7,000 men, women and children marched in the streets of Shepparton. In the freezing weather they came together and moved slowly in a funeral procession following the hearses and the grim reapers to the local Shepparton oval. And there, after speeches, a match was put to a huge pile of fruit boxes and, as they burned, people renewed their commitment to fighting as hard as they can an unstoppable disease called fire blight.</para></talk.start><para>Those 7,000 people were there to show their support for the growers, cannery workers, drivers, packers, farm suppliers and the individuals and families who depend on the fruit and apple or pome industry for a good life in this great country. They were there to insist that only the best science is used and prevails, so that apples from any fire blighted country are banned or there are such strict and tough conditions put in place that there can never be any chance of the disease breaking through our quarantine barriers. And let us not kid ourselves: this disease, apple and pear fire blight, would wipe out our pear industry and cripple apples as they are grown in this country.</para><para>Biosecurity Australia itself states that the loss of fruit, higher costs and lost income would see a 55 to 60 per cent permanent decline in apple and pear production in this country. Our dairy farmers know what it is like to lose 50 per cent of their income. We know that you cannot survive a 55 to 60 per cent drop in your production and associated income. Noone would be left standing. Their effort would be wiped out with such a loss. As well as the disease itself, apple and pear fire blight, there are another 21 quarantinable pests that can hitchhike a ride on fresh New Zealand apples—New Zealand is currently the country which is pushing forward to see their product exported to Australia. </para><para>Our apple and pear fruit growers are the smartest and best in the country, particularly those in the Goulburn and Murray valleys. The cannery, SPC Ardmona, is an Aussie icon. It depends on pears and the production surrounding it. Our pome fruit industry has worked smart and hard and invested hundreds of millions of dollars over generations to build a clean, green image for the domestic and export markets. Many of our growers arrived as migrants with little more than a single suitcase. Today, they and their families are the backbone of the industry, along with those who came in the 1800s. We are proud of the Goulburn Valley and the Murray Valley and the sweat and tears that have gone into making this area the food bowl of Australia. Most of Australia's pears grow in the Goulburn Valley. We have so much to lose if this disease gets into the country and gets loose in our orchards.</para><para>Pears do not survive fire blight. Sure, some apple trees do, but you need to drench them in antibacterial sprays and continuously cut back the black, dead and dying branches. In the USA, the original home of fire blight, the disease adds 30 per cent to the chemical costs alone, not to mention the damage done to their clean, green credentials, to the environment and to human health. This disease could take hold in your garden or in the host woody weeds along the roads on its way to establishing itself in orchards, and you never get rid of it. No country has ever eradicated fire blight. It is the mad cow disease of fruit, but it does not hurt humans; it just kills trees and the communities that grow those trees.</para><para>We have had a ban on imports of fresh apples from New Zealand for over 80 years. Sadly for them, they got the disease just after the First World War. The local New Zealanders who joined the march in Shepparton the other day—the New Zealanders who are now part of our fruit and dairy community in the region—joined with locals, stood shoulder to shoulder and said, `We know what it is like to live with fire blight; don't let it happen here.' The rules of international trade, of course, mean that Biosecurity has to process a New Zealand application for removing the apple import ban. New Zealand has asked that the ban be replaced with a set of apple treatments or a protocol that removes the risk of bacteria getting a free ride into our country. That is precisely what the people of Shepparton were asking and do ask of Biosecurity Australia; no more, no less. They ask that Biosecurity Australia correctly and accurately access and acknowledge the risk and then put the world's toughest set of measures in place to fight the fruit industry's toughest disease so we can end this debate forever. Our pome fruit industry must have security and protection from disease. It does not want trade protection; it does not ask for that.

To hear a representative of the apple and pear industry and of her electorate stand up in this place as a part of this government and say, `I'm against what my government is doing,' and somehow associate herself with the protesters who have been protesting against the government that she is a part of represents incredibly hypocrisy, incredible gall. What is the slogan of Sharman Stone going to be at the next federal election? `Vote for me. I'm a part of a government that wants to bring fire blight into Australia.' That should be Sharman Stone's election slogan at the next election: `Vote for me. I want to destroy the apple and pear industry in Australia.' What an amazing cheek to stand up in this place and try and present herself as being different from the government that she is a junior minister in and which has set in train this process that is bringing from New Zealand into Australia these apples and pears that are disease ridden and that are going to break the hearts of the people and break the apple and pear industry in Australia. What an amazing thing to hear. What an incredible thing for her to have said in this place. </para></talk.start><para>But I want to speak about something positive today. I had not come in here to make that comment about Sharman Stone, the honourable member opposite; but I could not let that go without remarking on it. It is an incredible thing for her to have said—incredible hypocrisy. I want to talk about a gutsy little country town in my electorate called Trafalgar, where people are very self-reliant, hardworking and get things done for themselves. A few years back Trafalgar had, like a lot of country towns, the closure of a number of the bank branches. The National Australia Bank pulled out and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia pulled out, and it really was a big blow to the town when that happened. But people in the town are hardworking and they come together at times like this, and they have now successfully put in place a Community Bank branch of the Bendigo Bank. </para><para>I want to congratulate the town on that great achievement, and I want to congratulate some of the key people who have been the driving force behind this great local initiative. Frank Hernadi, a local stock and station agent, has been one of the key prime movers in all of this. Councillor Bill Harrington, a councillor from the district, a fine representative and a good man, has been working hard on this project as well, as has a local small businessman who runs the local community supermarket, Geoff Hasthorpe. Well done to all the people involved in making the Community Bank branch of the Bendigo Bank in Trafalgar a reality. It is a great achievement. There have been many other people involved, and I do not have time today to mention all of them, but they know who they are. They have really been a part of a great local initiative and a great local success story. We really applaud their efforts and I congratulate them on bringing the town together behind such an important initiative.</para><para>In relation to another matter, there has been a concerted community effort in the town of Mirboo North for some time to get a community based child-care centre in the township. There has been a lot of good work done by the steering committee over a considerable period of time, and they have been able to secure the use of the Uniting Church hall site in the town as a place for them to base their child-care centre. They have done a lot of good work, and they have had some support from the local South Gippsland Shire Council. In particular, they have been strongly supported by Councillor David Lewis, who is the councillor who covers Mirboo North. I want to congratulate them on their effort. They have approached the federal government for support for a capital grant to build the centre, and at this stage they have been told that the answer is no—that there is no money available from the federal government for this project. It is a good project and it is something which should be supported. They are asking for only a small amount of money for a capital grant. I think that where a community helps itself in the way that Mirboo North always does and where people come together in the way they have through the Mirboo North child-care project steering committee, the government should support it. I call on the Howard government today to not be mean and stingy in relation to this project but to back this important community initiative in Mirboo North. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Schools: Funding</title><page.no>31772</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>31772</page.no><name role="metadata">Neville, Paul, MP</name><name role="display">Mr NEVILLE</name><name.id>KV5</name.id><electorate>Hinkler</electorate><party>NATS</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We have all thoroughly debated the private-public school funding exercise this week, but I would like to add to my previous contributions—notably on the MPI, which reveals my core position. Let me make it perfectly clear, as I have in the past: I am not an apologist for either the private or the public system, but I am a fierce advocate of choice and equity in education. This week, two representatives of the Queensland Teachers Union paid me a visit. While not doubting their personal sincerity, it is my firm conviction that the campaign being driven by the Australian Education Union and its state body, the QTU, is misleading, biased and divisive. It does not try to inject fairness or rational debate into the argument; rather it skews the campaign's attention to the minority funding component, namely the Commonwealth's. It does not refer to the states contribution to ensure funding for the schools that they are charged to resource.</para></talk.start><para>Using Queensland as an example, this is evidenced by funding over the past two years. In the first instance the Commonwealth's contribution increased by 5.4 per cent but the state's contribution increased by only 2.4 per cent. If the Queensland government had simply matched the Commonwealth's contribution in percentage terms, Queensland state schools would have enjoyed another $116 million. In the second of the two years, after a record budget and a $2.3 billion surplus, the Queensland government's contribution to state schools increased by only 3.9 per cent whereas the Commonwealth's contribution rose by 4.8 per cent—another $25 million shortfall. In other words, over two years state schools had suffered a $141 million shortfall during a period which returned a record surplus budget. That is neglect. The money could have built new classrooms, renovated run-down state schools—which Labor members are always talking about—airconditioned oppressively hot classrooms and replaced demountable buildings.</para><para>I am a fierce advocate of all the schools in my electorate. There have been more ministerial visits to my schools since I have been the member than under any previous representation. Education minister Brendan Nelson has even called Bundaberg's Kepnock State High School one of the finest in Australia. In Gladstone in recent years the comparatively new Tannum Sands State High School received $8.82 million in public funds—more than triple the funds of the three private schools combined. My next target is the Gladstone State High School, which has done all the heavy lifting over the last 30 or so years to make sure its facilities are up with the best. Ultimately, of course, the Commonwealth's recommendation goes to the state minister, and it will be her choice. My children have attended both education systems so I am familiar with the strengths and the weaknesses of both.</para><para>We must recognise that taxation, whether it be income tax, GST or state taxes, all comes from the pockets of the average taxpayer in the end. The ultimate test of fairness is seeing where the money ends up after going through the state and federal systems. The 2.25 million students in state schools get $19.9 billion in funding, whereas $6.2 billion goes to 1.1 million children in private schools, which also receive $4.1 billion, or 40 per cent of their total revenue, from the fees paid by parents. It is also true that the bulk of federal funding goes to the less wealthy Catholic, Anglican, Christian and Aboriginal community schools—not to the so-called rich schools. The general principle is that private school students are paid on a socioeconomic basis according to residential census collection districts. It is not a matter of rich or poor schools; it is a matter of a family's need based on the socioeconomic profile of its neighbourhood. </para><para>I put it to the two QTU representatives that to validate their organisation's argument they should surely argue that the state also support the private schools. I was met with adamant opposition. Ninety-one or 92 per cent of state funding goes to state schools and eight or nine per cent goes to private schools. The AEU has not yet come to the inescapable conclusion that any alteration to this system by the ALP would destroy equity and fairness. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Centrelink</title><page.no>31773</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>31773</page.no><name role="metadata">Hall, Jill, MP</name><name role="display">Ms HALL</name><name.id>83N</name.id><electorate>Shortland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Last Friday I met with three employees of a local minute market on the Central Coast of New South Wales. The store employs six workers, and, out of those six employees, three had problems with Centrelink. I would like to bring these complaints to the attention of the chamber. Before I detail the complaints that these three women made to me about their dealings with Centrelink, I have to say that the employer, the owner of the store, arranged for me to visit them at his premises. He was so concerned about the treatment his employees were receiving from Centrelink that he said that they were being harassed by Centrelink.</para></talk.start><para>Firstly, I will deal with the case of a lady who works 24 hours a week. Her partner is on Newstart and he is very ill and unable to work. She received a Centrelink debt. Every month she receives correspondence from Centrelink, and sometimes she receives the same correspondence twice a month or every day and then she has to complete the information form. She feels that Centrelink are constantly checking on her, constantly disbelieving the information that she is forwarding to them. Once they have interviewed her, they will turn around and ask her partner exactly the same questions. When she submits the information about her work and her income, sometimes it takes her four hours to get through on the telephone to Centrelink. Her son has recently been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and she has had quite a considerable amount of difficulty being approved for the carer's allowance. She has been told one thing and then been given different information, and by the time she submits the form it will be a considerable time since she first approached Centrelink. So she has had these ongoing problems.</para><para>The next employee I would like to deal with is a university student who works eight hours a week. On a number of occasions she has had her Centrelink Youth Allowance payments stopped without warning. Her parents are very low income earners and she receives correspondence saying that her parents have earned too much money, only to receive more information the next day saying that she should be reinstated. The fact that she is only allowed to earn $240 a week she believes is a disincentive for her to work longer hours and she feels that there should be more of a sliding scale and that this should be tied to the CPI and increased from time to time.</para><para>The other lady I would like to talk about is a supporting mother who works 16 hours a week at the same minute market and has recently received a debt of $6,000. Centrelink just stopped paying her. She gets $210 a week in wages. From the first payment that she received from Centrelink after they discovered the debt, Centrelink took $200 out of her payment. My office will be negotiating with Centrelink because this lady is working 16 hours a week for $10. She believes she has always given the correct information to Centrelink and she feels that the fact that Centrelink make a cut in her payment and then notify her does not give her the opportunity to work out the problem or even to understand it. She still does not know where she incurred this debt.  </para><para>To me, these instances say that there is an ongoing problem with Centrelink. They say that the systems are not working. I know the staff are very dedicated and do their utmost to provide a service for people in receipt of Centrelink payments. I call on the government to revise the systems that are not working to ensure that ordinary, average people who rely on Centrelink are not disadvantaged. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Agriculture: Industrial Hemp</title><page.no>31774</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>31774</page.no><name role="metadata">Scott, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BRUCE SCOTT</name><name.id>YT4</name.id><electorate>Maranoa</electorate><party>NATS</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to talk about a very important industry that is in the cinderella stages of its development in Australia and that has a significant role to play in the future. Over the past 10 years, Ecofibre Industries has developed the necessary industrial hemp varieties for viable commercial cropping purposes. CSIRO research indicates that, by 2050, the world population is expected to double. A new, sustainable source of fibres must be able to be produced if we are to meet the future demand from the rise in population around the world. Australia has the capacity, through this new industry, to meet this growing demand. We have the varieties, the growers and the technology. However, what we need and do not have is the necessary processing infrastructure. That is why I rise in the parliament today.</para></talk.start><para>It is important that people understand that ultralow THC industrial hemp is not a drug. Industrial hemp is a fibre commodity capable of addressing the consumption requirements of the modern world. I am pleased to advise the House that bipartisan support led to the establishment of Queensland legislation on commercial cropping of industrial hemp in October 2002. Although some other states have the necessary legislation, it is anticipated that in the near future other states will have legislation establishing all of Australia as a potential growing area for this crop.</para><para>Ecofibre's crop over the past few years has been growing in the Darling Downs, south Burnett, Wide Bay and Mackay regions, amongst others across Australia. The raw hemp stalk is presently harvested and exported to France for processing and value adding. This product is then imported back into Australia—at considerable expense and loss of jobs, obviously—to meet our market demand in Australia. It is imperative for the future development of the industry in Australia that sufficient investment capital is secured to construct a fibre-processing mill in regional Queensland.</para><para>Some of the products that can be produced from hemp are: superior paper pulp fibres, which reduce the need for deforestation; biodegradable plastics; automotive and aerospace components; animal bedding for the horseracing industry; absorbent materials used in oil spill and chemical containment; woven and non-woven textiles; building products and insulation; and, importantly, ethanol. Just about anything produced from crude oil can be manufactured using industrial hemp.</para><para>Australia's signing of the free trade agreement with the United States provides us with an opportunity for millions of dollars of export capacity and opportunity which will create numerous jobs in hemp growing and processing, particularly in regional and rural Australia. Presently, the United States of America imports its hemp from Europe and Canada, as there is legislation preventing the cropping of industrial hemp in the United States of America. Australia is poised to meet the demand of this new and emerging market. </para><para>Currently, the challenge is to fulfil the capital requirements for the establishment of the first Australian industrial hemp fibre processing mill. My electorate of Maranoa presents such an opportunity, because it is a growing region for industrial hemp. In fact, across the Darling Downs and out through the western Darling Downs hemp could be grown. Growers already have been commercially growing hemp in small, 10-hectare crops near Dalby and in the heart of the Darling Downs. This year we are set to grow some 200 hectares—all of which will have to be exported, sadly, to France if we cannot get a mill to establish this processing and value adding here in Australia.</para><para>With vision and commitment, Australia has the capacity to become the world's leading supplier of sustainable, environmentally friendly techniques for fibre production. It will be a new agricultural industry, one that will create jobs in regional Australia. It is environmentally friendly. Hemp can, as I outlined a moment ago, replace many products that are made from crude oil. I recommend to the parliament, and to those who are working on this vital and new industry, that we get behind this and make sure we can get the capital to have a processing plant in Australia to see these jobs in Australia and not in France. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Cunningham Electorate: Australian Greens</title><page.no>31775</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>31775</page.no><name role="metadata">Organ, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ORGAN</name><name.id>BNL</name.id><electorate>Cunningham</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As the House adjourns for the winter recess and members return to their electorates, it is timely to reflect upon the work of this place, upon the needs of the people of Cunningham, upon those who support the work of members of this place and upon the increasing importance of the Greens in the political landscape of this nation. A lot has been achieved since I was elected on 19 October 2002, and I look forward at the next election to being joined in this House by more Greens and also to the number of Greens senators increasing substantially.</para></talk.start><para>The Australian public continues to look to the Greens as the third major force in Australian politics, and the differentiation between us and the major parties continues to be striking. We only have to look at the Prime Minister's so-called green energy statement last week to realise that the future wellbeing of this nation does not lie with the LiberalNational coalition. They are too tied to vested interests to develop a broad enough vision which puts at its head the wellbeing and prosperity of every Australian, not just a few. Likewise, we have seen the opposition under a new leader go into small target mode prior to an election and stand behind the government on major issues. How many backflips have we seen this week? Labor have backflipped on the FTA and there is the disgraceful sell-out of the PBS, increasing the copayment by $4.90 for every script in order to pay for tax cuts for the rich as part of one of their pre-election promises. The differentiation between the Greens and the major parties continues to be stark, and the voters of Australia know this. The Greens are a party of principle, and we have seen a decided abandonment of principle by the opposition in this place in recent months. The government are, however, true to form and the sooner we get rid of them the better.</para><para>As I said, the winter break gives us a chance to work in our electorates, talk to people, find out their concerns and bring those concerns to the attention of government and bureaucracy. As every member of this place knows, our staff play a vital role in ensuring that we remain focused on serving the needs of our constituents. I have been privileged to have some wonderful staff working with me over the past 19 months, and I would like to make reference to some of them. They include Ian Miles, my first campaign manager, and my original staff, Nadine Torney, Allison Gibbons and Lorraine Woods, who helped me through the first three hectic months amidst a sharp learning curve. My present and most recent staff include Allan Clark, Carol Berry, Kristian Bolwell, Theresa Huxtable, Sharon Callaghan, Stewart Jackson and Jason Hart, not to mention the many volunteers who have enthusiastically given of their time, such as Sue Sergent. Also of great assistance have been numerous people in the Greens who have provided their time, energy, enthusiasm, commitment and knowledge to help support the historic Cunningham election victory. I would most especially like to mention Senators Bob Brown and Kerry Nettle and former staffer Ben Oquist. </para><para>The other big element in our lives as members of this place is our families. Their love, help and guidance, usually on a daily basis, are integral in ensuring that we are able to best serve the people of Australia. I want to thank my wife Jeanette, my sons Andrew and Kyle, my mother Roma, my sister Denise, my brother Terry and my many nieces and nephews, all of whom have played a role in support and in areas such as babysitting so that the time constraints inherent in the role of a federal member of parliament do not completely subsume the needs of the family. Countless friends and supporters also play an important role.</para><para>It is sobering to remember that, as we discuss matters of national and international import in this place, it is to the local electorate—our local community—that we must answer. As I speak, my community, my friends, are going about their normal lives and also fighting to ensure that the quality of life they enjoy is passed down to their children and their children's children, to ensure that we make the world a better place to live in. For example, the people of the northern Illawarra are once more fighting Wollongong City Council to ensure that the Sandon Point Aboriginal tent embassy and the Sandon Point community picket are not forcibly closed or removed by Wollongong City Council. The fight for Sandon Point—to protect, for example, its nationally significant Aboriginal burial sites and other culturally significant areas—has been going on since the late 1980s. The federal, state and local governments have continually worked against the local community and let them down, but the fight continues and many issues remain unresolved.</para><para>A jackbooted approach by Wollongong City Council at this point in time will solve nothing. Council is supposed to represent the community, yet with regard to Sandon Point it has been an abject failure. It has merely represented the interests of the developers, who care nought for the cultural and environmental heritage values of the site or the quality of life of the local people. It is issues such as Sandon Point and, for example, the increase to the PBS announced just yesterday which impact harshly on the people of Cunningham and which it is my clear role to address. I am honoured by this opportunity to be the federal member for Cunningham, and I look forward to continuing in that role and working hard with my staff, supporters and the people of Cunningham in the months and years ahead. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Eden-Monaro Electorate: Roads</title><page.no>31777</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>31777</page.no><name role="metadata">Nairn, Gary, MP</name><name role="display">Mr NAIRN</name><name.id>OK6</name.id><electorate>Eden-Monaro</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Across Australia probably one of the most important pieces of infrastructure is our road system. No matter where you live, roads are certainly a major piece of infrastructure. That is particularly so in an electorate like Eden-Monaro, which I represent, because some other forms of transport are not as good as they used to be. For instance, the only train service that we have had into my electorate comes into Queanbeyan and then goes on to Canberra. We do not have a rail service anywhere else in the electorate; the rail service down the coast stops before it gets to Eden-Monaro. Even the train service that comes into Queanbeyan has been cut right back and is nothing like it used to be even nine months ago. The importance of roads is certainly understood by this government, and that is why recently we had the announcement of the AusLink project, which looked at our transport infrastructure across the nation. One part of that transport infrastructure is roads. </para></talk.start><para>We have had lots of debate about who is responsible for what. One of the most irritating aspects of being a federal member is the constant debate about who should build what. When I was elected in 1996, I thought that everything was pretty straightforward because of an agreement between the Commonwealth and the states early in the 1990s with respect to road funding, which effectively from my point of view said, `The federal government looks after certain roads which will be part of a national system, the state government will look after certain roads which are state highways and then local government will look after their local roads.' The Federal Highway coming into Canberra was the only federal road in my area. The other highways are state highways, and the states are adequately funded through a variety of ways. But that seems to change, particularly when elections come around and people try to get certain things done and start making all sorts of claims.</para><para>You cannot get away from the fact that in the coastal part of my electorate the Princes Highway, which is a state highway and has been accepted as a state highway by successive state governments of differing political persuasions, has been neglected, particularly in the far part. The state government has been bragging for some time that it is putting $300-odd million into the Princes Highway over 10 years, but when you look at it closely you see that some of that money is federal money and that most of it is being spent around the Wollongong area. In fact over the next 10 years south of Kiama the state government will spend only about $5 million a year on the Princes Highway. That has been a frustrating debate. </para><para>Interestingly, in regard to AusLink we announced that $20 million out of the Black Spots Roads Program, which is a great program that we have been able to access across Australia, will be applied specifically to the Princes Highway. That means that we will be putting twice as much into the Princes Highway south of Kiama as the New South Wales government is, and it is responsible for the damn thing. Pambula Bridge will get $5 million of that amount. This has been debated for some time. In February this year, because the New South Wales government will not live up to its responsibility, I suggested that the additional $5 million could come out of the regionally strategic aspect of the extended Roads to Recovery program. Taking the money out of the Black Spots Roads Program, as it was announced and as it is budgeted for, is obviously a better solution.</para><para>In the meantime the Labor Party ran around saying, `Yes, we will fund it,' but nobody has been able to indicate out of what fund that money will come and how it will be paid for. The additional $5 million to ensure that Pambula Bridge is replaced is in the Black Spots Roads Program part of the budget—it is there and it is ready. The New South Wales government should spend its money and get on with it as fast as possible. It has been putting it off for a couple of years because it did not have the money. It clearly did not have the money, because we have seen it increasing taxes all over the place. But now that it knows that our money is there it will be interesting to see its money and get this thing fixed once and for all. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Labor Party: Retiring Members</title><page.no>31778</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>31778</page.no><name role="metadata">Hatton, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HATTON</name><name.id>LN6</name.id><electorate>Blaxland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr Deputy Speaker Mossfield, it is lucky that you happen to be in the chair, because I want to take a little time to say thank you to the Labor members of parliament who will not be continuing as federal representatives after the coming election.

I thank Janice Crosio, the member for Prospect, who came into this House in 1990 after initially serving a mayoralty in her home city and then going into state parliament, where she became a minister. Here Janice has served on a broad number of committees and is now the Chief Opposition Whip. </para></talk.start><para>We also have Leo McLeay, who yesterday celebrated 25 years in the federal parliament, and Laurie Brereton, the member for Kingsford Smith, who was a state member several times over and a state minister who was willing to take really tough decisions—the most difficult of which was the `beds to the west' decision to move hospital facilities to the western part of Sydney. This provided services to where the majority of the population of Sydney was living and would in the future live—people in areas such as Greenway, which is the area the Deputy Speaker represents, as well as other areas.</para><para>The commonality of all of those members is the fact that they are Labor members, but there also a commonality in their length of service to the Labor movement both inside and outside the House. The member for Greenway has given distinguished and long service to the trade union movement in New South Wales. The member for Watson—previously the member for Grayndler—Leo McLeay, has had a distinguished service within ALP head office.</para><para>Two of these people had a particular significance for me eight years ago when I came into this place. Two people usher you forward when you present yourself to the Speaker, and Leo McLeay and Janice Crosio were my federal sponsors into this House. They mirror two different traditions within the New South Wales branch: one came through from local council and state government and then to the federal level; the other came in through service directly to the party in its organisational wing as well as in local council, and then into the federal parliament.</para><para>It has been a great privilege for me during the past eight years. I was a bit of a latecomer, arriving three months after everyone else in 1996. They put me in the departure lounge, so I was sitting just behind Clyde Holding and Barry Jones and right next to me was Bobby Brown, the then member for Charlton. After some time—about 18 months or so—Leo, who was then whip, came to me and said, `Would you like to move closer to the action?' I said I was actually quite comfortable for this parliament to be in the departure lounge, because you can learn an enormous amount, as I had been doing already, from those people who had served so long in the parliament. It was a rare opportunity, day by day in question time, to be able to talk to them and to draw on their experience, and I hoped to use that knowledge to some effect in the years ahead.</para><para>Longevity in this game is something that does not come to everyone. Many people come through and do not serve very long in the parliament. The distinguished service that Laurie Brereton has given at state level and as the member for Kingsford-Smith, that Janice Crosio has given in the state and federal parliaments and that Leo McLeay has given in serving here for 25 years, reaching what is effectively ministerial level as Speaker during the Hawke-Keating government and then serving as Chief Opposition Whip, is pretty hard to do year in year out. But what it has meant for the electorates of all those people is that there has been a continuity of service and a continuity of commitment. And it means that the fundamental connections between the electors and the elected remain very strong.

Mr Deputy Speaker, you could ask why I as a federal member am raising the subject of New South Wales funded roads in this House. I raise it because this year we have given just under $16 billion of federal money to the New South Wales government, and the people in my electorate of Paterson demand that their money—the tax that they pay both to the New South Wales government and to the federal government—be spent back in their area.</para></talk.start><para>For the Dungog road system, Dungog Council received $400,000 for a little bit of road work north of the town of Paterson, although the mayor, Steve Lowe, has raised regularly the fact that there is a requirement for some $15 million worth of investment in roads to bring them up to scratch. The state government took all of the regional roads there and assigned them across to the Dungog Council without adequate funding. So now we have roads which are dangerous and a disincentive to tourists to travel into that region—and it is tourists that bring in the money that helps these towns grow and develop.</para><para>I was surprised there was no funding for another road, Bucketts Way, because my opponent, the Labor candidate for Paterson, has talked about the need for road funding on Bucketts Way. We contributed $20 million to Bucketts Way over four years. I would have thought that any Labor candidate worth their salt would have got on the phone to Carl Scully or their mate Bob Carr and said, `Listen, we've got to put some money into this.' Why should the New South Wales government put money into it? Because it is their responsibility. They should have at least matched the $20 million. How much did we see? Did we see $15 million? No. Did we see $10 million? No. Did we see $5 million? No. Did we see a single dollar? No, not a cent. It shows that my Labor opponent is just hot air and rhetoric, with no substance and no ability to bring any dollars to the table.</para><para>It does not end there. In the Great Lakes region, you have the Lakes Way, a road which is of significance in accessing the townships of Forster and Tuncurry and going to places like Seal Rocks, Blueys Beach and the like. How much money was in the budget for that road? None—not a single cent. So we see the state Labor government walking away from its responsibilities, not providing any money. But I am glad to see that the state Labor government invested money to make Tuncurry ambulance station open 24 hours a day. Mr Deputy Speaker, you may ask why I would like that. It is because, with the number of accidents that occur on this road, we need ambulances 24 hours a day to pick people up, not to drive them to a hospital in Forster or Tuncurry—no, we do not have a public hospital there; we have a private one—but to take them all the way to Taree. </para><para>That begs the second question: given that my opponent has been talking about the need for improved health services in the Forster-Tuncurry area, why was there no money to start the construction of a hospital in the Foster-Tuncurry region? The reality is Labor is full of rhetoric and very little substance. The people in my electorate pay their fair share of taxes. And why do I as a federal member raise these state issues? Because people pay the GST collected by the federal government—$9 billion redirected back through to the state government—and people demand accountability on a local level and that their money is spent back with them.</para><para>I go back to the roads again, and I can understand why Labor do not believe in funding roads. In particular, there is a member of this House who opposes the $20 million that we invested in Bucketts Way, and that is none other than the member for Hunter. The member for Hunter said in this House on 27 May:</para><quote><para>These RONIs, as they are called—Roads of National Importance—are just a political stunt: a means of redirecting money into projects where the government gets the best bang for its buck.</para></quote><para>It is not the government who gets the best bang for its buck; it is the residents and businesses that those roads service. What we need to see is more investment in these roads, but from the level of government directly responsible for it, and that is state government. The state government is very citycentric, and I see the member for Blaxland laughing. He would be laughing, because all the money goes to building tunnels and increasing the roads in Sydney, but very little of it gets spent in regional and rural areas—and that is where the money needs to be spent because that is where the safety program needs to be improved.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Reid Electorate: Community Organisations</title><page.no>31780</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>31780</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Laurie, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LAURIE FERGUSON</name><name.id>8T4</name.id><electorate>Reid</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish to put on the record this morning my appreciation of the effort of a coalition of groups, including Anglicare Australia, the Australian Catholic Social Justice Council, St Vincent de Paul Society and Uniting Care Australia, in launching the Say No to Poverty campaign. The situation they outlined this morning is that there are 3.6 million Australians living in households with incomes under $400 a week and there are 800,000 children living in jobless households. In my electorate, for instance, 90 per cent of people do not receive any benefit from the recent budget tax cuts at the top. This coalition of concerned organisations simply wants to put this issue on the public register and to make sure that the political parties in this country understand that, despite an unemployment level of 5.5 per cent, which many would say is far lower than previous years, and despite the booming economy, the reality is that prosperity has not spread to the underclass in this country. There are growing disparities of income, and this coalition basically seeks strong public recognition of these realities. I mention the lack of employment opportunities in the black spot suburbs of south-western Sydney, Western Sydney and parts of Melbourne et cetera.</para></talk.start><para>In this context I want to put on the record my appreciation for a number of local organisations that make massive efforts on these fronts. The first of these is the Granville Multicultural Centre, which grew originally out of the Catholic Church in South Granville. Mark Drury, the manager there, runs an organisation which has 20 employees. It runs family support programs for those families in crisis situations, before and after school care, a youth program with a counsellor and child care. It is funded by the community services department, and the fair trading department and education department of the New South Wales government—a government that, according to the previous speaker, has the wrong priorities. I say they are the right priorities. It also receives a grant for family assistance towards child care. That is an organisation that is on the ground doing vital work in my electorate. Recently it held the multicultural festival, with attendance improving each year. </para><para>Similarly we have the Auburn Migrant Resource Centre, which last year handled 25,000 clients in an area which has one of Australia's main concentrations of new arrivals. Recently I saw a question on notice by another member, and what the answer to that question proved was that one-fifth of all temporary protection visa entrants to this country live in my electorate—not one-fifth of Western Sydney, not one-fifth of Sydney, not one-fifth of New South Wales but one-fifth of TPV entrants to this country reside in the electorate of Reid. So the Auburn Migrant Resource Centre is a crucial local amenity. It has been funded consistently by the department and is respected by the public servants in that department. Its funding has been very well merited.</para><para>The centre essentially looks after small and emerging communities. Amongst those that have had presentations of cultural activities over the last year have been the Kurdish, Ethiopian and Eritrean communities. It is currently conducting a community garden program. It has the Hey Dad Parenting Program, a multicultural women's group which meets once a week,  and a home help program. With the government's increased emphasis on the Horn of Africa and Africa in general with regard to the refugee intake over the next few years—these are countries where there has been great displacement of people and where people have no formal education—those services are going to be even more important. There is casework and case management assistance and there is a refugee youth project. The centre has also provided assistance to many people on issues such as housing. There is migration assistance, and employment and income support measures and identified settlement issues for young people are a major emphasis of this organisation. There are also a school holiday recreation program, a Sanctuary youth drama project, art classes for refugee youth and the establishment of a web site for youth. Ministers of the current government have been to the centre on a number of occasions and have joined with me in appreciating the vital work it has done in one of Sydney's new arrival communities.</para><para>I finally turn to the Turkish Welfare Association, which over the last few years has managed to build a Turkish house in North Parade, Auburn. Its social worker, Riza, has been part of the organisation's stretching out to help not only Turks but also Azerbaijanis and other communities from Central Asia who are also of Turkish extraction. That organisation also houses the Turkish Federation of New South Wales. Dursun Candemir was recently re-elected. He is a person who previously had a background in publishing with the <inline font-style="italic">Dunya</inline> Turkish newspaper. It is another organisation that provides vital assistance in regards to migration matters and general welfare issues.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Eden-Monaro Electorate: Roads</title><page.no>31782</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>31782</page.no><name role="metadata">Nairn, Gary, MP</name><name role="display">Mr NAIRN</name><name.id>OK6</name.id><electorate>Eden-Monaro</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In continuing my earlier contribution with respect to roads and after hearing the contribution from the member for Paterson, I also note that the New South Wales budget provided nothing additional for the Princes Highway either—the road that the state government are responsible for. Down that part of the Princes Highway that I represent we will see this pathetic amount of a bit over $5 million a year going into it, which is very disappointing. </para></talk.start><para>One aspect I only mentioned briefly was the extended Roads to Recovery program, which has certainly been very well received by local councils. It is getting a lot of those back roads graded and built. It is a tremendous program because the money is going directly to local government; some of it is not getting skimmed off along the way. Local governments certainly appreciated the extension of it. One part of that program was a regionally strategic component, as we call it, of the Roads to Recovery program. That is opening up a whole lot of new possibilities for getting some roads built that probably would not have happened for a long time under current funding arrangements. In particular, there are a number of these in my electorate and I will be out there supporting our communities on these things over the coming months to see whether we can get some roads built that previously probably did not have a great chance.</para><para>One of them is called Spine Road and it is a bypass route around Batemans Bay. Batemans Bay is becoming a very popular area and there is a real traffic problem there. The council has been working on this Spine Road—it has this name because it runs along the spine behind Batemans Bay—so that traffic can bypass the main part of Batemans Bay and the residential areas and get to the other end of the bay much more quickly. It is a big job and the Eurobodalla Shire Council have been putting money into it each year. When I had the Prime Minister down there a few weeks ago, I took him around to have a look at the road. I was very pleased to see that this road was actually referred to in the AusLink program as the type of road that could be funded under the regionally strategic component. It is the responsibility of local government, but it would be great to get that additional assistance under the Roads to Recovery program. So that looks very hopeful and I will certainly be working with the Eurobodalla Shire Council on that particular project to assist them to get that completed a lot earlier and solve a lot of problems down there. It would be great to get some money out of the state government as well because it is going to have to connect onto the Princes Highway and they could be doing more to assist with that.</para><para>There are probably many roads that would fall into this category, but there a couple of key ones. Edwin Land Parkway is a road round the back from Jerrabomberra through to Queanbeyan. With Jerrabomberra growing larger and larger—and I know it well, because I live there—it is creating a bottleneck out on Lanyon Drive. The Lanyon Drive part has been upgraded by the New South Wales government and the Queanbeyan council, but for the section within the ACT down to the Monaro Highway the ACT government ought to direct some of their Roads to Recovery money to upgrading that in the next few years. If Edwin Land Parkway was completed, it would take some people out of Jerrabomberra into Queanbeyan by a different route. That is another project that I think could be a great project under the regionally strategic component of Roads to Recovery and I will be supporting the Queanbeyan council on that one.</para><para>Another one to grow our tourism industry in the mountains is the connection from Ando across to Dalgety—which is basically Bombala across to Jindabyne, you could say, but the road itself goes from Ando to Dalgety. That would create a great transport route from the coast across to the mountains. If we can tie that up we can get people moving much more easily, from a tourism point of view. Of any electorate in New South Wales, Eden-Monaro has the highest proportion of its work force in the tourism industry, and it is the fourth highest in Australia—9.3 per cent of our work force is actually employed in the tourism industry, which is quite amazing. We have a great opportunity to grow that even further, and a road like the Ando-Dalgety road would be a great road. I will support the Bombala Council on that one in relation to the regionally strategic component of the Roads to Recovery program. These are just some examples of things that can be assisted under this very innovative program, getting funds out there on the ground where they are needed, and they are the things that I will be working on over the coming months. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Melbourne Ports Electorate: Central Synagogue</title><page.no>31783</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>31783</page.no><name role="metadata">Danby, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DANBY</name><name.id>WF6</name.id><electorate>Melbourne Ports</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I welcome to Australia the Chief Rabbi of South Africa, Rabbi Cyril Harris, who is going on a nationwide tour of Australia and is here for a very important event in my electorate, reflecting the commitment of the Labor Party and the Labor government in Victoria to immigration and the strong commitment that this side of politics has to immigration and its positive values. Rabbi Harris is a very distinguished person. For his political stance in opposing apartheid he has been internationally recognised, particularly for his involvement with the disadvantaged black community in South Africa. Rabbi Harris is Scottish born and served at three large synagogues in London, for almost 30 years, before arriving in South Africa at a very important time, in 1988. From the beginning, Rabbi Harris established a strong relationship with Nelson Mandela that continued beyond Nelson Mandela's presidency. Rabbi Harris supported the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, chaired by Archbishop Tutu. President Nelson Mandela, speaking on the 10th anniversary of Rabbi Harris's appointment, in 1997, said:</para></talk.start><quote><para>The Chief Rabbi's dedication to building bridges between faiths, including his exceptional contribution in the field of religious broadcasting, has added impetus to forging a new South African identity.</para></quote><para>And isn't that a tribute. In my electorate, Rabbi Harris will be the guest of honour, along with the Treasurer of Victoria, Mr Brumby, at the opening of the new central synagogue in South Caulfield. Over the last few years there has been a significant migration of people from South Africa to the suburbs on the edge of my electorate—South Caulfield, Glen Huntly—and to Ormond and Bentley, which are outside my electorate. In 1998 Rabbi Yitzchak Reisenberg, together with other prominent members of the South African community, established the central synagogue, which aims to establish a congregation of people from South Africa. I have attended there many times, and particularly on Friday nights, when one has the most unusual and pleasurable experience of seeing a service that is extremely well attended and an almost entire congregation that sings—a phenomenon that most Australians would find very unusual. It is a very culturally South African thing that people go on a Friday night after work—even people who, like me, are perhaps not as observant as they might be.</para><para>In just a few years people like Ian Harris, the secretary of the central synagogue, and Rabbi Reisenberg have built a great congregation and community. They have purchased the new facility in Maple Street. This Sunday it will be opened by Rabbi Harris, the Chief Rabbi of South Africa, with John Brumby, the Treasurer of Victoria. Rabbi Harris and his wife are prominent human rights proponents in South Africa. In Australia Rabbi Harris will be giving the ADC Gandel oration for the antidefamation commission of B'nai Brith—and will be talking to audiences across this country about the Jewish community in South Africa and human rights concerns there and worldwide. Aside from congregational facilities, Central synagogue and community centre provides, as Rabbi Yitzchak Reisenberg says, `support services for social integration, networking, employment and business opportunities, educational services and the opportunity to practise Jewish cultural heritage'. </para><para>Arising from the presence of  former South Africans is the issue of immigration and the problems associated with it. Many are successful Australian citizens who want to have their relatives join them for short family celebrations and people who want to bring elderly relatives to Australia who are totally supported by them but have continuing difficulties with Australian immigration. We need a more visionary view of immigration, a view that sees the positive contribution that people like those associated with the Central synagogue are making to Australia. I cannot think of people who are more enterprising and hard working and of value to the Australian community than the people who comprise this new group in my electorate. I applaud the opening of central synagogue and the welcoming to Australia of Chief Rabbi Harris on that occasion.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Trade: Free Trade Agreement</title><page.no>31784</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>31784</page.no><name role="metadata">Cameron, Ross, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ROSS CAMERON</name><name.id>3K6</name.id><electorate>Parramatta</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise today to reflect on a matter of great moment and significance not only for this week in parliament but also for our nation's history: the very last stages in the execution of what will be the largest free trade agreement ever entered into by Australia as a sovereign nation. I want to remind the chamber that there have only ever been two other free trade agreements concluded between developed economies. Most free trade agreements have been between a developed economy and a developing economy. Australia's free trade agreement with New Zealand was the first free trade agreement between two developed economies. It is still the most liberal free trade agreement ever negotiated. The second was the free trade agreement between the United States and Canada. </para></talk.start><para>Those two free trade agreements have shown that the benefits tend to flow to the smaller party to the transaction. There are benefits on both sides, it is a voluntary agreement entered into for the benefit of both parties, but the preponderance of benefit goes to the smaller party getting access to the larger market. I want us to reflect for a moment on the relative sizes of these two markets. Australia has an economy of about $A700 billion and the United States has an economy of $US11.7 trillion. After doing the currency conversions, according to the <inline font-style="italic">Economist</inline> magazine, the US economy is 22 times that of the Australian economy. This is the opportunity which we are being given through this free trade agreement.</para><para>In the area of professional services, in which I have a special interest as Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, this will be the single most liberal professional services agreement ever entered into by the United States. No other nation in the world will have the degree of access that Australian lawyers and financial services providers will have to the American market. In fact the Americans have committed to work with us in the various state jurisdictions and with professional organisations to try to accelerate access to and penetrate further into the various layers of the American economy.</para><para>Here we have Australia with 2.2 per cent of the Morgan Stanley capital index of global GDP and the United States with about 25 per cent of the capital index. This is a vast opportunity for Australia. So what is the attitude of the Australian Labor Party? What we find is a party which is riven with divisions, which is completely perplexed and which is like a marsupial in front of the headlights not knowing on which side of the road to get off. </para><para>This gift-horse for our nation, according to the conservative Treasury estimates, in 10 years will be worth $6 billion a year in annual GDP and will create 30,000 jobs for our children and their children. I see the member for Greenway in the chamber. Western Sydney generates 10 per cent of Australia's GDP. To apportion that for the member for Chifley, who is in the chair, it will mean 3,000 jobs for our constituents in Western Sydney if we can execute this agreement, and Labor does not know whether to pass the agreement. Labor has baulked at this magnificent opportunity for Australia and it has reserved its right to oppose it in the Senate. </para><para>To me, this is not just about the free trade agreement; it is also about the capacity to govern a nation. The leadership of a country like Australia is about the capacity to recognise and seize opportunities for 20 million Australians. Often, opportunity knocks but once. It comes in a time and tide and, if we do not seize that moment, it will pass us by. If anything disqualifies the Australian Labor Party from a credential to govern this nation it is their vacillation over this agreement. I urge all members of this parliament to get behind the FTA and sign it into law. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Greenway Electorate: Education</title><page.no>31785</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>31785</page.no><name role="metadata">Mossfield, Frank, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MOSSFIELD</name><name.id>MK6</name.id><electorate>Greenway</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to speak about schools in my electorate of Greenway and about education in general. I think it is generally recognised that Greenway is the educational capital of Western Sydney, due to its vast educational facilities. I do not expect you to totally agree with that view, Mr Deputy Speaker Price, but we do have many excellent schools in my electorate across the whole range of services, such as the public system, the Catholic system and other Christian schools such as Church of England schools.</para></talk.start><para>I would like to see more cooperation between all sectors of education so that we can produce a good educational outcome—the best educational outcome—for the students of Greenway. We do have that in a number of areas, particularly in the educational precinct of Narimba, where we have Terra Sancta College and Wyndham College working hand in hand and sharing facilities. We also have the University of Western Sydney. A university is a jewel in the crown of any electorate in relation to education. I know that not all government members necessarily agree with that, but the member for Chifley and I certainly agree that the University of Western Sydney is a great asset to the area, not only for the students going to that university but also because of the products that come from universities, such as economic development and research that benefit industry in the area. I am very pleased to have that university in my electorate and I support the necessary funding to enable the university to operate effectively. We also have a TAFE college in the Narimba complex, so we have all facets of education there, and that is a great advantage.</para><para>The other thing is to see the outcome, the students that come from these educational facilities. I am very proud from time to time to welcome to this parliament many students from my electorate. It is always said that students from Western Sydney are among the best behaved students who come to this parliament. Also, their comments are quite enlightening. They ask many interesting questions. One that is asked from time to time is: do you have to be intelligent to be a member of parliament? I tell them no. They certainly take a great interest.</para><para>To the naked eye, it would appear that some schools have better resources than others. That cannot be denied. This unfortunately creates a feeling of inferiority and resentment amongst those that feel disadvantaged. So I would like to draw to the attention of the parliament some of the concerns that have been expressed to me this week by teachers from schools in my electorate who have visited me. They have drawn to my attention the need for additional facilities, which I fully support. I have a whole list of concerns, but I will mention the schools initially before I go to the items that they are concerned about. The schools whose representatives have visited me are the William Rose School, the Metella Road Public School, Lynwood Park Public School, Blacktown West Public School, Quakers Hill Public School, Hamilton Public School and Lalor Park Public School. These are the schools in my electorate where the teachers feel additional resources are needed. </para><para>The William Rose school is a special needs school. It has put to me that it needs a wheelchair bus; a sensory garden; a wheelchair swing; wheelchairs; speech therapy; an increase in physio and occupational therapy; computer upgrades—both software and hardware; a school hall; library books in Braille; large print and audio books; additional teachers' aids and a hydrotherapy pool. Metella Road Public School has also put to me that it needs specialised teachers for struggling students who need one-on-one assistance; more teachers to reduce class sizes; and logistic support for teachers, particularly in maths and science. The school community has funded airconditioning in some classrooms but more is needed. It says it needs counsellors and support staff. Lynwood Park Public School has raised with me the need for carpets in at least five classrooms and the library. Lynwood Park needs airconditioning. As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker Price, airconditioning is very important in the summer months in our part of Western Sydney. The school also needs computer furniture in the computer room; covered walkways; returfing of the sports field and it needs a retaining wall. It needs security fencing; new blinds in the hall and some classrooms; an electricity upgrade; and more teachers' aids. </para><para>There is white ant damage to some buildings at Lynwood Park school that needs attention. I should draw to the attention of the Main Committee that many of the schools are older schools and this sort of problem does exist in them. Lynwood Park also needs hot water in the staff toilets; an upgrade of student toilets; more resources for teachers such as reading books; and smaller class sizes. Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for your indulgence in allowing me to expand on the needs of the public schools in my electorate.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Price, Roger (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

I want to draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr Kofi Annan, has recently commended the Prime Minister of Israel, Mr Ariel Sharon, on the proposal to withdraw from Gaza. Supporting unilateral disengagement is a very hard decision that those of us in the international community who are concerned about stability and peace in the Middle East need to examine in as realistic terms as possible. I think we will all come to the same conclusion that the Secretary-General of the United Nations has reached—that is, while it may be impossible for direct negotiations between the parties to take place at the moment because of the chances forsaken by the President of the Palestinian Authority, the disengagement of the two peoples is an achievement in itself. I note again, against two nostrums of conventional wisdom, that the building of the separation fence has led to a total collapse of suicide bombings in the civilian areas in Israel that were affected. Obviously, for a civilian population faced with daily attacks on people in restaurants, supermarkets et cetera, you would have to understand how, as I recently saw on the BBC, the overwhelming majority of people in the streets in Israel proper regard this halting of suicide attempts as a very positive development. </para></talk.start><para>The other conventional wisdom relates to the role of Hamas in Gaza. In Gaza there is an existential war between Hamas and the state of Israel. Hamas is determined that the only border the Israelis should have is the Mediterranean Sea. Faced with an existential war, any country has the right to defend itself against the military practitioners of terrorism against its civilian population. Again, against conventional wisdom, it seems that the killing of the terrorist chieftains Rantissi, Sheik Yassin et cetera seems to have been absolutely effective, again leading to the virtual collapse of homicidal bombing.</para><para>I hope that, in the future, direct negotiations between the Palestinians and the Israelis will recommence. I note the recent comments by King Abdullah of Jordan that Mr Arafat should resign and give up his post. I notice also the comments by President Mubarak of Egypt that all the security services of the Palestinians should be established under one authority. I note the comments of the European Community that payments to elements of the Palestinian Authority should be made, especially European money, to authorised people and not to people for the purpose of buying suicide belts and going across and destroying any possibility of reconciliation between those two peoples. </para><para>The disengagement from Gaza, whatever one thinks of Mr Sharon or his past policies, is something that people around the world who have the courage to face the rational choices will need to face and should support. Disengagement of people in that area is the only way we can move forward at the moment until a new, more accommodating and far-sighted Palestinian leadership can come forward. Such Palestinian leaders are just below the level of Mr Arafat and will wish to negotiate a permanent peaceful solution. Australians of all political persuasions support such a solution. We supported, in 1948, a Palestinian Arab state alongside an Israeli Jewish state. That is a solution that everyone in the world knows is eventually going to take place. That is a solution to which I think the disengagement from Gaza is a precursor.

role="metadata">Nelson, Dr Brendan, MP</name><name role="display">Dr Nelson</name><name.id>RW5</name.id><electorate>Bradfield</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Education, Science and Training</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	The Australian Government is very aware that a number of industries, particularly the traditional trades, are experiencing critical skill shortages.</para><para>Skills shortages are caused by a variety of factors including a strong economy, high levels of employment, high levels of infrastructure investment and the emergence of new industries as well as lack of interest in trades among school leavers and the ageing of the workforce.</para><para>The Australian Government has recognised that any approach to addressing skills shortages, needs to confront the issues on a variety of fronts.  On Tuesday 6 April 2004 I launched the Australian Government's National Skills Shortages Strategy (NSSS) - a new, comprehensive approach to tackling skills shortages, particularly in the traditional trades.  </para><para>The NSSS will build on the work we have undertaken in partnership with eleven industries through the National Industry Skills Initiative, as well as complementing other relevant programmes addressing skills needs, including the special incentive for traditional trades, support for changing attitudes to traditional trades and support for group training.  Attached are fact sheets detailing the Strategy's nine tiered approach to addressing skill shortages.</para><para>Skill shortages also featured highly in the proposed ANTA Agreement for 2004-06, with targets being set to improve the number of New Apprenticeships in skill shortage areas.  States and Territories unfortunately rejected the Australian Government's offer for the proposed Agreement. </para><para>(2)	(a) There was a 22.3 per cent increase in hours delivered by both TAFE and private providers under the ANTA Agreement between 1997 and 2001 and an approximate 16 per cent increase in the total number of TAFE and private provider students undertaking training during the same time period.  Improved efficiency in the use of funds allowed the national VET system to grow in numbers of people in training and hours delivered, at the same time that the public cost per hour of training was reduced.  States and Territories were aware of the need to improve efficiencies in the system and signed up to the efficiency provisions in the ANTA Agreement with the Australian Government during this time.</para><para>Consequently, the comparison of funding per curriculum hour is not an appropriate indicator to measure the costs of training, as it does not take into account productivity/efficiency gains realised throughout the sector.</para><para>The efficiency gains were made while maintaining the quality of training.  The high quality of the training provided throughout the VET sector is reflected in the employers' survey which rated employers' satisfaction at 80 per cent in 2001.  Graduates' satisfaction also remains high, with satisfaction levels recorded at 82 per cent in 2002.  </para><para>The Australian Government is committed to VET and has significantly increased its funding to the sector.  Australian Government funding provided to the States and Territories grew from $888.0 million in 1997 to $1.056 billion in 2001, an increase of around 19 per cent.  I would also like to point out that since 1996 funding for VET has increased in real terms by 33 per cent and funding for New Apprenticeships and industry training has increased by 83 per cent.</para><para>(b) There has been a steady decline in the level of `unmet demand' for VET over recent years.  In 1995, an estimated 60,700 individuals were unable to enrol for a TAFE qualification.  This had dropped to 45,800 in 1999 and to 42,800 in 2003.</para><para>Figures for `unmet demand' in 2004 are not yet available, however, the Australian Government will directly purchase 7,500 additional VET places for priority clients including people with disabilities, parents returning to work and older Australians with funds forfeited by States and Territories when they rejected the Australian Government's offer for the proposed ANTA Agreement for 2004-06.</para><para>(3)	One of the key issues in addressing skill shortages in trades is changing outdated views of trades and showing they can be challenging, lucrative and provide great opportunities for career advancement.  The Australian Government's New Apprenticeships marketing campaign was specifically designed to dislodge negative perceptions of traditional trades. </para><para>The Australian Government has a number of strategies and policies to address skills shortages in trades and has been proactive in improving the numbers of people undertaking education and training in trade areas.  Some of these include:</para><para>The recent launch of the Australian Government's National Skills Shortages Strategy (NSSS) - a new, comprehensive approach to tackling skills shortages, particularly in the traditional trades.  The Strategy includes special incentive for traditional trades, support for changing attitudes to traditional trades and support for group training.   </para><para>The innovative skills shortages projects which will pilot a range of approaches to recruiting and training new entrants in traditional trades suffering skill shortages and the Targeted Initiatives Programme (TIP) which is currently giving priority to projects that target traditional trades.  </para><para>The Australian Government provides a number of special incentives for traditional trades.  </para><para>	Since 1999, the Government has spent over $120 million on incentives for construction industry employers and $86.6 million on manufacturing industry employers;</para><para>	There is a special incentive of $1,100 for New Apprenticeships in skills shortages in rural and regional areas.  Since 1999, around $41.6 million has been spent; and</para><para>	A special incentive of $1,210 for New Apprenticeships in innovation industries.  Since its introduction in January 2003, more than $6.9 million has been paid.</para><para>The Australian Government has made some significant inroads to addressing skill shortages in trades with:</para><para>	34 per cent of our current 406,900 New Apprentices being in the trades and related occupations grouping including carpenters, plumbers and electricians. These occupations only make up 13 per cent of the workforce; and</para><para>	employment growth in trades and related occupations growing over the last five years at an average annual rate of 1.4 per cent, while New Apprentices in training in trades and related occupations grew at an average annual rate of 2.3 per cent. </para><para>I recently announced a further $4.5 million for the continued support of careers advice by the Australian Government.  Some of these initiatives are packaged into the National Skills Shortages Strategy to directly address areas of skill shortage.  For the benefit of the Member for Lowe the suite of initiatives that I announced on 16 April 2004 include:</para><para>	funding to develop an accreditation scheme for careers practitioners;</para><para>	a three-part professional development package for careers practitioners;</para><para>	a new scholarship scheme to reward Australia's most outstanding careers teachers;</para><para>	a `tear out' pack for parents advising their children on career options for inclusion in the 2005 Job Guide delivered to every Year 10 student throughout Australia;</para><para>	initiatives to strengthen the 216 local community partnerships assisting schools, TAFEs, universities and local industries to advise students on career choices;</para><para>	careers forums for school principals and careers advisors to be held in conjunction with major careers expos across Australia; and</para><para>	infrastructure for a new national careers telephone helpline service.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>National Illicit Drugs Strategy</title><page.no>31793</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 3508)</subtitle><id.no>3508</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>31793</page.no><name role="metadata">McClelland, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McClelland</name><name.id>JK6</name.id><electorate>Barton</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Justice and Customs, upon notice, on 11 May 2004:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	In respect of the 2003-2004 Budget measure “National Illicit Drugs Strategy - prevention of illicit drug manufacturing strategy”, what sum has been spent during 2003-2004.</para><para>(2)	In respect of each program that has been funded through this Budget measure, what is its (a) name, (b) purpose, and (c) what sum has been spent on it.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>31794</page.no><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Ruddock</name><name.id>0J4</name.id><electorate>Berowra</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Attorney-General</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Justice and Customs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: </para></talk.start><para>Up to 30 April 2004, a total of $77,337 has been spent under the `prevention of illicit drug manufacturing strategy' for the following programs:</para><para>	Precursor Working Group and National strategy support: $63,304</para><para>Costs for a position to administer programs under the National Strategy and provide secretariat support for the National Working Group to Prevent the Diversion of Precursor Chemicals.</para><para>	National Working Group to Prevent the Diversion of Precursor Chemicals. $1,103</para><para>Support for meetings of the National Working Group.</para><para>	National Clandestine Laboratory Database System.
