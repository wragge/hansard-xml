The report was provided to the government in December 2003.</para><para>The government's package of reforms, with accompanying funding, recognises that the livestock export trade is important to Australia. The trade contributes significantly to the Australian economy, generating about $1 billion a year in rural economies and supporting approximately 9,000 jobs. However, the trade is also controversial because of the community's concern that the welfare of the animals is not being properly addressed.</para><para>The Keniry review found that, although the industry has made genuine efforts to address animal welfare issues, the improvements have been incremental and the pace has been too slow to restore community confidence in the trade. The government has, therefore, decided to take the lead to drive change at a faster pace through legislative and other means.</para><para>The main thrust of the bill is to achieve improvements in animal welfare outcomes by moving from a co-regulatory environment and providing government with clearer powers to require the livestock export trade to meet more rigorous standards.</para><para>The move away from co-regulation for the livestock export trade is highlighted by an amendment to section 9 of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Act 1997 which removes the requirement for the secretary to have regard to any broad policies formulated by livestock industry bodies in exercising certain powers under the act.</para><para>The Keniry review identified a need for the creation of a set of nationally consistent principles that focus on the health and welfare of livestock during the whole of the export chain. The bill gives the minister power to determine the principles and states that they are to be known as the Australian Code for the Export of Livestock. These principles will influence all aspects of the regulatory regime applicable to livestock exports.</para><para>The Keniry review also proposed closer integration between the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Act and the Export Control Act. Currently, the acts are integrated to the extent that a person must hold a licence under the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Act to be able to export livestock under the Export Control Act. The bill provides for further integration of these two acts.</para><para>The success of the government's reforms and the continuation of the trade will depend to a large extent on the integrity and competence of the industry participants. Industry participation is controlled through the granting, renewal, suspension and cancellation of licences under the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Act. The Keniry review identified a loophole in this act that allows an exporter to simply rely on the licence of an associate if a decision is made to deny the exporter a licence or to suspend or revoke his/her licence. To prevent frustration of the act by this behaviour, the bill provides the secretary with the power to take action, such as suspension or revocation, in relation to licences of the associates of the exporter. </para><para>Veterinarians engaged by exporters undertake an important role in the export chain for livestock, as well as for other animals and reproductive material. Under current practices, exporters engage veterinarians to undertake certain veterinary functions, such as testing of livestock to meet importing country requirements, before the livestock are loaded onto the vessel for the export journey. These veterinarians are currently accredited by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service under an administrative arrangement. The Keniry review recommended that the responsibilities of accredited veterinarians should be referenced in legislation with suitable penalties for breach.</para><para>The review also recommended that veterinarians should, in certain circumstances, accompany livestock on voyages to overseas destinations and be required to report to the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service on specified matters, including any matters relating to the health and welfare of the animals. In response to these recommendations, the bill contains amendments to the Export Control Act to provide a legislative basis for the accreditation of veterinarians to undertake roles both in Australia and on overseas vessels which are carrying livestock. The bill also contains offence provisions. The accredited veterinarians will continue to be engaged by the exporters.</para><para>The bill responds to current widespread criticism of the live animal export trade both in Australia and internationally. It represents an important step in the government's overhaul of the livestock export trade and reflects the government's strong commitment to rectifying the problems with the trade as a matter of urgency. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McClelland</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>29822</page.no><id.no>R2067</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>29822</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Ms Julie Bishop</inline>, and read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>29822</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>29822</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Julie, MP</name><name role="display">Ms JULIE BISHOP</name><name.id>83P</name.id><electorate>Curtin</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Ageing</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>The amendments in the <inline ref="R2067">Aged Care Amendment Bill 2004</inline> are not extensive. They are however important measures which need to be considered in the context of the 2004 budget initiatives in aged care, which in turn, should be considered in the context of our ageing population.</para><para>As the number of Australians over the age of 65 increases, so will the demand for aged care. The challenge is to find the appropriate balance between public funding and government regulation, the responsibilities of the aged care providers and individual responsi-bility. Older Australians have worked hard, they have raised families, paid taxes and contributed to our community. They deserve to be cared for and supported as they age.</para><para>The majority of older Australians want to stay in their own homes, in their own communities, or with their own families for as long as they can. If the time comes where staying in their homes is not possible, we need to ensure older Australians have access to the best available care delivered by qualified people. This care must be of high quality, affordable and accessible. </para><para>Growing demand, as the population ages, means that we must ensure that the aged care sector is sustainable over the long term. The challenge is to balance cost-sharing with equity of access, while continuing to improve the quality of care.</para><para>The Australian government is committed to meeting the challenge. We have made strenuous efforts over the past eight years to improve the quality of care for older Australians, introducing accreditation, improving access to residential and community care, boosting support for carers, and paying special attention to needs in rural and remote areas.</para><para>Funding for aged care has increased from $3 billion in 1995-96 to more than $6 billion today. Since 1996 the Australian government has allocated more than 55,600 new aged care places and is on target to meet its commitment to 200,000 places by June 2006. Funding for community aged care packages has increased by more than 820 per cent.</para><para>The government, providers of aged care services and the community must ensure older Australians continue to receive a high standard of care. This care must include choices in accommodation and services that are well resourced, well run and well staffed.</para><para>Every element in the government's 2004 budget package, Investing in Australia's Aged Care: More Places, Better Care is designed to maintain and improve access for older Australians to high quality and affordable care.</para><para>Over the next four years, the government will provide an extra $2.2 billion to build on the progress we have made since 1997 in establishing a world class system of aged care.</para><para>The budget package will bring the Australian government's total investment in the care of older Australians to $30 billion over the next four years—$6.7 billion in 2004-05 rising to $8.2 billion in 2007-08.</para><para>By the end of the four-year span of these latest initiatives, the Australian government will have spent $67 billion on securing better aged care since coming to office in 1996.</para><para>The budget funding and initiatives are a detailed response to Professor Warren Hogan's <inline font-style="italic">Review of Pricing Arrangements in Residential Care</inline>. This extensive review, commissioned by the government in 2002, examined the longer term prospects of residential aged care with particular reference to private and public funding, performance improvement in the industry and longer term financing.</para><para>The government has responded to all of the recommendations for immediate action and has fast-tracked its response to some of the medium term recommendations to create a sustainable industry.</para><para>Through Investing in Australia's Aged Care: More Places, Better Care, the government will encourage a cooperative working partnership with both aged care service providers and the community at large.</para><para>A central element of this partnership is working with aged care providers to ensure the most efficient use of aged care funding. Greater efficiency holds the prospect of lower costs. As the Hogan report noted: </para><quote><para>If all residential care services were to operate at optimal technical efficiency then the combined public and private cost of residential care could be reduced by 17 per cent ($1.1 billion in 2002-03).</para><para>In the alternative, the level of output of the sector (the number of people cared for) could be expanded by 17 per cent (23,100 in 2002-03) at no additional public or private cost. </para></quote><para>The government's package provides a firm foundation from which the aged care sector can grow and increase their efficiency and sustainability while ensuring that older Australians can receive the care they need—at the right time and in the right place.</para><para>We will provide $877.8 million over the next four years for a conditional adjustment payment which will increase residential care subsidies by seven per cent by 2007-08, in addition to the annually indexed basic care subsidy.</para><para>The average annual Australian government subsidy per resident, currently $30,500, will rise to around $35,380, including the effect of indexation, by 2007-08.</para><para>The payment is conditional on aged-care providers meeting certain requirements, including encouraging work force training, making audited accounts publicly available annually, and participating in a periodic work force census.</para><para>It will give homes an immediate boost in income so they can continue to improve the quality of care they provide, including assisting in paying more competitive wages to nurses and other staff.</para><para>The government recognises the unique problems that homes in rural and remote areas often face. We will pay an extra $14.8 million in viability supplements over the next four years from 1 January, after aspects of the viability supplements are reviewed.</para><para>The government is increasing the number of aged care places it subsidises—from 100 places to 108 places per 1,000 people aged 70 or over.</para><para>We will do so at a cost of $468.3 million over the next four years, including $58.4 million in new spending provided in the budget package.</para><para>This is the first increase in the aged care provision ratio since it was introduced in 1985.</para><para>This will double the number of places offered in community care to 20 per 1,000 people aged 70 or over, reflecting the preference of older Australians to receive care in their own homes.</para><para>In total, around 27,900 new aged care places will be allocated over the next three years, including 13,030 this year. </para><para>These are on top of the 35,371 places allocated over the past four years.</para><para>Among the total are up to 2,000 transition care places over three years to help older people return home after a stay in hospital. </para><para>Investment is needed over the next decade to ensure the supply of aged care homes grows in line with the increase in the number of older Australians who need care. </para><para>As well as building new homes, existing aged care homes need to be upgraded to provide quality buildings, furniture, fittings and equipment that are needed for the comfort and safety of residents. To ensure that services deliver high quality care in appropriate surroundings, homes will be expected to meet the new privacy, space and amenity standards, developed in consultation with the aged care sector, by 2008, and appropriate fire and safety standards.</para><para>The Hogan report noted that significant levels of investment in new buildings and upgradings were being undertaken.</para><para>It was reported that in 2002-03, $821.4 million of new building, refurbishment and upgrading work in aged care was completed, involving an estimated 22.8 per cent of all residential aged care services.</para><para>A further $941.7 million of work was under way as at 30 June 2003, involving about 11.7 per cent of services. </para><para>The government recognises that over the next decade there will be a continuing need for capital funding so that existing homes can be well maintained, new homes built and existing facilities refurbished. </para><para>To address these medium-term needs, the government will provide $438.6 million over the next four years to increase its capital contribution to the providers of care.</para><para>We will lift the top rate of the concessional resident supplement from $13.49 to an indexed $16.25 per resident per day from 1 July this year.</para><para>Other concessional resident supplement rates will be increased proportionately from the same date. The rates of the respite supplement will be increased in line with the residential increase—that is, by $2.76 per resident per day. The transitional resident supplement rate will be increased to match the new concessional resident supplement rate.</para><para>In addition, this financial year the government will make a one-off payment of $513.3 million to aged care providers, amounting to $3,500 per resident, to ensure that all homes have the means to meet 2008 certification standards, in particular fire and safety requirements.</para><para>In line with the principle that those who are able to make a contribution to the cost of their accommodation should do so, the government will increase the maximum rate of the accommodation charge for new high-care residents who are able to make such a contribution.</para><para>This means that the maximum accommodation charge for new residents from 1 July will be no more than $16.25 per day.</para><para>We will also remove the five-year limit on accommodation charges for new high care residents, so that a capital contribution is made for the duration of time spent in a residential care service.</para><para>We have also invested in the aged care work force. The government recognises that the global shortage of nurses and other care staff makes a major investment in education and training imperative.</para><para>In order to attract and retain staff, it is important that staff receive training and that caring for the aged is a rewarding career path.</para><para>A recent census and survey found that Australia's residential aged care sector employs over 116,000 direct care workers who are, overall, highly skilled and motivated.</para><para>It found that around 12 per cent had not had sufficient education and training opportunities.</para><para>New funding of $101.4 million over four years in this budget will significantly raise the skills and career opportunities of the aged care work force. </para><para>We will fund 400 more undergraduate nursing places each year, rising to 1,094 in the fourth year. This will enable 1,600 students to commence nursing education over the next four years.</para><para>Funding will also assist 15,750 aged-care workers, up to enrolled nurse level, to obtain formal qualifications, up to 5,250 enrolled nurses to be trained in medication management; and up to 8,000 workers to improve language and literacy skills.</para><para>One of the critical issues we have identified and addressed is to ensure that caring for older Australians in aged care homes is made easier for nurses and care workers by simplifying administrative requirements. This will allow them to spend more time caring for older residents and less time on paperwork. </para><para>Funding of $81.9 million over four years will be used to simplify administrative requirements.</para><para>The Hogan report recommended a single assessment service for community and residential care, and increased funding for Aged Care Assessment Teams to help people access the services best suited to their requirements. As part of the budget package, the government will boost funding for the ACATs and extend their role so that they can continue to give older people support to access suitable care.  </para><para>Further, the government will introduce a single assessment service for residential and community care. </para><para>The resident classification scale funding tool will be simplified from eight categories to three, making it less complex, with two supplements for dementia and palliative care.</para><para>A new $2.1 million web based information service will simplify choosing a residential care home, and encourage providers to consider the particular needs of older Australians.</para><para>We will introduce progressively e-commerce for funding and information transfers between government and providers.</para><para>After 1 July 2005, providers will no longer have to undertake asset testing for new residents. This function will be carried out by Centrelink and the Department of Veterans' Affairs in the case of veterans.</para><para>We will also provide additional funding of $36.3 million over the next four years to maintain the activities of the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency.</para><para>Although ACATs provide a `gate-keeping' role to ensure that the individual care needs of older Australians are met, there will no longer need to be an ACAT assessment as the care needs of a resident remaining in the same home increase. This means residents will more quickly receive care matched to their needs. This initiative responds to a specific recommendation in the Hogan report and requires an amendment to the Aged Care Act 1997, in particular the repeal of paragraph 28-1(3)(b).</para><para>Residents and their families and the providers entrusted with their care will benefit from this amendment. Removing the need for an ACAT assessment will allow residents to move quickly from low to high care within the same aged care home as their care needs change, meaning that people will receive the higher level of care they need more quickly. There will be appropriate funding review processes.</para><para>The second amendment to division 57A of the Aged Care Act 1997 gives effect to the government's response to the Hogan report's recommendation on the removal of the five-year limit on payment of accommodation charges.</para><para>It will affect only those residents who enter high-level care after 1 July 2004 and who can afford to contribute to the cost of their accommodation. This amendment recognises that it is reasonable for residents who can afford to make this contribution to pay a charge for the duration of their stay in an aged care home. Existing residents and new concessional residents will not be affected nor will those going into low-level care or extra service homes.</para><para>Existing accommodation bond arrangements remain unchanged.</para><para>In addition, the Australian government will ensure that residents who are in need can access a hardship allowance. Further, we will be reviewing the existing hardship allowance guidelines to ensure assistance is available to those who need it.</para><para>Both amendments are part of our overall aged care package that builds on a solid platform of reforms and our commitment to care for older Australians.</para><para>Every initiative in the new $2.2 billion Investing in Australia's Aged Care: More Places, Better Care package is designed to further the Australian government's long-term vision for world-class, high-quality, accessible and affordable care.

It is about giving effect to the Howard government's decision to abolish the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. However, as with any piece of legislation, I think it is very important—and, if anything, it is incumbent upon the House and the community—to actually look behind a bill and assess why it is before the House at a given point in time.</para></talk.start><para>I argue today that the bill is not just about abolishing the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission; it is also about putting in place a long-held desire especially of the Prime Minister to dismantle every means available to the Indigenous community in Australia to actually participate in decisions going to their future. I must say that really worries me. We are talking about the most disadvantaged community in Australia. On every social indicator, the Indigenous community in Australia is missing out—in employment, health, education and nutrition. You know the issues as well as I do, Mr Speaker. The Indigenous community is suffering, and suffering badly.</para><para>I think it is about time that we faced up to the fact that the debate is perhaps more important than the abolition of ATSIC. Unfortunately, it is also, I believe, a debate about the politics of race and the desire of the Howard government to pursue ATSIC for political purposes. It reminds me of the Prime Minister's dog whistle approach to a range of issues since he won government in March 1996. I suppose the first issue that he used for political purposes was the debate about One Nation and Pauline Hanson. Even today, in terms of potential political wedges, we are confronting not only the future of ATSIC but also whether or not we treat the gay and lesbian community in Australia as second-class citizens. I refer to the debate later today about the Marriage Legislation Amendment Bill 2004, which I also intend to contribute to. </para><para>I do not deny that there are problems with ATSIC. I also do not deny that we have to do better in coming to terms with the needs of the Indigenous community with respect to the issue of governance. But that is not to say that we should throw the baby out with the bathwater. The Indigenous community is looking for a helping hand, not ongoing criticism that is often without foundation just because there are a few bad apples. There are a few bad apples in the parliament too, but we do not propose to abolish the Commonwealth parliament.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—That is a bit of an untimely analogy from the member for Batman!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LS4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MARTIN FERGUSON</name></talker><para>—Yes. We commit ourselves to working jointly to try and improve the performance of the parliament. It is for those reasons that the opposition, under the name of the member for Fraser, Mr McMullan, a former shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, has correctly moved a second reading amendment. That second reading amendment notes our concerns about the bill. Not only do I support the second reading amendment but also I support the decision by the Labor caucus which effectively means that we will not allow this bill to pass through parliament without due consideration of its provisions. That is the right of the parliament. Just because the Howard government has a view that we should simply abolish ATSIC does not mean that there are not other views in this parliament. I think it is appropriate that, with any bill before a parliament, there is a proper debate and if need be, in the other chamber where we have the capacity, we actually inquire into the provisions of the bill and report back to the parliament about not only the provisions of the bill but also the intent of the government with respect to the bill.</para></talk.start></continue><para>That takes me to the issue of ATSIC. It is fair to say that ATSIC has been subject to fierce criticism from day one. It has also, unlike a lot of other areas of government activity, been subject to unrelenting scrutiny since its inception. As I look back over the role of the Commonwealth with respect to Indigenous affairs, it has been one marked by the chopping and changing of policy directions by governments. I recall the referendum of 1967, as a result of which the Commonwealth assumed some direct responsibility for Indigenous affairs from the states. That was a huge achievement, because I think we have a major national problem and there is a major role for the Commonwealth in trying to assist our Aboriginal community and to work in partnership with them to make some advances.</para><para>Since that referendum of 37 years ago, a series of governments has, for whatever reason, brought up alternative approaches to try to do a better job on Indigenous affairs in Australia. Initially, as a result of the 1967 referendum, there was an Aboriginal advisory council under Dr Nugget Coombs—a person who had a proud history of service and understanding of the needs of the Indigenous community. It also saw the creation of a small office of Aboriginal affairs within the Prime Minister's department—a statement by the then Prime Minister who actually regarded Indigenous affairs as exceptionally important, as he allocated the office to his departmental responsibilities. </para><para>That was followed by the election of the Whitlam Labor government in December 1972 and the decision in 1973 to establish a Department of Aboriginal Affairs. Its responsibilities were to administer the Commonwealth's Indigenous policy and programs. Whitlam also correctly established the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee. That is important because that was about the Commonwealth saying, `Not only do we want to try to do the right thing for service delivery but also we believe that Indigenous representatives ought to be consulted about the direction of Commonwealth government policy.'</para><para>The Whitlam government came and went, and then we had the Fraser government. It dismantled the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee and replaced it with a new representative body, the National Aboriginal Conference, in 1977. Whatever, we still had a process of consultation. The Fraser government also established, in 1980, the Aboriginal Development Corporation, which was about—and I emphasise this—managing a limited number of Indigenous economic development projects. In 1983 there was another change in government. The Hawke government brought Nugget Coombs back into the realm of Aboriginal and Indigenous affairs. His responsibility was to review the performance of the advisory council, the National Aboriginal Conference, established by the Fraser government in 1977. This eventually led to a decision by the Hawke government in December 1987 to establish ATSIC. The then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Gerry Hand, entered into a huge national process of consultation to try to get it right. I think it is fair to say that the eventual legislation passed by the parliament was not really what was sought in the original decision leading up to the establishment of ATSIC in December 1987. It was a different model to that which was originally proposed by Gerry Hand.</para><para>So we have had a rather chequered history. On each occasion there has been an acceptance that the Indigenous community had to be properly consulted and had to have a voice in government for the direction of Indigenous affairs in Australia. The problem is that, since the establishment of ATSIC, for a variety of reasons, it has been subject to major public and political attack, and I do not think it has been given the support on some occasions that it should have been given by governments of both political persuasions. There were people in the Labor government, from 1983 to 1996, who actually wanted ATSIC to fail because it did not suit their view of life with respect to Indigenous affairs. Alternatively, there were members of the combination of Hawke and Keating governments that were absolutely committed to trying to make ATSIC work, and I commend their best endeavours. The problem was that, with the election of the Howard government in March 1996, there was a clear determination to dismantle ATSIC because it did not suit the Prime Minister's view of what he believed was in the best interests of Australia and, perhaps more importantly, his own political interests. </para><para>So we confront today a bill which, yes, proposes the abolition of ATSIC but, more importantly, does not propose how we as a community commit to making further process in overcoming disadvantage in the Indigenous community in Australia. With respect to the criticism of ATSIC, I want to make it very clear today that it has not had prime responsibility for delivering programs aimed at overcoming discrimination and disadvantage in Indigenous communities. ATSIC's programs have been limited to CDEP, which is a former Work for the Dole program, initiated and pursued by Labor in government from 1983 to 1996 and then pursued by the Howard government. Over and above that, it has had some responsibilities for housing and infrastructure but it has not, for example, responsibility for fundamental services such as health, education and employment. I think we should think about that because, every time ATSIC is attacked, it is attacked for not delivering to the Indigenous community and not making progress in overcoming disadvantage in the areas of health, education and employment. But the truth is that ATSIC has not had responsibility for those areas of government delivery. </para><para>That brings me to the point of the role of government. As an alternative to ATSIC—as a stepping stone to abolishing ATSIC—the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, actually started to promote a debate about practical reconciliation. The Howard government suggested that it had the solution to Indigenous disadvantage in Australia and that is what it regarded as a practical approach to solving problems in Indigenous communities. It talked about how it was going to make progress as an alternative to trying to prop up ATSIC in areas such as employment, education, income, housing and health.</para><para>I want to simply say today that the Prime Minister's program of practical reconciliation has been a dismal failure. This is what today's debate ought to be about—not just abolishing ATSIC but also focusing on the problems that exist in Indigenous Australia and what we are going to do about putting in place an alternative to ATSIC following proper consultation with the Indigenous community and to actually come to terms with some of the issues that I am now going to refer to as examples of primary disadvantage that we ought to be ashamed of in Australia in the 21st century.</para><para>Let us talk about practical reconciliation and where we are at 37 years on from when the Commonwealth actually assumed responsibility for doing something more on Indigenous affairs. There are a couple of indicators which I think speak for themselves. Firstly, Aboriginal children in Northern Australia suffer rates of malnutrition comparable to or worse than any developing countries such as Eritrea, Nepal and Vietnam. Secondly, throughout the period 1999-2002, for example, the rates of children diagnosed with malnutrition in the Northern Territory increased by 25 per cent. Aboriginal children under three years of age are 120 times more likely to be admitted to hospital with nutrition related illnesses than non-Aboriginal children of the same age. Thirdly, we can talk about the cost of living and the huge achievements of the Australian economy and how, as the Prime Minister said, we are all going to share in the benefits of economic growth. Let us just go to the cost of living of people in these communities. The cost of fresh food in remote Aboriginal communities is much higher than the cost in southern cities, averaging between 150 per cent and 180 per cent more expensive. Community stores—which is a topic related to this debate—are generally poorly managed, lack best practice and, in essence, have all too often existed to rip off the Indigenous community.</para><para>I must say I have seen some examples of where we are making progress on overcoming some of the problems of store management and improving nutrition in Indigenous communities. But that progress is not being made by government. It is actually being made by non-government organisations such as the Fred Hollows Foundation in Katherine, in partnership with the local Indigenous communities. I commend those programs. They are examples of what we ought to be talking about today and how government, rather than abolishing ATSIC, should be debating an alternative to ATSIC that is about general improvement in governance in Indigenous communities in Australia and how they will have a greater say at a regional level in making progress with respect to the fundamental problems that confront their communities. </para><para>Let us talk about another indicator: the limited employment and training opportunities in remote communities. I am someone who has frequently visited Indigenous communities over the last quarter of a century, because I have had a long involvement in the union movement in the Northern Territory, formerly as a union official and more generally since I came into the House as part of my responsibilities as a shadow minister—and I am pleased to say that those responsibilities have frequently taken me to Indigenous communities. In terms of employment and training, I support CDEP. The Aboriginal communities want CDEP because it assists them on a variety of social and economic fronts. Yes, it is about Work for the Dole, but it is also our responsibility, in addition to CDEP, to try and work out how, at a local level, we create sustainable employment opportunities which are focused on improving attainment of education and access to tertiary education, be it university or TAFE.</para><para>Practical reconciliation speaks for itself. It has failed—the social indicators show that in no uncertain terms. I simply say today that the government desires to have its way on the ATSIC bill, but it is also about time that we as a community try to force the government to have a real debate about the alternative. That alternative has got to firstly provide opportunity and responsibility for the Indigenous community to assist in creating a new framework as an alternative to ATSIC. Abolition of ATSIC is an easy decision for the Howard government. Consultation and developing an alternative model is about good policy and decency in government.</para><para>I am very firmly of the view that you cannot overcome the problems of the Indigenous community through programs directed and implemented from Canberra. I am prepared to take a risk because I trust and respect our Indigenous community. I believe that, as part of an alternative to ATSIC, we have to give full support to regional delivery. That is about making sure that people at a local level have the capacity to do the job—give them the chance to do it, provided it is dependent on a genuine partnership between local, state and federal government, the private sector and the Indigenous community. </para><para>Give advice and support accountability but also say to the Indigenous community, `We have sufficient trust in and respect for your capacity to make genuine practical improvements as part of a national consultative process that fingers state and federal government on performance of service delivery, but in the primary instance we are going to give you the green light to do the job locally. We have failed, so let's try and work out how we give you the capacity in a practical way to do it yourselves.' That is what I, in my regional responsibilities, say to the broader Australian community. You cannot solve the problems in Canberra. You have to do it at a local level. If we are prepared to say that to the Australian community generally, then it is time we said it to the Indigenous community in particular. I commend the second reading amendment to the House. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>29831</page.no><name role="metadata">Grierson, Sharon, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GRIERSON</name><name.id>00AMP</name.id><electorate>Newcastle</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I too rise today to speak on the <inline ref="R2064">Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 2004</inline>. In doing so, I register my continuing support for Indigenous Australians and pay my respects to them as the original owners of and carers for this land we all share. This week is National Reconciliation Week, a week that spans two of the most significant dates in the history of Australia's engagement with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The week began on 27 May, the day that 91 per cent of Australians voted yes in a referendum that granted Indigenous Australians formal recognition as our citizens, an indication that this was the land of the fair go. The week ends on 3 June, the day that the Australian High Court delivered the historic Mabo decision, which put an end to the legal fiction of terra nullius. I also register my disappointment—for Indigenous Australians and for this nation—that during this week of national reconciliation we see this racist government presenting a bill which proposes changes to the administration of Indigenous affairs that extend well beyond the abolition of ATSIC. This is legislation that strikes at the heart of Indigenous Australians' autonomy and attempts to stifle their national voice. </para></talk.start><para>This bill is part of the Prime Minister's longstanding push to mainstream all services to Indigenous Australians. John Howard is well known for his fierce opposition to the principle of self-determination. The basic idea that Aboriginal people should have a significant say in the management of policies and programs that affect them is something that this Prime Minister has never agreed to. This bill is the final step in Mr Howard's ongoing quest to remove executive power over Indigenous affairs programs from a body controlled by Indigenous people, transferring it to mainstream bureaucratic agencies. He opposed ATSIC's formation and in eight years as Prime Minister he has managed to diminish its performance and demonise the organisation itself.</para><para>Apart from concentrating in the hands of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs much of the power previously invested in ATSIC, this bill makes a number of consequential amendments to the act. They include provisions that transfer ATSIC's assets and liabilities to the Commonwealth; establish a new housing fund to replace the ATSIC housing fund; transfer money held in the Regional Land Fund to the Indigenous Land Corporation; and expand the role of the Office of Evaluation and Audit to include the undertaking of evaluations and audits of Indigenous programs and individuals—and of organisations that receive funding under any Indigenous program. They abolish the Office of Torres Strait Islander Affairs and the Torres Strait Islander Advisory Board. They also vest the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs with new powers for the proposed life of ATSIC regional councils, including the power to approve staff engagements and convene meetings.</para><para>What does that mean in plain English? It means the assets will be removed from ATSIC and transferred back into consolidated revenue for our Treasurer to play with; a few special funds to be managed by organisations that are acceptable to the government will be set up; the government bureaucracy will audit its own performance and that of funded Indigenous organisations and groups; and the minister will be put in charge of hiring and firing within regional councils and of deciding when they will meet. That all sounds like a return to the colonial era to me.</para><para>This bill also makes so-called consequential amendments to another 10 acts of parliament, which I will not list here, but just think about the fact that 10 acts of parliament are involved. ATSIC was part of Indigenous Australia's development. It was part of their community development. It was part of their operations in every way. It will take a lot of change to dismantle this organisation. </para><para>Other amendments in this legislation remove a requirement for the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs to consult with any Torres Strait Islander organisation prior to the appointment of a Torres Strait Islander to the board of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies. There is obviously no say for Indigenous Australians there.</para><para>The bill also removes a requirement for the Minister for the Environment and Heritage to inform an Indigenous representative organisation of any proposal received under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act or to invite them to comment on that proposal. So forget Indigenous people having a say in what happens to Indigenous lands. It also removes a requirement for a nominee of an Indigenous representative organisation to sit on the National Health and Medical Research Council. It is always much easier to cover up poor performance if no-one is watching on the inside. It provides the Secretary of the Attorney General's Department with new power to determine grants to native title representative bodies—more paternalistic control and less Indigenous participation.</para><para>Just what did ATSIC do? I would like to tell the House a little about what it did on the ground in my region. The ATSIC New South Wales East Zone takes in an area from the Tweed River to the Hawkesbury River, along the coast and west to just past Mungindi, Gunnedah, Merriwa and Cessnock. It includes my electorate of Newcastle and other major centres such as Coffs Harbour, Tamworth and Gosford. That zone has two regional councils: Many Rivers and Kamilaroi. Kamilaroi occupies the inland part of that region and Many Rivers takes in the coastal strip, including Newcastle. Together those two regional councils represent the region that is most densely populated by Indigenous people in all Australia. Throughout the zone there are some 50,000 Aboriginal people—35,000 in the Many Rivers region. About 60 per cent of the individuals who make up the identified Aboriginal population in the ATSIC New South Wales East Zone are under the age of 19 years. The government thought it was going to be easy. No, it is not going to be easy—what an immense challenge.</para><para>A substantial number of Aborigines in this region are educated, employed, healthy and prosperous. However, there are many more who still suffer the dire effects of the past 220 years of European colonisation—homelessness, poverty, family violence and breakdown, substance abuse and sickness. There is also some racial tension in some towns within the zone. ATSIC has a regional office in Coffs Harbour for the Many Rivers region and one in Tamworth for the Kamilaroi region. Each office employs some 17 individuals, both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal. There are about 200 independent Aboriginal organisations, funded and unfunded, that operate within the zone, including land councils; sports, arts and cultural heritage groups; and economic and business development organisations. Yet this government, with one stroke of a pen, can attempt to wipe all that out. ATSIC plays a very important role in providing a link between all those organisations.</para><para>Aboriginal unemployment is high—as much as 50 per cent in some communities within the zone. The CDEP operates in both regions, and in the Many Rivers region it has 13 programs, ranging in size from 50 to 256 participants, with 1,770 participants altogether.</para><para>In my region, ATSIC's home loan program funds 470 home loans to the value of $9 million. With an average of $20,000 for each loan, we are not talking about luxury housing. Housing availability in my region has become an issue because of the problems of affordability. There are still 120 eligible borrowers on the waiting list in the Many Rivers region alone. The Community Housing Infrastructure Program maintains about 60 community houses throughout the region, offering employment opportunities for Indigenous people. </para><para>In addition, ATSIC administers the funding for the various Aboriginal Legal Services that operate in the zone. Those legal services are seriously underfunded and cannot possibly meet the demands of the people in that zone. The number of lawyers available to meet the needs of 35,000 people in the whole of the Many Rivers region is equivalent to 2½.</para><para>A program that is threatened by this legislation is the CDEP scheme. As the previous speaker, the member for Batman, mentioned, it is a program that does provide work opportunities, particularly in rural and regional Australia. It is an employment, training and community development program, and it began in 1977. In June 2002, there were 270 Indigenous community organisations and 34,182 Indigenous people were actually participating in the CDEP nationally. That accounts for approximately 25 per cent of Indigenous employment. I am not sure what the government says that it can do in its place—by removing ATSIC.</para><para>In Newcastle, Youloe-Ta, our local registered CDEP, is funded for 266 participants at present. It has grown from Yarnteen, which was set up in 1993, and has continued to have outstanding outcomes. One particular success of Yarnteen was the granting of $100,000—not by the Australian government but by Microsoft USA—to network all CDEPs across New South Wales. It is an outstanding program with outstanding achievements. In our region, there is also a registered training organisation at Yamuloong, a bush tucker tourist site of great renown as well as an education and conference centre.</para><para>Why does the government want to dismantle all of that? What did ATSIC do wrong? Much of the criticism which ATSIC has faced has focused on its expenditure of government funds. At the same time, one of the central misconceptions surrounding ATSIC relates to the amount of funding that ATSIC actually received—and what it could and could not do with that money. As the peak Indigenous body in the country, ATSIC is often the prime target for blame games. The issue of funding is also the focal point for debate about ATSIC's effectiveness. While ATSIC is not the primary service provider in most portfolio areas, particularly health care and education, it is often blamed when not enough is seen to be done in these areas.</para><para>One of the other misconceptions about ATSIC's funding that this government conveniently perpetuates is that ATSIC is responsible for all Commonwealth spending on Indigenous affairs. This is not—and never really has been—the case. ATSIC has only ever administered around half of the Commonwealth's total identifiable expenditure on Indigenous affairs. The other half, about $1.3 billion in the last financial year, is spent through various agencies in other areas, including in the employment, education and training portfolio, the social security portfolio and the health portfolio. In recent years under this government, ATSIC's share of the total Indigenous funding pie has continued to decrease. The mainstreaming of Indigenous-specific programs is usually—and has often been—at ATSIC's expense.</para><para>ATSIC does not have responsibility for many of the areas in which its performance is often criticised. ATSIC has always argued that its programs are only designed to supplement funding and programs provided by other Commonwealth, state and territory agencies. However, there is often a gap, particularly in rural and remote Aboriginal communities, between what should be provided to Indigenous people through mainstream service delivery agencies and what actually is provided. For example, part of ATSIC's expenditure through CHIP goes towards the provision of basic services such as running water and electricity in remote Indigenous communities—services that we would all expect to be provided to us by our government agencies. Subsequently, as a recent Commonwealth Grants Commission report commented, the failure of mainstream programs to address the needs of Indigenous peoples effectively means that Indigenous-specific programs are expected to do more than they were designed to do. </para><para>In order to illustrate how inadequate the levels of government have been in responding to the needs of Indigenous Australians, I will refer to the <inline font-style="italic">Social justice report 200</inline><inline font-style="italic">3</inline><inline font-style="italic">.</inline> In doing so, I pay tribute to Bill Jonas, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commissioner of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. Bill, a Worimi man very well-known in the Newcastle region, presented the <inline font-style="italic">Social justice report 2003.</inline> The report showed that there has been no significant increase in Indigenous household income; the increase in individual income for Indigenous Australians was less than the increase for non-Indigenous people; employment participation was at 54 per cent, against 73 per cent for non-Indigenous people; and the unemployment rate for Indigenous Australians was three times higher than that for non-Indigenous people.</para><para>In education, the report states that 69 per cent of Indigenous people are progressing to year 11, against 90 per cent of non-Indigenous people; home ownership for Indigenous people is at 13 per cent, as opposed to 40 per cent for non-Indigenous people; and Indigenous people make up 20 per cent of the total prison population. If you are an Indigenous Australian, you are 16 times more likely to be imprisoned than a non-Indigenous Australian, while Indigenous juveniles have made up 42 per cent of all incarcerated juveniles since 1997—and that rate has been consistent. Life expectancy for Indigenous females is 62.8 years. Life expectancy for Indigenous males is 56.3 years. Those figures show a slight improvement, but I do not think the government will have to worry about aged care costs or senior pensions for Indigenous males. Indigenous babies have twice the chance of having a low birth weight, and the infant death rate is 2½ times that of non-Indigenous babies.</para><para>As I said last week in this House when I shared these facts in an adjournment speech, it is very sad to repeat the outcomes from that report. For many non-Indigenous people those figures are just statistics, but for Indigenous people they are the everyday, real life struggles and personal tragedies that they experience. Their sons and daughters are represented by those figures. It is their babies, their frustrated youth and their family members and leaders who are struck down in their prime.</para><para>But John Howard lacks any sensitivity to the emotional burden Indigenous Australians carry with them every day—the burden created by a white history in this country that has been less than kind. John Howard has no understanding of reconciliation either and, more importantly, there is no apology to Indigenous people that, on every indicator of quality of life and socioeconomic status, this government over eight years through the departments it administers has failed to achieve significant progress of any kind. But of course this `blame everyone else' government would have us all believe that the failure is someone else's fault—the fault of Indigenous people themselves and the fault of ATSIC, they would allege. We all know that is just another white lie. The figures are shameful. </para><para>John Howard suggests that by abolishing ATSIC and mainstreaming all programs his government is actually showing more respect for Indigenous Australians—by treating them the same as non-Indigenous Australians. If we are all equal, he would purport, then why do we need to do anything differently for Indigenous Australians? Get real, Prime Minister: stop hiding behind some conservative class system that measures success by status and wealth and start looking at the quality of life indicators for Indigenous Australians, because there is not much equality there.</para><para>Another perception that John Howard would feel comfortable with in his conservative world would be the perception that ATSIC was a `corrupt shambles', as was stated in a media article. But the discussion paper on the ATSIC review, when commenting on ATSIC's structure—in particular its current responsibilities for advocacy, policy advice and program delivery—noted: </para><quote><para>Adoption of such a structure—</para></quote><para>as the one ATSIC has—</para><quote><para>for the delivery of political advocacy and publicly funded services and programs would never be contemplated ... for mainstream Australia. If groups of backbench Members of Parliament across Australia were personally making public funding decisions over `work for the dole' schemes, sporting clubs etc, there would be, at least, perceptions of a corruption-ridden shambles within months.</para></quote><para>Let us think about that comment and relate it to the actions of backbenchers and frontbenchers in the current government. I cite the Envirofund, where 76 per cent of those funds went to coalition seats—$20 million of government pork-barrelling. I cite the recent budget, from which 90 per cent of the people in my electorate will not gain any tax cuts because they do not earn over $52,000 per year. That is more targeted policy to gain votes. What about the disgraceful way public moneys were wasted on the `Strengthening Medicare' advertisements? That was another $21 million of Australian public funds up in smoke—smokescreens. No wonder the people of Australia are cynical about politicians and no wonder Indigenous Australians have so little respect for this mean-spirited, hypocritical government that looks after its own and shows no mercy for those it has little electoral use for.</para><para>While we are talking about poor governance, I do not see the government abolishing NAB for their woeful mismanagement, and I am still waiting, along with the rest of Australia, to see anyone in HIH face a court for the destruction of so many people's lives and assets through corporate greed and mismanagement. I have not noticed David Flint getting the flick either for questionable conduct on the public payroll. But we are here today debating legislation that would totally dismantle ATSIC as a punishment for not always getting it right. Such double standards by this government are unacceptable. But we should be used to that after eight years.</para><para>Not everyone here in parliament has contact with Indigenous people. Personally, my contact has been limited. But 30 years in education and 6½ years as a principal in a school where one-third of the student population was Indigenous gave me a wonderful opportunity to gain some insight into the lives of Indigenous people in my electorate of Newcastle. For those people, particularly those I met whilst principal at Carrington school, I will be forever grateful—grateful that they let me share their dreams, their frustrations, their sorrows and disappointments, their pride and their determination. I have one key message for the Prime Minister from that learning experience: you can try to take away from Indigenous Australians their identity and their self-determination, but you will fail. Indigenous Australians will survive and eventually they will thrive, and this country will be a better place. </para><para>I will never forget an Aboriginal student who used to say to me, very often, `It's too hard, Miss,' and I would look into her deep soulful eyes and know she was right. For her, it usually was too hard, given some of the struggles that were part of her everyday existence. But when I saw her compete in races when it was not as hard—when there was a more level playing field—I saw a strength and determination that was unstoppable. It was not unusual to see that courage and determination repeated in all the Indigenous students as they provided support and encouragement for each other. It was also usual to see Indigenous children adopt ways to creatively express their Aboriginal identity—another unstoppable force. In education, I was also privileged to work with many Indigenous people employed under ASPA programs and Aboriginal education programs. I pay tribute to their dedication.</para><para>As the member for Newcastle, I have also had the privilege to work with Indigenous leaders in our community—people like Jimmy Wright and the Smith family, who built an Aboriginal community in a place that had no members of the original Awabakal people surviving; people like Ray Kelly, who managed the Awabakal centre in a way that developed a community further—he is now with the Arts Council putting all his performance skills into work that benefits all Australians; and people like Leah Armstrong and Sean Gordon, who are involved with our CDEP programs. Without ATSIC though, few of these people would have been able to make a difference. Finally, I join my Labor colleagues in expressing my contempt for this legislation and support its full review by the Senate processes. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>29837</page.no><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Dr EMERSON</name><name.id>83V</name.id><electorate>Rankin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Late last year I launched an initiative called Wedge Watch, because we were keen to put the media and the Australian public on notice that an increasingly desperate Prime Minister would resort to the same sort of wedge politics he adopted in the lead-up to the 2001 election with the infamous <inline font-style="italic">Tampa </inline>incident, which was coloured most particularly by false claims by the Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and other ministers that asylum seekers had thrown their children overboard.

In fact, I foreshadowed the prospect of the Prime Minister using both of these communities to advance his political interests in my `wedge watch' speech last year. And here we are in June 2004, in the lead-up to the election, and the prophecy has been fulfilled.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The announcement of the abolition of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission in an election year has caused uncertainty for Indigenous people in our community and has once again caused division in the nation. It was done purely for political purposes—not for the national interest but for the political interests of the Prime Minister and his party. Yesterday the Labor caucus voted not to allow this bill to pass until all its provisions had had careful consideration in the Senate and there had been an opportunity for Indigenous communities and other interested Australians to come forward and express their views. Labor certainly does not support the denial of a voice to the Indigenous people of our country.</para><para>I met with elders of the Indigenous people of Logan, in my electorate, in my office on 22 April this year. The meeting was planned as a follow-up to an earlier meeting held in December of last year, but it happened that it was just days after the Howard government had announced the abolition of ATSIC. Consequently, interest and participation in the meeting was very strong. Representatives in attendance at that meeting included ATSIC Commissioner Robbie Williams, Vanessa Kirk, Elwyn Hill, Margaret Perry, Paddy Jerome, Reg Knox, Ida Collins, Jim Collins, Peggy Tidyman, Sigrumb Nilsen and Frederick McCoy. From that initial meeting, which was very successful, a new group representing the Indigenous people of Rankin has been formed. It is called Logan Elders. It is planned that they will represent the Indigenous people of Logan through this transition period. They want to ensure that they have a strong voice and that they do not see Indigenous issues absorbed into mainstream departments.</para><para>From the meeting in my office and two subsequent public meetings which I proposed, I have been asked to make known to the parliament the views of the Indigenous community in my electorate. I will set them out now. First, the Indigenous community through Logan Elders has expressed great concern at no Indigenous voice being heard at the national level. The government's decision to abolish ATSIC effectively takes away the Indigenous voice on issues of concern to Indigenous people. Logan Elders support the ATSIC commissioners being their elected voice at the national level. They have indicated that Australian governments have had more than 200 years to improve the lot of Indigenous people and to address the issues concerning the Indigenous community but have failed. They point out, too, that the government gave ATSIC 15 years and took it away because of the actions of a few. Government departments are still failing Indigenous people today. The elders ask: how will it possibly improve by handing ATSIC funds over to Commonwealth government departments to deliver services to their people?</para><para>The second major point that they have asked me to raise in parliament is that of the mainstreaming of Indigenous services. They feel that this will mean that Indigenous people will be further disadvantaged. Staff will not be prepared for the influx of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander issues and concerns. Staff are not trained in cross-cultural awareness to prepare them for the delivery of culturally appropriate services. Logan Elders and the broader Indigenous community tell me that mainstreaming of services such as legal services and CDEP will have a huge impact on Indigenous communities, sending them back 30 years. If legal services are taken out of the control of Indigenous people it could mean an increase in the Indigenous population in jails. </para><para>The third major issue that Logan Elders have asked me to communicate in the House of the Australian parliament and, through the parliament, to the people of Australia is their concern that funding to urban Indigenous communities has been reduced, with a diversion of funds to compensate what is in fact a lesser number of Indigenous people in rural and remote communities. I say without qualification that Logan Indigenous people support the provision of services to rural and remote communities, but they point out that there are a lot of Indigenous people in urban areas. Certainly there are a lot of Indigenous people in Logan City and surrounding areas. They do not want to be disadvantaged as a consequence of being in urban areas. They point out that Indigenous people in urban areas are being further disadvantaged by the lack of services to their families and young people in particular. They estimate the Logan Indigenous community at 7,000 to 10,000 people, but Indigenous organisations are slowly disappearing in our local area. Logan Elders call for an Indigenous community centre to enable them to form their own Indigenous identity within Logan City and not be identified as part of a multicultural community. They are happy to play their role in a multicultural society but they point out that they are the original Australians and have their own identity.</para><para>The fourth major issue is the failure of government departments to provide effective services to Indigenous people in Logan City. This is a major concern for the local Indigenous community, as expressed through Logan Elders. The newly formed Logan Elders Committee is not a traditional elders group but a community based elders group made up of elders from many different areas who have settled in Logan City. Logan Elders Committee is committed to working with government departments to ensure that Indigenous families and young people are being serviced appropriately by all relevant government departments. To date Logan Elders have met with Desley Scott, the state member for Woodridge, and with the police, Logan Youth and Family Services, Logan TAFE, Logan City Council, the Queensland Department of Housing and the Department of Corrective Services. Logan Elders Committee has indicated that it wishes to work towards developing partnerships with these organisations.</para><para>The fifth major issue is that the Logan Indigenous community do not accept the Howard government's decision to abolish ATSIC and calls on the Labor Party to reject the bill when it is tabled in parliament. It calls on the Labor Party to give Indigenous people of this country a voice at the national level and to put in place a structure that is acceptable to Indigenous people. Labor, in the Senate, will refer this bill to a committee for inquiry and report. This will give Indigenous Australians the opportunity to be heard in this debate and to have a say in their future. As the representative of Indigenous people in Logan City, I am absolutely committed to ensuring that our local Indigenous community do have an effective voice, through me, in the Australian parliament. It is important that they have an effective voice that will be heard and that they have a role to play in shaping their future, their destiny, and in improving their lot and that of the young Indigenous community in Logan City. </para><para>I support the work of such elders as Paddy Jerome, a dear friend of mine, who is working very hard to ensure that local young Indigenous people understand the culture of the Indigenous community in our area and more broadly. Once they understand the culture it certainly contributes positively to self-esteem, giving them a sense of identity and a feeling of having a truly strong place in our community. Paddy Jerome and others feel that that is the key—and I certainly think that there is a lot of merit in this argument—to giving self-esteem to young Indigenous people. We need to ensure that they can be a real part of our community, that they can receive all of the benefits of growing up in the Australian community. We need to ensure not only that they are not deprived in any way because of their Indigenous background but that, in fact, with that knowledge of their own culture, they are able to explain to non-Indigenous people the culture that they have inherited over 40,000 years.</para><para>I am very proud of our local Indigenous community. Having received this news about the Howard government's decision, they have not just said, `We'll have to lie down and take it.' They have risen up and have organised themselves into a very active, strong group which now is very well coordinated through Logan Elders. It is a tribute to their determination. They have been kicked in the guts so many times that you could understand that local Indigenous people, particularly under this Howard government, might just say, `It's time to give up.' But they will never give up. They want a strong voice in parliament, which I will give them. They want a say in their future, and that is vitally important from the point of view of the Labor Party.</para><para>In closing, I condemn the Howard government for yet again embracing wedge politics and for seeking to set Australian against Australian to divide our community at the expense of the Indigenous people of Australia. We have come to expect this from the Prime Minister. It is sad when we see it actually happening, as we do here today with this bill and also with the marriage bill. I condemn the Prime Minister for these tactics. I think they are grubby tactics, but we are now familiar with them. It will be a great pleasure to play my part in the Labor Party to ensure that this Prime Minister is removed from office later this year and to celebrate the election of a Labor government, which will give the Indigenous community in this country a real voice, a real say in their future and a decent standard of living.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>29840</page.no><name role="metadata">King, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KING</name><name.id>00AMQ</name.id><electorate>Wentworth</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Whatever one says about the effectiveness of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission—and there are many differing views on that—the organisation has effectively done two things. Firstly, it has been a one-stop, administratively convenient government organisation for Aboriginal people and those concerned with Aboriginal affairs. Secondly, it has been an attempt to adopt a principled approach to relations between Aboriginal communities and the Australian government. That being so, the debate on the <inline ref="R2064">Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 2004</inline> needs to focus on the worthwhile aspects of ATSIC and the lessons learned from ATSIC to encourage government in the future to take the good parts of what ATSIC represented and move forward.</para></talk.start><para>I want to say a couple of things about administrative convenience and to refer to two incidents. As the member for Wentworth, I have worked closely with the La Perouse Aboriginal community. La Perouse is the well-known landing place and indeed a place of a famous Aboriginal community in Sydney. Kenny Rodgers, who is one of the elders of that community, has worked with me on a number of different projects. </para><para>One of those projects has been the development or potential development of Aboriginal owned land and publicly owned land in the La Perouse area for the benefit of local Aboriginal people—in particular, for housing and development. The Aboriginal community there does not take a negative approach to commercial development. It sees that as having potential for the Aboriginal people in that area. It was on that basis that I was able to approach ATSIC and, ultimately, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs to see what could be done to assist that process. Having a one-stop shop was critical to helping the local people.</para><para>The second example I want to refer to with regard to administrative convenience concerns the Block at Redfern. When I was Chair of the Australian Heritage Commission, I was involved in the listing of that place on the Australian national register. Whatever happens to the Block in Redfern in the future, in accordance with Commonwealth, state and local government arrangements there will be an interpretive centre to ensure that people of the future understand the struggles of the people in Redfern and the importance of the cultural heritage, such as it was, to the people living there. But, from a practical point of view, it is now virtually impossible for people who are trying to do their best to redevelop the Block area in Redfern, which has effectively been razed, to approach that in a coordinated fashion—as one organisation—so that they can seek funding and put in place administrative arrangements that may assist them in the future development of that important place.</para><para>These are practical matters. We are talking about grants. We are talking about approvals. We are talking about planning relationships between local and Commonwealth agencies and so on. That is why, from an administrative convenience point of view, it is necessary and appropriate to have an organisation—not the same as ATSIC, but one that has fulfilled that role in the past. I urge government to ensure that there is a one-stop shop for Aboriginal people and those concerned with Aboriginal affairs so that they can conveniently access Commonwealth largesse, such as it is, to Aboriginal people.</para><para>I also raise a point about the importance of a principled approach. Here I want to concentrate on three matters. It seems to me that, for the future, the following considerations need to be taken into account. The first principle is the need for Aboriginal involvement in the delivery of better outputs and outcomes for Aboriginal people. I am talking not only about health and education but also about housing and the many other services that are delivered by government to Aboriginal people. The second principle that ought to be taken into account is shared governance. By that I mean that Aboriginal people should have a continuing involvement in the governance of their various communities.</para><para>Let me give you an example as to why that is important. At Lockhart River in North Queensland, there is a very vibrant community. There they have a wonderful vegetable garden. That vegetable garden was developed as a result of a CDEP—a Community Development Employment Project. In 2002-03, the CDEP program contributed about 50 per cent of the $1.1 billion from government in Aboriginal funding. The reason for the success of that particular project was that local people, the local Indigenous organisation and the CDEP people were able to work together.</para><para>The third principle is accountability to the Australian people. One suggestion I have in this regard is that, whatever future organisation is established, there ought to be a representative of the Aboriginal people in this place. Whether that is in the Senate or in this House, as occurs in countries such as New Zealand and Canada, is a matter for government but, unless there is that accountability, the Australian people and taxpayers will feel that they do not have a stake in the future of their involvement in this process. As Patrick Dodson said the other night in his lecture in this place, it is important that we proceed with a shared involvement and a shared stake in the future—that is, not only the Aboriginal people but also the Australian people. It is with some regret that I support this bill, but I do so on the basis that we are looking at better outcomes in the future, adopting the principles that I referred to. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>29842</page.no><name role="metadata">Andren, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDREN</name><name.id>KL6</name.id><electorate>Calare</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I listened with interest to the contribution by the member for Wentworth and I must commend him on his somewhat visionary approach to some aspects of Aboriginal and Indigenous representation. For a long time, I have also believed that we need to think seriously about moving to a situation where we examine the New Zealand example. From, I think, 1867 there was temporary Maori representation in their parliament, which turned into a permanent arrangement, and that has continued under proportional representation in recent years.</para></talk.start><para>The <inline ref="R2064">Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 2004</inline> raises more questions than it answers about Aboriginal and Indigenous policy in this country. Few doubt that ATSIC as it stands is flawed but, as someone said earlier in the debate on this bill, we seem to be throwing the baby out with the bathwater here. It raises a whole series of questions. What exactly is the new structure and what is the process that will replace ATSIC in the longer term? What will happen with the regional representation once the regional councils are abolished in 2005? What exactly is happening with the assets of ATSIC—which assets are to be subsumed by the Commonwealth? Why has there been no consultation with those bodies and those people who were affected by the abolition of ATSIC?</para><para>There is no doubt that a framework which ensures and demands answerability and transparency in programs and funding is needed. The current structure of ATSIC certainly did not meet those criteria in all cases, but nor do many areas of public administration—and we do not have to go outside this very parliament to find them. The Productivity Commission's report last year showed that the root causes of Aboriginal disadvantage remain. Key indicators such as health, longevity, education, employment and the rate of incarceration remain at shameful levels. But that will not be solved by simply abolishing ATSIC and mainstreaming services.</para><para>The member for Wentworth again mentioned the positive sides of ATSIC, and indeed there are positive sides. They are so often overshadowed by the publicity about rorting or political plays within the administrative structures—exactly the sorts of things that we hear from organisations within the non-Indigenous community, but somehow they get focused out of all proportion and that denigrates the importance of the good work that is being done on the ground by ATSIC.</para><para>I think of the Binaal Billa Regional Council, which operates out of Wagga Wagga. One of the problems in dealing with the Indigenous communities of my electorate is that they do not feel that they see enough of the organisation to deal with their particular problems. I know, having met with the Binaal Billa people in this place on a reasonably regular basis, that some of their proposals and plans that they had in place—includ-ing the working parties that they are working on within the communities to try and establish workable community based organisations that are not based on, if you like, nepotism, mob or family influences but a more representative model—seem to be working very well. That is a grassroots model that has developed out of the needs of the local community and is dealt with at a regional and local level. That is but one example of the positive work that is happening. I despair, and I think the community despairs, of that sort of organisation being replicated or administered by a mainstreamed Aboriginal affairs process. </para><para>In the final report of the review into ATSIC a package of reforms to ATSIC was recommended, including greater control, and thus a greater voice and answerability of ATSIC by its constituents at a regional level. That was at the heart of these recommendations and that should have been the basis on which we progressed, not this abolitionist program, which I believe takes us back to the bad old days of paternalism and assimilation.</para><para>Recently, the late Mr Djerrkura, the former chairman of ATSIC from 1997-99, prior to his untimely death at the age of 54 said:</para><quote><para>Despite its flaws, and I do not want to deny them, ATSIC deserved better than execution by Prime Ministerial decree.</para><para>The Prime Minister has long refused to accept the fundamental difference of Aboriginal people in our community. He was never sympathetic to the principles on which ATSIC was based and founded. He has always rejected any suggestion of indigenous autonomy and self-determination.</para><para>In the classic imperial fashion, without negotiation, without understanding and with little empathy, the great white leader announced that Aboriginal people had, yet again been a “failure”. ATSIC would be abolished. No more paternalistic model of government could be found.</para></quote><para>He went on to say:</para><quote><para>I suppose we should not be surprised. The Prime Minister walks early and often, but he has never walked for reconciliation.</para></quote><para>In a similar vein, in those comments a few days prior to his death, he said that he had worked in his community, as we know, for many years and, while the federal government has championed this thing called `practical reconciliation', he recognised better than most the deplorable circumstances in which his people lived and the increasing and worsening disease and death rates that are afflicting his people. He said:</para><quote><para>I live every day understanding the immediate and extremely urgent needs of Aboriginal people. But I also understand the importance of symbolism.</para><para>Symbolism matters because it is a reference point for all Australians.</para></quote><para>He was referring, of course, to the simple process of saying sorry, which has been such a difficult word to drag out of this Prime Minister and this government. I would suggest the symbolism of an appointed body, which we see in this legislation, to replace a representative one is a very powerful symbol to the Aboriginal people of this country. It is a symbol that we are returning to the bad old days of the past.</para><para>Let me return briefly to the assets of ATSIC. This bill provides for the transfer of ATSIC assets and liability to the Commonwealth. In my own electorate the All Hallows property, a former convent at Bathurst, was dedicated to the Aboriginal peoples of Bathurst by its former owners, the Sisters of St Dominic, on 14 February 1984. I made some inquiries recently and found that the title search shows the title is held in the name of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, and there is nothing registered against the title. The property, comprising a manager's cottage, child-care centre and former convent, is located on about five hectares on Lloyds Road, Bathurst.</para><para>Because of continuing problems, some dysfunctionality and, I would say, a lack of proper assistance from ATSIC—and that is one criticism—the process of delivering that property to the full benefit of the community has not been realised. The commission has not been able to identify any corporation which meets the covenants of the deed of gift relating to the transfer of the property to a suitable Aboriginal corporation. The existing Towri Aboriginal Corporation does not meet the covenants because it is considered that it is unable to effectively utilise the land and premises for student hostel purposes, which was the aim of the nuns transferring the property. It is currently a very effective preschool, drawing young children from all over the Indigenous and non-Indigenous community of Bathurst, but it is currently the target of litigation on several issues, including alleged unfair dismissal and other compensation details that go back some years, and these people are very nervous. </para><para>I believe that it is being administered as efficiently as it could possibly be. The state departments, and indeed the minister in this House who is responsible for child care, are satisfied that its operation is quite sound and satisfactory, but the people are faced with several litigious matters, and the whole community is faced with doubt as to what the future of this property will be. Will it be subsumed by the Commonwealth and the assets sold, or will the community be assisted into utilising that very valuable asset for the benefit of that entire community? That is one question mark that I do not think is solved by the processes that we are putting in place here.</para><para>I think many of us attended the Beyond the Bridges and Sorry address by Patrick Dodson last week in this place. I want to read into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> some of his statements regarding the demolition of ATSIC. He said:</para><quote><para>Indigenous Australians must have a National, State and Regional voice and it's authenticity must be informed from the local level according to proper cultural protocols.</para></quote><para>I noticed the member for O'Connor making an interesting observation about the 300 language groups as a possible basis for formulation of policy and funding distribution. I do not know how that would affect resettled communities such as Orange and Bathurst, where language in many cases, I understand, is no longer that strong. But at least it is a positive idea for a basis which reflects the sort of local, proper cultural protocols that I think Pat Dodson was referring to.</para><para>I recently visited Tasmania and saw the apologetic signs at Aboriginal sites saying `We do not know really what this site was used for, but we think this was the purpose,' because these people were cleared out of that island and taken off their land, and not only family links but language have been shattered on that island. Having seen that, I do not know how we would begin to deliver under this new model the sorts of services needed by the Indigenous people of Tasmania—and indeed there are some, contrary to the comments that we sometimes see made about the Indigenous community of Tasmania. Pat Dodson went on to say:</para><quote><para>But now the Government has by its own actions in removing our national voice unwittingly opened up a new opportunity for us ...</para><para>If political leaders are prepared to enter into a discussion, a dialogue with us, we now have an opportunity to realign the relationship between the Indigenous Australians and governments at all levels.</para></quote><para>That dialogue would not, I suggest, be an imposed advisory body as we see in this legislation. Pat Dodson said:</para><quote><para>We require a National indigenous voice that has its authority grounded in support from indigenous Australians.</para></quote><para>He said: </para><quote><para>In the different parts of Australia nations, tribes and communities may determine that they wish to use their existing community representative structures to convey their views. </para><para>In other regions people may wish to retain existing ATSIC type forums to represent their interests.</para><para>Still others might have a whole new approach to representation and all of these options must be considered.</para></quote><para>We must heed that call if we are not to repeat the mistakes of the past.</para><para>The Oxfam Community Aid Abroad organisation makes some telling points about the abolition of representative structures for Indigenous peoples. It says the ATSIC board is the only national representative structure in place for Indigenous peoples. It says:</para><quote><para>The Indigenous specific programs that were previously handled by ATSIC, representing roughly 15% of national funding ... have now been divided up into mainstream government departments.</para></quote><para>It points out that the review into ATSIC commissioned by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs suggested packages of reforms to ATSIC—not abolition—`primarily designed to give greater control of the body to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people at the regional level'. Oxfam Community Aid Abroad says:</para><quote><para>National and regional representative Indigenous bodies are necessary ...</para><para>Indigenous Australians do not enjoy the level of representation and involvement in the Australian political system to the extent that they could or should.</para></quote><para>Again, I refer to the comments of the member for Wentworth and to the New Zealand case, where there are dedicated Maori seats. That may be an option, but again we would have to consult the Aboriginal community to see if that is the model that in some ways may offer an opportunity. But I think the most urgent need is the grassroots representation and the ability of local communities to determine their own processes and the ways in which they administer their own programs.</para><para>I am reminded often of the situation that I saw on an SBS documentary a few years ago, where for years non-Indigenous people from the health department went to a particular community, trying to break the cycle of worms in the kids from the dogs and the thrown out nappies. The cycle went over and over again, and they were trying to break down the process. Of course, it was culturally inappropriate to require the parents to bring in a stool from the kids so it could be analysed and they could be shown the worm burden that the kids were carrying and how they had picked it up. When Indigenous people were trained to explain and to show the problem by various audiovisual means, then it became acceptable. A culturally appropriate program that was put in place convinced the parents that, yes, this had to be done to get rid of this scourge that was affecting the health of their kids. That was worked out at a local level. I think that, so often, ATSIC itself—the fact that it is a top-down structure—has been part of the problem. But that does not mean that substitution with an imposed advisory council is the way to go.</para><para>This debate has been held between a dozen or so non-Indigenous people—all with a view on what should be done to improve the parlous health and social conditions of our Indigenous people. I have tried to put down a few words from some of the Aboriginal leaders in this country, for it is their opinions that we should be respecting. The recurring theme from most Aboriginal leaders, whether from Pat or Mick Dodson, or the late Johnny Bugg in my electorate, is self-determination. ATSIC is flawed because it was not a product of self-determination. Abolition and mainstreaming of services are a return to failed policies of the past. It is a return to assimilation and paternalism. </para><para>A selected national council is no solution at all. We are locking the broader Aboriginal community out of the process, and only if we have the patience to develop a process like that outlined by Pat Dodson will we begin to meet our responsibility to the custodians of this land, whether they be urban or outback. In the absence of satisfactory alternatives to ATSIC in this bill, I support the thrust of the opposition's second reading amendment; but at this point I will be abstaining from any vote.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>29846</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Brendan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR</name><name.id>00AN3</name.id><electorate>Burke</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise in this debate on the <inline ref="R2064">Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 2004</inline> and, with regret—along with other Labor colleagues—support the abolition of ATSIC, but not for the reasons of the Prime Minister and the government. Labor will refer the bill to a Senate committee for inquiry and report. Labor does not support the transfer of Indigenous programs to Canberra based bureaucracies as outlined by the government. By referring the bill to a Senate committee we seek, most importantly, to provide proper and comprehensive input by Indigenous Australians about life after ATSIC.</para></talk.start><para>I think it is important to reflect upon the comments by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Amanda Vanstone, when they announced the government's intention to abolish ATSIC in April this year. I will quote the apparent goals of the government. The Prime Minister said:</para><quote><para>Our goals in relation to indigenous affairs are to improve the outcomes and opportunities and hopes of indigenous people in areas of health, education and employment. We believe very strongly that the experiment in separate representation, elected representation, for indigenous people has been a failure. We will not replace ATSIC with an alternative body. We will appoint a group of distinguished indigenous people to advise the Government on a purely advisory basis in relation to aboriginal affairs. Programmes will be mainstreamed, but arrangements will be established to ensure that there is a major policy role for the Minister for Indigenous Affairs.</para></quote><para>That was the primary basis upon which the government explained its decision to abolish ATSIC. On issues of service delivery, coordination and administration of ATSIC programs after ATSIC's abolition, the Prime Minister and Senator Vanstone made the following points. They indicated that service delivery and coordination at a grassroots level would be raised at the next COAG meeting. The Prime Minister said: </para><quote><para>The COAG trials in this area have been encouraging and have taught us a number of lessons, and I look forward to close cooperation with the states.</para></quote><para>He stated further:</para><quote><para>The regional councils will have a role in the interim—</para></quote><para>that is, they will have an interim role until they cease to exist on 30 June next year—</para><quote><para>as we establish different mechanisms at a local level through consultation with communities and with local government and with state governments. ...</para><para>That of course does not in any way preclude processes whereby indigenous people themselves will in different areas, according to their own priorities, elect bodies and people to represent them, and the Government will in the course of consulting different sections of the community, be very keen to consult any bodies that may emerge from that process.</para></quote><para>The Prime Minister further indicated that there would need to be effective coordination between ministers and, he said:</para><quote><para>... there will be a ministerial task group which will be chaired by Senator Vanstone, which will bring together all of the Ministers that have an interest.</para></quote><para>According to the budget papers of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, there will be a new office of Indigenous policy coordination established to assist in this role. </para><para>The final point I would like to make in relation to the comments made by the Prime Minister and the minister for Indigenous affairs with respect to the proposal to abolish ATSIC is that they indicated that there would be arrangements in place where resources for ATSIC programs which are transferred to departments are quarantined for future funding of Indigenous programs.</para><para>I have selected a number of significant parts of the contributions made by the Prime Minister and Minister Vanstone in relation to the decision that was made by the government to abolish ATSIC. In short, it means the end of self-determination as we know it for Indigenous Australians and the end of the opportunity for Indigenous Australians to make decisions for themselves and their destiny. It is a sad day indeed.</para><para>Having looked at the words and the intent behind the government's decision, I have some further comments to make in relation to the history of the decisions made by governments and the way in which this matter has evolved over the last 40 years. The government's proposal to abolish ATSIC, replace it with an appointed advisory body and mainstream the delivery of Indigenous programs raises a number of important issues. With respect to policy advice, I think it is important to make some observations. The government's proposed appointed advisory body is, in some ways, structurally analogous to the former Council of Aboriginal Affairs, or CAA—the advisory body established by the coalition government following the 1967 referendum—in that its membership will be appointed rather than elected by Indigenous people. The CAA was comprised of three eminent non-Indigenous people at the time: the chair, H.C. Nugget Coombs; distinguished Australian diplomat, Barry Dexter; and eminent anthropologist, William Stanner. The obvious difference between the CAA and the proposed new body is that the government's proposed advisory body would, in this instance, be made up of Indigenous people rather than non-Indigenous people. That would be the only net gain from an advisory body appointed next year, for example, and one appointed almost 40 years ago.</para><para>However, the fact that the new body would be appointed rather than elected, I contend, will expose the advisory body itself to the criticism that it will be unrepresentative and undemocratic, and the government to the criticism that it will listen only to the advice that it wants to hear. I think it is fair to say that, now we have listened to the responses made by Aboriginal leaders and others, there are clear signs that the kinds of distinguished Indigenous people that the government might be hoping to attract to the proposed advisory body may not be interested in joining it. It is one of those things—unfortunately, the distinction of a person may in fact be demeaned by being appointed to particular bodies. It may well be the case that, as expressed by many Aboriginal leaders, this body would not indeed be worth being appointed to. I note that former Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation chair, Patrick Dodson, said that the government would have difficulty finding anyone to join its planned advisory body because, in his words, advisory boards in these circumstances are `a waste of space.'</para><para>The proposed advisory structure raises important issues also about the advocacy of Indigenous issues. One of the key roles of the ATSIC board and its two precursors—the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee, the NACC, and the National Aboriginal Conference, the NAC—was to advocate for Indigenous people on various issues. In particular, each of these bodies was active in advocating and promoting debate on Indigenous political rights issues. An appointed body whose role is to advise government on policy matters will presumably be less inclined to take up the role of Indigenous advocate played by ATSIC and the NAC and the NACC before it. Notwithstanding the efforts by the government to indicate a replacement for ATSIC, there are some significant concerns expressed by Indigenous and non-Indigenous people about the mandate that such a board or body would have to represent Indigenous people. Indeed, I think it is fair to say and argue that it is a long step back to a time when Indigenous people had to hope to be appointed by a government rather than be elected by their own people. </para><para>A related point raised by the government's proposals concerns the extent to which a body appointed by the government will be free to criticise government policy. An important feature of ATSIC and its precursors was their independence from the government of the day, which meant that they were relatively free to criticise government policy. It could well be argued that that same freedom may not exist, as I said, with an appointed advisory body. Further, this may be detrimental to the quality of advice that the government receives. The Prime Minister's and Senator Vanstone's statement in April of this year announcing the government's proposals indicated that the new arrangements would not preclude processes whereby Indigenous people themselves will, in different areas and according to their own priorities, elect bodies and people to represent them. I think it is fair to say that it would be difficult to see how such bodies will be able to form and operate if there are no resources made available to support them.</para><para>With respect to the issue of service delivery, I think that a number of observations must be made. Firstly, I indicate that the government's proposed arrangements for the administration of the Indigenous affairs port-folio emphasise the idea of mainstream--ing. This means that programs currently delivered by ATSIC will transfer to the mainstream departmental structure. For example, according to an article entitled `Canberra picks over the bones of ATSIC' written by Stuart Rintoul and James Madden and published recently in the<inline font-style="italic"> Australian</inline>, the CDEP—Com-munity Development and Em-ployment Projects—business development and assistance and the Home Ownership Program will be transferred to the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations. The Community Housing and Infrastructure Program and projects focused on Indigenous women will be transferred to the Department of Family and Community Services. Arts, culture and language, broad-casting services, sports and recreation and the maintenance and protection of Indigenous heritage will be moved to the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts.</para><para>It should be noted that the move to mainstreaming is not without precedent. That is, some program areas, such as Indigenous education and Indigenous health, are currently managed by mainstream departments. Indeed, one of the major frustrations of ATSIC and its supporters has been the tendency to blame ATSIC for apparent failures in areas of service delivery for which it has not and does not now have responsibility. Indeed, earlier speakers made comment upon the fact that ATSIC, for all of its failings in recent times, has been blamed for problems for which it had no responsibility. It would appear that that has continued throughout its life and it is a major problem. It is important, I think, to bear in mind in any discussion of mainstreaming that, while those in favour of mainstreaming argue that it provides greater scope for service delivery agencies to be held to account, there is very little evidence that mainstream service delivery leads to better outcomes for Indigenous people. That was confirmed or underlined by a number of earlier speakers. The 2001 Commonwealth Grants Commission report on the funding of Indigenous programs made it clear that there was no evidence that mainstreaming would improve services. In fact, it indicated on page 52: </para><quote><para>It is clear from all available evidence that mainstream services do not meet the needs of Indigenous people to the same extent as they meet the needs of non-Indigenous people.</para></quote><para>So I do not think the argument that is being put by the government is substantiated by the evidence commissioned by the Commonwealth Grants Commission. The move towards mainstreaming service delivery and the removal of executive power over Indigenous affairs programs from an Indigenous control body mark a fundamental shift away from the principle of self-determination—the basic idea that Aboriginal people should have a significant say in the management of policies and programs which will affect them. The fact is that all of the consequences that flow from the decision leave Labor in no position other than to ensure there is a decent and comprehensive review by a Senate committee to see what should replace ATSIC.</para><para>I note that speakers on both sides have made reference to Aboriginal leaders and spokespeople in this debate, and I will be no different. I was not able to attend the speech given in the Great Hall by Patrick Dodson last week, but I did receive a copy of the speech, and I think that, in a very comprehensive way, it not only places the abolition of ATSIC in a historical context but also expresses a deep regret on behalf of Indigenous and non-Indigenous people that we have not moved forward in this area. If the Prime Minister and the government truly believe that they have managed to achieve practical reconciliation then I think they are kidding themselves.</para><para>In my first speech in this place, I made comment that I would like to see proper and lasting reconciliation with Aboriginal people, and of course that includes a national apology on behalf of the Australian people by the government. Clearly, the Prime Minister does not hold that view. The Prime Minister's view is that we do not need symbolic gestures; we do not need symbolic contrition or indeed any formal apology. The Prime Minister's view is that what we do need is practical reconciliation. The fact is that, unfortunately, there has been no clear evidence of any practical reconciliation—whatever that term means. There have certainly been no improvements to the health, welfare and education of Aboriginal people in the eight years this government has been in office. The decision now is a difficult one, but I think it is fair to say that the Prime Minister, when it suits him, does believe in symbolism because I believe he sees some symbolism in his decision to abolish ATSIC. I think for him, and the government generally, the abolition of ATSIC is an opportunity to remove any tenet of self-determination by Indigenous Australians. So he is not a person who does not see symbolism as important—notwithstanding the comments he makes. He understands quite clearly that this quick and simple decision to abolish ATSIC without properly consulting Indigenous Australians and without anything comprehensive in its stead has managed to move this important issue in Australia back to the days of the sixties, in a way, when all we had in place for Aboriginal people was an advisory body of three appointed non-Indigenous people.</para><para>It appears that there is no intention by the government, or government members, to properly involve Aboriginal people in decisions about their future. I hope that, when this matter is referred to a Senate committee, firstly, we will be able to ensure that Indigenous Australians have a comprehensive say about their future post-ATSIC and, secondly, there will be a recommendation by that committee that will allow for a body ensuring democracy amongst Indigenous Australians, giving them a mandate to represent their people, because without such we are certainly going to go backwards. In the end of course, the most important thing is the wellbeing of Indigenous Australians. If we are concerned about their health, and their wellbeing generally, we also have to concern ourselves with what they feel and what they need—and what they need, of course, is self-determination. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>29850</page.no><name role="metadata">Windsor, Antony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr WINDSOR</name><name.id>009LP</name.id><electorate>New England</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to briefly speak to the <inline ref="R2064">Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 2004</inline>. Even though it is a fait accompli that ATSIC as we currently know it will be abolished, I would like to place on record my thanks to some of the people in my region who have been involved with ATSIC over many years, particularly those based at the Tamworth regional office. I think that the regional manager, Bob Faulkner, has done an exceptional job not only in the management of ATSIC within that regional component but also on reconciliation in our area generally. I would also like to thank his assistant, Joe Craigie, and many others in the ATSIC office.</para></talk.start><para>Even though there is probably consensus that there have been some difficulties in the national leadership of ATSIC, at a regional level many positive changes have been made and many issues addressed—they have not the subject of major articles in the national press—that have seen significant gains for particular communities, individuals and families. That has not happened because the government has imposed certain rules and regulations; it has happened because people within a structure have determined that within their area they are prepared to and intend to make some degree of difference. I happen to live near the community of Caroona, which has an Aboriginal community called Walhollow, and that community particularly demonstrates to me that where you have strong local leadership and assistance from the bureaucracy you can achieve quite outstanding results in assisting a community to move forward.</para><para>I can remember as a child, going to school at the public school at Werris Creek, going out and playing football against the kids at Caroona. Caroona was an Aboriginal mission in those days. It is now the Walhollow Aboriginal community—an excellent community by any measure and one that, in my view, should be used as a model for a lot of other communities that want to improve themselves. I remember going out there as a kid to play football. Many of the Aboriginal children that were there at the time are adults of my age now, and we are still friends. The Werris Creek school did not have football guernseys at the time, so we dressed in wheat bags with three holes cut in them to play the children of Caroona who did not have any football boots. But they had the capacity to run on khaki burr and other burrs and black soil which comprised the football field. Obviously, the kids from Werris Creek were much softer in their environment and were unable to compete at the same level. I do not think we ever won a game of football at Caroona.</para><para>Various community groups have many pluses and I would not like to see us flush everything down the sink because we are abolishing the national program in relation to ATSIC. We must make sure that the positives that have occurred over recent years, particularly for the younger people in ATSIC—those who are in their 20s and 30s now—who have displayed leadership within their communities and have been coming to grips with an understanding of government and how to use the appropriate processes of lobbying government and who have done a lot in Indigenous health issues—are not left out. It would be a great shame if those people were left out of the agenda. </para><para>One of the things that the government really does need to have a very close look at in the proposed legislation is that the appointment of an advisory body may not be acceptable to the great majority of Aboriginal people—not necessarily the Aboriginal political players but the Aboriginal people. In recent years there have been some great gains. A lot of people on the ground in the communities have felt that reconciliation has been starting to work. They have felt they are part of the broader community because they are being engaged in that community process. If we leave those people out in the future, we run the risk of severe slippage in the Indigenous agenda. I urge the government, in putting in place this so-called advisory body, to actually reconsider whether that is the best way to go about this particular process and to consult with as many people as they possibly can—I suggest maybe over a weekend or a week where Aboriginal people can come together and talk in a positive sense about their future rather than in a protesting sense. The government should allow a coming together of a whole range of individuals to sit down and try and make this thing work better than it has in the past. That could be done. There are some excellent people out there that are striving to make life better not only for Indigenous Australians but for all Australians.</para><para>Last weekend I had the pleasure of running into an old parliamentary colleague of mine who has since retired—Colin Markham, from the Wollongong area of New South Wales, who has done a tremendous amount for the Indigenous community and was very helpful in my electorate when I was a state member of parliament in the establishment of the Coledale Community Centre, which essentially services all people but Aboriginal people in the majority in the area of Coledale. It has been an outstanding success. There again it is on a local level, but they were assisted by very caring people such as Col Markham. Bob Carr, the Premier of New South Wales, was with Col Markham on the weekend at the community in Bingara which is in my constituency. He actually overnighted in Bingara then went on to the site of the Myall Creek massacre memorial the next day. There again, at a local level there has been a very positive coming together of cultures in recognition of what did actually happen those many years ago at Myall Creek. There has been local leadership and people willing to provide support at a whole range of levels, and I would hope that by just appointing an advisory body we do not fence a lot of those people out of the agenda.</para><para>One of the concerns I have that I would like to relay to the House is that, even though the Aboriginal people in Australia make up only about two per cent of the population, they do include something like five per cent of the younger people in our population. If we do not embrace and give younger Aboriginal Australians a glimpse of a future that involves them being part of the broader Australian agenda, we run the risk of having an angry group of young people in our midst. I do not think we can just turn away and say, `We'll deal with that when it comes.' If we leave a number of people out of the broader agenda, we run the risk of those young people becoming an angry group. Those people have a tremendous amount of potential, and we really should be trying to embrace them.</para><para>Regarding the subject I have just spoken about—and younger people particularly—on a local level there have been some initiatives that have made some real progress, and there is need for government assistance there. If the government are going down this mainstreaming road, there are examples at the local level where they could help. The first example I will talk about is Youth Insearch, which applies not only to Aboriginal people but also to all young people who in their early teenage years or mid teenage years may be experiencing difficulty because of family background, economic circumstance or life generally—they may just have got in with the wrong crowd. </para><para>I would like to pay a compliment to Youth Insearch. Mr Ron Barr is the chief executive of Youth Insearch. He was in the parliament yesterday, and I have had a bit to do with him for a number of years now. Youth Insearch, for those who do not know, is essentially a voluntary program where young people volunteer to go to various camps in different parts of New South Wales—and also in Queensland and other parts of Australia—and spend time together trying to come to grips with some of the problems that they may have. These problems may be linked to their family background or to drug and alcohol addiction or to physical and sexual abuse—there is a whole range of problems like that. Youth Insearch has an amazing record of helping young people.</para><para>I was very pleased to see Ron Barr again yesterday, and he told me that there was a camp at Kurrajong Heights in Sydney only last week where 65 young Australians came together—people on the verge of going one way or the other in their lives; people who may be appearing in the courts. These people are not at the top of the tree in terms of the gratuities et cetera and family backgrounds that some luckier kids have. We can change the direction of the lives of these kids if we help them at the appropriate stage.</para><para>Out of all the programs that I have seen in my time as a member of parliament, Youth Insearch is by far the most productive in terms of results. It is not only productive because the people who drive and organise the program are very caring and well-meaning people; it is productive because the young people are mixing with people who have had problems themselves, and they help themselves through their various problems. I am aware that Mr Ron Barr and Mr Paul Simpson, who were in the parliament, yesterday have put a submission to Minister Larry Anthony in relation to funding for some part-time assistance in relation to their camps. I encourage the government to look very closely at that application. Anybody who has had anything to do with Youth Insearch in the past will recognise that its results are quite phenomenal.</para><para>I was delighted that Mr Ron Barr said that, of the 65 kids at Kurrajong Heights last week, 16 were from Tamworth in my electorate—it is where my electorate office is—and eight of them were Indigenous young people from Coledale. I referred to Coledale a moment ago. It is where former Premier John Fahey, a previous member of this House, assisted in the setting up of a community centre that, after the Carr government came into power in New South Wales, Col Markham was instrumental in assisting in many ways too. Mr Barr said that eight of those kids were exceptional and really gained from the Youth Insearch program. He dropped into my office to let me know that and to compliment the children from the Coledale area that had come to Youth Insearch only last week. At that time, I rang the magistrate at the Tamworth district court, Mal McPherson, who in a voluntary sense is helping Youth Insearch. He said to me on the phone, `I'm trying to help the kids before I see them appearing in front of me in the court.' I congratulate Mal McPherson and Evelyn Parkinson from his office for the work that they are doing for not only Aboriginal children but all children who need that little bit of help. I hope that, in the establishment of this advisory body and the various other things that the legislation will allow, the government remembers that there are groups on the ground that we really need to get behind. </para><para>There are two other things I want to raise with reference to my electorate. Both have achieved outstanding results in terms of delivery of services to Indigenous people. Firstly, in Armidale in my electorate, the Minimbah preschool and primary school was set up some years ago by a very well-recognised Aboriginal woman called Diane Roberts. She has subsequently been awarded the OAM for her contribution to the education of Aboriginal people. The school is an independent school that recognises the particular needs of Aboriginal people, although it is not only for Aboriginal people—other cultures are free to attend. But the school does have some unique features in terms of its status as an independent school. Those features relate in some way to the differences between Aboriginal people and others—white people particularly.</para><para>One of the problems that Minimbah primary school is experiencing is that its enrolment rate varies because some of the Aboriginal families only live in Armidale for part of the year; they may go back to the coast for part of the year, as they have done for thousands of years. Consequently, enrolment is not the same as at other independent schools. Minimbah primary school is asking for a hearing from Minister Amanda Vanstone in relation to its particular problems—and for some administrative assistance, if at all possible. The school has recognised that education is not only about reading, writing and arithmetic but also about the broader educational experience within the community—family life and all those sorts of things. The school has produced some outstanding results and is run by some very caring people, and so I hope the government will look favourably at that sort of example when providing assistance in the future.</para><para>The final thing I want to raise in relation to the broader debate is the Aboriginal Employment Strategy, another successful program that has been developed  not at a national level but at a local level. Most of the successful things that we see in life are driven from the bottom up, rather than being imposed from the top down, and again I think that there could be real problems with the appointment by the government of the day of some advisory panel to tell people what they are going to do. If we fence people out, we run the risk of having some very real problems in the future. The Aboriginal Employment Strategy is based on a model that was developed by Dick Estens. Some of you might have heard Dick's name before. I was fairly critical of an inquiry into Telstra that was chaired by Dick Estens, but he has done an outstanding job in relation to the Aboriginal Employment Strategy.</para><para>The Aboriginal Employment Strategy started at Moree, with the participation of the cotton industry, and it has subsequently opened an office in Tamworth. It is a model that the government should have a very close look at, with a view to developing it, because—like Youth Insearch and like Minimbah—there are measurable results on the ground in terms of jobs. I was at a television studio only about a month ago and, while talking to the manager, I was delighted to recognise the girl who was on the front desk: she was an Aboriginal girl from my home town of Werris Creek. I asked her about how long she had been there, and she told me she had found employment through the Aboriginal Employment Strategy based in Tamworth. The manager told me that one of their other people was moving on to another job somewhere else in the network and, because they had been so pleased with the relationship they had developed with the Aboriginal Employment Strategy people, he was going to go back to them to get a replacement. He also said that the girl who was behind the desk was being promoted through the system. There are countless examples at a local level of interaction between business and the community, and I want to put on the public record the fact that I do congratulate Dick Estens on the work he has done in terms of Aboriginal employment. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>29854</page.no><name role="metadata">Katter, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KATTER</name><name.id>HX4</name.id><electorate>Kennedy</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I think that the measure of any country is probably how it treats some of its poorest people. I listened to a speech recently by a professor from the University of Queensland who said that this country had three great shames: the way we treated the men who came home from Vietnam, the way we treated our dairy farmers and the way we treated the first Australians. To that list, I would add the Boer War and the concentration camps there; and our refusal to allow the Jewish people into Australia during the Second World War. Most certainly, I think, they are five things this country should not be very proud of at all.</para></talk.start><para>People might say, `All right, some mistakes were made'—and some would argue that some very terrible mistakes were made —`and there have been endeavours to try and overcome that situation.' But really, whether or not those mistakes were made, where you have an identifiable group of people who start from a base of no education and have, in the case of those who live in a totally first Australian community—or, some people would say, in an Aboriginal community—no inherited understanding of democratic processes, of the rule of law and of all of those sorts of concepts, you are asking a lot. If you say that they are not doing it well under self-management—and I am referring specifically to Queensland, which is the only state really that had self-management, although I have to use the past tense there—you have to remember that you are asking a group of people to leap from virtually no background at all in democracy or rule of law to modern day, sophisticated, democratic processes and systems. If it is taking them a while to get there, it is worth remembering that the British set up the King's Council at Runnymede in 1215 and I do not really think there was democracy in England until the 1800s. It took them 600 years. If you want to use Cromwell as your baseline you are still talking about 400 years, and yet you are expecting this group of people to leap more quickly than that. There has been a lot of criticism in Queensland over the qualified reports from the Auditor-General for the self-managed—self-governing, if you like—com-munities of Queensland, but if we understand history and recognise how long it took the English to achieve a proper functioning democratic system then I think we can allow the people in this country some benefit of doubt.</para><para>Today the ALP have moved a second reading amendment to the <inline ref="R2064">Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 2004, </inline>which we are currently debating. I think their amendment is very good, except for the first part of it. I wish they would split it up so that I could vote for it, but I have enormous difficulties with the use of the word `reconciliation'. If you keep talking about reconciliation, it means that you see there is a necessity for reconciliation. I would hope that in the hearts and minds of all Australians there is no necessity for reconciliation. Reconciliation assumes that there is a conflict. People are at a great distance from this problem. The honourable member for Lingiari, who is from the Northern Territory, is in the House, and I think he may have some inkling of what I am saying here—and its correctness or incorrectness. </para><para>We have special academic prizes in Queensland for people who are of Aboriginal descent. Why do they need special prizes? To me, that sends out the most terrible psychological message—the same message that the reconciliation debate sends out. I simply do not see this as other people see it. People constatly refer to Aborigines, and I constantly try to use the term `first Australians', because again I do not want to differentiate. I had the very great honour and privilege of being brought up in one of the most integrated communities in Australia—in fact a lot of people describe my hometown of Cloncurry, of which I am very proud, as easily the most integrated community in Australia. There just was no consciousness there of these people being different. In everything you did in your life there was a black face among the people you were doing it with—whether we were playing up behind the hotel or getting up to all the pranks we got up to at the Two Mile Waterhole, on the rugby league oval, at mustering camps or wherever.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>IJ4</name.id><name role="metadata">Snowdon, Warren, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Snowdon</name></talker><para>—What did you do at the Two Mile Waterhole?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>HX4</name.id><name role="metadata">Katter, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KATTER</name></talker><para>—I had better ignore that one and move on! I have watched this very closely over the years, having been one of the longest serving Aboriginal affairs ministers in Australian history—serving in state government—and having had the great privilege of receiving the accolades of almost every leader. I do not say that to praise myself, but because it relates to the ALP's amendment, which says that there was no interface with people of Aboriginal descent before this decision was made and asks what is going to happen afterwards. You have to understand that, after I left Queensland politics, subsequent governments have run into horrific problems in Aboriginal affairs. Every minister they have had has been tenaciously condemned by the black community. They all had the unfortunate burden of following me as minister—and I make the point that my background in Cloncurry gave me a great advantage so I do not want anyone to think I am praising myself here; that is not the point I am making.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The point I am making to the House is that I remember a three-month period in which I spent only three nights in my home, even though I had five little kids I love very much—as we all love our kids. Every one of those nights and days was spent sitting down and staring at the faces—the black faces—of Australians and, please God I hope, at all times keeping my mouth shut and desperately trying to listen. That has not taken place since. Not since Billy Wentworth was in this place have we had a single Aboriginal affairs minister who has gone out there and put real time into this portfolio. It does require an awful lot of time, because these people are not very friendly towards outsiders—and who can blame them. You have to spend an enormous amount of time to win their confidence. I had a lot of experience of living in communities that were predominantly of Aboriginal descent—the Cloncurry community is arguably predominantly of Aboriginal descent. It is a big town too, in the sense that it has 4,000 people, which is big by our standards in western Queensland.</para><para>Those people did not want to interface directly with me on many occasions. I had to have black people—black Australians, if you like to use that expression—that I interfaced with, and then they interfaced with the local first Australians—Aboriginal people, if you like—who then interfaced with the local community. So you needed communication through four stages to really get the message on many occasions. There was no short way. Simply spending the time on the ground with these people was the only way to come up with the answers that they wanted. </para><para>I find it extraordinary that I constantly hear about native title and tribal ownership. All of these concepts that prevail in this place and in the Queensland parliament now are concepts that, quite frankly, are not wanted by the people. When I became the minister for Aboriginal affairs in Queensland, I became the owner of six million acres—all very good country with annual rainfall of more than 25 inches. It included the land opposite Cairns and Trinity Inlet, which is some of the most valuable land in Queensland. Yarrabah, for example, has some of the most valuable real estate in the state. As minister, I had inherited all this land. I owned it, in the sense that the Governor in Council appointed the legal owners of these Aboriginal reserves.</para><para>So we went out to the people and said, `At the present time, the government owns this six million acres. It is not right or proper, moral or legal, that we should continue to own this land. What do you want?' They asked, `What are the options?' We put up the options: they could have tribal council ownership; they could have land council ownership, because the land councils were already going in those days; they could have a continuation of government ownership; they could have all the councils from Cape York Peninsula or the gulf owning the land collectively; they could have their local council owning the land; or they could own the land themselves, privately—each individual's own family could own the land. Surprise, surprise: out of the 3,800 people that the proposition was put to, only three did not want to own the land privately. Would you have got any other result if you had asked other Australians—or Russians or Bullamakankans? Surprise, surprise: that was what they wanted. Is that what they got? No. The governments and the parliaments of Australia have told them that they need native title ownership of land.</para><para>If you are close to these people and they trust you, they will tell you that this is a migaloo—a migaloo is a whitefella—plot. It most certainly has been enormously successful in getting all the black Australians to hate each other. If it was a device to divide and conquer, it has been enormously successful. At Yarrabah we had the incredible situation where the original tribe took out an injunction against the building of any houses because they were to be built on their land. So we had no houses at Yarrabah for three or four years because we were finding a way through this injunction.</para><para>I was told in no uncertain terms at the Innot Hot Springs Hotel about three years ago by a group of first Australians that I had been a party to this plot to get them to all kill each other. They were very aggressive about it, I can tell you. One of the five or six most prominent leaders in Australia said exactly the same thing to me at the Mining Council dinner some years ago. Both some ordinary people in the street and one of the highest people in Aboriginal affairs had an idea in the back of their heads that this land ownership arrangement was so bad that it was actually a plot for them to get rid of each other. They talked about the old days and the police. It was sadly true in Queensland that most of the police that were responsible for the punishment—and there are a lot of words we could use here—that resulted in the deaths of many, many Aboriginal people were black police. The police force in Cloncurry, which was involved in outright warfare with the Kalkadoon tribe, was wiped out. The entire police force of 15 was wiped out by the Kalkadoon. All the members of that police force—bar one—were of Aboriginal descent.</para><para>The lack of communication would break the heart of any patriotic Australian—it is a total lack of communication. Has anyone from this place gone to Doomadgee, where we have nearly 17 people in each house? Those who go there pass very harsh judgment upon Doomadgee. I am sure that if you put nearly 20 people in every home in Townsville, Mr Deputy Speaker, the houses would not be in a very good condition. A house that is designed to take four people is taking nearly 20 people. The young man who is the CEO there, Troy Fraser—he is a man of outstanding abilities and I pay him a very great tribute—has done everything humanly possible. He has reformed the local rugby league team, getting them to travel 1,000 kilometres almost every time they have to play a game in the mid-west. Of course, I was heavily involved myself. </para><para>Troy's father was the CEO there before him and also the chairman of the council when I was the minister. I said to Troy: `Your father was building 17 houses a year here. How many are we building now?' He said, `Two.' I said, `Well, you're getting the same amount of money'—which is probably between $300,000 and $500,000 a year—and he said, `Yes, but I can't do it; I can only build two houses.' I said: `Why aren't you using CDEP? Your father used work for the dole. He rang me and said that everybody else had a block-making machine and he wanted one there. As minister, I wrote out a cheque for $85,000 and he got his block-making machine. So he was getting the bricks for virtually no cost at all, because they were being built by CDEP labour, and all the bricklaying for the houses was done by the local CDEP work force. So he was able to produce 17 houses a year. Why can't you do that now?' Troy said: `I've tried, Bob. But the national competition policy says we've got to call for tenders and we just end up with white contractors who fly in, slap a house together and fly out again, taking all the money with them.'</para><para>So we have moved from a situation where there were 30 or 40 jobs locally building houses—people being given pride and respect. Surely, if someone from here had gone to Doomadgee they would have realised the problem and done something about it. But nobody here has gone to Doomadgee. I go to these places. I said, `Haven't you spoken to the state minister about this?' I rang Gerry Hand, and Gerry said, `Great idea, Bob; we'll do it.' It was as simple as that. Troy Fraser's father, Don Fraser, rang me, the minister. I answered the telephone. He had no hesitation in ringing me, because he knew me well; I had been up there dozens and dozens of times. He had great confidence in being able to ring me up and talk to me. I just rang up Gerry Hand—and I pay that man respect, because I think he did a good job—and he said, `Yes, we'll do it.' I assume almost every community at the time had block-making machines. They met exactly the same specifications as Besser. Every thousandth brick was sent to Brisbane for testing. They had to meet exactly the same specifications as Besser met. </para><para>The road into Doomadgee is out for some two or three months of the year on average. This is a community of 2,000 people with no communication with the outside world. There is no food produced locally at all. They have set up some sort of privately owned station but they cannot get any title deeds and so they cannot borrow any money off the bank to develop it or buy cattle to put on it.</para><para>I am not here to condemn ATSIC. I can see the very great problems that they had in the process. I am not here to defend them and I am not here to condemn them one way or the other. But I want to say this. In North Queensland, the first Australians own almost as much land as Stanbroke Pastoral Company or the AA Company—the two biggest pastoral companies in Australia. Both of those companies are making profits of around $100 million a year. For the 10,000 people of Aboriginal descent living on the gulf and the peninsula, that would work out to maybe—I do not know—$40,000 or $50,000 per family on top of what they are already getting. </para><para>These people have the wherewithal and the resources to be rich Australians. But they are not. The reason they are not is that they do not actually own those stations at all. In one of the most contemptible acts that I have seen—and I have seen many contemptible acts in 33 years—the Queensland Labor government reversed the legislation that the black people of Queensland asked me to put through. Each of the six million acres was owned by the local shire council—an arrangement which, again, I set up as minister, at the direction of black people. I would have been skinned alive if I had not. If you have to go and live in these places with these people you want to deliver to them what they want. So ownership of the land was moved to the local shire council, with a mechanism to devolve it to private ownership. The incoming Labor government, for reasons that to this very moment have never been established and that precipitated the worst rioting in Queensland parliamentary history, took the six million acres back.</para><para>The owners of that six million acres now are trustees appointed at the discretion of the minister. I inherited legislation under which the ownership of the land was appointed by the Governor in Council. Now it is not even appointed by the Governor in Council; it is appointed just by the minister. So whoever is the minister for Aboriginal affairs in Queensland is the proud owner of six million acres of land. The people were dispossessed and they staged the worst rioting in Queensland parliamentary history. Did anyone listen to them then? Did a single person from the Queensland government walk through the fence, as I did, and say, `What's this all about, fellas?' A lot of change is needed. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>29858</page.no><name role="metadata">Hardgrave, Gary, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HARDGRAVE</name><name.id>CK6</name.id><electorate>Moreton</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The member for Kennedy has made fine contribution, a very emotional essay, and I think that many in this place would greatly admire his passion for the cause.

I wish to also table a couple of minor corrections to the explanatory memorandum.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I will begin by expressing deep disappointment at aspects of this debate. Initially the government drew strength from believing that the opposition, the Australian Labor Party, was genuinely interested in taking the road less travelled, to look with a vision for a better future for our first peoples. Instead, sadly, we now have an opposition that is using this issue—the abolition of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission—as a pawn in a political strategy to differentiate itself from the Howard government, in an effort to try to score some political points. Perhaps some would see this as the biggest backflip since Methuselah was a young man. I do not know. Either way, I do not think it is going to wash with the Australian public. </para><para>Sadly, we have seen yet again a political party that presumes it can win the next election and form a government that is lacking in much detail. I think the lack of detail in itself underscores a complete lack of commitment to the real task ahead. It is clear that the opposition has completely misunderstood this bill. Indeed, it does not seem interested in reading the bill in the true spirit in which it was intended—that is, as an opportunity to seize the day and to truly empower the Indigenous people, the first Australians, the first people of this country. This bill is designed to be a turning point in Australia's history, towards reconciliation. Instead, the Australian Labor Party is squandering this precious opportunity for its own political and, dare I say, cynical ends.</para><para>Labor says that the consequential amendments are profound and need further scrutiny. This is a nonsense. The profound changes will be achieved through administrative changes that will take place on 1 July 2004, a few weeks from now, regardless of the delaying tactics of the Australian Labor Party. I submit to you that Labor has been listening yet again to the wrong people: the vested interests and, no doubt, many of the ATSIC commissioners who have behaved so badly that support for what they are doing could only come from them. Labor has not been listening to those Indigenous peoples who desperately want change, such as those whom the member for Kennedy was talking about. Instead of looking to the future, Labor has again done nothing but hark back to old reports as a reason to create more reports. In the meantime, Indigenous peoples languish and nothing changes; there is no advance for them.</para><para>The Labor Party talk about the terrible circumstances that many Indigenous people face. But that was a legacy that this government inherited. We have to try to break this cycle. But where is Labor's vision? From this debate it is clear that they simply do not have one or choose not to have one. We agree that the problems we face are not the fault of ATSIC alone. It is not a blame game. We have all in different ways failed to get the sorts of results that Indigenous people and indeed all Australians want. But this parliament has an obligation to change that. The status quo simply is not working. It is time to draw up a new map, a new model.</para><para>This government is serious about reducing Indigenous disadvantage. It has spent a record $2.9 billion on Indigenous-specific programs this year, which is 39 per cent more in real terms than that spent in the last years of the Keating government. It has taken real steps in reducing the disadvantage felt by Indigenous Australians in education, employment, health and housing compared to their non-Indigenous counterparts. The proportion of Indigenous children who stay on at school through to year 12 has risen from 29.2 per cent in 1996 to 39.1 per cent in 2003. Between the 1996 and the 2001 census, the unemployment rate for Indigenous Australians fell from 22.7 per cent to 20 per cent. Funding for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Program stands at more than $280 million in 2004-05, which is more than double, in real terms, the amount allocated in 1995-96. Between the 1996 and the 2001 census, Indigenous home ownership increased from 30.8 per cent to 32.2 per cent. </para><para>Throughout this debate, we have also heard repeated vilification of the Prime Minister, yet it is this Prime Minister—John Howard, the member for Bennelong—who has taken a leadership role with the Council of Australian Governments to advance reconciliation and reduce disadvantage. We are basing our approach on the lessons learnt in the COAG trials—independently assessed as making great ground when it comes to Indigenous infant mortality and the basic health requirements of Indigenous communities, even in the most remote parts of Australia.</para><para>Labor talk about an apology, but what have they done in a practical sense? The government has provided $120 million for real initiatives to address these issues, such as the link-up network, counselling and parenting programs, cultural and language programs, a records preservation project and a national oral history project. They are meaningful outcomes. The opposition continue to dredge up their views on native title. The 1998 amendments to the Native Title Act 1993 have resulted in the volume of claims being rationalised and the claim processes being streamlined. Most recently, the government provided Reconciliation Australia with a capital injection of $15 million. Reconciliation Place has been constructed in the parliamentary triangle at a cost of over $6 million. My colleague Senator Amanda Vanstone, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, yesterday presided at a very emotional ceremony there with original Australians. But it is not good enough to keep working within this same flawed framework designed by Labor. That is why we are going beyond abolishing ATSIC to introduce some radical reforms.</para><para>The member for Fraser has said that Indigenous Australians are emotionally attached to ATSIC but, in actual fact, there has been very little adverse reaction to the abolition of ATSIC. Members of the opposition have also said that there should be more public consultation before we act but, again, nothing could be further from the truth. During the review, there were two major rounds of public consultation. A web site was set up and 8,000 copies of the public discussion paper were mailed out. The panel met with a wide range of stakeholders across the nation, including each of the 35 ATSIC regional councils, and received 156 written submissions. A number of regional councils chose to invite community members to participate. The panel also met with some interested individuals. The public consultations revealed widespread disillusionment and dissatisfaction with ATSIC on the part of Indigenous Australians.</para><para>The opposition have also spoken at length about what they call mainstreaming. They describe it as assimilationist and returning to the past. We say that all government departments have a role to play. The Labor Party says government departments have always failed Indigenous people. We say there is more that should be done.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>IJ4</name.id><name role="metadata">Snowdon, Warren, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Snowdon</name></talker><para>—What have you done about it?

They want to yell and they want to scream, but they do not want to listen. We are not abolishing special programs and we are putting machinery in place to make sure that all government departments and agencies are taking up their responsibilities. Many of the Indigenous programs that mainstream agencies will manage are delivered now by Aboriginal organisations, and they will be in the future. These are simply Labor scare tactics—the big voice with no substance and no detail. </para></talk.start></continue><para>In fact, it was Labor that also mainstreamed Indigenous health programs when it recognised that ATSIC was failing, but it did only part of the job. It left the other programs hanging. It did not put in place the machinery that we are proposing to put in place to make certain that all government departments are accountable. In the Northern Territory where the member for Lingiari comes from, his own Labor government has mainstreamed the management of programs as have almost all states and territories. In general, the states and territories support what we are proposing. It has only been the federal Labor Party that has persisted with this separatist approach.</para><para>Whole-of-government leadership and coordination will be a key feature of our approach and will be provided by a ministerial task force. Secretaries of departments with responsibilities for Indigenous-specific services will be held directly accountable for the successes and/or failures of programs and services. Indigenous coordination centres at the local level will be places where Indigenous communities can expect a whole-of-government response to their needs. All government agencies will now be responsible for 100 per cent of Australians 100 per cent of the time. First Australians deserve first-class service from all government agencies.</para><para>Arrangements for transfer of the programs are well under way. It is obvious where most of the programs will go. The location of some minor programs may change before 1 July 2004, and final administrative details will be provided shortly. Those few programs that are being transferred to agencies outside the Commonwealth are also covered in the bill. Let me also make it clear that any assets held in trust by ATSIC and transferred to the Commonwealth or to anyone else will continue to be held in trust. Item 191(4) makes that clear. The housing fund and the majority of housing and business loans will be transferred to Indigenous Business Australia. The money in the regional land fund and ATSIC land holdings will be transferred to the Indigenous Land Corporation. Land-holdings will continue to be divested.</para><para>The government is not seeking to replace ATSIC with another government imposed representative body. Such bodies have not been effective in the past. Other countries with Indigenous populations such as the USA and Canada do not have such government established bodies. It would be far more consistent with Indigenous self-management for Indigenous people to develop and establish their own representative bodies. Indeed, the fact that so many members spoke on this bill proves that even the broad representative mechanisms of this place are perfectly part of the process of representing Australians of Aboriginal descent.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>IJ4</name.id><name role="metadata">Snowdon, Warren, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>CK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hardgrave, Gary, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HARDGRAVE</name></talker><para>—The Australian Labor Party want to speak with a big voice, but there is no detail to their proposal. They are not providing any detail to any proposal. They are looking for the big wedge, and the big voice drives it. The national Indigenous council, which is not meant to be a representative body, will include Indigenous leaders with expertise and knowledge on a range of issues affecting Indigenous people. Indigenous people will continue to participate in the design and delivery of programs. We on this side, the Liberal Party in particular, have never been afraid to embrace full representation of all people of this country in this place. I was proud to know the late Senator Neville Bonner, who represented my state in the other place.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Labor say that our reforms go beyond the abolition of ATSIC. They need to. What Labor do not understand is that many of the changes will be implemented administratively. We will do so on 1 July 2004. Unfortunately, the transfer of additional funds and functions to Indigenous Business Australia, the Indigenous Land Corporation and the Office of Evaluation and Audit will be delayed. These are positive changes that would benefit Indigenous people. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>IJ4</name.id><name role="metadata">Snowdon, Warren, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Snowdon</name></talker><para>—Who says?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>CK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hardgrave, Gary, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HARDGRAVE</name></talker><para>—The three agencies concerned would tell you that, if you bothered to ask. Indigenous Business Australia, despite what the member for Fraser and, indeed, the member for Lingiari say, wants the housing fund. If Labor had, in fact, read the bill they would recognise that the housing fund would be quarantined within Indigenous Business Australia. The Office of Evaluation and Audit performed an important role within ATSIC. We want to extend that role to all agencies delivering Indigenous-specific programs. This is a worthwhile mechanism of accountability.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The Indigenous Land Corporation will take on responsibility for the regional land fund, previously administered by ATSIC. ATSIC's rural property holdings will be better managed by the ILC and will continue to be divested to Indigenous communities. The opposition, the Labor Party, are concerned that the Torres Strait Islander Advisory Board will be abolished—more scare tactics. In fact, the board have been saying for some time that they are frustrated that ATSIC has not given their people an adequate voice. The arrangement under ATSIC did not work. Mainland Torres Strait Islanders, under our proposal, will be included in the national Indigenous council. We want to hear their views about how their voices can best be heard at the regional and local level. The opposition mistakenly believe that the Indigenous representative on the National Health and Medical Research Council will be removed. That is simply not correct. We are only removing the requirement that the person be nominated by ATSIC. Labor would see the discredited and dysfunctional ATSIC board continue indefinitely at a considerable cost to the taxpayer.</para><para>Labor have shown that they are not committed to the abolition of ATSIC. They are opening the gates to their old mates, their cronies, to carve out a bleak future for Indigenous Australians. This is Labor's Clayton's abolition. No radical change for them. They would simply want to change the labels. What would a future ATSIC look like under Labor? More black armbands; more of the same. Indigenous people have every right to be concerned about what Labor are proposing. Labor will abolish ATSIC and replace it with more of the same. They will change from one nationally elected board to another elected board. They will abolish ATSIS and roll its functions back to their new commission. Regional councils will continue much as they do now, regardless of what people want at the local level. It would go on and on, and we would end up with 35 mini ATSICs instead of one. That is Labor's plan. It is simply not good enough for Labor to pretend to the Australian public that they intend to abolish ATSIC. They really do not have the guts to do what needs to be done.</para><para>In summary, the bill will make major changes to the Australian government's institutional structures in Indigenous affairs to improve the lives of our first Australians. We will provide better arrangements for involving Indigenous people at national and local levels in the determination of priorities and policies related to issues affecting them. The opposition talk about models of empowerment—models which empower some people but in fact disempower the vast majority of Indigenous Australians. They might look after their mates, their cronies; we want to look after the silent majority of Indigenous Australians. The opposition say that we are motivated by some ideology, but the ATSIC model, of course, was based on the ideology of a previous failed Labor government. It failed. Indigenous Australians will tell you that. </para><para>This issue should be above politics. We thought it was. The Australian Labor Party led the public to believe that it was. Only a few months ago the Leader of the Opposition was saying, `We'll abolish ATSIC', to try and get ahead of the game as far as the government's own agenda was concerned. But again the Leader of the Opposition and those who support him have shown themselves to be so lacking in detail as to be dangerous as a potential government of Australia. We cannot let the failed ideology of the past continue. We cannot let that failed ideology of the past stand in the way of a better future for Indigenous Australians. This is important legislation. It should be above the partisan politics being played by those opposite. We lament the fact that they seek to mislead the Australian public in this way. We commend this particular bill to the House.

The threshold ensures that no Medicare levy is payable for low-income individuals and families where taxable income does not exceed a threshold. Above the threshold the Medicare levy shades in at a rate of 20c in the dollar.</para></talk.start><para>Every year since its introduction in 1986, the Medicare levy low-income threshold has been indexed to CPI. The amendments in this bill will increase the threshold for individuals to $15,529. The bill also indexes the Medicare levy surcharge low-income threshold. Where a family's combined income is above the Medicare levy surcharge threshold, each individual with a taxable income above the Medicare levy surcharge low-income threshold must pay the Medicare surcharge of one per cent—that is, of course, if the family does not have private health insurance. The Medicare levy surcharge low-income threshold has historically been set at the same level as the Medicare levy low-income threshold. The bill increases the Medicare levy surcharge low-income threshold in line with the increases in the Medicare levy low-income threshold.</para><para>It would be unforgivable for me not to point out that these amendments represent the only relief from tax in the budget for individuals earning less than $52,000. All they got was what every government has given them for almost 20 years: an indexation of the Medicare low-income threshold. What they deserve is a government not determined to destroy Australia's universal health care system by stealth. They deserve to know that their children can gain a university place based on merit and not be priced out of a degree by students with wealthy parents. What they deserve above all, and what only Labor will deliver, is relief from Australia's highest taxing and highest spending government.</para><para>When we are looking at indexation of tax thresholds, we should also look at the related issue of whether the government's tax cuts have returned bracket creep to most Australian taxpayers. Of course, they have not. By bracket creep I mean explicitly the cost of returning the tax scales to their inflation adjusted equivalent as at the introduction of the GST.</para><para>The Access Economics <inline font-style="italic">Budget Monitor </inline>shows that the value of bracket creep is $2.5 billion in 2004-05 whereas the tax cuts are worth only $1.925 billion. Bracket creep in 2005-06 is $3.9 billion, which, again, is more than the value of the tax cuts of $3.8 billion. In 2006-07 bracket creep will top $5.3 billion, which is almost $1 billion more than the value of the tax cuts of $4.25 billion. Access Economics has supplied me with an estimate of bracket creep for 2007-08 of $6.7 billion, which is almost $2 billion more than the value of the tax cuts in that year of $4.75 billion.</para><para>Over the forward estimates period, the tax cuts fall almost $4 billion short of what Australians have every justification to expect would be the minimum benchmark for the value of tax cuts in this budget—that is, giving back bracket creep over the period. To be absolutely precise, over the budget year and the three forward estimates years, the Access Economics estimate of bracket creep is $18.4 billion. The value of the tax cuts as set out in the measures table in the budget papers is $14.725 billion. That is almost $4 billion of bracket creep being used to maintain a Commonwealth budget surplus. </para><para>The same story can be repeated using other estimates of bracket creep that are routinely published around this country. I have done the same exercise with the estimates of bracket creep that have been provided to me by the Melbourne Institute. You get a very similar picture. If the Treasurer does not like the Access Economics estimates of bracket creep, he might like to look at the Melbourne Institute's estimates. They are, as I said, within a few hundred million dollars of the Access Economics estimates. If he does not like either the Access Economics or the Melbourne Institute estimates of bracket creep then I challenge him to publish the estimates of the Commonwealth Treasury. I know that he will not because, if he did, he would be admitting that his tax cuts are giving back only a part of what has been taken in bracket creep.</para><para>The tax cuts in this budget were less than the bare minimum expected by Australian voters. For four out of five taxpayers, last year's sandwich and milkshake tax cuts now look like a bit of a feast because four out of five Australian taxpayers this year are getting no tax cuts. The sandwich and milkshake tax cuts of last year fell short of giving back bracket creep since the GST was introduced. There is no meaningful measure of bracket creep before that because of the effect of the tax mix switch that accompanied the introduction of the GST. All of these tax cuts are less than the bare minimum that Australian taxpayers could reasonably have thought they had a right to expect.</para><para>This time around, 80 per cent get no return on bracket creep at all. The Treasurer and the Prime Minister have been quick to remind them that they got the sandwich and milkshake tax cut last year. But, of course, that was not enough to hand back bracket creep. Those people who did not get a tax cut at all this year and who got an inadequate tax cut last year are two-time losers. The government has published tax scales for the following year. They are in the process of being legislated for by the parliament and they will pass. The government will give those same taxpayers on less than $52,000 no tax cut in 2005-06. So, in terms of the return of bracket creep, those taxpayers will be three-time losers.</para><para>In this bill we have the only measure in this budget which does anything to provide any tax relief for those taxpayers—and that is only to a small proportion of them, namely, those with incomes under $15,529—by indexing the Medicare low-income threshold. That is all those people are getting in this budget. I think they are going to be, and already are, very annoyed. The government is going to come to regret the way that it has treated them.</para><para>The Labor Party will be presenting an alternative tax policy before the election. People will have a full opportunity to examine it. It will be broader and fairer in the tax cuts and will be accompanied by policies which will at least give those people who are totally reliant on Medicare and bulk-billing a much greater opportunity to have free medical services. We are specifically targeting measures that will increase the proportion of services that are bulk-billed. We believe that our policy will lift bulk-billing rates back to 80 per cent of services. That will be a real relief for people on low incomes. With the exception of this single, small measure that we are passing in this legislation today, this government has given absolutely nothing by way of tax cuts for people on incomes of less than $52,000.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>29866</page.no><name role="metadata">Baldwin, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BALDWIN</name><name.id>LL6</name.id><electorate>Paterson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R2052">Tax Laws Amendment (Medicare Levy and Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2004</inline>, which again demonstrates how this government is supporting individuals and families with low incomes in the area of health. The bill itself will amend the Medicare Levy Act 1986 to increase the Medicare levy low-income thresholds to ensure that low-income individuals and families are exempt from paying the Medicare levy. It means that the Medicare levy low-income threshold for individuals will increase from $15,062 to $15,529. For families, the threshold will increase from $25,417 to $26,205. For those pensioners below age pension age, it will increase from $17,164 to $18,181 to ensure that they do not pay the Medicare levy while they do not have an income tax liability. This is just one example of how this government is working with communities and supporting them in health, but it is a very important one. It reinforces the government's belief that all Australians should have access to high-quality health care while promoting choice in the health care system. </para></talk.start><para>Labor's scare campaign to save Medicare is a fraudulent farce. This government has strengthened Medicare. Earlier this year the government announced MedicarePlus, a $2.85 billion program to strengthen Medicare, now and for future generations. Some of the initiatives in the MedicarePlus package include an additional payment to GPs of $5 for every bulk-billed medical service provided to Commonwealth concession card holders and to children aged under 16 and $7.50 in regional and rural areas. There was the rollout of the HIC online technology to doctors surgeries, so that where patients are not bulk-billed they can have their Medicare claim lodged at the surgery and their rebates paid directly into their bank accounts. This removes the need to visit a Medicare office or an Easyclaim facility.</para><para>We have introduced a safety net to help people cope with the costs of out-of-hospital procedures, such as MRIs, CT scans, ultrasounds, blood tests, X-rays and radiation oncology. The safety net will pay 80 per cent of the out-of-pocket costs for Medicare services provided for families and individuals covered by a Commonwealth concession card or receiving family tax benefit A once their expenses reach $300 and $700 for other individuals and families. We have also introduced a new MBS system for the services of allied health professionals like psychologists, physiotherapists, podiatrists, dieticians and chiropractors—a multidisciplinary care plan for people with chronic and complex health conditions. This can involve at least two allied health professionals and includes dental treatment for patients with chronic or complex conditions. I am impressed by the fact that 1,500 more doctors and 1,600 more equivalent practice nurses will be introduced by 2007. There will be funding of up to $8,000 per GP who provides services to aged care residents who do not have a regular doctor, including after hours and in an emergency, and who participates in the in-home quality improvement. It is an outstanding package which looks to the future needs of our community and which bring improvements to our health system. </para><para>Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for Labor's Medicare plan and their hot spot teams, which doctors in my local area of Paterson have dismissed lock, stock and barrel. Dr Chris Boyle, Chairman of the Hunter Urban Division of General Practice, was quoted in the <inline font-style="italic">Port Stephens Examiner</inline> as saying:</para><quote><para>I was very interested to read what the ALP policy on the Medicare bulk billing team is. It does not involve new GPs. It simply involves moving GPs from private practice to public service—not one new GP ... </para></quote><para>Dr Arn Sprogis, who is the CEO of the Hunter Urban Division of General Practice, told radio 2HD: </para><quote><para>I think it's one of the most bizarre notions I've seen in the 12 or 13 years I've been in this game. I think the Labor Party's lost the plot completely to be quite honest ... it seems now if you're poor turn left and sit in the emergency department ready for your hot spot Medicare team and if you're working then turn right and go to your GP.</para></quote><para>Regardless of the ridiculous plans the ALP put forward, I have always believed that actions speak louder than words. You only have to look at the successes we have had in attracting doctors to Karuah, Medowie and Lemon Tree Passage to find a local example of that. Most recently, we were successful in obtaining a provider number for Dr Falah Sharrad to practice in Medowie. I have met with Dr Sharrad, his wife, Kate, and his family on a couple of occasions now, and they are absolutely delightful people who are committed to the care of their patients. The best news for the community of Medowie is that Dr Sharrad is bulk-billing in his new practice at the Medowie Medical Centre.</para><para>We were able to obtain an overseas training provider number for Dr Hazim Dhahir so that he could practice in Karuah. The good news for the people in Karuah is that Dr Dhahir is also bulk-billing. He took over from the much loved Dr Stan Wiekmann, who passed away in December 2001. Following his death, the community in Karuah rallied together and were able to get a successful outcome—what is now called the Karuah Medical Centre. I would like to thank both doctors for their commitment to the area and I hope they and their families enjoy living in this great part of Australia.</para><para>Aside from the MedicarePlus package and the changing of the Medicare levy threshold as contained in this bill, the government also announced a number of initiatives in the recent budget. Again, I remind people of the Labor Medicare scare campaign and how they opposed the safety net package in MedicarePlus. As of 29 May 2004, nearly 58,000 concessional family tax benefit A families and over 15,000 concessional individuals had incurred out-of-pocket costs of more than $300 for Medicare services provided outside of hospital. There were over 13,000 other families and over 6,000 other individuals who had incurred out-of-pocket costs of more than $700 for Medicare services provided outside hospital. This means that a total of nearly 22,000 individuals and nearly 72,000 families, totalling 232,000 individuals, have reached the safety net. Nearly $9,200,000 in safety net benefits has been paid. A total of 2,250,000 families are registered for the safety net. The only danger to Medicare, the private health insurance industry and private hospitals is the Labor Party. They are the party that voted to deny the safety net. They are the party that will abolish the 30 per cent private health rebate. </para><para>Like all communities, we have our champions in my electorate, and one of the great advocates for Diabetes Australia is Mr Ross Presgrave. I was delighted to be able to inform Ross of the government's plan to help those who find it hard to control diabetes with injections. The use of the new generation insulin infusion pumps allow these people to administer a steady flow of insulin through the day without injections. For anyone who needs to give themselves daily injections of insulin this can be a very difficult task, particularly for young kids. I have a number of young kids in my electorate, such as Aaron Moase and Bryce Chambers, who have to manage this problem on a daily basis. So I welcome this initiative to help those suffering from diabetes.</para><para>Another initiative affecting the Hunter region was the announcement of $5 million for the Hunter Medical Research Institute. This is Australia's only regionally based health and medical research institute and was established in 1998. It now employs over 350 researchers. This funding will assist the institute in constructing a clinical research centre on the campus of the John Hunter Hospital. The work that is coming out of the Hunter Medical Research Institute benefits not just the Hunter in terms of employment but also the whole of our society. The research that is coming out of this facility is quite remarkable. For example, researchers have discovered a placental clock that determines when a baby is born. Another example is the discovery of a particular compound found in green leafy vegetables which stops cancer cell growth. This amazing research, which is happening in our own backyards in the Hunter region, benefits everyone. The key areas of research include mental health, cancer, cardiovascular health research, mothers and babies, vaccines and immunity. The institute itself has warmly welcomed this funding and no doubt it will have enormous benefits when the central headquarters is finally constructed. </para><para>Another measure that was announced in the budget which will greatly assist my electorate is the increase in aged care numbers and funding. The government will lift the number of aged care places to be allocated in the next three years to 27,900, including 13,030 in 2004. The government will also provide a one-off payment of $513.3 million in 2003-04 to providers, or some $3,500 per bed in recognition of the forward plan for improved standards in aged care homes.</para><para>In my electorate of Paterson it means that a total of $2.77 million will be paid to these providers in this financial year for local aged care beds, as a part of the measures announced in this federal budget. These budget measures and the measures contained in this <inline ref="R1543">Taxation Laws Amendment (Medicare Levy and Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2002</inline> demonstrate how this government is looking to the future of this country and providing support where it is needed. It also shows how Labor do not have a plan for local areas. They are more focused on making motherhood statements with no attention to actual detail or how they will implement their policies.</para><para>In fact, I had to laugh when I read a letter that my Labor opponent in Paterson has mailed out to the residents in Forster-Tuncurry in the last few days. She says in that letter that one of her top priorities is to ensure quality health care at our local hospital. It is quite obvious that this is a standard Labor letter, and I assume that all Labor candidates are sending it out. It does not actually address one of the key issues facing the residents in the Great Lakes region, and that is the fact that there is no public hospital in the Forster-Tuncurry area. We do have an outstanding hospital—it is a private hospital, the Cape Hawk hospital, and they provide outstanding services—but if people want to go to a public hospital they have to travel all the way to Taree. If the go to the private hospital at Cape Hawk, they will need private health insurance, remembering that the 30 per cent rebate is under threat from the Labor opposition.</para><para>I know that Labor's candidate has only just started hitting the ground in her campaign, but she certainly has not done her homework on local issues. How could you write a letter to residents about health and not talk about the most pressing local issue? It is a puzzle to me and it is also a puzzle to residents from Forster-Tuncurry who have called me and said how bewildered they are. Then again, perhaps she should have raised it with the area health community representative. That person, of course, is her former boss and the former federal member for Paterson, Mr Bob Horne. Mr Bob Horne is the area representative on the Mid North Coast Area Health Board. The only problem is that our local area health representative lives in Eumundi in the Maroochy Shire in Queensland.

In the debate last week, Labor raised its concerns about the targeting of the co-contribution, expressing the view that this co-contribution is most likely to be utilised by those who least need it: high-income-earning couples where one spouse is earning a low income. Since then, this concern has increased as Labor has become aware that there are unintended opportunities for tax avoidance inherent in the scheme. Labor also pointed out that most genuine low-income individuals earning $28,000—the highest income at which there is entitlement to the full government contribution—would be unlikely to be able to find the $1,000 after-tax contribution necessary to get the full $1,500 co-contribution.</para></talk.start><para>The <inline ref="R2049">Superannuation Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 1) Bill 2004</inline> addresses another aspect of the changes to the co-contribution: the change in the work test for eligibility for the government co-contribution. The bill makes two changes: one is to the work test, the other is to ensure that individuals receiving the co-contribution are not able to double-dip by obtaining a deduction for their personal contribution. The previous work test required an individual to already be receiving or entitled to employer superannuation guarantee contributions. This effectively excluded anyone earning less than $450 per month or under the age of 18 and working part time. Admittedly, this definition limited those entitled to participate in the co-contribution scheme, including the low-income self-employed. Unfortunately, although the new definition will mean that more individuals are entitled to participate, Labor is concerned that this measure will not effectively target those who could best benefit from this scheme.</para><para>The new eligibility criteria require that only 10 per cent of a person's income need be earned from employment in any one year. This will allow many earning less than $450 to participate who would otherwise not be entitled to the co-contribution. Unfortunately, reality tells us that those people whose only income is less than $450 are most unlikely to have any money to contribute to superannuation. Commonsense tells us that those who will benefit from this change in definition are most likely to be those who are receiving the most substantial part of their income in the form of passive income from family trusts, property and other substantial assets—not genuine low-income earners, in the ordinary sense of the concept. Who is subsidising this? The average working Australian who in most cases does not have the financial capacity to participate in the co-contribution scheme. As Labor pointed out in the debate on the Superannuation Budget Measures Bill 2004, the benefit will be used to subsidise low-income spouses in high-income households. </para><para>The second amendment is an integrity amendment to ensure that the co-contribution is not exploited by individuals obtaining a tax deduction for the co-contribution amount. Labor clearly supports such a measure because without this measure the co-contribution scheme could be used for tax minimisation purposes by those same high-income households that will be able to exploit the system under the proposed change to the work test for co-contributions. Labor believes this is not enough and that the eligibility test for the co-contribution should also take into account total household income, to ensure that the benefit of the co-contribution, which will be paid for by ordinary working Australians, does not go to those who do not need it.</para><para>While Labor supports these bills, it will be referring them to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee for further investigation. Labor will be moving a second reading amendment condemning the government for not adopting Labor's approach of providing a superannuation tax cut to all Australians and for continuing to pursue its failed superannuation co-contribution scheme. </para><para>The <inline ref="R2050">Superannuation Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 2) Bill 2004 </inline>contains five measures largely designed to remove anomalies in the current superannuation legislation regime, some of which have been in need of change for some time. Labor supports these amendments, although it has some reservations about some aspects of the fourth measure standardising the superannuation guarantee contribution base. As a second reading amendment to that bill, I will move:</para><para>That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “while not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House:</para><para> (1)	expresses its support for the introduction of a simplified superannuation guarantee base definition from 1 July 2005, instead of 1 July 2010, with employers being given the right to argue before a Federal or State industrial commission for the simplified superannuation guarantee base definition to be phased in because of their incapacity to pay; and</para><para>(2)	opposes any use of this legislation to remove any superannuation guarantee base that is more generous than the Ordinary Time Earnings Base”.</para><para>Of the five measures in this bill, the first measure will exempt superannuation funds from having to provide actuarial certificates for account based income streams. The requirement to provide actuarial certificates for income streams was introduced in a context where the most common form of stream was the defined benefit pension, which guaranteed a particular level of income. These funds needed to have sufficient assets to fund their liabilities; but there was also the risk that some funds would understate the assets that they needed to fund their liabilities in order to access the tax concessions associated with the assets backing these liabilities.</para><para>In the time since the introduction of this requirement, different types of pension income streams have emerged, such as allocated pensions, which do not guarantee a fixed income stream, and consequently the fund does not need to make provision for future funding of the income stream. The amendment to exclude these account based income streams from the requirements to provide actuarial certificates will be a simplification of the system and reduce the cost of the funds which provide account based income streams.</para><para>The second measure is an anti-avoidance measure which will ensure that those under 18 are not able to obtain a deduction for any contribution made—either the co-contribu-tion or any other contribution—that might otherwise have attracted a tax deduction, unless they meet a further work test, that of having to derive eligible employment or business income. This effectively prevents persons under the age of 18 from being used to obtain tax deductions for superannuation contributions when they are neither employed by nor actively involved in a business. Nonetheless, Labor note with some interest that the regulations setting out the new work test to which this anti-avoidance measure is to apply have not yet, according to our information, been drafted. </para><para>The third measure amends the maximum time allowed for a retirement savings account to act on an application to transfer an account from one year to a maximum of 90 days, bringing retirement savings accounts in line with other superannuation providers.</para><para>The fifth measure is designed to clarify that the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority's power to cancel the licence of a registrable superannuation entity in writing is subject to the minister's relevant consent except where the registrable superannuation entity itself has requested the cancellation or the registrable superannuation entity has been disqualified. Although most employers are required to use ordinary time earnings as the superannuation guarantee earnings base, there are a number of exemptions set out in the superannuation guarantee legislation and there are some industrial awards where a different superannuation guarantee earnings base is permitted. In most cases this results in a lower SG earnings base and of course lower superannuation guarantee contributions. This is a particular problem for some industries where shift penalties make up a major part of the remuneration but are excluded from the superannuation guarantee base by either legislation or the industrial award.</para><para>We are aware that there are significant numbers of employees affected by this. Some examples of these are: coal industry workers, who have their superannuation guarantee calculated on their award rate of pay and not their agreement rate; workers under Queensland state awards, two-thirds of whom have weekend penalties excluded from the definition of ordinary time earnings; casual workers under the Queensland state clerical employees award do not receive superannuation guarantee contributions on hours worked outside 6.30 a.m. to 6.30 p.m. Monday to Friday and 6.30 a.m. to 12.30 p.m. on Saturday, even when they are employed in environments such as 24-hour call centres; Queensland public sector workers who do not receive the superannuation guarantee on shift penalties—this is a particular concern for nursing staff; and a large number of metalliferous miners in Tasmania and Western Australia. These are just a few of the workers missing out on full superannuation guarantee contributions.</para><para>Although Labor strongly supports the proposed standardisation of the superannuation guarantee base it has some reservations about the government's proposal and its motivation for the change. Firstly, Labor questions the need to wait until 2010 to implement the change. The employers involved have effectively had a substantial advantage, in comparison to other industries, for up to 12 years—in fact one could argue that it is quite unfair to give particular employers such a financial advantage. But the delay in bringing in these measures is even more unfair on the employees of these organisations as they prepare for retirement. Further delaying this change can only add to current community pessimism about the superannuation system. The message the government is sending is: `This is an unfair situation, but you are going to have to wait five years for it to be rectified.' That is a ridiculous position to take. </para><para>Labor believes that the date of implementation of the measure to standardise the superannuation guarantee base should be moved to 1 July 2005. A 12-year advantage is enough. There is no valid reason for the situation to continue, especially to the detriment of Australian workers dependent upon the superannuation guarantee contribution for their retirement savings. Labor recognises that there may be some employers who may have difficulty changing over immediately. With this in mind it proposes that employers who believe that they do not have the financial capacity to introduce the standardised superannuation guarantee base immediately be able to apply to the relevant industrial commission to have the standardised superannuation guarantee base phased in over time.</para><para>Labor also believe that no existing employee should be disadvantaged by the change to the standardised base. This may occur where an industrial award provides for a higher SG base than the standardised ordinary time earnings base. We do not anticipate that there will be many situations where this will happen, but the rights of these workers should be protected. In view of Labor's concerns with these bills, I move:</para><para>That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for:</para><para>(1)	its failure to adopt the alternative approach of offering a superannuation tax cut to all contributors, as proposed by Labor; and</para><para>(2)	operating a system that fails to recognise the inability of low-income Australians to take advantage of measures to expand their superannuation while permitting spouses with wealthy partners to exploit the benefit”.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Price, Roger (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

The former bill is attracting the most attention and is the one that the previous speaker, the member for Kingston, spent most time on. It deals with amendments to the Superannuation (Government Co-contri-bution for Low Income Earners) Act. The bill is an innovation and it adds to previous innovations introduced by this government to encourage people into superannuation. The government believes that, since we have a declining contribution to pensions by an ageing population, people need to be preparing for their retirement. The previous government started on this with its superannuation guarantee proposals for all workers, but this government has been more innovative and more in tune with the needs of the community.</para></talk.start><para>Firstly, there was the capacity for parents to superannuate children from their day of birth. That process has attracted a fair bit of attention. It is a great savings mechanism and it gives young people the opportunity to set aside funds in a different format to savings in a bank account. It preserves funds for later in life, with the choice, if choice ever becomes a real feature of Australian superannuation, of adding during their working life to that superannuation investment taken out by their parents. It is encouragement that we are talking of here and encouragement that we are dealing with in these amendments to superannuation measures.</para><para>The proposals before the House extend the superannuation contribution by the government for low-income earners to include employees who earn below the $450 per month superannuation guarantee threshold. They also ensure that people who are now eligible for the co-contribution cannot double-dip. What is this about? The government is proposing that, for every $1 a person puts into a super fund, the government will put in $1.50. That is a pretty good deal. I have heard many commentators on talkback radio saying to people not of large means, `How can you walk away from a gift of $1.50 for every $1 that you put in?' That is the sort of investment that people should be making. They should be investing in super funds and taking advantage of this government incentive. </para><para>Of course there are limitations to it, both at the level of income and the amount that a person can put in. For a maximum of $1,000 the government will put in $1,500. That $1,500 goes to any person wanting to establish a super fund. As I said, when they change employment and their super fund continues to grow they will, we hope, be able to move their super fund to a place of their choice which offers the best returns and the best yield. In that way they will realise benefits at the end of their working life and have the certainty that they will continue to receive income.</para><para>The Australian Labor Party does not want choice and it has not thought about whether or not people ought to receive an incentive of this type. We hear today instead fringe type complaints about what the government is doing. The opposition would be better off spending its time focusing on real issues and letting the bills go through the parliament. Then people will be able to choose their super fund and have every successive employer contribute to that fund and they will not have a proliferation of small sources of revenue scattered in a series of superannuation funds as they change from job to job; it will all be consolidated and earning real benefits for them.</para><para>It is interesting to look at some of the tables relating to the manner of investment of super funds and the size of super funds over the last nine years. For instance, in 1994-95 the amount in corporate investment was $48 billion, and over the last nine years it has only grown to $55 billion. The public sector has more than doubled from $51 billion to $115 billion. The big growth has been in the small funds, however—the mums and dads who have sought to provide for their own superannuation. These funds are generally those of fewer than five members and they include small APRA funds, single-member approved deposit funds and self-managed superannuation funds, which are popular with small business. The growth in those small funds has been from $20 billion in 1994-95 to $127 billion currently. This indicates a willingness and an enthusiasm among small businesses to prepare for retirement. They are establishing their own super schemes, investing the funds to earn the best benefits they can and thereby ensuring a future as well as growth in the value of their businesses.</para><para>In December 2003 the superannuation industry indicated that 88 per cent of all workers have superannuation coverage. It indicated also that the employer contributions totalled $35 billion and that member contributions totalled $19 billion, making a total of $54 billion in the year ended December 2003. That demonstrates to me that employers are making a major contribution to the wellbeing of their employees and that members are also contributing, and that is the way it should be: employers contributing roughly twice as much as employees.</para><para>The amount of funds directly invested is $210 billion, the amount placed with investment managers is $196 billion and the amount invested in life office statutory funds is $160 billion. So there is almost an equal spread between direct investment, investment with investment managers and life office statutory requirement. That background indicates a growing interest in superannuation, and it behoves the government to be careful about changes to super and to make sure that the incentive processes stay and that the long-term plans of people who have invested in superannuation are protected so that their ultimate benefit plans are not recklessly interfered with. That applies to self-managed funds as indeed it applies to the proposals we are looking at today, because nobody wants to find that the certainty they thought was in their plan is suddenly removed because of government initiatives. </para><para>Within the proposed amendments to the superannuation laws which extend the eligibility for government co-contribution, I highlight announcements made on 14 March this year by the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, the Hon. Senator Helen Coonan. The comparison between the proposed legislation and the current law can be summarised in this way: the current laws, until these bills are enacted, have among their eligibility criteria that, to receive a government co-contribution, an individual must be in receipt of or entitled to employer superannuation support and not eligible to claim a taxation deduction for their personal superannuation contribution. For example, employees earning less than $450 per month and employees under the age of 18 and employed on a part-time basis are currently generally unable to qualify for the government co-contribution.</para><para>In the new legislation, the eligibility criteria will be extended: an individual will no longer require receipt of or entitlement to an employer super contribution and an employee contributing at least 10 per cent of their income will qualify for the government co-contribution for the coming year and subsequent years. Previously, employees not in receipt of employer superannuation support were able to claim a deduction for personal superannuation contributions. In the new legislation, a person will not be able to claim a deduction in the coming year and subsequent years for personal superannuation contributions if they now qualify for a government co-contribution. That is a simple process: if you qualify for a government kick-along with your super, you cannot claim your own contribution as a tax deduction. I think that is a very sensible thing: the government is providing $1.50 for every dollar you put in, and I think that on balance that contribution should come out of your salary.</para><para>The transitional rules are these: a person is eligible for co-contribution made on or after 1 July 2003 if the individual has a total assessable income and reportable fringe benefits of less than $40,000—the previous member was talking about overtime and all the rest of it, but it is assessable income and reportable fringe benefits all wrapped up into one amount of less than $40,000—has at least 10 per cent of their total income attributable to eligible employment, and is under the age of 71. That is another innovation introduced by this government: the age at which you can contribute to superannuation has been extended. A number of people in my electorate have come to me and said, `We want to work beyond the age of 60 or 65 but superannuation is not available to us; we want to continue to contribute to it.' That is something that the government has observed and it has extended eligibility to the age of 71; previously it was 65. To be eligible, a person must be under the age of 71 in the income year that the personal superannuation contribution is made and must not be a temporary resident of Australia. That is basically the way it works. I think that is reasonable; I do not think temporary residents should have access to this offer of support in superannuation. </para><para>There have also been administrative changes to these laws. It is quite interesting that the administrative amendments specify that the interest rate to be applied for late government co-contribution will be prescribed in the legislation. So if the government is late in paying, the money earns interest. However, a person must make their contribution within 28 days of the co-contribu-tion payment being made—that is, a person's money must be in the fund no later than 28 days after the government dough hits the deck. So the government must pay within a set period. If it does not pay on time, interest is earned by the late payment, and the person must make their contribution within 28 days of the government money being in the fund. There is an imposition where the superannuation provided does not repay the government co-contribution amount within a particular time, and the requirements placed on the minister are also outlined.</para><para>So the interest rate and the time frame within which the provider must credit a government co-contribution are part of the new law. I think this is an excellent process, and the government is to be commended. I encourage people, both young and old, to take advantage of what amounts to a gift of a $1.50 for every dollar contributed towards a super fund. It is a great innovation—something that will encourage people to save for their retirement and it is worthy of our society.</para><para>The other bill before the House is entitled the <inline ref="R2050">Superannuation Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 2) Bill 2004. </inline>This bill improves the practical operations of the retirement income system and its interaction with other areas of the law. I see this measure as something that assists in making retirement savings accounts—SRAs—more readily available and adjusts the way in which they are applied. There are changes in the law in regard to actuary certificates, which are part of the process for accounts based on income streams. Another proposal relates to funds paying pensions of the prescribed type—for the IT regulations, and no other type of pension, an actuary certificate is not required. Actuarial requirements and the under-18 superannuation contribution deduction work test are also part of the change in the law. Persons under the age of 65 will not have to satisfy a work test in order to make personal superannuation contributions. In addition to being eligible, in order to claim a tax deduction for these contributions, a person under the age of 18 will now have to derive eligible employment or business income in the income year in which the taxation deduction is claimed. That is a sensible tightening up of the system so that it is not abused.</para><para>In referring to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority report for this year, it is disturbing to notice that there have been several enforcement actions taken by APRA within the superannuation field. Of the 388 enforcement actions that have been taken by APRA, 261 related to superannuation. Auth-orised deposit-taking institutions—super-annuation funds, general insurance companies, life insurers and friendly societies—are included in the supervision by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, and the amount of attention given to superannuation is of concern to me. I notice that within the last 12 months, the number of enforcement actions that have been taken have risen from 107 to 261. This indicates that APRA has been concerned about the way in which funds and personnel have been looking after the retirement benefits of a lot of people. The low returns, APRA says, are also of concern to many. It report states:</para><quote><para>The low returns in most superannuation funds have spurred interest by some trustees in investing superannuation monies in non-traditional assets, including hedge funds and instalment warrants. </para></quote><para>There are many people who are unhappy with the returns that superannuation funds are offering. The level of activity required by APRA for enforcement is also a matter of concern. The number of directions that have been given to super funds, the number of prosecutions for delayed contributions and the number of show-cause letters have increased significantly. A stringent application of the law regarding super funds is essential. The HIH fiasco is a wake-up call to everybody. However, I would like to remind the House that it was the failure of a large corporation. It was not one of the small corporations that failed; it was a large one. So I encourage APRA to apply their energy to making sure that large funds with lots of resources and personnel that are not showing a very good return are the ones that receive attention to make sure that there is not another instance like the HIH failure. In fact, the encouragement given by the government should be recognised. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>29879</page.no><name role="metadata">Sidebottom, Sid, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SIDEBOTTOM</name><name.id>849</name.id><electorate>Braddon</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Last week the <inline ref="R2048">Superannuation Budget Measures Bill 2004</inline> was debated in this House. This bill contained measures that included the low-income co-contribution to individuals earning up to $58,000 per annum and an increase in the government's former dollar-for-dollar contribution to a government contribution of $1.50 for each dollar contributed by an individual up to a maximum of $1,000. Like so many of this government's financial packages—and there are plenty of examples to demonstrate this—one wonders if this co-contribution scheme can correctly be labelled `low-income earners scheme', if it ever was a low-income co-contribution scheme in the first place. </para></talk.start><para>Don Watson in his thought provoking book <inline font-style="italic">Death</inline><inline font-style="italic"> Sentence</inline>—and I recommend it to all members—which is on the salvation of public language, highlights government doublespeak in giving names to pieces of legislation that often have the opposite effect if not intention. In fact the Howard government could fill a whole chapter of Watson's book with its doublespeak bill titles, let alone the AttorneyGeneral providing a personal chapter on `confuse-speak'. I note that, when the AttorneyGeneral utters his normal introductory phrases `the point of the matter is' or `the fact of the matter is', the listener knows it is Ruddock code for `There will be no facts that really matter'—and, if there are, we won't get to know about them anyway. However, I digress. </para><para>As I was saying—and putting aside the difficulty faced by the worker earning $28,000 or less per annum to find a spare after-tax $1,000 to make the voluntary contribution—an individual on $58,000 per annum can hardly be considered `low-income'. In researching ABS data related to my electorate of the north-west coast of Tasmania and King Island, I noted that in the 2001 census 62,595 individuals in the labour force received income under $52,000 per annum and 3,673 earned over that amount. Out of interest, the number that did not state their income was 4,687. Clearly the great majority of working people in my electorate earn incomes of well below $52,000 per annum. So, compared with these people, an individual earning $58,000 is much better off financially.</para><para>Labor raised its concerns about the targeting of the co-contribution in debate last week on the Superannuation Budget Measures Bill 2004. It expressed the view that this co-contribution is most likely to be utilised by those who least need it—that is, high-income households where one spouse is earning a low income—and not, I suggest, by genuine low-income households or individuals who struggle to find the money to get through the week let alone put aside anything: put simply, the majority of working people and families in my electorate. What is more, Labor's concern about the co-contribution has increased because it is becoming apparent that there are loopholes that can be exploited by higher income earners that give them access to the co-contribution scheme. I would like to remind the government of those reservations before I address the amendments proposed in this bill. </para><para>Noting that the measures to extend the co-contribution are tied to the government's proposed surcharge, I would point out that it is obviously the astute high-income household—with the low-income spouse able to access the contribution and the high-income spouse in that same household able to get a substantial surcharge tax reduction—that will benefit from the government's superannuation measures. So what does this mean? It means that the high-income household gets the best of both worlds while in electorates such as Braddon, Bass and Lyons in particular in Tasmania low-income families struggling to make ends meet get nothing. These families and individuals do not pay the surcharge, so there is no benefit from that measure. These same battling families and individuals are unlikely to be able to find the spare $1,000 after-tax cash to contribute to the co-contribution scheme. And certainly these people are unlikely to be in a position to exploit loopholes in the co-contribution scheme. </para><para>In reality, the great majority of working people in Braddon would be far better off with Labor's proposed contributions tax reduction: a reduction from 15 per cent to 13 per cent, which would benefit all members of superannuation funds and assist all to increase their retirement savings. It would not favour those on higher incomes, as proposed by the government's scheme and reinforced in its income tax cuts outlined in the 2004 budget.</para><para>Let me now go to the two bills under discussion today: the <inline ref="R2049">Superannuation Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 1) Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2050">Superannuation Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 2) Bill 2004</inline>. The first bill being considered, the Superannuation Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 1) Bill 2004, contains further measures in relation to the co-contribution—namely, a change in the work test for eligibility for the government co-contribution. This bill introduces a new work test which is accompanied by integrity measures to ensure that individuals receiving the co-contribution are not able to double dip through obtaining a deduction for their personal contribution. Up until now, eligibility to participate in the co-contribution scheme was dependent upon an individual receiving or being entitled to employer superannuation guarantee contributions. This meant that anyone earning less than $450 per month or aged less than 18 years and working part-time was excluded. This test then effectively excluded many casual workers and low-income self-employed persons, many of whom live in my electorate. The new definition will mean that a handful more individuals are entitled to participate.</para><para>But Labor believes that the change will not be any more efficient in targeting those who would best benefit from this scheme than the previous definition. In fact, we contend that it will allow more of those who have no real need for government assistance with their retirement savings more opportunities to participate in the co-contribution scheme. Is this the intention of the government?</para><para>The new work test means that an individual will only need to show that 10 per cent of their earnings in any single year come from employment. The change does mean that many people earning less than $450 per month—that is, $5,400 per year—who previously would not have been entitled to the co-contribution can now participate. The government has stated that its justification for this significant change to the definition is to allow a greater number of low-income individuals—this number is unspecified, I would add—to access the co-contribution scheme. But I suggest it only needs a modicum of commonsense, which even the government must have, to realise that an individual earning less than $450 per month is most unlikely to have any money to contribute to superannuation. The people who will most likely receive the benefit from the change in eligibility criteria will be individuals who are receiving the most substantial part of their income in the form of passive income—for instance, from a family trust, property and other substantial assets—not genuine low-income earners who are struggling to make ends meet. The reality is that the beneficiaries of the scheme will be low-income spouses and children of higher income earning parents, and I believe this will be borne out later this year, when the extent of the takeup of the co-contribution for the first year of its operation, 200304, is published as required under the act. </para><para>As my colleague and fellow Forthite from Tasmania, Senator Nick Sherry, has pointed out in his analysis of this bill, it is interesting to note that the amendment provides for payment for the 200304 financial year despite the fact that the new measure was announced on 14 March 2004 and has not yet become law. Consequently, the claimed cost of $45 million for 200405 is highly questionable. Instead, it will be the tax paying struggler—the person who cannot take advantage of loopholes and who will not benefit from the cut in the superannuation surcharge tax proposed by this government—who will pay for this measure. The average working Australian is once again subsidising the more wealthy, subsidising the lifestyles of low-income spouses in high-income households. At least the government is giving a slight nod to integrity in relation to the change in the work test—that is, they are doing something to prevent double-dipping.</para><para>The second measure in this bill operates to prevent an individual from obtaining a deduction for any amount contributed in order to access the government co-contribution. Labor has no issue in supporting a measure that will prevent those in the community who are prepared to go to any lengths to minimise tax at the expense of the average worker—and one suspects that those will be the same high-income households that will be able to benefit from the poor targeting of the co-contribution scheme resulting in part from the change in the eligibility criteria which I just mentioned. But this is not sufficient to give these new measures real integrity. In order for the co-contribution to benefit those who most need it, it must use as an eligibility criteria total household income. This will ensure that the benefit of the co-contribution paid for by the ordinary working Australian goes to those who need it.</para><para>The second bill, the <inline ref="R2050">Superannuation Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 2) Bill 2004</inline>—wow!—includes four amendments to remove some irregularities in the existing superannuation system and an anti-avoidance measure related to the change in the work tests for eligibility for the co-contribution scheme and superannuation guarantee contributions. The four changes to remove irregularities are well overdue and are acceptable to Labor, except that Labor believes that one of the measures, measure No. 4, which simplifies the superannuation guarantee base, does not go far enough. That argument has been eloquently outlined by the shadow minister for revenue and assistant shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Kingston. I will briefly deal with the three amendments to remove irregularities and the integrity amendment before moving on to Labor's concerns relating to the superannuation guarantee base. </para><para>Measure 1 will remove the requirement for a superannuation fund to provide actuarial certificates for account based income streams. The requirement of actuarial certificates was a product of a pension environment, where the most common form of income stream was the defined benefit pension and an income stream which guaranteed a set result. As there was an opportunity for funds providing these pensions to exploit the tax exemptions available, actuarial certificates were required. Indeed, as the member for Kingston pointed out earlier, as the superannuation system has expanded, so have the different types of pension income streams available—for example, allocated pensions. These are income streams based on accounts which do not provide a guaranteed return and do not offer the same opportunities for tax avoidance. As a consequence, actuarial certificates are not required for these products. Further, this amendment, in removing this requirement for account based income streams, will result in less administration and lower costs for the funds administering account based income streams.</para><para>Measure 2, as mentioned earlier, creates a new superannuation contribution work test for individuals under 18. This is an anti-avoidance measure which will ensure that those under 18 are not able to obtain a deduction for any contribution made in relation to the co-contribution or any other contribution that might otherwise have attracted a tax deduction unless they meet a further work test. That work test requires that they must have derived income from eligible employment or business income, effectively preventing persons under 18 years of age from being used to obtain tax deductions for superannuation contributions when they are neither employed nor actively involved in a business.</para><para>Measure 3 and measure 5 are both technical changes that Labor supports. Measure 3 amends the maximum time allowed for retirement savings accounts to act on an application to transfer an account. The existing maximum time of one year will change to a maximum of 90 days, and this brings the RSAs into the same time frame as superannuation funds. Measure 5 is a clarification measure designed to ensure that APRA's power to cancel the licence of a registratable superannuation entity in writing is subject to the minister's relevant consent, except where the RSE itself has requested the cancellation or the RSE has been disqualified.</para><para>I would now like to spend some time speaking on measure 4—a measure to simplify the superannuation guarantee earnings base. Although most employers are required to use ordinary time earnings as the superannuation guarantee earnings base, there are some exclusions in the superannuation guarantee—SG—legislation, and there are some industrial awards where a different SG earnings base is permitted. In most cases, this results in a lower earnings base than that provided by ordinary time earnings. A lower superannuation guarantee earnings base means lower SG contributions and, ultimately, lower retirement incomes. I do not need to remind the House of the difficulties that would accompany this.</para><para>More often than not it is penalties that are excluded from the calculation of ordinary time earnings which cause particular problems for industries such as mining and nursing, where shift penalties make up a substantial part of these workers' incomes. These are significant industries in my electorate and involve many workers, Mr Deputy Speaker Price—which I know you are well aware of because you have visited Braddon many times. In some cases, weekend penalties are excluded from ordinary time earnings. In other instances, casework outside particular hours is excluded, which creates a serious problem for workers in industries that operate on a 24-hour basis, such as call centre workers—again, affecting a significant employer in my electorate with large call centres in Burnie and Devonport. </para><para>Labor strongly supports moving to the standardised SG earnings base of ordinary time earnings but it is uneasy about the motivation behind the government's proposal. Why does the government need to wait—as the member for Kingston questioned earlier—until 2010 to implement this change? Surely the employers presently avoiding the standard definition of ordinary time earnings have received a substantial benefit—a benefit not afforded most other employers—for the last 12 years. Is it fair to give them a further five years of advantage? I think not. As I have mentioned before, there are many hundreds of employees in my electorate who will be disadvantaged by this delay. Is the delaying of this measure not grossly unfair on these employees, expecting them to accept inferior superannuation guarantee contributions for another five years? I think Jack Hill the blind miner would have to say yes to that one. No wonder many Australians are cynical, let alone confused, about superannuation when the government permits this sort of inequity to continue.</para><para>Labor believes that the date of the implementation of the measure to standardise the superannuation guarantee earnings base should be moved to 1 July 2005, as outlined in the amendments set out by the shadow minister at the table. Surely, a 12-year advantage is enough. There is no valid reason for this situation to continue, especially to the detriment of Australian workers dependent on the superannuation guarantee contribution for their retirement savings. Labor recognises that there may be some employers who find it financially difficult to make the change, but it is prepared to support a mechanism that would allow employers who believe that they do not have the financial capacity to make an immediate changeover to the standardised superannuation guarantee earnings base to apply to the relevant industrial commission to have the standardised superannuation guarantee earnings base phased in over time. That is only fair and sensible.</para><para>In addition, in those very few situations where an industrial award provides a higher superannuation guarantee earnings base than the standardised ordinary time earnings, Labor strongly holds the view that those employees whose superannuation guarantee is calculated on the higher SG earnings base should not be disadvantaged, and that the law should allow an exception for any SG earnings base which exceeds ordinary time earnings. In summary, Labor supports the essential elements of this bill but it would like to examine it in a Senate inquiry to clarify some detail relating, particularly, to the new work test for eligibility for the co-contribution, and the measures to standardise the SG earnings base. I support the amendments put by the shadow minister for revenue and assistant shadow Treasurer as outlined earlier today.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>29883</page.no><name role="metadata">Hunt, Gregory, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HUNT</name><name.id>00AMV</name.id><electorate>Flinders</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am pleased to rise in support of the <inline ref="R2049">Superannuation Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 1) Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2050">Superannuation Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 2) Bill 2004</inline>. In addressing these bills, I want to put the whole question of superannuation and retirement incomes into the broader perspective. I believe that these bills take important steps forward. They take forward the measures outlined by the Treasurer in the 2004 budget to assist with low-income earners in co-contribution, and with other earners in a reduction of the surcharge rates on the superannuation contribution. However, it is critical to understand where superannuation fits in the broader challenge that Australia faces. </para></talk.start><para>Like all western societies, Australia has an ageing population. Other societies within Europe are ageing at a faster rate than Australia. Their natural replenishment is lower and the result is that those societies are facing a significant pensions crisis over the coming decades. Already, we know that in France and Germany there are critical problems that have actually led to significant social divisions. That is the consequence of mismanagement of planning for the long-term future of the country. The challenge which was recognised for Australia—and I pay respect to the opposition for this when they were in government—was to plan for Australia on a generational basis. That task is ongoing. We are always planning for the present and for the next generation. In that context, what we need to recognise is a very simple fact: as Australia ages, the number of people who will be working as a proportion of our population will decline. So, proportionately, fewer people will be supporting more people.</para><para>In that context, it becomes absolutely imperative that each of us of working age today prepares for our retirement and our future so that the next generation does not have to support us and we are able to support ourselves. There is a very simple principle behind this—that is, the notion of intergenerational equity. If this generation does not provide for itself, it will effectively be expecting another generation to provide for it. Taken to its extreme, if we are selfish, if we do not prepare and make our own contributions now at the societal level and at the individual level, we will be engaged in an act of intergenerational theft. Australia went through an act of intergenerational theft during the early 1990s. What we saw was one generation stealing from another.</para><para>Let me remind the House of the budget impact of one generation stealing from another. In 1991-92, the budget deficit was $11½ billion; in 1992-93, it was $17 billion; in 1993-94, it was $17.1 billion; in 1994-95, it was $13.1 billion; and in 1995-96, it was $10 billion. In those last five budgets of the previous government, one generation stole $68 billion from the next. The result was that a succeeding generation had to pay that back, and that is what we have been doing. Over the last five budgets, by comparison, we see that in 2000-01, this generation paid back $5.9 billion of the debt which was incurred by the previous Labor administration. In 2001-02, there was a deficit of $980 million; in 2002-03, there was a surplus of $7.4 billion; in 2003-04, there was an estimated surplus of $4.6 billion; and, in the current financial year, there is an estimated surplus of $2.4 billion. In essence, it is the difference between $68 billion of debt which a future generation has to pay and $19.5 billion of debt which this generation has repaid.</para><para>In that context, these superannuation reforms have to be seen, understood and included, because they are about preparing the current generation for the future, to make sure that we are not engaged in a similar act of intergenerational theft. This means that we are preparing so that, as a country as a whole, we can pay for and meet the requirements of our superannuants, retirees and pensioners and also pay for all the other social, economic and infrastructure requirements of our country over the next generation. So that is why these reforms are important at the national level. At the individual level, they are about ensuring that each Australian has the chance to develop a retirement income which will allow them and their families to move forward into retirement with security and to live a good, rich, full and whole life. That is what superannuation is about. In that context, this bill is part of a package which does two things. The first change of the 2004 budget is that it introduces, and extends the number of, people who will be eligible for the superannuation co-contribution. In particular, it does this by targeting low-income earners. That is a critical step forward. </para><para>I would like to explain to the House what that means. It will do three things. Firstly, it will increase the contribution made by the government from a maximum of $1,000, for a $1,000 superannuation contribution from a low-income earner, to $1,500. So the ratio changes: if an individual puts in $1,000, they will now get $1,500 in a matching contribution from the Commonwealth government. It ratchets up the amount of money that they will get. So for every dollar that they put in, $2.50 all up will be placed in their superannuation account. That is a very important increase, because money put in by people in the early stages of their working lives has a massive compounding effect over a 40-year working life. It does two things: it helps to provide the base, the nest egg and it builds the culture of contributing to superannuation. It gives people a stake in their own future. It gives them a sense that they can have a worthwhile superannuation base for the future.</para><para>The second thing that this bill does in relation to the superannuation co-contribution is that it increases the maximum income that somebody can receive before losing the matching contribution. That increase goes from $25,000 to $30,000. So at any point, somebody earning up to $30,000, will be able to contribute up to $1,000 a year and receive $1,500 back from the government. That is an important step forward because it increases the amount of money that they will have in their own nest egg, and it increases the number of people who will benefit from that. </para><para>Thirdly, what this budget also does in relation to the superannuation co-contribution is that it increases the upper threshold of earnings to qualify from $40,000 to $60,000. So each of those three changes is fundamentally important. They extend the number of people who obtain the superannuation co-contribution, they extend the amount of money which people will be able to receive for the superannuation co-contribution, and they extend the limits and the threshold at the lower end and at the higher end so that the maximum number of people will benefit from the co-contribution.</para><para>The second big change that the budget package brings is in relation to the threshold. It lowers the threshold to 12½ per cent for the maximum surcharge rate in 2004-05. It lowers the surcharge rate again in 2005-06 to 10 per cent, and it lowers the surcharge rate again in other measures which will be brought forward to 7½ per cent in 2006-07. These are important steps forward. In summary, the superannuation laws amendments, which are set out in these bills and which will also be accompanied by other measures, are very simple. They recognise that Australia has an ageing population. They recognise that what occurred between 1991 and 1996 was an act of intergenerational theft, where one generation effectively stole from another, and we have had to pay that back. That is what intergenerational theft is about, and these measures ultimately are designed to take care of the next generation, and I commend them to the House.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

I can inform the House that the March quarter national accounts show the Australian economy continuing to grow in the March quarter but at a slower rate than in the December quarter, with quarterly growth being 0.2 per cent and through the year growth being 3.2 per cent. Particularly pleasing in these March quarter national accounts was the fact that farm production continued to grow strongly, increasing by 5.9 per cent, and is 41.6 per cent higher through the year. That is coming off an all-time record drought when farm production was smashed accordingly back in 2002, but it is particularly welcome to see production coming back to rural Australia, although it is far too early to say that the drought has broken. In substantial parts of Australia the drought continues to linger on in an aching way.</para></talk.start><para>Household consumption continued to grow strongly at 1.2 per cent, and that is supported by strong consumer confidence, record employment levels and unemployment which is now at 23-year lows. The March quarter national accounts show that dwelling investment decreased in the quarter. That is consistent with what we have seen in relation to housing approvals and housing finance, which indicates that the housing market is actually slowing. The good news on the inflation front is that Australia is confirmed as a low-inflation economy and wages growth remains moderate. Profits remain strong, with the profit share to GDP at around 25 per cent.</para><para>But it would be a mistake to think that all of Australia's economic challenges are now behind it. We have made enormous progress in the last eight years with balancing the budget, reducing Labor's debt by $70 billion, locking in low inflation, reforming the taxation system and increasing labour productivity, but there are still great challenges to the economy. We have record high world oil prices. We have drought lingering on in some parts of Australia. It will take management in relation to the housing market coming off, and world interest rates are expected to rise throughout the course of next year.

I appreciate the interest she shows. I have said this before: the member for Pearce is one of the members who not only has showed a great interest in the welfare of the Iraqi people and their human rights but has been there and has had the opportunity to meet with them. The Australian government welcomes the announcement of a new interim Iraqi government. The announcement was made overnight our time. This is an historic step in a strategy to bring freedom and democracy to the people of Iraq. The appointment of the interim Iraqi government is a result of extensive consultations between United Nations special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi and Iraqi community leaders.</para></talk.start><para>The interim government will be able to exercise its full powers as the sovereign government of Iraq from 30 June. The Coalition Provisional Authority will cease to exist from that time. The interim Iraqi government will be, if you like, a caretaker government until elections are held on 31 January 2005. As a sovereign government it will be able to conclude international agreements and conduct diplomatic relations. It will be responsible for economic reconstruction. It will be responsible for national policies and of course it will be responsible for those election preparations. It will also have quite clear authority over Iraq's security forces.</para><para>The interim government comprises a balance of leaders who remained in Iraq under Saddam Hussein's rule, as well as some people who were in exile during that period of time. Let me take the opportunity to congratulate President al-Yawar, Prime Minister Allawi and the ministers who have been appointed. These are leaders with strong credentials. They represent the ethnic and religious diversity of Iraq. I know a lot of members will be interested to know that there are six women included in the government.</para><para>The fact is that the formation of the Iraqi interim government reinforces Iraq's progress in a number of key areas. The transitional administrative law which was adopted recently enshrines for Iraqis their human rights and their civil, political and religious freedoms. There is now unprecedented access in Iraq to the media. There are 120 newspapers there. There is satellite news available to people. Over four million children have been vaccinated, 2,500 schools have been rebuilt, all the universities are open and hundreds of thousands of jobs have been created through reconstruction work. It is worth noting also that electricity and oil production are close to prewar levels, despite the activities of terrorists who are trying to disrupt the supply of both electricity and oil.</para><para>Over 200,000 Iraqis now constitute the Iraqi security service. That is not just police; that is people who are being trained in the new Iraqi army, as well as others who are involved as private security contractors. So a significant number of Iraqis are already moving into the area of security. The terrorist bomb that went off, which members will have heard about overnight or yesterday, shows that terrorists will do what they can to try to derail this strategy. But let me reassure the House that the government will do everything it can to make sure that the Iraqi interim government is successful, that it is able to fulfil its responsibilities and that the some 24 million people in Iraq are able to achieve a new era of freedom and, ultimately, democracy. </para></answer></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DISTINGUISHED VISITORS</title><type>Distinguished Visitors</type><page.no>29891</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>29891</page.no><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate>PO</electorate><party>N/A</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon members of a parliamentary delegation from the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China.

I remind the House that, as part of this year's budget, the government announced a policy by which there would be a government co-contribution of 150 per cent to what people put into their superannuation for those on an income of up to $58,000 per year. So for those earning up to $58,000 per year, if you were to put an additional $1 into your superannuation, the government would make a co-contribution of $1.50 and, as a consequence, there would be $2.50 for every $1 that was put into that scheme.</para></talk.start><para>If we take a person on average weekly earnings of $39,220, they are eligible under this scheme to put $626 per annum into their superannuation and would receive $939 per annum from the government as a co-contribution to their superannuation. That is a pretty good deal—$939 from the government by way of a co-contribution to their superannuation. Over the course of a 30-year working life, this would increase their accumulation balance by $36,000, or an 18 per cent improvement, as a consequence of this scheme. You would think that, for the low-income employees of Australia, both political parties would welcome such a scheme and would say, `What a wonderful scheme to help people save for their retirement.' You would think that the Labor Party, which professes to be interested in average weekly earners, would say, `What a wonderful scheme,' but I regret to inform the House that the Australian Labor Party opposes this scheme. It opposes a scheme to pay $1.50 for each person's contribution. </para><para>Why would the Australian Labor Party do that? Apparently, the Australian Labor Party thinks that a much better policy would be to reduce the 15 per cent contributions tax and has put forward a proposal to reduce it by one per cent from 1 July 2004. Let us work out what that would mean for a person on average weekly earnings. It means that a person on average weekly earnings with a nine per cent super guarantee would get a one per cent reduction on their super contributions tax, which would give them, in the year commencing 1 July 2004, an additional $35.30 per annum—or, in a weekly tax cut, it is 7c per week. Mr Speaker, you have heard of the ABC contributing 7c a day. Instead of the opportunity to get a $939 co-contribution, Labor is offering average weekly earners, as an alternative, a tax cut of 7c per week. But there is good news, because on 1 July 2006, the contributions tax would come back by another 1c and the tax cut from the Labor Party would rise to 14c per week. It is a 100 per cent increase. By this stage, they would have been denied the opportunity of $939 per annum in 2004, 2005 and 2006.</para><para>This is the importance of policy in politics today. We can run around with all of these schemes which are designed to try and endear people to the media, we can run around with all of the latest pop theories that the Leader of the Opposition wants to go on about, but what counts in Australian political life is policy. Policy counts. Policy is what determines people's outcomes. You can run around and promise all sorts of tax cuts to all sorts of people but, if you cannot name the rates, the thresholds, the amounts or how it is going to be paid for, it does not mean a thing—it does not count for a children's book. It is the same in relation to superannuation. You can run around and say, `We want to give middle- and low-income earners an opportunity,' but, until we know a policy, we do not know how to assess the emptiness of these promises. Labor has put forward a policy—an unfunded policy as it turns out—with regard to superannuation and you can compare and contrast a person on average weekly earnings of $39,220 under a government policy eligible for $939 per annum and, Labor's alternative, a tax cut of 7c per week. I think that makes pretty clear the political party that has thought about the position in relation to superannuation and savings of Australia's middle-income earners. That political party is the coalition. If you do not do the work, you cannot help the people of Australia who need help so very badly.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Budget: Taxation</title><page.no>29892</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>29892</page.no><name role="metadata">Latham, Mark, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LATHAM</name><name.id>K26</name.id><electorate>Werriwa</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Acting Prime Minister.

It makes a very real difference because a large number of them are in a situation where they particularly need better opportunities for their children.

They even tend to have more children and they are in more necessitous circumstances, as you point out. Nothing could benefit them more than being in a situation where, overwhelmingly, they are $600 a child better off per family.

As the Treasurer has repeatedly pointed out, there were certain other groups in the community who were denied their tax cuts at that time, and I will come to the sorts of people who are critical to electorates like yours who were denied the tax cuts—people who are needed by everyone in your sort of community— </para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Acting Prime Minister!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4K4</name.id><name role="display">Mr ANDERSON</name></talker><para>—tradespeople, truck drivers, electricians, plumbers and so forth: the people who were bumping up against the tax scales that were so constructed as to act as a disincentive, because you would not give them the relief that we wanted to offer some time ago.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Acting Prime Minister!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4K4</name.id><name role="display">Mr ANDERSON</name></talker><para>—It was important that that be given for electorates like yours and, frankly, like mine.

In fact, recently I announced that a $700 learning tuition coupon or voucher will be delivered to every parent of a child who did not pass the basic year 3 reading benchmark in 2003. I am pleased to say that today New South Wales has announced that it will be providing the results of those tests to all parents in the state of New South Wales.</para></talk.start><para>I am asked about other policies. The Leader of the Opposition has focused a lot on the importance of reading to children—which, of course, is supported on this side. Apart from love, we believe that the greatest gift we can give children is reading. On Monday, at the launch of the latest book by the highly acclaimed children's author, Mem Fox, the Leader of the Opposition said this:</para><quote><para>The truth, as a parent, is I couldn't have done it without Mem Fox.</para></quote><para>He went on to say—and it is very important that the House remembers these words: </para><quote><para>Mem impressed upon me the importance that you can't start early enough, that learning doesn't start the first day of school, it starts the first day of life, and we shouldn't wait until babies are three or four before we start reading books.</para></quote><para>It is interesting that, after the launch, one of the journalists asked the Leader of the Opposition a question. The question was: </para><quote><para>Mr Latham, that was a lovely story that you told us again today about Mem Fox's inspiration for Labor's policy but you are rewriting history a little bit, aren't you? You've brought this up before, you've written about this before you met Mem Fox. </para></quote><para>The response from the Leader of the Opposition is quite instructive. He said:</para><quote><para>... she sent me Reading Magic ...</para></quote><para>That is interesting: he could not even get the name of his favourite book right: <inline font-style="italic">Possum Magic</inline>—</para><quote><para>... she sent me Reading Magic, her book.

Why would the Leader of the Opposition deny the fact that he had anything in his book about the importance of reading to children?' Then, thinking of the Treasurer, I thought, `You can airbrush a web site but you cannot airbrush a book.' So I went to the book <inline font-style="italic">What Did You Learn Today?</inline> which the Leader of the Opposition said he wrote before he met Mem Fox. I turned to page 87. There is an entire section entitled `Parents as educators'.

There is a pattern emerging here where the Leader of the Opposition wants people to believe a particular point of view which he wishes to promote and a certain persona which he is seeking to adopt. I think we would all remember the unedifying sight that we had on 22 April this year when on the Channel 9 news we had Bill Clinton in the State of the Union Address saying, `Every 12-year-old child will be able to log onto the computer,' and then next to that we had the Leader of the Opposition saying, `Every 10-year-old will be able to log onto the computer.' Then the Leader of the Opposition was on the news trying to deny that black is white—denying that he was a copycat, that he had plagiarised that. In fact, on the ABC <inline font-style="italic">AM</inline> program on 22 April, he said in defending this—</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Honourable members interjecting</inline><inline font-style="italic">—</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—If members on both sides of the House wish, I will gladly exercise the standing orders and remove some of them from the chamber, but I would not have thought that was appropriate.

So these are Australian home-grown ideas. </para></quote><para>That would be the case whether they were from Mem Fox or whether they were in fact from the Leader of the Opposition. In fact, here is the answer. If you go to the State of the Union Address in 1997 you will find that President Bill Clinton said:</para><quote><para>You must read with your children every night.</para><para>Learning begins in the first days of life. ... young children develop emotionally and intellectually from their very first days, and how important it is for parents to begin immediately talking, singing, even reading to their infants.</para></quote><para>Far from being a home-grown idea! And those comments were repeated on Monday at the launch of Mem Fox's most recent book. What did the Leader of the Opposition say on 22 April this year when he was asked about it by the ABC? He said:</para><quote><para>But I had a read of it—</para></quote><para>that is, Clinton's address—</para><quote><para>last night and I'm not familiar with the content of it other than the reading I had last night and I didn't know that there was reference there to reading programs and the suggestion that it's an idea I got from Bill Clinton, I got it from Mem Fox here in Adelaide. I've made that plain on the public record consistently.</para></quote><para>When you go back to the section in the book on `parents as educators', you see that there is a reference—reference No. 59—and the source of this is not the Australian Literary Guild, not the Australian Labor Party and not Mem Fox; the source is the United States Department of Education <inline font-style="italic">Strong Families, Strong Schools </inline>Washington, DC, 1994. So what we have discovered is that these are not home-grown ideas at all and there are two things that are emerging. The first is, as Laurie Oakes said in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> on 18 April: `The Leader of the Opposition is a serial plagiariser. He doesn't just take two or three lines.

He often raises the shortage of skilled labour along the Murray River to meet the needs of the horticultural and other industries. In this place we often hear, with all of the fervour of the recent convert, about community forums. It is a bit like fatherhood and reading—now we have community forums as though they are a recent invention. Having been involved in them now for 15 years or so, I recently had six days on the road and conducted a lot of community forums. I engaged in a lot of face-to-face time with people. Over those six days, I went to Coffs Harbour, Wagga, Gunnedah, Tamworth, Armidale, Eidsvold, Warwick, Mungindi, Warialda, Goondiwindi and Coonamble.</para></talk.start><para>The interesting thing is that there was one issue that came up at every single one of those forums. It was the issue of finding enough skilled tradespeople. It came up everywhere. It was about getting truck drivers, electricians, carpenters, joiners, plumbers, motor mechanics, chefs, cooks and diesel mechanics. As I looked through the media recently, I noted that the <inline font-style="italic">Courier Mail</inline> in Queensland ran an article headed `Teens want to be masters, not apprentices'. It talks about the 500 apprentice positions available now along the Gold Coast to Sunshine Coast stretch of Queensland. Interestingly, in another related story, we hear of three young Australians—Brock Campbell, Lee Richardson and Phillip Lumsden, who are 21, 17 and 16 years of age respectively—who have moved to try to capture those opportunities. What is amazing is that they are looking for remuneration between $45,000 and $70,000 as qualified tradesmen when they finish their apprenticeships. So the remuneration is really very attractive indeed—reflecting, in part, the shortage.</para><para>Of course, that is very important in all of those rural electorates. It is important to the member from Rockhampton, who asked an earlier question. We need more of these people and they need incentives to work. But, before that, they need incentives to train. We have had a bit of chiacking from the other side. They say we are not doing anything to provide incentives. Yes, we are. The abysmal picture that we picked up when we came to government really has been turned around. We now have well over 400,000 new apprentices compared to about 135,000 in 1995. Can you believe it? Of those, and this reflects a significant rise as well in the proportion, around 34 per cent are in the trades and related occupations.</para><para>We are taking significant extra steps to meet their needs. I am indebted to my colleague the Minister for Education, Science and Training in this area. For example, today the situation is that each employer of a new apprentice in the bush at the certificate III or IV level receives $4,400 in commencement and completion incentives. They are also able to get a special incentive of $1,100 for new apprenticeships in skills shortages in rural and regional areas.</para><para>A more recent initiative was in April when the minister announced a new national skills shortage strategy to specifically tackle this problem in areas where there are shortages because of a new industry coming in or an old one declining or departing. That will test fresh approaches: shorter apprenticeships, specialised apprenticeship pathways in industries such as building and construction and closer coordination between schools and local business employers. We talk so much about community forums in this place, but what struck me was that employers and trainers everywhere on that trip said that we as a country are sending an unhelpful message, and we need to address that—all of us. </para><para>That message to our kids is that somehow to really make it these days you have to be in pursuit of a university degree—to be valued you have to pursue a career that involves a degree. The fact is that 70 per cent of our young people do not go directly to university. We need to avoid this message that we are tending to send that, if you cannot get into university, there is nowhere for you. Many of these newspaper articles talk about trainers and employers being concerned that if we cannot encourage young people to make it to a university degree we tend to encourage them not to try and to drop out when, in reality, we need to be highlighting the real jobs in what might be called the heartland—in these skilled occupations that are well paid. There are real opportunities and really good remuneration available.</para><para>What, in the face of this, does the ALP do in this place? We hear question after question on university places, but we almost never hear about the shortage of skilled people out there and the opportunities that are going begging for them. More than that, if the Labor Party were to have any credibility on this issue at all they would not only acknowledge it, talk about it and seek to address it but would start to condemn their state colleagues for the 300 per cent to 400 per cent increase in the cost of TAFE education in this country.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Immigration: Children</title><page.no>29901</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>29901</page.no><name role="metadata">Andren, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDREN</name><name.id>KL6</name.id><electorate>Calare</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is addressed to—</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>PG6</name.id><name role="metadata">Macklin, Jenny, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—The last time I checked the list Mr Andren was the member for Calare, not Ms Macklin.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>KL6</name.id><name role="display">Mr ANDREN</name></talker><para>—My question is to the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs.

The Australian Federal Police, ASIO and the Director of Public Prosecutions collectively have dedicated a great deal of time and effort to this case, as observed by the judge. I would like to also add my thanks to all those officers involved. In this matter, the prosecution sought a sentence approaching the maximum penalty of 25 years for this offence. In sentencing, the judge alluded to the seriousness of the charges while acknowledging the cooperation more lately offered by Mr Roche. </para><para>It is worth emphasising for the benefit of the House that, despite contacting ASIO, it is known that Mr Roche continued plotting the bomb attacks beyond that point. Also, contrary to recent claims by his defence counsel that were repeated in some media reports, the court was told that information provided by Roche to authorities did not play a role in the arrest of the suspected Bali mastermind, Hambali, or the al-Qaeda operator, Muklas. This has been confirmed to me by our agencies.</para><para>The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions is independent. It is a statutory office. I know that following my inquiries he is giving consideration to the merits of an appeal in relation to the severity of the sentence in this matter. I have asked for that report and, in exercising my responsibilities, I will be guided by his advice on that matter.</para><para>This case has reinforced our knowledge that Australia is not immune from the effects of international terrorism. We have known that since October 2002, when 80 Australians tragically died in the Sari Club in Bali. Evidence has emerged in this case that serves as a chilling reminder that extremists do exist and operate within Australia. We are a terrorist target because of who we are and what we stand for. The national security measures that we have adopted have been important in dealing with this. </para><para>There have been further developments today. The Australian Federal Police have charged a 34-year-old Sydney man, following an investigation by the Australian Federal Police's joint counterterrorism team. The counterterrorism officers arrested the man outside his Lakemba home this morning and formally charged him with one count of collecting or making documents likely to facilitate terrorist acts. The Sydney man is the first to be charged with this offence since the introduction of our counterterrorism legislation in 2002. The offence carries a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment. The arrest here follows a lengthy investigation involving collaborative efforts by ASIO, New South Wales Police and the Australian Federal Police. The matter will be before the court shortly, and I will not be commenting in detail on it. The man is to appear later this afternoon in the Central Local Court.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Transport and Regional Services: Funding</title><page.no>29903</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>29903</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MARTIN FERGUSON</name><name.id>LS4</name.id><electorate>Batman</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Acting Prime Minister, the Minister for Transport and Regional Services.

We reacted by saying that we will introduce legislation to this place to preserve the entitlement of small business to be exempted from this unfair burden being placed on it by the Industrial Relations Commission. </para><para>Yesterday I saw a press release from the member for Rankin.

In that press release, he said this about the safety net that he is embracing to protect small business: `GEERS is fundamentally flawed. It was a hastily cobbled together sham. It has not protected employees' full entitlements. It makes no provision for unpaid superannuation.' Yet, as of yesterday, it is Labor Party policy. If the Labor Party is abolishing their opposition to GEERS, the Treasurer would be interested to know. This creates a further hole in the Labor Party's costings. What a surprise.

Can I seek some guidance in relation to that because the reference from the member for Capricornia, if I recall, was to a particular Queensland National Party Senate candidate. In this place, we frequently make references to particular individuals—they might be former prime ministers, people who are senior in business life and public life, commissioners of the police and so on—and the significance of what we are saying and the issue being raised does turn on the identity of the person being nominated, so I was intrigued to hear you rule the way you did. My understanding of that standing order was that you should not name someone who is in a situation like thousands of other Australians vis-a-vis a particular government policy or action, so I would seek your guidance regarding that ruling and that issue.

It is about the competence of this government and it is about the character of this government's Prime Minister. It is about the competence of a government that has had more than a month to establish the facts concerning the Iraqi prisoner abuse debacle and that has failed pathetically to do so. Equally, however, it is about the character of a Prime Minister whose practice it is to hold others responsible but never himself and whose practice it is to say whenever the wheels fall off that it is someone else's fault, not his fault. When there is a matter requiring accountability, others are accountable; he is never accountable. That is the division of labour we have with this Prime Minister.</para></talk.start><para>All of us in this place know this Prime Minister has form: on kids overboard, Iraqi WMD and now Iraqi prisoner abuse. This is an ingrained pattern of behaviour. It essentially has three elements to it. The first is to take credit for anything that the government has done well. The second is to take cover when something goes wrong. The third—and this is the most important part of the trilogy—is to rapidly construct a series of concentric firewalls around yourself so that, when it comes to a question of where the buck stops, it always stops with somebody else. That is the key principle at stake here: to try to ensure that any line of politically problematic advice stops just outside the firewall erected around the Prime Minister himself.</para><para>And here is the real trick in it all—the Prime Minister's office, watching this on their screen at the moment, knows this just too well: to make sure you never actually ask for a piece of advice which will at the end of the day prove to be formally embarrassing; always keep it at arm's length. It is too bad if public policy gets shredded on the way through—foreign policy, national security policy; do not worry about that—because the central guiding principle of Australian public policy for some time has been this: the critical national interest at stake here is maintaining this Prime Minister's personal firewall at all costs. John Howard, Chief Firewarden of the Commonwealth: that is his effective title and that is his effective function. He is always insulating himself from the truth, always ensuring that the truth lies just outside his own personal firewall—always impenetrable. If estimates demonstrates one thing, it is that getting the truth out of this government is like getting blood out of a stone.</para><para>Until yesterday, how had the old firewall defence gone? Three firewalls had been constructed. Let us call the first the inner fence—the inner firewall. It is about what ministers knew about allegations of prisoner abuse in Iraq. Minister Hill said he knew in April. Minister Downer said he knew in January. The Prime Minister, always hedging his bets, said that he knew in January and in April. Then, when all this got a bit complicated, the Minister for Foreign Affairs said, `We all knew in January, but some of us knew in April as well.' Just to add clarity to it all, last night the Prime Minister told everyone again, `We all knew in April'—presumably in addition to January. Quite apart from all that, the integrity of the overall firewall essentially remained in place around that most robust principle of public policy called the Sergeant Schultz principle: `I know nothing; I have seen nothing; I know nothing.' That is what has held this firewall together. That is, ministers knew nothing about the allegations of prisoner abuse.</para><para>What about the second firewall, at least up until estimates? What did their departments know? Here the script gets a bit more interesting. What we had here with the three ministers were slightly different stories. Mr Downer's office said that Canberra was told about the Red Cross report in February. Minister Hill said on 11 May that Defence became aware of an ICRC report in February. What about the Prime Minister? He said on a radio 3AW interview on 12 May: </para><quote><para>... the report itself did not come to the Australian government until after all the publicity occurred.</para></quote><para>We presume that all the publicity he is talking about is when this whole thing blew up in the American media on 28 April. From the Prime Minister's statement, we assume that what he means is that the Red Cross report of February this year became available to ministers from somewhere between 28 April, when it all blew up in the public domain, and when the Prime Minister gave that interview to 3AW on 12 May—so the first half of last month. Just in case there is any doubt about which ICRC report we are talking about, Minister Hill clarified it last Friday when he made it explicitly clear that it was in fact the February ICRC report.</para><para>As of yesterday, as of the estimates committee convening, how was the second firewall going? Departments in Canberra knew of a Red Cross report on prisoner abuse in February but a copy of this was not available to ministers it seems until after the 28 April blow-up. That is the second firewall.</para><para>The third firewall is of course what Australian officials knew in Iraq. There was not much on the public record about this until very recently—the third firewall. At least there was not until the end of last week. That is when Major O'Kane, courtesy of the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>, entered the public script. That is why last Thursday I put a pretty unremarkable question to the Prime Minister. Here at this dispatch box I asked he who was sitting there, before he departed for pleasanter climes:</para><quote><para>Prime Minister, when were Australian personnel in Iraq, either civilian or military, first made aware of allegations of prisoner abuse in Iraq?</para></quote><para>In the 17-paragraph response, which was full of abuse, the key element was this: </para><quote><para>I was advised that a report by the International Committee of the Red Cross in October of last year covered general concerns about detainee conditions and treatment ... A separate report by the Red Cross, in February of this year ... raised allegations of ill treatment of detainees.</para></quote><para>That is a very critical distinction, as this debate will unfold in the coming weeks. In other words, he was saying in parliament at the dispatch box last Thursday that the October Red Cross report was okay—no problems; Red Cross officials had some involvement in that. The February report was bad—we found out about that later on—but the October report was not bad. It was a distinction he made clear again in statements he made to the media last Friday.</para><para>That was where we had got to when estimates began: first firewall, second firewall, third firewall. But then of course estimates caused these firewalls to start collapsing, one after the other. It started yesterday when we found out about the volume intensity of Australian official awareness of what was actually going on in the Iraqi prison system. Do you remember what the Prime Minister had said? An official, O'Kane, dealt with an ICRC report that did not deal with prisoner abuse.</para><para>What did we find out from estimates yesterday? We found out the following: Major O'Kane was not sitting in an office, it seems, doing a bit of legal drafting. Major O'Kane visited the Abu Ghraib prison not once but on five separate occasions between 27 August and 4 January. One of Major O'Kane's visits was to obtain information from the US Army 800th Military Police Brigade and the 205th Military Intelligence Brigade on allegations and comments made in the October 2003 Red Cross working paper. If you have been following this debate at all, you will know that the 800th MP Brigade and the 205th Military Intelligence Brigade were not responsible for the catering; they were doing a few other things. Major O'Kane was directly engaged in Red Cross deliberations with these individuals. Another of Major O'Kane's visits dealt with the legality of the interrogation policy at Abu Ghraib. This came out at estimates yesterday, when we finally managed to extract from the government Major O'Kane's end of trip report. It states quite nicely in section C, paragraph 5, that meetings with the brigade et cetera at Abu Ghraib dealt with advice on the legality of interrogation procedures. </para><para>What we are finding here is that we are not at the margins of this exercise; we are actually close to the centre of this exercise in terms of the awareness of what was occurring. But it is not just Major O'Kane. Beyond Major O'Kane, there are six other Australian legal officers who visited Abu Ghraib and another prison facility, Camp Cropper, from June 2003 on. Evidence in estimates told us graphically that Australian officials in Iraq were deeply aware of and involved in the exchanges between the Red Cross and the CPA last year.</para><para>Remember that the Prime Minister's first firewall defence was that only one official was aware and that this was in relation to an ICRC report which, according to the Prime Minister, did not deal with any serious allegations of prisoner abuse. So we now have an avalanche of US lawyers on their way to Canberra to find out what exactly these Australian officials knew, because it is directly germane to a series of inquiries and legal cases on foot in the United States. So much for the first firewall, which I think most honourable members would now concede is in some state of disrepair. The first firewall is officials in Baghdad.</para><para>The second firewall is officials in Canberra. Regrettably, officials in Baghdad have communicated with officials in Canberra. A great string of situation reports has been sent from Baghdad to Defence, but also to the department of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who is sitting at the table. Estimates today is working its way slowly through the number of communications which went to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and also to the Attorney-General's Department. There are some terrific examples of how precise the information was that went through to the minister, including this situation report that was released to the minister's department on 29 February 2004, which refers to a meeting along the following lines. I am not quoting; I am paraphrasing. The meeting was facilitated by an Australian group captain and the ICRC and senior coalition officials. The response from the meeting was one of shock to the actual content of the ICRC report, and it reported on the removal of Brigadier Karpinski and other management changes at Abu Ghraib.</para><para>That report came back to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade here in Canberra. We have a steady list of these things coming back to Canberra. So the first firewall is gone. The second firewall in Canberra—Defence, Foreign Affairs and Attorney-General's—is collapsing. What about the third firewall? The most important firewall of all is that surrounding Minister Downer, Minister Hill and the Prime Minister. How is that going? Remember, the whole argument still hinges on the Sergeant Schultz defence that these ministers knew nothing. But here is the Prime Minister's problem. He stood up at this dispatch box last Thursday and told us that his advice was that only one officer, Major O'Kane, had been in Baghdad looking at an October ICRC report which did not deal with serious allegations of prisoner abuse. </para><para>When all that fell over yesterday in estimates, who did he blame? The defence department. He went out, did his doorstop and said, `Woe is me. Defence is terrible. I, the Prime Minister of Australia, am fine. It is just that rotten bunch of officials who have stuffed it up.' Here is the Prime Minister's problem, and he knows it. At this dispatch box yesterday I asked him a simple question: `When, Prime Minister, did you or your office or department receive a copy of the February 2004 Red Cross report?' Why did I ask that question? Because his remarks so far have been about the report from last year. The reason I asked that question was that if you go to the beginning of the February 2004 report it says specifically that it is addressed to coalition forces, and it deals with a number of serious violations of international humanitarian law. These violations have been documented and sometimes observed while visiting prisoners of war in what period in Iraq? Between March and November 2003.</para><para>So when the Prime Minister stood at this dispatch box yesterday he had had in his possession—we think, because he has not confirmed it; he has refused to answer the question—for at least a couple of weeks, from the middle of May, this report which says that back in the last three-quarters of last year the Red Cross was visiting these places and reporting on prisoner abuses. And these, he now knows also from other reports, have been funnelled through Australian officials. The key thing is this: if you look at what the Red Cross have separately said about how they put this report together—this is a big problem in terms of this Prime Minister misleading this parliament last Thursday—the Red Cross, in a public statement on 8 May, said:</para><quote><para>It is important to understand that this report—</para></quote><para>that is, the Red Cross report of February this year—</para><quote><para>represents the summary of concerns that were regularly brought to the attention of the CF throughout 2003.</para></quote><para>That document has been in the public domain for nearly a month. This document has been in the possession of the Prime Minister, we think, for two to three weeks. Hence that is why he sniggeringly refused to answer the question that I put to him yesterday—because he knows it is a walking time bomb. What he has had in his possession, therefore, is clear evidence that the ICRC last year was looking at cases of prisoner abuse and that, courtesy of the ICRC's press statement, the report of February this year is a collation of all of that.</para><para>Surely, in the month that has gone by since 28 April when all this blew up in the public domain, you would think you would start to put two and two together about what actually was going on at the end of last year. That is the Prime Minister's key political vulnerability and he knows it. This material was in his possession. The report of 2004 was in his possession when he stood here and misled the parliament last Thursday. The press statement of 8 May by the Red Cross was in his possession when he stood here and misled the parliament last Thursday. There was one other thing as well. Remember the photographs which they all said that they were horrified about when they saw them and that that was their first knowledge of them. Surely, if you are a responsible government, you ask yourself this question: when were the happy snaps taken? When were they actually taken? If you had bothered to ask any of those questions and if you had bothered to look at the Taguba report done in the United States by the US military, you would see that it says that those photographs were taken during the relevant period of last year. </para><para>So what does the PM have in his possession? He has a Red Cross report of February this year, a Red Cross statement and information to the US military about the timing of when these photographs were taken. He stood at the dispatch box and he went out into the courtyard and said, `The defence department is my alibi.' My challenge to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, when he answers, is: did you have in your possession this information? What inquiries did you make of your department and what inquiries did the Prime Minister make of his department and his office as to what was known by the time he made the misleading statement last Thursday? Answer fundamentally to this parliament why, once again, you have been loose with the truth at a key moment. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

And it is a phoney concern coming from a party which would cut and run and leave Iraq in the hands of terrorists. That is the Labor Party policy. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The facts are important. On 16 January, the United States CENTCOM announced an investigation into abuses at Abu Ghraib. On 17 and 18 January, the United States took action against the commanders of Abu Ghraib and, on 10 February, the Red Cross handed a report to the CPA head, Ambassador Bremer—a report not addressed to Australian authorities and not passed to Australian authorities. On 23 February, the United States suspended 17 soldiers. On 24 February, the Red Cross met AusAID in Canberra. The prisoner abuse issue was not raised. On 12 March, General Taguba reported the findings of his investigation and, on 28 April, the CBS network aired the photographs.</para><para>These facts are kind of important because at the heart of this is the issue of the photographs of abuse and some sort of typical Labor Party contorted arguments about what the government may or may not have known. If you can find a major somewhere, then he constitutes the whole of the Australian government. It is a kind of unbelievable thesis that the Prime Minister himself, instead of running the country, should be down there in the defence department flicking through file after file and interviewing hundreds and hundreds of people. Only a few of the Labor Party's fellow travellers in the media think this is a serious proposition. The facts are a matter of inconvenience to the opposition.</para><para>The fact is this—and let us just think about this: despite the 16 January announcement made by the Americans, which was in the media, the opposition did not ask one question about this issue. They did not seek one briefing on the prisoner abuse issue, despite the fact this was publicly known after 16 January. It is only since April that they have sought even to raise the issue of human rights in Iraq. It is a pattern of course. All the opposition are interested in here is scoring political points on the back of human rights; scoring political points against the Americans, whom they hate; and scoring political points against the Australian government. I suppose, to be fair, they are paid to score political points against the Australian government.</para><para>Apparently, the opposition seek to say we had responsibilities on the February Red Cross report, despite the fact that it was not addressed to Australia because we are not an occupying power and we do not detain prisoners. Security Council resolution 1483 says that Britain and the United States are occupying powers. The opposition know more about who an occupying power is than the Red Cross apparently, because the Red Cross gave their reports to the occupying powers but did not give a report to us. Do you think anyone would work out who was right—the Red Cross or the member for Griffith—on this point?</para><para>The other thing which intrigues me is that the opposition expect the Australian government to have better knowledge of the abuses in Abu Ghraib than the British or the American governments. I think this point kind of exposes the fallacy of the argument being put by the opposition and the cynical party politicking on the back of human rights abuses. Of course, the ministers and officials in Australia did not know about the horrific detail of the Abu Ghraib abuses until after the 28 April broadcast of images. DFAT and my office only got the February Red Cross report on 10 May.</para><para>I just make this point: Prime Minister Blair, Foreign Secretary Straw and Defence Secretary Hoon have said that they did not know the details of the Abu Ghraib abuses until the photographs came out. But somehow the opposition—and, I have to say, a few of their fellow travellers in the media—seriously think that they can construct an argument that the Australian government would have known more about this, with a small number of personnel in Iraq and a very small number of personnel in the Coalition Provisional Authority, than the British. The opposition seriously expect the Australian people to believe that lie. I am afraid that will not wash. </para><para>In the case of the Americans—and I would have thought they had a few people on the ground, in the Coalition Provisional Authority, in the military and, of course, in the Abu Ghraib prison—I would have thought that American leaders were likely to know about this before Australian leaders. Does the opposition seriously believe that the Prime Minister, Senator Hill and I would have known about this before President Bush, Secretary Rumsfeld and Secretary Powell? I think not. I do not think any reasonable minded person in Australia would possibly believe that fantasy. The fact is that the opposition are engaged in a mighty muckraking exercise on the prisoner issue. Their interest in the welfare of others is, I am sorry to say, marginal to their cause.

The fact is that Senator Evans's vile statement about the Australian Defence Force simply exposes the intent of the Australian Labor Party on this issue. They seek to besmirch the reputation of the Australian Defence Force by saying that Australian legal officers were involved in the abuse scandal. But the member for Griffith never lets the facts get in the way of his own hysteria.

So we had a whole speech about what an outrage the Prime Minister is, firewalls, cheating, lying and all that sort of thing, but he says he cannot establish that the Prime Minister knew anything about it. What an extraordinary argument. I always say this: if you are forensic with the member for Griffith, you will expose a pretty thin intellect; not a man, if I may say, with great legal training, like the Minister for Health and Ageing, the member for Mackellar—no, not the others.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BNL</name.id><name role="metadata">Organ, Michael, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4G4</name.id><name role="metadata">Downer, Alexander, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DOWNER</name></talker><para>—No, not those two.

After listening to that very poor speech by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, all I can say is that there is another dimension now, and that is a bluster of ignorance. When the minister sank to the depths that he did, when he misquoted the shadow minister for defence, we knew that he was on about bluster. I will tell the House what the shadow minister for defence had to say today. I have a transcript of a doorstop interview that he did. He was asked some questions, and in his response Senator Evans said this:</para></talk.start><quote><para>I don't think that the abuse of Iraqi prisoners is a minor technicality. What we know is that some of these people were tortured, they were treated very inhumanely, and to be fair to Senator Hill he admitted that that occurred and he has admitted that the Australian Government has known since October. I mean our responsibilities under the Geneva Convention are important to the Australian people. We want to be known as a people who observe international law and respect Human Rights. What happened in Abu Ghraib clearly was that those rights weren't protected, weren't respected and Australia has to stand up to its responsibilities. Some of those prisoners may have been ours. Some of those may have been prisoners taken by Australian forces. We have a legal and moral responsibility to them and we have a legal and moral responsibility to our officers who are attached as legal officers inside American headquarters, that they be allowed to act properly and in accordance with Australian standards. </para></quote><para>And of course it was these Australian legal defence officers that Chris Evans was referring to.</para><para>The ALP have pursued this government over the issue of their misleading the Australian parliament on the question of the abuse of prisoners in Iraq, and we have tried to get them to accept their political responsibilities for their failures in Iraq. We have pursued the government for many reasons, and I will go through them. Firstly, we have pursued them because we believe that, as a partner in the coalition of the willing, Australia has international obligations. The ALP believe that these obligations are important if we care about our international standing and, most importantly, our standing as a nation of honour in our region of the world—a reputation that many believe is being tarnished more and more, the longer this government stay in office. An example of that is seen at almost every question time, when the Minister for Foreign Affairs gets to his feet. Today was a prime example. I do not care how much of a fool the minister makes of himself, how much of a fool he makes of the Liberal Party or how much of a fool he makes of The Nationals, but I do care when he starts to make a fool of Australia overseas—and that is what he is doing.</para><para>Secondly, we have pursued this government because—as Kevin Rudd, our shadow minister for foreign affairs, pointed out just a couple of weeks ago in some detail—we are signatories to the Geneva convention and we have obligations and responsibilities as signatories to that convention. Surely, as part of those responsibilities, we need to be aware of the conditions under which prisoners are being held. Indeed, it is now apparent that the government did know, because a bevy of defence lawyers visited Abu Ghraib as early as October 2003 and reported on these matters. The PM claims that he is sorry because no-one told him. That sounds like the three blind mice defence: look no evil, see no evil and, above all, don't ask about any evil. Of course, that comes back to the latest doctrine of the government: the doctrine of calculated ignorance.</para><para>Thirdly, and most importantly, we have pursued this government because we on this side of the House care about the welfare and wellbeing of our troops who are on overseas deployment. We care about their reputations and their international standing, and we care about their safety in the event that one or more of them should ever be taken prisoner. Can we even begin to imagine how the mums and dads of Australian servicemen would feel if the images that we have seen of these abused Iraqis were, instead, images of Australian members of the Defence Force? The people of Australia have been absolutely sickened by what they have seen, and we do not want to be associated—and we do not want to have our Australian standards associated—with that sort of thing.</para><para>Fourthly, we are pursuing this government because we believe that truth and accountability in these matters are important. Truth, honesty and accountability have all been missing from this government and its senior ministers right from the initial stages of Australia's involvement in this pre-emptive strike as a partner in the coalition of the willing. At best, this government has been sloppy, recalcitrant and irresponsible over its handling of these events. At worst, it has just continued the lies, deceit and cover-up which have been a hallmark of the Howard government over both the `children overboard' events and this issue that we are dealing with today. </para><para>Fifthly, we are pursuing this government because we do not believe that the Department of Defence and our senior troops should be made scapegoats over the government's incompetence, dishonesty and lack of responsibility. It is patently obvious that this government do not want honesty or to take due responsibility; they simply want a public servant or an ADF member whom they can hang out as a scapegoat.</para><para>But it is the third reason that I want to return to—that is, our care, concern and respect for our troops. We in the ALP are outraged at the actions of the Prime Minister and his Minister for Foreign Affairs, who have attempted to slur us and the media when questions about the treatment of Iraqi POWs and the government's actions have been raised. Their slippery, slimy defence has been to say that we are trying to impugn the reputation of our troops by raising questions and asking for accountability from the Howard government. I call this the dingo defence, because it is about as low and as gutless as you can get.</para><para>We just heard the Minister for Foreign Affairs trying to hide behind our troops and trying to use them as his front-line defence—a pathetic, weak-kneed and gutless approach. That typifies this Minister for Foreign Affairs. And we see the Prime Minister doing it again as he blames the defence department and our senior troops, as he decides to cut and run to the United States—a timely trip to visit his American idol—no doubt in the hope that, on his return, Defence will have absorbed the blame, the scapegoat will have been hung out and all will be forgotten. We will not forget and the people of Australia will not forget. It needs to be said: we do not want much. We just want the Prime Minister and his government to conduct themselves with the same moral courage and commitment which we expect and receive from our troops as they go about their responsibilities in the field. Our troops do their job in the highest traditions of the Anzacs, and we want this government to accept their responsibilities with the same high level of commitment, the same high level of morality, and in the highest traditions of our parliamentary democracy. I do not think that is too much to ask.</para><para>If the government had any respect for the conventions and standards of this place and for our democracy they would take due responsibility instead of shying away from it—as a startled horse shies away from a venomous snake. This government shy away from doing the right thing and accepting their responsibilities.</para><para>I want to compliment the Leader of the Opposition, Mark Latham; our shadow minister, Kevin Rudd; our shadow defence minister, Senator Chris Evans; and other senators on the way in which they have so doggedly pursued the Prime Minister and his government over these matters. What the Prime Minister and his Minister for Defence must explain to the people of Australia is why they hide the truth and why they refuse to accept any responsibility for these appalling events. As the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> said this morning, `PM admits nation misled over Iraqis'. It is one thing to admit it; however, it remains to be seen what responsibility, if any, he will take for misleading us—or whether he will simply hide behind the same people he blamed for the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline> affair: the Australian Defence Forces. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>29918</page.no><name role="metadata">Hunt, Gregory, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HUNT</name><name.id>00AMV</name.id><electorate>Flinders</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I do agree with the member for Cowan that this debate is about responsibility. Let me start with the inescapable point that, had the opposition's policy on Iraq been followed, Saddam Hussein would still be in power today. Let me repeat that for the benefit of the House and for the benefit of the Australian people: had the opposition's policy on Iraq been followed, Saddam Hussein would still be in power today. The opposition may not have sought it and they may not have desired it, but that would be the inescapable, unavoidable and absolute conclusion of the path down which their policy would have taken this nation. I respect the fact that there are some people of good integrity and good intentions who would pursue that policy and who believe that the cost of action would have been too great. But it is the inescapable conclusion that Hussein, the Baathists and all of those associated with the legacy of human rights abuse would still be in power.</para></talk.start><para>I want to deal with three things in this debate. Firstly, the question of human rights abuse; secondly, the opposition's implications—because the opposition seek to work by implication rather than by direct allegation—and thirdly, the question of Australia's responsibility. In terms of abuse, there is a very general and critical principle. Prisoner abuse, human rights abuse and torture are never justified. It does not matter against whom, it does not matter by whom, it does not matter what alleged justifications there are. It is wrong, it is wrong, it is always wrong. Having said that, we know that, under Saddam Hussein, Abu Ghraib was a scene of incomparable human misery. Iraq is a country which, over the last decade, witnessed 300,000 lives—if not more—exterminated under a genocidal regime. Marsh Arabs, Kurdish minorities and Shiite communities were all damaged and destroyed, and lives were extinguished repeatedly, daily, under an ongoing regime of fear. That is the reality of abuse in the last decade under Hussein.</para><para>I previously said that I had one regret in relation to Australia's involvement in Iraq, and that is not that the world community acted but that it did not act sooner. I welcome this debate, because we should be focusing on these things. If it highlights the fact that, in dealing with those atrocities, there have been people who have acted in breach of their responsibilities within Abu Ghraib prison over the last year, then they should be punished, they should be brought to account, investigations should be completed, and there should be no holding back in the punishment meted out. The full force of the law should be brought. Those are the basic principles.</para><para>What we face is a great struggle in Iraq today: a struggle between the forces of the Baathists on the one hand and those associated with al-Qaeda and their desire to destroy democracy, to bring a reign of terror, and to open the gates of hell to split Iraq asunder. That is what they seek to do. We are involved in a difficult operation.</para><para>But what are the implications made by the opposition in this debate? What are the implications made by the Leader of the Opposition? What are the implications made by the member for Griffith? They cast three key implications. The first implication, which is inescapable and unavoidable from everything they say, is that Australia was involved or that it was complicit. That is the underlying implication in all of their work. Was Australia involved? Was it complicit? What did Senator Chris Evans, the opposition defence spokesperson, say today on ABC radio this morning? He said, `didn't get the answers that revealed the involvement of Australian legal officers in the abuse scandal.' `Involvement'—that is what they are seeking to imply; that is what they are seeking to show: that in some way Australia was involved. That is a dangerous and reprehensible implication, because the implication is pregnant, it is heavy, it is there, and it is directed against the government through the implication that, in some way, we were involved. That is the underlying assumption, and it is fundamentally wrong, and Australians throughout Australia know that it is fundamentally wrong. </para><para>The second implication which the opposition raise is that the Prime Minister knew of the abuse. But this would have had to have been in advance of the US President; the United Kingdom's Prime Minister, Tony Blair; the defence secretary of the UK, Geoffrey Hoon; and Jack Straw, the foreign secretary of the UK. That is the implication but, when questioned, do they agree with that? What did the member for Griffith say on Victoria radio this morning when asked:</para><quote><para>... but you haven't established the Prime Minister knew anything have you?</para></quote><para>The member for Griffith answered:</para><quote><para>Ah, no, that's not our point.</para></quote><para>`It is not our point that the Prime Minister did not know'? That is their entire point. It is to imply and imply that the Prime Minister was aware and effectively failed to do anything.</para><para>The third implication is that senior officials knew—that if the Prime Minister did not know, senior officials knew and should have informed the Prime Minister; that there is a culture of being cowed. Let us deal with these implications expressly—because they are not stated; they are implied. Have the courage to come out and state them. What was the height of the implication in the member for Griffith's statement? It was simple. He went so far as to make the bold allegation that, after the Abu Ghraib incidents were aired on television, the Australian government might have received the ICRC report from February. That is the height: that, after the world community knew, the Australian government might have received the report. There is a sort of fantasy here which is extraordinary.</para><para>But let me go to another part of this debate. A difficult question for everybody involved—and I entirely respect the right of other Australians and other members of this House to have different views—is the question of what our responsibilities are as a nation to individuals within Iraq, to the course of human history as it stands now and to Australian troops and representatives? There are two great questions that we face. The first is whether or not we leave Australian troops within Iraq, because that is an unresolved question. What we have is a position from the opposition that says, `We should withdraw those troops at the very first opportunity that we in the opposition will have.' I respect their right to do that, but the consequence—and you can never divorce the consequence from the action—is simple to see. It will leave Australian diplomats, Australian aid workers and any Australian in Iraq exposed. It will leave them open to violence, to terror and to the worst forms of action—as we saw only last week. That will be the consequence of the action which the opposition prescribe—Australians will be exposed.</para><para>The second question that we face is: what is the deeper significance of what the opposition are advocating? Are they advocating that the West should walk away? What is occurring in Iraq now is one of the great civilisational challenges. It is a battle between forces related to the Baathists and to Saddam Hussein and his legacy and also those related to al-Qaeda and their desire—as we saw only last weekend—to destroy all of the existing Islamic societies and to replace them with a Taliban style world of utter and total oppression. There is a challenge that is alive today in Iraq; big history is being battled out—and the opposition say that we should pull out. </para><para>The consequence of that if taken to its conclusion—that the United States should pull out as well; that this is no place for the West; that this is no place for people to be dealing with the lives of ordinary Iraqis—is that the gates of hell will open on Iraq. If you care about Iraqi citizens, you could not pursue a more dangerous, a more destructive or a less concerned policy for the people of Iraq. It is a fundamentally flawed, a fatally dangerous and an inhumane policy, because it will open the gates of hell on the people of Iraq. That is what will happen to the people in that country. For the people in the rest of the world, we will see played out again and again the acts of terror and the attempts to break down our civilisation. That will be the consequence. That is the battle that we are facing. On every front, I reject the position put forward by the opposition today. It is a position based on an inability to deal with abuse, on false implications and, above all else, a failure to carry out Australia's responsibilities. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>29920</page.no><name role="metadata">Organ, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ORGAN</name><name.id>BNL</name.id><electorate>Cunningham</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Gates of hell indeed! I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to this debate on the government's misleading of the Australian parliament and people on the question of prisoner abuse in Iraq. The way in which the government has handled the issue of torture of prisoners in Iraq is another example of the contempt in which it holds the Australian people. It is now clear that a number of people in the defence establishment were aware of the allegations and the government failed to discover the fact, preferring instead to adopt the stone-walling tactics of denial which have become this administration's stock response.</para></talk.start><para>I hope that the government has read the report of US Major General Anthony Taguba, and I hope it has read it closely, because one of the people named by General Taguba has strong links with our country. I refer to Steven Stefanowicz, who General Taguba found had:</para><quote><para>... made a false statement to the investigation team regarding the locations of his interrogations, the activities during those interrogations, and his knowledge of abuses.</para></quote><para>Stefanowicz has been identified by the <inline font-style="italic">Philadelphia Daily News </inline>as a former public relations specialist for the South Australian government, though other sources suggest his field of work was really information technology, at which he was not particularly successful in gaining employment.</para><para>The <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> newspaper cast more light on this, confirming in a report of 8 May 2004 that Stefanowicz worked in IT sales in Adelaide for 18 months until October 2001. It appears he returned to the United States and joined, or re-joined, the US Navy Reserve, where he held the rank of petty officer and served somewhere in the Middle East.</para><para>How he came to be working as a civilian contractor for CACI International is unclear from the public record. Nonetheless, his position with that organisation was obviously one of some significant authority. You can glean that much from General Taguba's recommendation about him, and again I quote from his report. General Taguba's recommendation was:</para><quote><para>Stefanowicz, of CACI International, be fired from his army job, reprimanded, and denied his security clearances for lying to the investigating team and allowing or ordering military policemen who were not trained in interrogation techniques to facilitate interrogations by `setting conditions' which were neither authorised, nor in accordance with army regulations.</para><para>He clearly knew his instructions equated to physical abuse.</para></quote><para>Despite this his family—presumably his mother, Jean Campbell, who lives in Telford, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, near where Stefanowicz grew up in the Philadelphia suburbs—has confirmed to at least two major newspapers that her son remains in Iraq. And, despite that damning finding, the US Army has confirmed that he is still working at Abu Ghraib prison, the site of his gross abuses of human rights. According to that report in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> which I referred to earlier, he now intends to come back to Australia. He feels like Adelaide is home. Mr Speaker, I am here to tell you that this man must not—I repeat `not'—be allowed to re-enter Australia. We have seen how government stonewalling and denial delayed the truth about who knew what and what was going on in the Iraq prisons and when. </para><para>And that brings me to my final point. General Taguba's report reveals that US Major General Geoffrey D. Miller, the Commander of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility, reviewed the detention and interrogation operations in Iraq between 31 August and 9 September 2003 and, using the Guantanamo Bay procedures as a baseline, recommended that detention operations must act as an enabler for interrogation. Major General Miller was previously the Commander of Joint Task Force Guantanamo, and Taguba's report shows that he applied the Guantanamo protocols in his review. How can we be sure that there is not a report which the government can deny knowing about on the treatment of the Australian Guantanamo detainees David Hicks and Mamdouh Habib? How can the government be sure that the abhorrent techniques used on Iraqi detainees were not similarly used on them? And how can we believe them?</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

The estimated cost of the proposed fit-out works is $18.5 million. The Department of Health and Ageing has been situated in the Woden Town Centre since the development of the town concept in the early planning of Canberra. Over time, the department has expanded to occupy some 46,000 square metres of leasehold accommodation in Canberra, with 12 of its 15 leased premises being located in Woden. The need for the proposed work is driven by Health's objective of consolidating its Canberra activities into two buildings in Woden, one of which will be Scarborough House.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Health anticipates that the rationalisation of its accommodation at Scarborough House will result in a number of organisational benefits, including cost and operational efficiencies derived from the collocation of fragmented leases and the provision of a modern working environment for employees. Work elements for the Scarborough House proposal comprise: integration of electrical, mechanical, security, communications, fire and hydraulic services into base building works; and general office fit-out to meet Health's requirements, including security and reception facilities, office areas, meeting rooms, utilities, stores, tearooms, a first aid room and conference and training facilities.</para><para>At the public hearing, the committee questioned Health on issues related to project costs, building amenities and consultation. We asked them to expand on the cost efficiencies to be realised from co-location, and Health stated that savings would be generated in a number of areas, including security arrangements, energy, repair and maintenance costs, venue hire and courier and freight charges. The committee expressed concern at what appeared to be unusually high relocation costs. The department explained that the relocation costs provided for a number of moves which were required to create greater cohesion through the realignment of business entities within the department.</para><para>The committee noted Health's tight project time line and queried the potential for cost escalation and the provision of appropriate contingency arrangements. Health replied that, while it was confident deadlines would be met, the building owners would be responsible for any costs incurred in the event of a delay. With respect to all cost matters, the committee requested that Health supply it with a cost savings analysis, a detailed breakdown of relocation costs and a project time line. The department subsequently provided that information.</para><para>The committee asked why Health had decided against the provision of child-care facilities on site. Health explained that employees were not moving outside the Woden area, where adequate facilities already exist. Furthermore, the building has insufficient external space to provide a suitable play area. Noting the open-plan layout of the office accommodation, the committee raised concerns about employees' personal work space environments. Health assured the committee that individual work space allocations would be within acceptable departmental ranges and that the issue of sound intrusion had been addressed. </para><para>The committee was also interested to learn more about Health's staff consultation process in relation to the move. Health described its communication strategy, which included staff information sessions and a consultative forum comprised of employees from each work area and union and occupational health and safety representatives. Health developed a process to encourage staff feedback and suggestions from staff and intended to incorporate these into the architect's brief.</para><para>Although Health's written evidence described a range of proposed energy conservation measures, it did not indicate that Health had consulted with the Australian Greenhouse Office to ensure compliance with the Commonwealth energy policy.

It thereby significantly extends the scope of the existing co-contribution for the low-income earners scheme. The change proposed is one part of a number of changes announced over the last few months in the superannuation area. The most recent were announced in the budget. The suite of changes includes this current proposal to alter the definition of a low-income employee, changes to the amount of the co-contribution from dollar for dollar to $1.50 per dollar for each dollar saved for those on low incomes, increasing the upper income limit for full access to this scheme from $27,500 to $28,000 per year and cutting the superannuation surcharge for those on high incomes.</para></talk.start><para>Under current law, eligibility for the government co-contribution requires that an individual be in receipt of or entitled to employer superannuation support in the form of superannuation guarantee contributions. This means that those earning under $450 per month—the amount above which SGC payments are required—are not eligible for the co-contribution. It also means that those under 18 years of age and working part-time are also ineligible for the same reason. The current arrangements also exclude low-income earners who are self-employed and those whose incomes are erratic, which is the case for many casual workers. </para><para>The changes proposed here mean that an individual is no longer required to be entitled to employer superannuation support to be eligible for the co-contribution. Instead, the requirement will be that 10 per cent of the individual's income is from employment. The reason for this change is to increase access to the scheme: that is, those who earn less than $450 per month—$5,400 per year—are now entitled to a co-contribution if they make superannuation savings. Also, those who earn their low income from activities other than employment are now also eligible.</para><para>One has to ask the obvious questions: why is the takeup of this scheme such that the government sees the need to act to improve it; and why alter the eligibility criteria in this way? The answer to the first question is obvious: not many employees on a low income can afford to make voluntary superannuation savings out of their own pockets. People on low incomes usually do not have much discretionary income. Most of their income is taken up with everyday living expenses. One can only speculate on the answer to the second question. A cynic would note that the most likely person on a low income able to make superannuation savings is the person who is at least partially financially supported by somebody else—someone like a spouse on a high income or a parent.</para><para>The change to the eligibility criteria that removes the need for all of the income to be from employment—in fact, reducing the income required to be from employment to just 10 per cent—is a huge change. Suddenly, it opens the door to households, for instance, where one partner is substantially supported by a high-income earner who has put the household investments in the name of the low-income partner. It is quite legitimate for households to organise their financial affairs this way, but I do question whether these are the households most in need of help in making superannuation savings. Many of these households will be receiving a tax cut as a result of the recent budget, a tax cut denied to those on incomes of under $52,000 per year. These households get to gain twice. They will gain three times if the high-income earner earns more than $92,000 per year and gets a tax break because of the cut in the superannuation surcharge.</para><para>If the government is serious about assistance to those on low incomes in the superannuation area, other things could be done that would be of more benefit. For instance, the government could have cut the superannuation tax for all employees rather than cut the superannuation surcharge, which benefits only a small section of our community.</para><para>The Labor Party over the years has done a lot towards ensuring employees have sufficient superannuation to see them through retirement. It was Labor after all who established a system of compulsory contributions for employees. This started from a modest three per cent of earnings and has gradually moved to nine per cent, where it sits today. The original legislation went further than nine per cent. It proposed an additional three per cent employee and three per cent government contribution—a total of 15 per cent. This was abandoned by the present government in 1997, which is seen as a backward step. Labor was interested in giving workers a real chance to build up their superannuation for a decent income in retirement. Instead of spending the money on a tax cut to those on high incomes—four per cent of superannuation contributors—the government could have followed Labor's lead and offered a superannuation tax cut to all superannuation contributors by cutting the 15 per cent super tax on all contributions back to, say, 13 per cent. </para><para>It would be better to offer Australians better security for their superannuation savings. Super is often the only asset a family has beyond their home. Despite this and despite the fact that super is compulsory, the government has not provided 100 per cent compensation for those who lose their super savings. Super can be lost through theft or fraud or where a business has failed and the employee superannuation guarantee contributions have not been paid by that business. Labor proposes changes to superannuation which include a ban on exit fees and commissions, a cap on ongoing fees and charges on the nine per cent compulsory superannuation guarantee, tougher enforcement of the law to ensure financial planners give independent and competent advice to consumers and full compensation for funds lost through theft or fraud.</para><para>On the face of it, this bill is all about helping those on low incomes to save for their retirement. But, like every other step taken by this government which appears to help those not so well off, it pays to be wary of the hidden agenda. This bill will benefit those on low incomes who have high earning partners: that is, those who despite their low incomes have discretionary income. It will be interesting over time to see how many beneficiaries of this bit of legislation have a partner who benefits from the income tax cuts for those on incomes of over $52,000 per year or who benefits from the other inequitable tax cut, the reduction in the superannuation surcharge. At best, this bill is misdirected. At worst, it is very well directed, but not to those purported to be the objective of this legislation.</para><para>I support the amendments moved to this bill, which point out the failure of the government to offer a tax cut to all superannuation contributors while offering one to those on high incomes and which point out that this bill is really only going to benefit those low-income earners who have a partner with a high income who is prepared to contribute to the low-income person's superannuation. It will not be of much use to low-income households at all.</para><para>The second bill being debated here is the <inline ref="R2050">Superannuation Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 2) Bill 2004</inline>. This bill is largely technical in nature but it does have a sting, and that is a simplification of the earnings base used to calculate the superannuation guarantee entitlement. Most employers are required to use ordinary time earnings as the SG earnings base but there are a number of exemptions. This is a particular problem for some industries where shift penalties make up the major part of the remuneration but are excluded from the SG base either by legislation or by industrial award.</para><para>While I support the proposed standardisation of the SG base, I have to ask why it does not take effect until 2010. These employees affected by this situation have been disadvantaged for the last 12 years. Why should they wait any longer? Labor believes that this measure should be implemented from 1 July 2005. I understand that some employers might face difficulty in changing over immediately and we propose that employers in this situation apply to the relevant industrial commission to have the standardised GC base phased in.</para><para>Superannuation is critical to the security of everyone in retirement. We should be serious about offering real incentives and the capacity to those who rely on their hard earned wages to save for their retirement. The measures being brought forward over recent months do not help working families and people. They provide assistance to those already able to look after themselves—a tax cut for those earning over $52,000 per year, a super cut for those on over $95,000 per year and now a cash bonus from government for those on low incomes who can somehow afford to put aside $1,000 in superannuation savings. It is time this government got serious about superannuation and adopted some of our proposals for ensuring adequate and secure superannuation for all people. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>29930</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Gavan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR</name><name.id>WU5</name.id><electorate>Corio</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R2049">Superannuation Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 1) Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2050">Superannuation Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 2) Bill 2004 </inline>give effect to changes made to the government's policy on superannuation contained in its most recent budget. As the Australian public well knows, we are in an election year and the current flurry of activity on several policy fronts, including this one, is motivated more by the political imperatives of the government than by any government desire to construct a longterm retirement policy to serve all Australians.</para></talk.start><para>The Superannuation Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 1) Bill 2004 amends the Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Act<inline ref=""></inline>2003, the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 in order to extend the government's co-contribution for low-income earners to some employees who at the moment do not qualify for it. It will also remove taxation deductions available for personal superannuation contributions made by individuals who, under this bill, will now qualify for a government co-contribution. In this way the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 will be amended to deny a taxation deduction in respect of personal superannuation contributions made by individuals who are entitled to a government co-contribution. Schedule 2 of this bill amends the Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Act<inline ref=""></inline>2003 to specify an interest rate to be applied to late government co-contribution payments, to require superannuation providers to repay government co-contribution amounts which are not credited to members' accounts within a specific time frame and to further outline the requirements for reports by the minister to parliament under the co-contribution act.</para><para>The Superannuation Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 2) Bill 2004 will amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, removing the requirement for superannuation funds to obtain an actuary's certificate in order to qualify for exemption from tax. It will also amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to provide an additional condition in regard to taxpayers below the age of 18. Further, it will amend the Superannuation Guarantee Administration Act 1992 to simplify the earnings base of an employee for superannuation guarantee purposes. This legislation also seeks to address several key issues relating to superannuation. In particular, it will remove the complexity in determining the correct earnings base as well as the inequality in the level of contributions between equivalent employees. A lead time of six years will allow the changes contained in this measure to be considered by employers and employees in the wage bargaining process.</para><para>In press release No. 11, dated 25 February 2004 and entitled `A more flexible and adaptable retirement income system', the Treasurer set out the government's policy objectives. Let me for the benefit of the House go over those objectives here. They are, firstly, to simplify the operations of the superannuation scheme and reduce superannuation providers' compliance costs associated with administering the current super-annuation work test; and, secondly, to improve equity of access to the super-annuation system. These are indeed noble objectives and I do not think there would be anybody on this side of the House who would dispute those particular objectives as being important to this area of policy. But the government has had eight years to get on top of these two particular objectives and to give effect to them in its policy on superannuation, and I think it is indicative of the fact that superannuation has never been a priority of the Liberal and National parties in this country. </para><para>The electorate is very cynical about these preelection manoeuvres and I think the people of Australia can rightly be cynical of what the government is attempting to do with its superannuation budget measures and in this legislation. As I have said, super has never really been a priority of the Liberal and National parties, but we now have this flurry of activity in the preelection phase as the government tries to pretend it has an agenda beyond the next election.</para><para>I do not propose to canvass all government amendments contained in these two bills; however, I would like to make comment on two aspects that have given rise to the second reading amendments proposed earlier by my colleague the member for Kingston, who is in the House this evening. As my colleague has pointed out in debate—and I think it was last week in debate on the <inline ref="R2048">Superannuation Budget Measures Bill 2004</inline>—Labor has voiced some real concerns that the targeting of the co-contribution may lead to its being utilised by high-income earning couples where one spouse is earning a low income, and these are the very people who least need it. These provisions ought not to lead to situations where couples are able to utilise them to extract a tax avoidance benefit.</para><para>We on this side of the House all know the natural tendency of the Prime Minister to structure policy to assist the tax bludgers in our community. He has form; he has a history as Treasurer, with the bottom of the harbour schemes, of allowing tax rorters to run riot in this country. As he has a fair bit of form, we as an opposition have to be eternally vigilant to ensure that the Prime Minister does not slip back to his bad old ways. As Treasurer of this country, he left Labor with a deficit which in current terms would be in excess of $25 billion in any one year. And we know that, with regard to certain taxation practices, he allowed the tax bludgers to run riot. We as an opposition do not intend to allow the Prime Minister once again to introduce legislation that will allow high-income earners to milk the system for their own benefit and for that to be paid for by the ordinary wage and salary earners of this country.</para><para>We have also pointed out in this debate that most low-income taxpayers earning $28,000, given the household demands on their available income, are unlikely to be able to save the $1,000 after-tax contribution that is necessary for eligibility to claim this offer from the government. Labor have stated that we will support integrity amendments to ensure that the co-contribution scheme cannot be abused by tax rorters. In particular, we are of the view that the eligibility test for the co-contribution should take into account total household income to better target the assistance to low-income earners. Labor will pass these amendments but we will also refer them to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee for further examination.</para><para>I want registered in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> my support for the second reading amendment moved by the honourable member for Kingston in this debate—namely, that whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the government for its failure to adopt the alternative approach of offering a superannuation tax cut to all contributors, as proposed by Labor, and for operating a system that fails to recognise the inability of low-income Australians to take advantage of measures to expand their superannuation while permitting spouses with wealthy partners to exploit the benefit. </para><para>I turn to the second bill before the House, the <inline ref="R2050">Superannuation Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 2) Bill 2004</inline>. Rather then pick up on all the measures in that bill, I will just refer to that aspect of the bill that deals with the simplification of the superannuation guarantee earnings base. As we know, most employers are required to use ordinary-time earnings as the superannuation guarantee earnings base. However, there are a number of exemptions to this in the superannuation guarantee legislation and, as we know, there are some industrial awards where a different superannuation guarantee earnings base is permitted.</para><para>These particular exemptions and provisions result in a lower superannuation guarantee earnings base and, at the end of the day, lower superannuation guarantee contributions. We have noticed that this is particularly the case in industries where shift penalties make up a major part of the wages of workers. There are significant groups of employees that are affected by these exemptions. Workers in the coal industry, workers under Queensland state awards, casual workers under the Queensland state clerical employees award, Queensland public sector workers and miners in Tasmania and Western Australia are just a few of those that are missing out on the full superannuation guarantee contributions.</para><para>We support the standardisation of the superannuation guarantee base but we question the motivation of the government in bringing this legislation and this amendment before the House. In particular, we ask why the government has put in a time limit of 2010 to implement this change. That would effectively give many employees a substantial advantage over others. We are essentially saying to employees: `Yes, there is a problem. We think you have been disadvantaged and are in an unfair situation relative to other workers, but you are going to have to wait another five years to have this issue redressed.' We are of the view that the date of implementation of the measures to standardise the superannuation guarantee base ought to be moved forward to 1 July 2005. I think that is a reasonable amendment, and I support the second reading amendment that has been proposed, which gives effect to that particular proposition.</para><para>The Labor Party has a real vision for an ageing society. It is an inclusive vision which is rooted in the proud history of previous Labor governments, and it really does contrast with the rather exclusive approach that has been pursued by the Liberal and National parties, both in government and in opposition. Labor has always led the way on retirement incomes policy in this country, simply because it seeks to give the broadest coverage and the broadest security to the greatest number of Australians that it can. Honourable members might recall that in 1909 the Fisher Labor government introduced the first Commonwealth age pension for males at age 65, and that was extended in the next year to women at age 60.</para><para>Australia was fortunate enough to have the Chifley Labor government introduce a national compulsory contribution pension fund to pay for future pension costs. We know the reaction of the Liberal and National parties to that proposition in the early 1950s. The Menzies Liberal government ceased funding it in the early 1950s. It took until the Hawke Labor government in 1983 to increase pensions to 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings. This change meant that the age pension increased not just in line with inflation but in real value as the economy grew. </para><para>The next major achievement by Labor in government was the establishment of the existing compulsory superannuation system, which commenced in 1987. In that year Labor in government took the visionary step of establishing Australia's first compulsory superannuation system. This was a response to a long held belief of ours that security in retirement is a fundamental right of all Australians and a recognition by us that the retirement income system at that time did not provide all Australians with that security against the background of an ageing population. Since then, we have pursued a three-pillared strategy that now forms the basis of Australia's retirement income system—namely, the age pension, the superannuation guarantee and additional voluntary contributions to superannuation.</para><para>Since its introduction in 1987, when the Industrial Relations Commission decision required employers to pay a three per cent compulsory contribution to superannuation on behalf of each worker, coverage has expanded from 48 per cent of the work force to 80 per cent. I think that is one of the most significant social reforms that any government has introduced in this country in the post war era. It was not a Liberal-National government that created the superannuation scheme, because they have basically done very little on this retirement incomes front until recent budgets; since Federation it has been the Labor Party in government that has attempted to set up a viable retirement incomes policy for the people of this nation.</para><para>There is something instructive that I want all electors in Corio and the Geelong area to fully understand; that is, there is a very good reason the Treasurer wants them to work until they drop: it is, simply, because those workers in my electorate on average weekly earnings have been dudded to the tune of $100,000 as a result of the failure of this government to fulfil the promise it gave before it came to power that it would continue Labor's superannuation policies. In 1995 the Retirement Income Modelling Task Force estimated that Labor's plan would have increased by $100,000 the retirement income of an employee who was then aged in their mid 30s and on an average weekly income. So $100,000 would now be in the pockets of each of those employees on retirement if Labor had stayed in power—or if the Prime Minister had implemented the promise he gave to the Australian people.</para><para>I want to quote from the Liberal Party policy document called <inline font-style="italic">Super for all: security and flexibility in retirement: the federal coalition's superannuatio</inline><inline font-style="italic">n and retirement incomes policy</inline><inline font-style="italic"></inline>dated 19 February 1996. It says: </para><quote><para>...the funds earmarked in the 1995-96 Budget to match compulsory employee contributions will be provided in full, in a manner that is both efficient and equitable ...</para></quote><para>We now know that the Prime Minister ratted on that particular promise on superannuation. Workers in my community who paid into their superannuation during the years of the Labor government and who were given that great opportunity to improve their retirement incomes have been dudded by the Liberal Party and The Nationals out of $100,000 in their retirement.</para><para>So we know your priorities; we know exactly your priorities. You can spend $1 billion on a war in Iraq, you can spend $100 million on wasteful advertising, you can spend over $250 million on a dopey Pacific solution on refugees, but when it comes to keeping your promises on superannuation and when it comes to meeting the needs of Australians in their retirement, you certainly fall well short. We are going to support the measures contained in these bills, but we have moved a second reading amendment. I wholeheartedly support that amendment moved by the honourable member for Kingston. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>29934</page.no><name role="metadata">Cameron, Ross, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ROSS CAMERON</name><name.id>3K6</name.id><electorate>Parramatta</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is my pleasure to sum up debate on these bills, which I think in most cases has been most constructive, although the member for Corio seemed to run out of impetus about two-thirds of the way through his speech. The government would like to thank all honourable members who participated in the debate on the <inline ref="R2049">Superannuation Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 1) Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2050">Superannuation Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 2) Bill 2004</inline>.</para></talk.start><para>Over recent years there has been a growing realisation throughout Australian society of the importance of retirement planning and saving for the years ahead. Superannuation is seen as a vital element in planning for a comfortable and secure retirement, providing a vehicle for people to secure a higher standard of living in retirement than would be possible on the pension alone. A key initiative introduced last year to provide greater incentives for voluntary superannuation contributions was the government's co-contribution scheme. The government has recognised that more incentives were needed for low-income earners to increase their level of voluntary superannuation saving.</para><para>The Superannuation Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 1) Bill gives effect to a proposal by the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer on 14 March 2004 to alter the eligibility criteria for the government's superannuation co-contribution. This bill will amend the Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Act 2003 so that individuals will no longer be required to be employer superannuation supported to qualify for the co-contribution. Rather, they will only be required to have at least 10 per cent of their total income as an employee. This change will apply for all co-contribution determinations made for a person for the 2003-04 and later income years.</para><para>To prevent double-dipping, the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 will also be amended to ensure that these people now entitled to a co-contribution cannot also claim a tax deduction for their personal superannuation contributions. This will only be done for the 2004-05 and subsequent income years to avoid any retrospective effect on these new co-contribution recipients.</para><para>Other measures contained in this bill to ensure the smooth operation of the Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Act 2003 are: specifying a time frame in which providers must repay uncredited co-contribution amounts to the Commissioner of Taxation and a further period of time after which providers will become liable to pay the general interest charge; outlining that, where the information is available, the minister will report on an aggregated and annual basis on the numbers of co-contribution beneficiaries and spouses of beneficiaries within prescribed income ranges; specifying the interest rate that will apply to late payments made by the Commissioner of Taxation; and inserting a previously omitted definition.</para><para>In response to comments made by the honourable members for Kingston, Braddon, Isaacs and Corio during the debate on this bill, let me make the following points. There is no evidence to support the claim that the new co-contribution test will primarily benefit low-income spouses of high-wealth households. However, as was also mentioned during the debate, amendments in this bill will mean that the minister will report to parliament on an annual basis about the number of co-contribution recipients and the number of spouses of those recipients by prescribed income ranges. Furthermore, let me reiterate that the new test is that a person must have earned at least 10 per cent of their total income as an employee. </para><para>Let me also say that this change means that employees will now not be denied a co-contribution just because they do not have employer superannuation support on their income earned as an employee. For example, this change will mean that employees without employer superannuation support who earn less than $450 per month or are under 18 and work less than 30 hours per week will be brought into the co-contribution measure if they make personal superannuation contributions. It should also be noted again that, whilst it is claimed that low-income earners will not be able to afford $1,000 to receive the co-contribution, people will receive a co-contribution for personal contributions of less than $1,000. Finally, more generally the co-contribution provides an opportunity for low-income earners to take advantage of a greater incentive than existed previously in order to improve their superannuation savings.</para><para>The Superannuation Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 2) Bill 2004 gives effect to a number of the enhancements to the retirement income system announced by the Treasurer on 25 February 2004 in his statement `A more flexible and adaptable retirement income system'. The measures contained in this bill will simplify the superannuation guarantee earnings base arrangements, remove the requirement for prescribed pension providers to obtain an actuary certificate, align the portability time frame applying to retirement savings accounts providers with that of superannuation providers and introduce an integrity measure to require those under the age of 18 to satisfy a work test in order to claim a tax deduction for personal superannuation contributions. This bill also contains a technical amendment to correct a cross-referencing error in the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 relating to the cancelling of registrable superannuation entity licenses.</para><para>In response to the points raised by the honourable members for Kingston and Braddon in relation to the Superannuation Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 2) Bill 2004, I would like to make the following comments. The first point raised by the opposition relates to the bringing forward of the date of effect for the simplification of the superannuation guarantee earnings base provisions from 1 July 2010 to 1 July 2005. The government considers that a start date of 1 July 2010 will allow for a smooth transition to a simplified superannuation guarantee system. The commencement date of 1 July 2010 will allow approximately two industrial bargaining cycles for employers and employees to consider and incorporate these changes into the bargaining process. The time frame allowed will ensure that the labour market is not undermined—which could potentially result in job losses—which is a possibility if implementation is rushed.</para><para>The opposition's proposal to require employers to appear before an industrial tribunal to put a case for a phased-in adjustment to an earnings base of ordinary time earnings would be costly and time consuming. A less cumbersome approach of having a reasonable time frame for implementation will allow both employers and employees to phase in the changes at a rate which is most beneficial to them, utilising existing industrial bargaining practices. </para><para>The second point made in relation to this measure was that the legislation would not remove any superannuation guarantee base that is more generous than the ordinary time earnings base. The superannuation guarantee requires employers to provide a minimum level of superannuation support for their employees. The proposed measure will remove references to all other instruments that can currently specify an earnings base for superannuation guarantee purposes—for example, industrial awards. This measure will not prohibit the specification of superannuation conditions in industrial agreements. Employers and employees will remain free to negotiate higher earnings bases or higher contribution rates in their industrial agreements. Where higher contributions are negotiated under industrial agreements, the employer superannuation guarantee obligations will still be determined with reference to the employee's ordinary time earnings. The obligation to pay the additional amount would need to be enforced in the same way as all other terms and conditions of the industrial agreement through the appropriate industrial dispute channel.</para><para>These changes will broaden the availability of superannuation and make it more adaptable to changing work arrangements. I am hopeful the government will receive support for both these bills, given the importance of increasing the attractiveness of superannuation and making the retirement income system more flexible and adaptable. I therefore commend the legislation to the chamber.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Scott, Bruce (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

Labor has previously indicated its support for the changes, particularly those which encourage the early introduction of ultra low sulfur diesel, known as ULSD. But, yet again, it has taken the government too long to implement them.</para></talk.start><para>The government first announced these measures on 31 May 1999 and it has taken five years for them to get this far. Meanwhile, refiners have been living with great uncertainty. At least one of them invested early and then found the incentives did not materialise as soon as was expected. Others have been waiting for security before they make the very large investment decisions to produce clean petrol and diesel. For them, time is fast running out as the deadline for the new fuel standards in 2006 rapidly approaches. Similarly, biofuel producers have faced years of uncertainty and backflipping under this government. It is not only fuel producers who have suffered as a result of the government's tardiness on these bills. Consumers should have been encouraged to use low sulfur diesel long before now. Cleaner diesel is better for the environment and better for public health, but Australia will struggle to meet its deadline for new clean fuel standards in 2006 because of the delay in the introduction of these bills into the parliament.</para><para>Further, Australia has been left behind in the vehicle technology stakes, with many advanced diesel engines not even available in Australia because our fuel quality is not yet good enough. This is just one example of the Howard government's disregard for consumers in the fuel sector. High petrol prices are putting financial pressure on Australian families. Most parts of the country are experiencing prices of at least $1 per litre and, of course, in many regional and remote areas the prices are much higher.</para><para>As Peter Costello has said, a big part of the problem is the war in Iraq and the instability in the Middle East—something for which the government surely must take some responsibility. High oil prices mean it is now the time to increase competition in the Australian petroleum industry and provide relief for consumers and their families. This is the best way of assisting motorists in the domestic market and that is why a Labor government will implement a six-point plan to put downward pressure on petrol prices. We want to break down the power of the big oil companies and help the motoring public. Conversely, this government has adopted a spectator approach to the emerging Caltex-Woolworths, Coles-Shell retail duopoly. This government is standing on the sidelines while retail petrol competition is being diminished and motorists are left even more exposed to the prospect of even higher petrol prices in the future.</para><para>Labor will ensure that consumers continue to have access to a competitive retail petroleum market. Our six-point plan will strengthen the Trade Practices Act and give the ACCC more teeth to take action against major oil corporations and their alliance partners misusing their market power to the detriment of the market and, consequently, the detriment of the consumer. A number of reports have recommended reform of the Trade Practices Act but the Howard government has refused to legislate them. Only Labor is committed to stimulating competition and, in this case, delivering lower petrol prices to consumers. </para><para>Minister Macfarlane claims, quite incorrectly, that Labor's plan would lead to the demise of the shopper docket scheme. Indeed, the ACCC has already undertaken a thorough investigation of the shopper docket scheme and found it not to be anticompetitive in any way. Labor's plan will encourage competition, not undermine it. But the point has to be made that the shopper docket scheme does, in turn, enhance the power of the major oil companies and their alliance partners—the supermarkets—and therefore, once again, makes it urgent that we get these most overdue reforms through this parliament. Minister Macfarlane's comments again demonstrate that the silly season has well and truly begun. Labor has no intention of moving against the shopper docket scheme.</para><para>There is also the longer term issue to be addressed in protecting consumers and ensuring access to reliable supplies and reasonably priced petrol and diesel. This government has had eight years to give Australia a national energy policy but it has done nothing. Its failure to produce a national energy policy that seriously addresses Australia's growing oil import dependency is leaving Australia increasingly exposed to external shocks, such as the war in Iraq, and motorists are increasingly exposed to higher petrol prices.</para><para>So far the only initiative the Howard government has taken is a token offering to the big oil companies to encourage more deepwater oil exploration. This is at a time when they have every incentive to explore and when oil prices are through $US42 a barrel. A Labor government will take the many steps that are needed to diversify the transport fuel mix and provide a buffer for Australian consumers and industry against global oil price shocks. This means doing more to promote biofuels, natural gas, LPG, CNG and synthetic fuels produced from technologies like coal-to-liquids and gas-to-liquids. All these fuels have environmental benefits as well.</para><para>Australia has an abundance of coal and natural gas and should be adding value to them, but the Howard government's only approach to energy policy is to export as much LNG as possible, even if the sale price undermines Australia's long-term interests. Even worse, the Prime Minister is now pretending to sell Australia's endowment of natural gas. Last week he told the parliament that he planned to visit California this week to lobby for a project which he hoped would result in the sale of $15 billion worth of Western Australian natural gas to the southern Californian market. Opening up new markets for Australia is a good thing, but there are a number of questions the Prime Minister must answer to convince the electorate that his meeting with the Governor is no more than a photo opportunity: (1) where will the gas come from, (2) where did the $15 billion figure come from, (3) what opportunities were other companies with gas interests in Australia given to put their case to build a receival terminal off the US west coast, and (4) given BHP has few gas interests in Australia, what guarantees has the government secured that any gas processed through BHP's facility will be Australian gas?</para><para>BHP has three gas interests in Australia. It has a one-sixth interest in the North West Shelf project and part ownership of the Scarborough and Scott Reef-Brecknock fields. The North West Shelf project is not marketing LNG to the US west coast. The Scarborough field is in deep water and distant from shore, 270 kilometres north-west of Onslow, off the Western Australian coast, and it is at such an early stage of appraisal that it is more than a decade away from development. The Scott Reef-Brecknock fields are also a long way offshore, some 350 kilometres north of Broome, and a long time from development. </para><para>The only two projects currently marketing gas to the US west coast are the Gorgon and Sunrise ventures, neither of which has any BHP equity. What lobbying is the Prime Minister doing on behalf of these Australian gas projects? It will be first in, best dressed, with respect to a receival terminal off the west coast of the US. There is likely to be only one receival terminal, and that factor of course will render the receival terminal that is eventually successful a monopoly project.</para><para>I just want to reinforce some of these points. The Howard government has had almost nine years to develop an energy policy in this country. This means not just dealing with electricity, gas and cleaner diesel fuels, as are addressed in this legislation, but taking an integrated national approach to energy policy, dealing with all the issues from upstream offshore oil and gas, right down through value-adding processing plants, through to transport fuels, right down to demand-side participation in our households and of course, along the way, reforms in the electricity and gas markets. We have seen very little of this.</para><para>We have seen the Parer report, which goes some way to addressing electricity and gas issues, but the government has moved on none of its recommendations. We have certainly seen no response from the government to the Productivity Commission's review of gas, the gas pipeline issue, access arrangements et cetera. Again today we see the Prime Minister rolling out, as his answer to an energy policy, going to see the Governor of California to talk about a receival terminal being proposed by just one company.</para><para>The House needs to be reminded that there are at least four companies vying to do the very same thing off the coast of California. It is right for us to ask the question: what opportunity have these other companies been given to secure Australian government support for their proposals? The Prime Minister might want to argue that BHP is an Australian company. That is a debatable point these days, and I would support that argument, but the Prime Minister has given the Australian community the impression that he is going to talk about a natural gas contract.</para><para>BHP does not have any gas in Australia—or certainly no fields in Australia that are currently being developed, outside its one-sixth interest in the North West Shelf project. As most members of the House would be aware, the North West Shelf project is pretty much committed, at least until a fifth train can be built, and that will be many years off indeed. By contrast, ChevronTexaco and Shell are partners in the Gorgon field—the field most likely to be the next big gas field developed off the coast of Australia. If ChevronTexaco and Shell, for example, were to secure a receival terminal off the coast of California, then they would be well placed to argue that they were in a position, in the medium term at least, to provide Australian gas out of Gorgon into that receival terminal and into California's huge energy market. But BHP cannot make any such claim. It does not have access to any gas. It does have an interest, as I said, in some fields well off the Western Australian coast, but they are at least a decade off development. So, if BHP secures the right to construct a receival terminal off the West Coast of the USA, how do we know that that gas will come from Australia? It is just as likely that that gas could come from other nation states. </para><para>But these are the questions that John Howard, the Prime Minister, is not able to answer. When asked yesterday, at a press conference before he left Australia, where the gas was coming from, he scratched his forehead and gave the wrong answer. He said that it was coming from BHP's existing fields. It cannot be coming from BHP's existing fields, and it was apparent from the look on the Prime Minister's face and the little scratch of the forehead that he had no idea what the proposal actually entailed. I saw him stumble again in a press conference held somewhere on the west coast of the United States, some time in the course of the last few hours. It seems that between his mistake yesterday and his press conference today he still has not been able to work out what in fact he has gone to California to do. These are the questions that the Prime Minister needs to answer.</para><para>I was having a look yesterday at a glossy BHP document which was designed for the consumption of US and, in particular, Californian residents. The glossy document showcased the receival terminal that BHP would build off the west coast of the US. Nowhere in that document was there any suggestion that the gas would be sourced from Australia. Indeed, nowhere in that document was there any indication of where that gas would come from.</para><para>These are important fuel measures that we are considering within the terms of these bills tonight—better late than never—but they are just one small piece of a wider jigsaw. You cannot just talk about clean diesel fuels; you also have to look at refining issues. You have to look at the retail petrol market and the wholesale market. You have to have a look at electricity and gas, and you cannot just be flogging LNG at every opportunity at bargain basement prices without some plan and some idea about what Australia's own medium- to long-term needs for fuels in this country will be. We do not have an energy policy in this country. We certainly do not have an integrated energy policy. We do not know where we are going, and it is about time the government put in place a plan to give some direction, because if they do not do it soon they will miss their opportunity—after 8½ years—and Labor will certainly do it for them.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>29941</page.no><name role="metadata">Ripoll, Bernie, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RIPOLL</name><name.id>83E</name.id><electorate>Oxley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Tonight we are debating two bills: the <inline ref="R2022">Excise Tariff Amendment (Fuels) Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2019">Customs Tariff Amendment (Fuels) Bill 2004</inline>. In brief, these bills propose changes to existing legislation in three key areas: one is the creation of a new customs and excise duty rate for ultra low sulfur diesel and high sulfur diesel, another is increasing the rate of both customs and excise duties on aviation fuels and, thirdly, these bills impose both customs and excise duties on biodiesel at the normal rate for ultra low sulfur diesel—that is, at 38.143c per litre. </para></talk.start><para>I would like to address each of these issues in turn. The first is the creation of a new customs and excise duty rate for ultra low sulfur diesel and high sulfur diesel. These changes impose both customs and excise duties of 1c per litre for high sulfur diesel on top of the normal rate from 1 July 2003 and 2c per litre from 1 January 2004. These duty rates were first announced by the Prime Minister on 31 May 1999 in the Measures for a Better Environment package. The new duty rates will give effect to the government's decision to encourage the early introduction of ultra low sulfur diesel, which will be mandated on 1 January 2006 under the Fuel Quality Standards Act 2000. </para><para>Labor supports the initiatives to encourage cleaner fuels, there is no doubt of that; and we heard from the member for Hunter, the shadow minister in this portfolio area, about the importance of certain initiatives and about some of the things that the government should be doing. These initiatives are important; however, it is also worth noting that introduction of the ultra low sulfur diesel alone is not sufficient to achieve these results. The government must do more. It must actually have a full strategy and a full plan. As we heard from the member for Hunter, it has been a wasted opportunity of eight years—and it is not an uncommon story in this parliament that things that could have been done have not been done. Australia does not have an energy policy in terms of a national strategy, and it is something that I think is absolutely necessary and that Labor will take on in office. Other measures in this legislation include certain engine technology that is needed to achieve more satisfactory results.</para><para>It should also be noted that the timing of the introduction of these measures is interesting. It has taken well over 12 months for the government to introduce these bills. Again it is an example of wasted opportunities in terms of the government not acting and not taking advantage of the time when it is necessary but instead waiting for political opportunity and political timing to get to the point of introducing legislation. There is a raft of evidence—not just in terms of these bills—of the government acting this way in a range of areas.</para><para>The second issue that I want to go into is the increases in the rate of both the customs and excise duties on aviation fuels by 0.306c per litre. This measure was announced in the 2003-04 federal budget on 13 May 2003. The increased duty rate on aviation fuels is being collected to provide supplementary funding for the Civil Aviation Safety Authority to ensure it is adequately resourced so that it can continue to carry out its safety regulatory responsibilities. The rate takes effect from 1 July 2003.</para><para>The third issue is the imposition of both customs and excise duties on biodiesel at the normal rate for ultra low sulfur diesel—that is, 38.143c per litre. This measure was also announced in the 2003-04 budget and forms part of the fuel tax reform arrangements to bring all currently untaxed fuels used in internal combustion engines into the excise and customs duty system. Both biodiesel and biodiesel-diesel blends will be taxed. Labor has previously indicated support for these arrangements, which in general encourage the introduction of cleaner fuels, particularly cleaner diesel. This should not be underestimated in terms of its impact and it is something that Labor recognises.</para><para>Some related bills have already been passed. For example, we have had the energy grants bills. These bills require early passage to implement administrative arrangements that should have been in place almost a year ago. The amendments proposed in relation to the diesel fuel excise and customs duty are designed to encourage production and use of environmentally friendly diesel fuels. This is important in order to encourage the right types of developments, technology, research and usage in this country, and it should form part of a broader national strategy. This is a key opportunity for government to act. This is where the government has the power at a national level to put in place the sorts of mechanisms that industries look towards and need. Again, I believe that this has been a wasted opportunity—eight years of wasted opportunity—for the government. This is something that Labor will deal with. This is an important issue and something that I am personally committed to. </para><para>These environmentally friendly diesel fuels are not just important for Australia; it really is an international issue and something that we as a nation should be taking a lead in and not just following. Whether the proposals can unfold to their full potential in the short term is yet to be seen. It seems that engine technology, especially catalytic converters, are necessary to actually achieve a reduction in harmful emissions—which is the primary goal of the policy.</para><para>The amendments in relation to aviation fuels are proposed to raise funds for CASA. However, the government has already foreshadowed in the explanatory memorandum that:</para><quote><para>The revenue from aviation fuel duty is estimated to be 11% lower than forecast as a consequence of cessation of Ansett operations, world-wide reduction in air travel demand and introduction of larger, more fuel-efficient aircraft.</para></quote><para>I suppose the latter part of that is actually a good thing—although there is going to be less revenue than was forecast. Certainly the introduction of larger, more fuel efficient aircraft and, I suppose, the reduction of air travel demand, are good; although I do not think that the reduction in air travel demand will last for too long. It is certainly not good that Ansett ceased to exist, but that is another debate for another time.</para><para>The amendments making biodiesel excisable are the result of the government's plan to create a homogenous excise system as suggested by the fuel taxation inquiry. The introduction of the EDR corresponds with the introduction of the Energy Grants Cleaner Fuels Scheme and should result in a zero excise rate for those qualifying for a grant. These sorts of bills give rise to the opportunity to talk not only about the specifics within these bills but also to look at the ancillary effects and the broader effects they will have. They also give rise to the issue—as has been stated clearly before—of the need for a national energy strategy. That is something that this nation can look toward as a plan for the future.</para><para>We in this place are often criticised—and I think rightly so—by people in the community who say that governments pass legislation or have policy to get them through to the next election. I think that sometimes is a fair criticism. We should be in here working as hard as we can to make sure we have long-term plans and strategies in place for the future, not just for the next election. Issues arising out of fuel—not just fuel excise, but refining issues; the reforms needed in the electricity industry; gas; liquefied natural gas, LNG; the way that the markets operate and a whole raft of issues that are intertwined into this kind of legislation—are, I think, essential in the debate.</para><para>I have spoken on a number of occasions about the market power of the major oil companies and the large corporates and also about the large retailers and the way they operate within the market. It is a matter of debate as to what should take place, but I think it is clear that there needs to be market control. There need to be mechanisms by which government has some enforceable power over predatory pricing policies within the oil industry and the market power of the major oil companies and retailers. This is an issue that was raised by the Leader of the Opposition, Mark Latham, in his address-in-reply speech to the budget, where he specifically referred to section 46 of the Trade Practices Act deals with issues of market power and market power abuse. I think this is critical and should form part of the thinking of government in coming to terms with how we deal with these bills and these issues.</para><para>The ACCC does have power to act in this area. I made some comments earlier this week in the parliament about my views, and I have written to the head of the ACCC to seek some guidance and advice on what the ACCC believes to be the case with market power of, particularly, the major retailers, Woolworths and Coles, and their association with the major oil companies. Certainly when talking about this, the shopper docket schemes come up. This has been a case of some investigation by the ACCC, who have determined that that in itself does not form anticompetitive behaviour. </para><para>The great concern I have is that, if we do not act in some way and look at curtailing the market power of the major oil companies, in the future there will be a time when the small independent fuel suppliers, the service stations and those related to that industry will simply close their doors because they will not be able to compete. It is a pretty simple equation if you look at what is going on. If you talk to the independent retailers and the suppliers, they will tell you that they cannot purchase fuel for a cheaper price than the majors sell it for at the bowser. You do not have to be a genius in business or mathematics to quickly work out that, if your competitor can sell it cheaper than you can buy it, sooner or later you are going to go out of business.</para><para>If this government is serious about supporting small business—if it wants to back its own rhetoric—and helping people, it ought to look closely at the market power of the big majors and how they are driving the smaller players out of the industry. I certainly believe that section 46 of the Trade Practices Act needs to be reformed to put a stronger emphasis on protecting small business from predatory companies, from predatory pricing policies and from abusive market power.</para><para>As I said, this government has had eight years to do something on fuel excise and a national energy strategy, and in real terms has done nothing. The government should not waste any more time. It should look at putting forward some legislation in the few months we have left before an election to try to make good some of its promises not only to small buiness but also to consumers. The government is quite prepared to take the credit when the prices are low, whether you compare it to international prices or local prices—and my view is that it is okay for the government to do that—but, on the other side of the coin, when prices are high it has to take responsibility. It cannot merely accept the credit when prices are low and push away the responsibility when prices are high—and this is something that we are seeing at the moment. Just as the government claims to be responsible when the prices are low, it is responsible when prices are too high.</para><para>Prices are too high for a number of reasons. Some may be out of the government's control—as it always says—but there is still some responsibility there. I will not get into the detail of why prices are high, because when people in the street go to the bowser they know why the prices are high: they are high because of the war in Iraq which has destabilised international markets and the fuel industry, causing the price of a barrel of oil to rise. There is no question about that; no-one can actually question that. Another reason is government policy. There is no question that government policy affects fuel prices. The government is always prepared to say that it is government policy when fuel prices are low—and I say okay, that is fine—but, when they are high, it has to be taken back the other way. The government is never prepared to do that; it is always prepared to push it away onto somebody else.</para><para>In summing up, these bills do a number of things that need to be done with fuel excise and customs. The government has certainly squandered eight years of opportunity to do something about a national energy policy. This is not a small issue; this is a big issue, a key area for this country and for the world. But we are just going to have to wait—hopefully not too long—for somebody to have the guts to get out there and do something about a comprehensive national energy strategy that not only deals with fuels and biodiesels but also looks at a whole raft of reforms and industries, not only LNG and gas but also LPG, and to look at trying to give direction to this country on fuel and fuel use in this country. This will certainly be the case under Labor. We have made our commitments clear, and I will certainly be continuing my campaign in making sure that we deal with these matters. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>29945</page.no><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SLIPPER</name><name.id>0V5</name.id><electorate>Fisher</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The government would like to thank those honourable members who have contributed to the debate on the <inline ref="R2022">Excise Tariff Amendment (Fuels) Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2019">Customs Tariff Amendment (Fuels) Bill 2004</inline>. It was interesting to listen to the contribution made by the honourable member for Oxley, who has now left the chamber. He spoke about the importance of small business. The coalition are the parties of small business. We strongly support small business; we make no apology for the fact that we recognise that small business is the engine room of the Australian economy.</para></talk.start><para>Quite frankly, if the member for Oxley was in any way, shape or form wanting to be sincere about the importance of small business, he would be encouraging his colleagues to pass the unfair dismissals legislation, which has been rejected by the Labor Party on so many occasions. That continuing rejection prevents people from getting jobs, and in fact has denied some 50,000 people nationally the opportunity of obtaining employment. I think that people get sick and tired of hearing members like the member for Oxley bleat on about small business. Small business is very important; the government recognises that but, unfortunately, the Australian Labor Party does not share our concern for that very important sector of the Australian community.</para><para>The amendments contained in the bills have previously been tabled as excise tariff proposals. The proposals now require incorporation in the Excise Tariff Act. The bill contains three government initiatives: the introduction of excise differentials between diesel with high sulfur content and ultra low sulfur diesel; an increase in excise duty rates for aviation fuels; and the imposition of an excise duty on biodiesel. The excise differential for high sulfur and ultra low sulfur diesel is part of the Measures for a Better Environment package introduced by the government to encourage production and use of cleaner fuels. I was pleased to hear the member for Oxley say that there are some very important initiatives in these bills, and the government certainly agrees with him on that particular point.</para><para>The production costs for ultra low sulfur diesel are higher than for high sulfur diesel. Without the differential, ultra low sulfur diesel would be uncompetitive in the marketplace, as users generally regard high and ultra low sulfur diesel as interchangeable and would not be prepared to incur the additional cost of ultra low sulfur diesel. The imposition of an excise differential is intended to even up the price between high sulfur diesel and ultra low sulfur diesel and reduce the price disincentive for the production of ultra low sulfur diesel. The bill amends the Excise Tariff Act to incorporate the excise differentials for high sulfur diesel and similar products with high sulfur content that may be used as diesel substitutes. </para><para>An increase in duty on aviation fuels is required to provide supplementary funding for the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. Duties on aviation fuels provide a substantial proportion of funding for CASA, which is estimated to receive 11 per cent less than the forecasted revenue due to reduced worldwide demand for air travel, cessation of Ansett operations and the introduction of larger and more fuel-efficient aircraft. The increase in duties will ensure that CASA is adequately resourced to continue its safety regulatory responsibilities and maintain Australia's enviable aviation safety record.</para><para>The imposition of excise duty on biodiesel was announced by the government in the 2003-04 federal budget—an excellent document, if I might say so myself—as part of the government's broader fuel tax reform arrangements that bring all currently untaxed fuels into the excise and customs duty systems. The reform establishes a broad, sustainable taxation framework providing increased certainty for investors, as well as establishing a fairer and more transparent fuel excise system with improved competitive neutrality between fuels.</para><para>You would recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, that on 16 December last year the Prime Minister announced the final excise duty rates for fuels. Biodiesel will receive a discount of 50 per cent on the usual excise rate. This discount was set having regard to a range of industry, regional and other factors. Grants are provided under the Energy Grants Cleaner Fuels Scheme for the production of biodiesel fuels and biodiesel fuel blends. These grants will offset the excise duty, effectively providing an excise-free rate for biodiesel until 1 July 2011. After that date, the grants will be reduced by five even annual instalments until the final excise duty rate for biodiesel, 19.1c per litre—half the rate applying to conventional fuels—will be reached by 1 July 2015. Grants are similarly provided for imported biodiesel to offset customs duty. Complementary changes to the customs legislation are being addressed through the <inline ref="R2019">Customs Tariff Amendment (Fuels) Bill 2004</inline>.</para><para>Before I conclude though, I would like to touch on a couple of the matters mentioned by honourable members. The member for Hunter claimed that the government was lacking an energy policy. He made his comments in the context of the Prime Minister's visit to the United States and liquefied natural gas matters. I want to point out to the member for Hunter and to the member for Oxley, who also claimed that the government did not have an energy policy, that the Prime Minister has indicated that energy policy is a government priority and that he will be making a statement. I suggest that both honourable members examine that policy when released. They will find that the government is paying much greater attention to these matters than either of those members has expected.</para><para>The government does place a very high level of importance on the issue of energy policy—we are not going to apologise for that, and I think it is rather unfortunate that some persons in this place choose to assert propositions to the contrary, which could have the effect of misleading the Australian people. There was also comment in the debate on petrol prices and why they are so high. Let us just have a reality check. Members opposite should go out and take a cold shower and look at what the facts actually are. Of course nobody likes to pay higher fuel prices at the bowser or anywhere else, but we have to look at the reality of the situation. Australia enjoys the third lowest petrol and diesel prices among the 27 OECD economies surveyed by the International Energy Agency. Most people in the community understand that petrol prices in Australia are closely linked to international prices because domestic petrol producers have the option of exporting their product at world prices or selling it locally. Moreover, Australian refineries import over 60 per cent of their crude oil and other refinery feed stocks. Retail prices have risen as a result of rising prices for crude oil. </para><para>In November 2002, the average price of West Texas Intermediate, an international benchmark crude oil, was around $US26 a barrel. The price has risen to a high of over $US40 a barrel in May this year. Market analysts attribute the most recent rise in prices to concerns about hostilities in Iraq and the higher demand for petrol in China which has resulted in a general shortage of petrol in the Asia-Pacific region, including Australia. In response to community concerns over high fuel prices, the government reduced fuel excise by 1.5c a litre on 2 March 2001 and has abolished the half-yearly indexation of fuel excise introduced by the previous Labor government in 1983. Had these important initiatives not been taken, fuel prices in Australia would be much higher than they currently are. In other words, had the Labor Party policy been allowed to continue to be implemented, petrol prices and fuel prices generally would be much higher than they currently are. People ought to recognise that it was this government that had the courage to remove the half-yearly indexation of fuel excise and reduce fuel excise by 1.5c a litre on 2 March 2001.</para><para>I would also like to reassure anyone who is listening and, in particular, members of the opposition, that the ACCC continues to monitor fuel prices to ensure that this excise cut is passed on in full to motorists. The ACCC recently released its report detailing reasons for its decisions in relation to petrol discounting schemes and related arrangements.</para><para>It also ought to be recognised and noted that the Treasurer said on 17 May this year that the rising oil price has got nothing to do with a government policy or a tax. Nothing has changed in relation to taxation arrangements except that we cut the excise three years ago and it has not risen since. This is an international development and the current situation is caused by world international oil market prices. The member for Oxley claimed that the government should in some way, shape or form, take the blame for rising fuel prices. As I have indicated, the situation is related to the world situation.</para><para>The member for Hunter also claimed that there was some uncertainty for industry and consumers on standards. I want to put the record straight, in conclusion, by stating that the timely passage of these bills provides certainty, not uncertainty. It was the Howard government that put in place the Fuel Quality Standards Act 2000, under which a standard for diesel has been made. After 1 January 2006, diesel with sulfur content greater than 50 ppm will no longer be allowed to be sold. The excise penalty on such high sulfur diesel contained in this bill encourages early introduction of ultra low sulfur diesel.</para><para>Both of these bills are very important. I do recognise that members opposite see that much of what is included in these bills is very important. We do reject the party political criticism that has been extended in our direction by honourable members opposite. I take this opportunity to commend both bills to the chamber.</para><para>Question agreed to. </para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>29947</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Mr SLIPPER (Fisher—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration) (6.41 p.m.)—by leave—I move: </para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a third time.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a third time.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT (FUELS) BILL 2004</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>29948</page.no><id.no>R2019</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>29948</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 1 April, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ross Cameron</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>29948</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Mr SLIPPER (Fisher—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration) (6.42 p.m.)—by leave—I move:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a third time.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a third time.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>29948</page.no><id.no>R2062</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>29948</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 27 May, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Truss</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>29948</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Gavan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR</name><name.id>WU5</name.id><electorate>Corio</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The opposition will be supporting the passage of the <inline ref="R2062">Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2004</inline> through the parliament. The purpose of the bill is to extend the government's Farm Help program. The bill extends the program to 30 June 2008. The bill also proposes a number of amendments that will tighten the administration of the Farm Help program. These changes to the administration of the program will shift its emphasis from welfare support to structural adjustment. The <inline ref="R2062">Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2004</inline> follows the announcement contained in this year's budget that the program would be extended. The program provides up to 12 months income support at the Newstart allowance rate, a grant for professional advice to assist recipients in making decisions about their future in farming, and funding for re-establishment grants to assist people who have no option but to leave farming.</para></talk.start><para>The bill also introduces a number of administrative changes to the program that flow from a review of its performance and a report from the Australian National Audit Office in 2003. New requirements for income support and re-establishment grants mean that a person will have to undertake financial advice and develop their activity plan prior to receiving income support, except in cases of hardship prior to receiving a re-establishment grant. Farmers are currently required to arrange a financial assessment of their farm businesses within a three-month period. Under the new system, they must undertake the financial assessment of their farm businesses and develop an activity plan before their income support can commence. An approved financial adviser must now assess the farmer's prospects of getting additional finance.</para><para>These changes also provide for this assessment process to be varied for people in severe financial hardship. To qualify for this provision, the liquid assets of a person and their partner at the time of application must not be greater than the total amount of Newstart allowance that would have been payable in the immediately preceding six weeks. Hardship provision recipients will be provided with income support for a period of up to three months, while they undertake their financial assessment and develop their activity plan. Income support will cease if they have not done this within the three-month period. The recipient will then be assessed in order to qualify for the remainder of their income support. </para><para>The proposed changes will also enable reviews to be conducted of re-establishment grant recipients, to determine whether they are complying with their undertakings not to re-enter farming within a five-year period. There is also a provision to terminate Farm Help income support if a person or their partner is in receipt of an exceptional circumstances relief payment. The government is advised that this clause is designed to remove the possibility of a person receiving Farm Help income support and the exceptional circumstances relief payment at the same time. The re-establishment grant will also be increased to $50,000, up from the current $45,000. Labor supports these amendments to the program.</para><para>According to the minister, the underlying basis for these amendments is to shift the focus from providing welfare support to facilitating adjustment. I want to come back to that claim, in the context of the record of this minister in facilitating adjustment in regional economies, but firstly I want to have a look at the minister's management of this particular program. In this year's budget papers expenditure on the Farm Help program for this financial year is estimated at about $15.6 million. In last year's papers, the minister's forecast for projected expenditure in 2003-04 was $24.875 million. He has missed the mark by some $9.2 million—or nearly 60 per cent. The numbers in the budget for this coming financial year are back up to $34.44 million. So we now have a forecast for this coming financial year of more than double the estimated expenditure for 2003-04.</para><para>Through the Senate estimates committee hearings last week, Labor tried to get a fix on why all these forecasts have been so badly wrong. Part of the explanation given by departmental officers was the interaction of Farm Help with a number of other programs, particularly the 2002 sugar package. Members may recall that the 2002 package, the third of four packages put together by the government to carry this key rural industry through to better times, had an income support package with a limited life. When that household support program ended, canegrowers were expected to migrate to the Farm Help program. It is clear that they did not.</para><para>The income support component of the 2004 sugar package will end in March next year, and these budget numbers suggest that Mr Truss, the minister, again expects a large number of canefarmers will be forced onto Farm Help. I would like some advice from the minister on that, please, when he makes the summing up statement in this debate. I would also like some advice from the minister about the impact of income from the sugar package on the ability of canefarmers to access Farm Help—that is, farmers fail income and assets tests for Farm Help because of the assistance provided through the sugar package mark 4.</para><para>It is also important to note that you have to be in a very difficult circumstance to access Farm Help. Farmers must find themselves in the position where the banks are refusing to lend them money against their assets. If the minister's numbers for 2004-05 do turn out to be accurate, then there are certainly a lot of farmers out there who the minister expects to be facing very tough times indeed in the coming year.</para><para>The Farm Help program is a component of the Agriculture Advancing Australia package. This package has been around in various forms since 1997. The minister likes to call it his flagship. If you closely examine this particular program, you can get an understanding that this is certainly not a flagship at all. Currently the other components of this package include the Rural Financial Counselling Service, farm management deposits and the Agricultural Development Partnerships program, in addition to Farm Help. </para><para>Before looking at the administration of these programs, I want to make a few comments on the effectiveness of a key part of the Farm Help program—the re-establishment grants. At the end of 12 months, farmers on Farm Help support can seek assistance to leave farming by accessing this particular grant. The grant was originally $45,000. Through this bill, that will be increased to some $50,000, with an assets test applying. These exit grants have been a part of most industry restructuring packages developed by this government. In fact, they are available to qualifying farmers at any time, but the minister likes to add them in to industry support packages for a bit of political padding. In recent times they have proved to be little more than that—these grants are proving to be quite ineffective in assisting people to leave farming—and, therefore, in assisting the process of rural adjustment.</para><para>The 2002 sugar exit package contains such an exit grant. Those canegrowers accessing household assistance through the 2002 package—that is, those farmers able to meet tough income and assets tests—numbered in the order of 1,500 from an industry of some 6,000 farmers. That means that 1,500 growers were facing significant hardship. The minister had allocated some $30 million for exit grants in that package. He expected the number of exits to be 10 per cent of canegrowers—that is, around 600. That was the adjustment he considered was required to put this key sector of the agricultural industry on a long-term sustainable path. The re-establishment grant was the administrative tool he judged most appropriate to deliver that outcome. The result was just 16 exits, not 600. Minister Macdonald conceded in estimates last week that the quantum of the exit payments was based on the existing AAA package. In other words, no real consideration was given to what was required to facilitate adjustment. It was a case of just lifting the old program off the shelf, dusting it off and having another go. Of course, the result we got was no real adjustment at all. This was a real wasted opportunity by the government and by this minister.</para><para>Of course, the failure of the exit grants was not the only problem with this program. The whole 2002 package foundered. Now we have a new package and a new exit provision of up to $100,000 on offer. Again, the minister expects around 600 farmers to leave the sugar industry in 2004-05. Funding for this purpose for the coming year is set at $62.6 million. Around $1.4 million of that money will go in administration costs, including costs incurred by Centrelink.</para><para>I would appreciate some advice from the minister about the assets and income tests that will apply to the exit grants in this latest sugar package. I am also interested in whether the farm and the family house are included in the test and what the threshold number for the value of assets might be. I assume that once the income and assets threshold is reached, the farmer is excluded from accessing these exit grants, rather than there being a reduction in the grant as the value of the assets increase. I am also interested in what assessment has been made of how that test will impact on the access of farmers, particularly those with farms in coastal areas that would be worth a lot of money. All these matters are relevant to the bill, because, depending on the answers, the take-up of Farm Help will be higher or lower than the current forecasts that have been provided.</para><para>As I said earlier, this current sugar package is the fourth since 1998. If anyone wants to look at a monumental failure of government policy in eight years, it has been in the sugar industry. To add insult to injury, not only have they failed with the policy settings they have put in place for this regional industry, which is of such importance to northern New South Wales—including your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley—and to canefarmers in regional communities in Queensland, but in the US free trade agreement they have dropped it clear off the table. If ever there was an insult delivered to an industry, it was that one. If this latest sugar package fails to deliver adjustment, canegrowers and their communities will not be the only ones to suffer. The Australian taxpayer will suffer too, and it will be this minister who will have to be held accountable for the failure of policy in this industry.  </para><para>If you look at the administration of the FarmBis program, you will find a similar sorry story, I am afraid. This program was designed to assist farmers through funding for education, training and skill development. It should be playing a very important role in upgrading farmers' skills, thereby steering them away from the path that would lead to Farm Help. There was significant funding for the program in the 2000-01 budget, but it was not spent. In the 2001-02 budget statement, the minister ripped some $41 million out of FarmBis. He put that money into the Agricultural Development Partnerships program—and I will come to that program in a minute. In the 2002-03 budget statement, the minister ripped another $9.2 million out of the Commonwealth-state component of FarmBis, to prop up funding for the National Food Industry Strategy. In the same year, he took money out of FarmBis again, for a southern bluefin tuna scientific research program. Last year the minister took another $2.5 million out of FarmBis, to fund an aquaculture initiative. In last year's budget, the funding allocation to the states for FarmBis was estimated to be $31.336 million. That number has been revised in this year's papers to $25.688 million. The allocation for next year is down by 50 per cent, to just $12.1 million.</para><para>Given that training is a very important part of improving on-farm productivity, you would have to ask why funding for this particular program has been so badly underspent. You would have to ask why the minister has chosen to raid this program every year to fund other projects, rather than fix it and get the money out to farmers on the ground. The minister always says that it is the fault of the states. That is his standard mantra when it comes to these particular issues. He says that about everything. The reality is that with most programs in this portfolio the problem is more to do with the ability of this minister to properly administer his portfolio. The maladministration of the FarmBis program is one shining example.</para><para>I now want to go to the administration of the government's Agricultural Development Partnerships program. We all know that this particular program was announced with great fanfare by the minister. It was another program that involved the states, and it was primarily designed to assist regional restructuring. But there was no expenditure at all in the program in 2000-01, nor was there any in 2001-02—and the next year again we did not see any expenditure in it. There was an allocation of funds in last year's budget paper of some $2.2 million—that was for 2003-04—and in the additional estimates we saw an increase in that allocation to $7.4 million. But we were told in the latest estimate round that the actual expenditure on this program for this financial year will only be in the order of $670,000—that is, 10 per cent of the funding allocation for this program will actually get off the ground.</para><para>This program has been around for years. It had a budget in the order of $25 million over four years when it was first announced—with, as I said, great fanfare by the minister. Its purpose was to fund, together with the states, regional restructuring initiatives. Now the minister has given up on the program. It is to be wound down and the funds will be used to plug holes elsewhere in the portfolio.

That is not good enough.

Funding for this program was scheduled to end this month. Members might recall that I asked the minister to advise 85 rural counsellors well before the budget whether funding and therefore their jobs were secure. Those representations came to me from farmers and rural communities, as well as the counsellors themselves. That certainty was also important for client farmers, who number on average 9,000 annually. But the minister made them wait until budget night to find out their fate.</para><para>Rural financial counsellors play a vital role in rural Australia, helping farmers, fishing enterprises and small rural businesses that are experiencing financial hardship. They have considerable skills and are well experienced in dealing with financial issues confronting people living in rural and regional areas—be they farmers or fishers. They have played a key role in ensuring many farm enterprises survive the worst drought in 100 years. They deserve certainty in their future employment, rather than being forced to wait until just a few weeks before their contract has ended. </para><para>While the minister could not find $5 million for rural counsellors prior to the budget, he had no trouble finding nearly $6 million for a pre-election advertising campaign. I want the farming community that is out there listening to this debate tonight to understand this fact: when I brought this matter to the government's attention—as did financial counsellors and rural communities—the minister could not find $5 million to fund the Rural Financial Counselling Service, which delivers a very important up-front service to farmers in difficulty at a very important stage in their particular enterprise. But the minister could find $6 million for an advertising campaign. Farmers are paying taxes to have the government line the pockets of advertising executives in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane.</para><para>I think that is an absolute disgrace. It is no wonder, of course, when you get National Party senators locating their offices among the Collins Street farmers. They slip down to the Melbourne Club. The Minister for Science ought not to try to deny this, because I have heard rumours that he is wont to walk the hallowed halls of the Melbourne Club with his brother, who is in the Senate. There they meet many Collins Street farmers—those who structure their taxation affairs as farmers to take advantage of the tax laws by minimising their tax. Of course, the honourable member for Gippsland and his brother from the Senate no doubt meet many Collins Street farmers there where they can chew the fat and pull the woollen shawl over their shoulders while they sit by the fire sipping their champagne and reds.</para><para>But, out in the farming communities, farmers really get upset at that. They get upset at the fact that National Party senators want to rub shoulders with the Collins Street farmers and then line the pockets of advertising executives to the tune of $100 million in advertising expenditure just before an election. Farmers are smarter than that: they do not buy the sort of political cynicism that says that you can create uncertainty in a vital rural program and then at the last minute meet the financial commitment to secure funding for that service and at the same time spend money on advertising like it is going out of style.</para><para>The minister has chosen to focus his efforts and his budget on the government's re-election by launching a taxpayer funded advertising campaign to massage public opinion over natural resource management. This advertising campaign, which involves the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Dr Kemp, is one of 18 campaigns to be run by the Howard government this year as part of its bid for re-election. Of course, the real value of funding to rural counselling services under the stewardship of this minister has continued to decline. It is a warped sense of priorities and the government ought to be condemned for it.</para><para>I want to make one more comment about the administration of this portfolio. There is an increasing concern both internationally and domestically about the administration of the quarantine regime in this country. I know the minister is receiving advice that the test that should be applied is whether or not decisions relating to import risk assessments would offend the WTO. The test is not the science but how the politics of the WTO can be best accommodated. We on this side of the House think that the science should be the test—not the threat of action through the WTO. We think the focus should be on getting the science right and then defending that position in the WTO or elsewhere. This is a very important issue, because if the minister or this government get these decisions wrong then it is certainly going to create an enormous demand for the resources and the programs that are provided in the measures that we are debating here today. As I said, we take issue with the government and with this minister on the administration of this scheme particularly, but we support the fact that it is part of the AAA package and we will support the passage of this legislation through the parliament. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>29954</page.no><name role="metadata">Baldwin, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BALDWIN</name><name.id>LL6</name.id><electorate>Paterson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise today to speak to the <inline ref="R2062">Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2004</inline>. At the outset I want to pay tribute to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry for extending this scheme to help more farmers re-establish themselves in careers off their farms. In my electorate of Paterson, there are patches of farming communities which have over the years adjusted and changed what they farm or how they farm to improve their profits or re-establish themselves. Those who have been able to move with the times, read the writing on the wall and adapt to the changes in their industries have been able to weather the downturns. But there are some who for financial reasons could not adapt to change and these people may one day recognise that farming is not what it used to be.</para></talk.start><para>Last week my office was contacted by a dairy farmer called Brett from Gloucester. Brett's situation could not be any worse than it is today. Brett inherited the family farm from his father two years ago. Brett's father died somewhat early after a fight with cancer and left Brett with a farm and, of course, a mortgage. Struggling to make ends meet, Brett took out a loan from a finance mortgage company. This loan was tracked down and purchased by a person who could only be referred to as an opportunist. I prefer to use the term shark. This loan is now being called in, and Brett simply does not have the money to pay him back. Litigation is currently under way, so I will not go into any further detail on this matter today. But, needless to say, morally it just is not right that a loan company can sell a loan to a person intent on taking advantage of another person's weakened financial state. But selling such a loan is legal, and the situation could have been avoided if Brett had received sounder legal or financial advice on the situation and the style and unsecured nature of this loan.</para><para>Knowing that there is at least one farmer in my electorate who has been targeted because of his weakened financial position post dairy deregulation, in the midst of a major drought and also suffering the loss of the second pair of hands on the farm, makes this bill all the more important to me. Brett's situation paints a clear picture that this government should do all it can to help second-, third- and fourth-generation farmers find a way to earn a living off their farms. Things are different now from how they were 20 years ago, and they are extremely different from how they were 50 years ago. Often it is the philosophies and principles of today's farmers' grandparents which keep farmers on their properties for far too long. The idea that, as long as you have a farm, you will be able to make money is one that is no longer completely true. In Brett's case, Gloucester is currently facing the worst drought for 100 years, let alone 20 to 25 years. I know the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry is concerned that Gloucester is facing a crisis of a significant nature, and he will visit my electorate at the end of this week to meet with farmers to talk about this situation.</para><para>The simple fact is that if the rain does not come for three years in a row the grass does not grow. If there is no fodder for the cattle then the farmers must handfeed with manufactured hay. This drought, on the back of the deregulation of the dairy industry, has created a situation now where some farmers are asking `Why bother?' Some are getting out to ensure that their families have a better lifestyle. Farm Help could be of major benefit to Brett. Grants for legal, accounting and financial advice will help him to make correct decisions which are sound and which ensure that he does not take out another loan from a mortgage finance company—the type of loan that can be sold to opportunistic property developers and unscrupulously called in at a time when Brett can least afford it. </para><para>Retraining for someone like Brett will not be easy. All he has ever known is dairy farming, and he is only 40 years of age. Making a change at this time of his life will be very hard. He would be the first person to walk off the farm. But if he is deemed eligible for the Farm Help Re-establishment Grant he could benefit from up to $50,000 if he chooses to sell the farm and retrain in another field. As the minister rightly said in his second reading speech, a key component of this act is to refocus on adjustment, not welfare. It is appropriate that farmers have an obligation, when they receive assistance from the government, to undertake training or obtain advice which will prevent them from falling into a financial quagmire down the track.</para><para>The second provision is for people in severe financial hardship. Three months of financial support at the Newstart rate is paid to ensure that farmers do not have to truncate parts of the farm to pay for the everyday living expenses that they incur. They are given three months of Newstart and during that time they are expected to put together a financial plan which sets them on a path to self-sustainability again. The ongoing assessment of farmers in receipt of Newstart, to ensure that they are making plans which are sustainable, is also part of the scheme. This ongoing review is part of the mutual obligation component of receiving government assistance.</para><para>Extending the provisions of this bill through to 30 June 2008 recognises that, even apart from structural changes which governments introduce and implement over the next four years, farmers faced with natural disasters such as drought, fire and flood can access professional advice on what to do. This bill recognises that farmers who are making money today may not necessarily make money in a year or two years, and therefore an exit strategy should be there as an insurance policy for future natural disasters.</para><para>I have spoken about one farmer in the Gloucester district who has suffered a great deal due to the ongoing drought, low milk prices, a fallout from the deregulation of the dairy industry and the mercenary attitude of one local businessman. But there are many farmers in the Gloucester district who have not had the rain, their pastures are not producing enough fodder, and now they need assistance. Gloucester has suffered a comedy of errors. When the first application was submitted by the New South Wales government, this drought affected community was included with the Maitland City Council, which had received rainfall when Gloucester had not.</para><para>The second application, similarly, included areas which had received rainfall. The Gloucester Rural Lands Protection Board pulled out of that application. Instead, they worked with the New South Wales government to submit an application as a single shire or entity. This last application was found ineligible for assistance in April. The short story about Gloucester is that in every way they meet the hardship criteria to be deemed eligible for exceptional circumstances, but the problem is proving it. Their rain gauges are in the wrong location. In the first instance, they are outside the assessable area, in areas of high rainfall. Rain gauges have to be recognised by the Bureau of Meteorology, and there is only one rain gauge in the Gloucester application area that is recognised by the bureau. The others are outside the area. </para><para>In the second instance, Gloucester was measured for EC on a model that would be of use to Scone or Tamworth, but not Kempsey. So what is the difference? Kempsey needs more rain more often, as Gloucester does. Kempsey and Gloucester are similar types of areas. But Scone is a more arid area and can thrive on less rain than Gloucester. It pains me to stand up and criticise my own government's methods of determining hardship, but I will do it because I believe my constituents are in genuine hardship.</para><para>In this process, a local area must submit their application for assistance through the state government. We have to ask why. I understand that a shire or two shires may band together and prepare an application for exceptional circumstances, but surely there is no need for this application to be prepared by a state government. In the case of Gloucester, their application took 18 months—a good 12 months longer than it should have taken—to get the final answer. And, for expediency, the state department of agriculture combined Gloucester with two other areas nearby which had received regular rainfall. A system of Rural Lands Protection Boards has been established throughout Australia, and these boards have enough knowledge and expertise to put together an application for exceptional circumstances. They should be allowed to do this directly rather than by working through another layer of bureaucracy.</para><para>The other issue that I believe needs correcting is the need for an appeal process on the final application. In every other welfare scheme applicants have the option of taking their application to an appeals tribunal or panel to ensure that their particular circumstances are factored into their eligibility assessment. In the case of Gloucester, the positioning of the rain gauges has prejudiced the decision on their application against them. Gloucester being compared with Scone rather than Kempsey has prejudiced the decision. There must be an appeal process where Gloucester can argue the case of this hardship. Exceptional circumstances is about recognising that from time to time farmers face conditions which are extraordinary and prevent them from doing business. In the case of Gloucester, they have had as little rain as they have had in 100 years. There is no pasture to feed the herds and they are struggling to make ends meet. But, because the evidence presented on their behalf by the state government is flawed and not relevant to their particular situation, Gloucester has not been deemed eligible for EC status.</para><para>I have risen to speak on the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2004, and I support measures which assist farmers to become more business savvy and aware of other options when farming becomes unprofitable for them. But there are times when we need to keep farmers on their farms and ensure they are able to keep going until the rains come again. I would hope that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry would look at the way exceptional circumstances assistance is applied for and granted. The lack of an appeals process needs to be looked at and a review of regulations and legislation for this scheme needs to be undertaken. At the moment, it is inefficient, ineffective and, in the case of Gloucester, unfair. As I said, this Friday the minister will be in Gloucester to meet with my farmers. We will put our case on why our farmers need this support. </para><para>It is no joy to read in the paper of family break-ups. It is no joy to read of yet another fatal road accident and have to ask the question: is that road accident an accident or is it suicide? These people are the very core of Australia—the foundation on which our society is built on. I am talking about people that put their backs and shoulders into the land to make it work to feed other Australians. They do what they do not because the money is there; they do what they do because they love the land that they live upon. I feel for a person like Brett, who is a fourth-generation farmer but the generation that has to look at walking off the farm. What will that do for his self-esteem? What will that do for his family's history? I will not let it stop there. We need to fight for the EC funding, and if change needs to be introduced in this House to allow an appeals process so that people can be fairly heard on the facts that pertain to their area then that needs to be done and the government needs to listen to what I have to say. I support my farmers. I will argue their case every day because I know and I believe they are right.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>29957</page.no><name role="metadata">Hull, Kay, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs HULL</name><name.id>83O</name.id><electorate>Riverina</electorate><party>NATS</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak in support of this government's key program in delivering support to our farm sector, because this support is required to provide short-term income support to our low-income farm families. These are farming families who are experiencing financial hardship and who are unable to borrow further against their assets. This assistance in the form of professional advice will enable our farmers to make informed decisions about their future. An adjustment support assistance package will enable farmers who, through no fault of their own, have to leave the farming industry. It will make that transition that is so difficult that little bit easier on them and their families. In addition, it will enable access to skills retraining for an alternative career because, as the previous member who spoke in this debate has said, many of these people know nothing else but farming the land. Many of them have gone to university to ensure that the farming of their land is done in a more productive and efficient way but, unfortunately, the weather has beaten them. The circumstances are such that they are unable to continue in these areas and they do need alternative careers and advice on other employment opportunities should they choose to exit this industry that they love so much.</para></talk.start><para>The package is tailored to meet the needs of individual farming families, and that is something that I am very grateful for when I speak to many of my Riverina farmers who need various types of assistance. Some of them are in irrigation properties, they are smallholding properties, but the package does reward the farmer with some very good outcomes. Some of them are extraordinarily large properties and broadacre dry land farming properties but, because I have one of those electorates that has a diversity of areas, there is a very strong need for the government to provide individual choices and individual opportunities after the assets of farmers are depleted.</para><para>This program is flexible and, as I said, is currently tailored to meet the needs of each farm family. I am sure that all members are aware that farmers in my electorate and in rural communities throughout Australia have suffered enormously from the effects of this once-in-a-century drought. Life on the land presents many challenges, but this drought has tested many farmers, including many successful farmers, who have been forced to sell their stock, cart their water and watch their crops wither and die. Programs such as the Farm Help program that we have provided are so very important to our producers and also enable sustainability of the rural and regional communities which our farmers live, shop and work in. They are the basis on which schools, banks and a whole host of small businesses who service these farming families survive as well. This gives them an opportunity to have a choice as to how they want to exit the industry, if they need to, with some dignity. </para><para>It is important, particularly during these times in the farming sector, that programs such as Farm Help continue to provide ongoing support to the nation's farmers, and it is great to see this program being extended out until 2008. That is important. We are not nearly through this drought; this drought is going to be ongoing. In my electorate of Riverina, I do not believe that many of my farmers will get to plant their crops. Canola is being considered as one of the more lucrative crops in my electorate, but I am sure that many of my farmers are unable to plant canola for this season. This is coupled with the difficulty farmers had when Shepherds Producers were unfortunately brought to their knees, injuring an enormous number of grain growers in my electorate. Many of them will be looking forward to the extension of this program so that they can have, and retain, dignity in how they can move forward.</para><para>It is very difficult for farmers to move forward. Some of them are frozen in time. They really feel that they cannot make a decision one way or another about whether they should leave, whether they should stay, whether they should invest, whether they should borrow even more money or whether they should deplete their assets even further. It must be the most difficult position in the world.</para><para>Farmers are the backbone of the nation. I think they are the most underestimated and underrated people. My friends in the city think that, if they run out of milk, they can just go to the local Woolworths, Coles or delicatessen, open up the fridge and pull out a carton of milk with no knowledge of what it has taken to ensure that that milk is in that refrigerator for them to access. I sometimes think that maybe we need to have emaciated and naked people walking around before people recognise the great benefits that the farmers of this nation provide not only to this nation but also to the international program.</para><para>As I have said, this program is of significant benefit to farmers in the Riverina. It is a very tough industry, and the financial situation of a farmer and their outlook are dictated by those of us in this House who, like them, rely on the weather in order to determine whether tomorrow you are going to feed your family, educate your family or clothe your family. As I said, farmers are the backbone of the nation and should be treated as such.</para><para>Debate interrupted. </para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>29958</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Jenkins)</inline>—Order!

I am referring to childcare workers—people who many of us leave our children with each day while we go to work; people who earn our trust and, therefore, deserve our respect.</para></talk.start><para>Childcare workers earn some of the lowest wages in the country. In Tasmania the over 1,000 childcare workers earn, on average, $12 to $13 an hour—so there will be no tax cut for them—and yet they have possibly one of the highest levels of responsibility within our community. Childcare workers are developing and educating children in what is recognised now as their most important stage of life: zero to five years. Despite what some people perceive, childcare workers are not babysitters and it is time that they were given the respect, the recognition and, most importantly in this debate, the remuneration that they deserve. The community and this government need to recognise that our perceptions of the work of childcare workers often lag behind the reality of the very complex nature of this industry. </para><para>The demands on the provision of this service have increased exponentially over the last few years. I believe the crisis in the child care industry is in part because the Howard government refuses to fund child-care centres appropriately. In Tasmania, community led organisations still remain the dominant management system in the child care industry, but this is in danger of following the mainland trend if something is not done urgently to rectify the funding predicament within the sector. Profit should not be the driving and motivating factor of child care. It is not fair to expect childcare workers to maintain their level of responsibility to properly mentor, shape and assist in our children's development when we effectively say to them that the work that they do is of no value.</para><para>Childcare workers must complete at the bare minimum a two-year full-time TAFE course. However, many childcare workers have also completed an optional extra year of study for an advanced diploma. There are also many more childcare workers who are actually trained teachers with degrees in early childhood education. These workers are not unskilled labour. They are highly educated and trained professionals who should be treated and paid as such.</para><para>Childcare workers spend a lot of their time planning individual programs for our children so that each child receives the best one-on-one care and attention to ensure that their cognitive and developmental needs are met. They do not spend the day playing in the sandpit or organising drinks. However, these individual programs take time and effort. At the moment, each worker is allowed one hour per week to develop individual plans for all the children in their care. This is on top of the increasing load of other paperwork childcare workers are now expected to complete—an expectation that is not built into any sort of increase in their hours or their remuneration. This extra paperwork is an added responsibility for an already overworked and underpaid industry, where the repercussions can really go in only two ways: an impact on the workers, who already have a massive and growing burnout rate, or an impact on our children.</para><para>The workers at the centre that my children attend are impeccable and my children adore them, but, like other parents, I do not want the childcare workers who work with my children to be so professionally stretched. I also want them to be the same workers day after day. Childcare workers are currently in the process of implementing a new curriculum based on the same curriculum that is being implemented in Tasmanian schools. The work the childcare workers do is as important as that of the teachers in the school system.</para><para>Labor is committed to highlighting the importance of early development and learning, and this is being done through policies like the early reading program. Childcare workers in Tasmania are equally committed to the early development of our children, but they need our support. They need our recognition of the work that they do and they need to be appropriately rewarded for this work. The Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union in Tasmania is currently embarking on a campaign—a campaign shared around the country by the excellent union workers—to highlight the situation of childcare workers. They can start the campaign, but it is up to us as legislators, community members and parents to support the people who support our families. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Bushfires</title><page.no>29960</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>29960</page.no><name role="metadata">Nairn, Gary, MP</name><name role="display">Mr NAIRN</name><name.id>OK6</name.id><electorate>Eden-Monaro</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Last year I chaired the House of Representatives Select Committee on the Recent Australian Bushfires.

It certainly contains a substantial amount of information that came from predominantly volunteers—people who are out there on the ground; people who know their country and know how fire reacts. For a lot of them it was very difficult to give the sort of evidence that they did. They had been through a horrific experience in the 2003 bushfires.</para></talk.start><para>That report is with the government at the moment. I know the government is working on a response in conjunction with a report by a committee set up under the COAG arrangements. I hope that the government comes back to us very shortly with a response to the report, because many people out there on the ground certainly want to see some action in relation to the recommendations that we made. There have been some actions. Particularly New South Wales, Victoria and the ACT have governments that did not oppose our inquiry but certainly did not cooperate with our inquiry in any way and did not allow any of their public servants to appear. I think they have started to make some things happen but in very limited areas and without any recognition of the recommendations made.</para><para>We have seen a bit of a flurry in fuel reduction in a few places, but no overall planning, no long-term planning, for fuel reduction. It is certainly still the case that very little is being done with respect to access to forested areas and fire trails. I was in the Deua National Park—an area that used to be part of the state forest area—in my electorate recently. The original roads there were superbly built. They were built so well that they actually had concrete drop structures and drainage lines. But, since it has become a national park, a lot of these roads have been virtually destroyed. They have gone in there and built huge rollovers and things like that and have totally upset the drainage. You have table drains that were very well built being blocked by these sorts of rollovers to prevent access. Certainly there is no way in the world that you would get fire tankers into that particular national park if a fire broke out. So the things that happened in 2003 could happen again.</para><para>We have heard talk about changing insurance, and I know that the Insurance Council recently have said things similar to what we recommended in our report—that the levy on insurance policies should be dropped in New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania and that it should be applied through the rates system. It is good to see the Insurance Council agreeing with that, and I think in New South Wales the Public Accounts Committee is currently looking at that aspect and is going to report in a couple of weeks. I hope that they also pick up on our report. I doubt that they will make any reference to our report, because once again the New South Wales government wanted to close their eyes to it.</para><para>I want to quickly say a couple of things about the ACT inquiry, the coroner's inquiry, that is still under way. I think most of the evidence coming before that inquiry is in line with the evidence that our committee received. I am very concerned about some of the evidence coming in about the cross-border cooperation—or lack of cooperation—which we highlighted in our report as well. The evidence coming forward calls into question the coroner's report in New South Wales. They actively discouraged people from putting in submissions for the New South Wales coroner's report. The coroner then brought down a finding saying that National Parks and the rural fire service did a great job. That is contrary to all the evidence that we received and it is contrary to the evidence that is coming before the ACT committee. I think there should be virtually an inquiry into that coroner's inquiry in New South Wales, because it would seem to me that there was some interference along the way, because there is no way in the world that you could come down with the recommendations—or lack of recommendations—that that coroner did. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Budget: Carers</title><page.no>29961</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>29961</page.no><name role="metadata">Jackson, Sharryn, MP</name><name role="display">Ms JACKSON</name><name.id>00AN2</name.id><electorate>Hasluck</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Margaret Edgar is 71 years old. She continues to care for her 44-year-old son who has an intellectual disability and epilepsy. Kenneth has limited verbal skills and needs assistance with all areas of his life. Margaret's health is deteriorating—she has heart problems, osteoporosis, anxiety and depression. Kenneth is very demanding and takes up a lot of time and energy. If his mother cannot understand him, he will physically drag her to show her what he wants. She worries about finding supported accommodation for him. She worries about what will happen to him if she is no longer there for him. Caring for Kenneth is heavy work.</para></talk.start><para>Mrs Edgar, one of my constituents, is also one of many thousands of parents and carers in similar situations. In my home state of Western Australia, there are an estimated 300 people with disabilities and their families who are currently unable to access the accommodation support they critically need. According to 2002 estimates by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, there are 21,000 people nationally whose need for supported accommodation has not been met.</para><para>In their recent budget the government claim that they have `recognised the contribution of carers'. They herald their measures, but what is there for Mrs Edgar and carers like her? I note in the budget that the government have set aside $73 million over the next four years for parents over the age of 70 to access four weeks a year of respite care, of which Western Australia will get approximately $2 million—perhaps $3 million. While I am sure that the respite will assist to some degree, it really misses the mark when you consider that 70-year-old parents of severely disabled children are looking for supported accommodation long term, not four weeks respite a year.</para><para>I also note that a $255 million program will give a one-off carer's bonus to eligible carers in June 2004. A parent of a disabled child from my electorate summarised her thoughts on these two budget measures in an email to me shortly after they were announced. This is what she had to say:</para><quote><para>They miss the point, yet again. Ageing carers are looking for accommodation, not 4 weeks respite a year. Over 70s are usually on a low income and cannot afford to have a holiday. They need to know that their child is accommodated in a safe secure place. They need peace of mind not a break.</para></quote><para>It goes on:</para><quote><para>WOW a whole $600 a year, to show how grateful the government is to carers that cant get the Carers payment. This is—</para></quote><para>less than—</para><quote><para>$50 a week, that is a packet of incontinence pads. I'm sure this will win votes. The $255 million would be better spent in urgently needed services.</para></quote><para>By `urgently needed services', the mother goes on to explain, she is talking about funding for supported accommodation. </para><para>The fact is that in Western Australia the state government has recognised the importance of providing assistance to parents of disabled children by addressing the biggest single issue: funding for supported accommodation. The WA government will be allocating 93.5 per cent of the growth funding for supported accommodation and related support services, compared to just a 6.5 per cent contribution by the Howard government. Over the five-year life of the Commonwealth-State-Territories Disability Agreement, the Howard government will provide only $3.4 million growth funding, compared to the WA state government contribution of $49 million. If the Howard government wanted to match the Western Australian government contribution, they would have provided an additional $12.3 million recurrent funding over the next four years just to keep pace with the rate of growth in state funding and the indexation provided.</para><para>How we treat people with disabilities and the people who care for them is important. How governments provide for these people speaks volumes about that government's values and character. Carers face higher costs of living, are underrepresented in education and employment, and face emotional and physical stresses that many of us here cannot even begin to imagine.</para><para>We have an estimated 2.5 million carers in Australia who care for family members or friends with a disability, mental illness or chronic condition or who are frail aged. A conservative estimate of the economic contribution of carers to Australia is that their care saves government $16 billion of expenditure annually. Carers are the major providers of community care services, delivering 74 per cent of all services to people needing care and support. The Home and Community Care program, worth over $800 million nationally, meets only nine per cent of this need.</para><para>Many members in this place endorse the notion of mutual obligation. These figures clearly demonstrate that the Howard government is shirking its responsibilities, free riding on the backs of people like Margaret Edgar. I urge government members to talk with carers, meet with them and listen to them. They do not expect governments to wave a magic wand, nor do they expect an overnight solution. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Parliament: Divisions</title><title>Barker Electorate: Mount Gambier Hospital</title><page.no>29962</page.no></subdebateinfo><title>Barker Electorate: Mount Gambier Hospital</title><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>29962</page.no><name role="metadata">Secker, Patrick, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SECKER</name><name.id>848</name.id><electorate>Barker</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Shortly before 5 p.m. today, a division was called—as you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, because you were in the chair—on a suspension of standing orders.

I was actually promised that it would come through but it still has not. </para><para>I do not want to reflect on the chair; I have a very high respect for the chair and the position of the Speaker. But many people said to me afterwards that a one-minute division was not announced. It was just announced that the bells would ring but not that it would be for one minute. None of us is perfect. These things happen, and I suppose, because of that, I did not note the urgency of the matter. I was certainly unaware of it. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, I think the convention is that, unless a one-minute division is called, it is a division for four minutes. Whilst I do have great respect for the position of Speaker—and also for you, Mr Deputy Speaker—I certainly do not want to reflect on your ruling. Based on what was happening at the time, I do not think that I can argue with your ruling. I note that the member for Mackellar did ask for a recommittal of the vote, for which there are precedents, but that was denied. Because of the respect that I have for the position of Speaker, I remained in my seat as directed, even though I had no wish whatsoever to support this stunt by the Labor Party.</para><para>It was only a procedural motion to suspend standing orders—not a substantive one. It was certainly not a substantive motion on policy. I wish to have it recorded that, like the member for Mackellar, I did not and I do not support these Labor stunts. It may have provided some humour in an otherwise tense chamber, and for this I am sure that we welcome this minor diversion. I have accepted the general ribbing that has happened as a result, but I did want to record the fact that I did not support—even though I am probably down in the voting as supporting it—this stunt. I certainly did not wish to. I could have walked out of the chamber; but again, because of respect for the chair, I did not do that. As I understand it, my vote would have recorded the same way, so I did not know.</para><para>In the brief time I have left, I have another very important issue to raise: the Mount Gambier Hospital issue. The state budget has not increased funding for the Mount Gambier Hospital. It is still at the same funding as it was two years ago, even with extra funding of $10 billion, matched by the state government. With $20 billion extra going into health, that should mean another $1,000 for every man, woman and child in Australia. In Mount Gambier they have not got that extra funding. The local member, Rory McEwen, has been asleep at the wheel, and it is about time this was raised in this forum.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Housing: Public Housing</title><page.no>29963</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>29963</page.no><name role="metadata">Ripoll, Bernie, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RIPOLL</name><name.id>83E</name.id><electorate>Oxley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This evening I would like to talk about access to public housing. This is an issue which is very important for many Australians—not least of all for many people in my electorate of Oxley. Australia currently faces a national housing crisis. There is a very serious shortage of low-cost rental housing in both public and private sectors. In relation to the private sector, housing affordability has been steadily eroding. It is estimated that more than 500,000 private rental households throughout Australia are in what I call `housing stress'—that is, they are paying more than 30 per cent of their income in rent.</para></talk.start><para>In the public sector, public housing waiting lists are growing rapidly. I am very concerned also about the lack of growth in public housing stocks in Queensland, the significant number of people on waiting lists and, of course, the homeless. Funds for public housing have declined rapidly in real terms. In 2003-04 the federal government will contribute just $930 million. This represents a decline in real terms of over $300 million since 1995-96. The federal government's contribution to the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement in 2003-04 is 25 per cent less in real terms than it was in 1995-96. The additions to the public housing stock are barely 5,000 dwellings per year, compared with an estimated 150,000 private sector additions, which has little impact on waiting lists. </para><para>Further, much public housing stock is aged, requiring significant maintenance, substantial replacement or refurbishment. It is evident, therefore, that existing housing policy approaches are patently inadequate. The Howard government has reduced public housing expenditure, transferring those funds to rental assistance. On the surface that might sound okay, because people are getting it through rental assistance, but it causes a range of problems. Increased rent assistance does not increase the supply of affordable housing. The Howard government's rental assistance policy is a dismal failure—leaving many Queenslanders without a roof over their heads. The Howard government has spent more than $3.4 billion in federal government rental assistance payments in Queensland alone, yet housing continues to be unaffordable for thousands of Queenslanders. This money would have been better invested in new public housing construction. Put simply, the Howard government's approach does not provide relief for those families signing up for public housing.</para><para>What Australia needs is a national housing strategy that specifically addresses this problem and restores the commitment to public housing through the Commonwealth State Housing Agreement. What we do not need is the politics of neglect and expulsion that is the Howard government's approach to housing. These are the real objectives upon which Labor are developing a national housing strategy to provide affordable housing for all Australians.</para><para>I would like to commend the Queensland state government for its efforts to address housing issues. The Queensland department of housing, through its community housing service area, works in partnership with not-for-profit organisations and local governments to provide community based solutions to local housing needs. Funds are distributed to organisations to provide crisis, transitional and long-term accommodation; information, advice and advocacy to residential tenants and people in housing need; and, importantly, it provides housing support information and assistance for older people and people with a disability living in their own home or renting privately. But with the Howard government ripping millions of dollars out of Queensland's new housing construction market, it is hard to meet the demand for public housing—an area very much under strain.</para><para>In the minutes I have left, I would also like to put on the record that there is a new public housing development of nine residential units in my old home town of Inala. Inala has come a long way in recent years. The success of Keith Brown Place is a tremendous story. This is a traditional public housing area where the state government has poured a substantial amount of effort in not only to refurbish public housing and make public housing more affordable but also to build new houses and units. State minister for the area, Henry Palaszczuk, councillor for the area, Les Bryant, and I recently opened the new housing development in Inala at Keith Brown Place. It really is a testament to Keith Brown, who has been serving the community in Inala for more than 50 years of his life. He is a great contributor to the community. I was very proud just to participate in and share the wonderful experience of having those nine housing units named after him. It is a true acknowledgment of his success as a community worker and also an acknowledgment of the need for public housing in Queensland. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Robertson Electorate: Ettalong War Widows Guild Club</title><page.no>29965</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>29965</page.no><name role="metadata">Lloyd, Jim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LLOYD</name><name.id>IK6</name.id><electorate>Robertson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish to pay tribute to the Ettalong War Widows Guild Club, which celebrated their 50th anniversary at a luncheon on Monday, 31 May this year—last Monday. It was held at the Ettalong Beach War Memorial Club. Unfortunately, parliament was sitting and I was unable to attend this very important function. The Robertson electorate has a very high population of veterans and war widows, and it is very important that we have community organisations there to support our veterans, their families and the widows of veterans in our community.</para></talk.start><para>The Ettalong War Widows Guild Club was formed in 1954 due to the initiative of Mrs A. L. Watkins, the State President. Mrs Watkins invited Mrs Winifred Hopkins, Mrs Hounsell and Mrs Williams to become foundation president, secretary and treasurer respectively. The meeting was held in the old Army tin hut at Ettalong, the first quarters of the local RSL sub-branch on 24 May 1954 at 8 p.m. and was attended by 16 ladies. The first meeting was held at the home of Mrs Hopkins on Wednesday, 2 June 1954 at 8 p.m. and ladies from the Country Women's Association and representatives from the Ettalong Beach War Memorial Club attended this meeting, and I believe that they have had representatives attending annual general meetings since that date.</para><para>Five years later this small band of ladies purchased a block of land, which was donated to state headquarters, on which Vasey Court was built to house war widows. This property is now owned by Brisbane Water Legacy. The Ettalong Beach War Memorial Club has had a close association with the War Widows Guild since its inception and has been most helpful in providing afternoon tea, a room, equipment and staff to assist them. They certainly appreciate the assistance of the Ettalong Beach War Memorial Club.</para><para>Members of the guild take part in Anzac Day celebrations locally and also the Field of Remembrance held at St Andrew's Cathedral in Sydney, the annual War Widows Walk and the Members Christmas Party. Several members have represented the guild on the state council. Their patron, Mr Bill Hall, had been associated with them since 1971 as secretary-manager of the Ettalong Beach Memorial Club. He became their patron in 1980. After 23 years of loyal support and friendship, Bill passed away in February 2003. Bill Hall was someone I was very proud to be able to call a friend. He was a great veteran and he did a tremendous amount of work for the Ettalong and peninsula community. He has certainly been sadly missed since he passed away just over 12 months ago.</para><para>Mr Ruth Winser is the present patron of the guild. Their president is Mrs Joyce Davis; their vice-presidents are Mrs Gloria Parkes, Mrs Iris Sommerfield and Mrs Doris Wills; their honorary secretary is Mrs Dorothy Beardman; their assistant secretary is Mrs Dorothy Robertson; their honorary treasurer is Mrs Eileen Redrup, OAM; their assistant treasurer is Mrs Muriel Draper; their social secretary—a very important role—is Mrs Beryl South; the assistant social secretary is Mrs Mavis Rasmussan; their publicity officer is Mrs Betty Johnston; their hostess is Mrs Valerie Barnard; and their refreshments committee is Mrs Joy Howell and Mrs Irene White.</para><para>The Ettalong War Widows Guild has provided support and encouragement for war widows for the past 50 years—and, for someone who was born in 1954, this is my entire lifetime. Their role is becoming increasingly important as the years roll past and more and more of our veterans unfortunately pass on, many of whom are survived by their widows. I pay tribute to the Ettalong War Widows Guild for the support and the assistance they provide in our community for the war widows of the Central Coast. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Jenkins)</inline>—Order!

Stage 1 of the proposed Glen Waverley Secondary College facilities redevelopment has been funded to the tune of $7.8 million. The college council has also allocated $1.8 million to the project, which will see the development of a new arts centre, a new library and a language centre. The senior students centre will be expanded and a new two-storey classroom block will be established to house a performing arts centre, an information technology centre and a range of reconceptualised learning spaces. The college community envisages that this redevelopment will place the college at the forefront of innovative curriculum based facilities design. This state school is already a fantastic resource, with over 1,900 students in attendance.</para></talk.start><para>Box Hill Senior Secondary College was allocated $4 million to complete the final stage of its facilities upgrade. The school's arts centre, main building and library will be upgraded over the next 12 months. This is a fantastic, innovative school that has a year 11 and 12 program only. Speaking of Box Hill Senior Secondary College, the Victorian government last week announced that a $1 million school catering specifically for young and upcoming elite tennis players would be built at the college. The school, for students from grades 5 to 9, will run a specialised tennis program, which will feature specialist classrooms, training facilities, tennis courts, flexible relevant curriculum and Internet based online learning for students. The concept of a tennis school for middle-year students expands on a successful sports programs developed already at the college. The college has a fantastic AFL program and a basketball program already in place. These are very innovative ideas.</para><para>The Victorian government has also announced that it will provide $1.2 million to fit out a new dental clinic in Box Hill and around $2 million annually to support its operation. This is a much needed and welcome service, as more than 4,000 people are currently on the Whitehorse Community Health Service dental waiting list. The new Whitehorse clinic will grow from having one dental chair to 10, when it is fully completed. Six of the chairs have been allocated for community and youth dental programs, two have been allocated for the school dental service and two will support undergraduate clinical experience of dental professionals from the University of Melbourne. This is fantastic for students who do not get to have much clinical placement. The clinic will operate on an extended hours basis, increasing significantly the number of hours of care to be provided and reducing waiting times. I want to acknowledge the fantastic efforts of the CEO of the Whitehorse Community Health Service, Andrew Fleming—it is largely because of his efforts that this has happened—and wish him well in his new endeavours. I also want to acknowledge the service's board in making this new dental clinic a reality in Whitehorse. It will greatly reduce the discomfort of many people within my electorate who have been waiting way too long to have their teeth looked at. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>National Community Crime Prevention Program</title><page.no>29968</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>29968</page.no><name role="metadata">Gambaro, Teresa, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GAMBARO</name><name.id>9K6</name.id><electorate>Petrie</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The community response to the government's budget allocation of $20 million for the National Community Crime Prevention Program can be taken as encouraging proof that this program has struck a chord with grassroots Australia and will be embraced positively by the community. The reason for the response is that, undoubtedly, it is seen as a crime prevention campaign that starts in the right place—at the grassroots level in communities themselves. Local grassroots community organisations in my electorate of Petrie are already signalling their approval and support, and they are ringing up to say that they think the program is exactly what is needed to fight crime before it begins. They are also thanking the Australian government for recognising the contribution that their organisations are already making towards the safety and security and the quality of life of the communities they serve.</para></talk.start><para>These organisations are the backbone of this nation. They are volunteer groups who look after the young and the lost, the elderly and the lonely, the vulnerable and the needy, and the hungry, the homeless and the people at the margins of our communities and society. They are worthy organisations, and they are running church welfare groups, our neighbourhood drop-in centres and our parish soup kitchens. They are the local sports groups volunteers who devote their time after work and their weekends to keep young people motivated and out of trouble. They are the caring friends who look after each other's property and the wellbeing of their elderly neighbours who may be living on their own.</para><para>They are organisations like the Red Cross; Neighbourhood Watch; junior soccer, football and swim clubs; and church based organisations like Aspley Care, which operates out of St Dymphna's Catholic Church.

Father Peter Luton of St Dymphna's was one of the first callers I heard from last week when the government's National Community Crime Prevention Program was announced and applications were called for in a series of advertisements in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>. Father Luton personally embodies the qualities and commitments on which the National Community Crime Prevention Program depends and the reason it works. No-one is better placed to understand the grassroots situations that give rise to community crime, petty theft, vandalism and random violence—which this program will tackle—than Father Luton. Parishioners have been inspired and they are channelling all their energies into doing something about looking after others. There are people who are at the fringe, Father Luton says, who do not have food, clothes, shelter or somewhere to sleep. They are people who are most likely to be pushed into crime out of sheer necessity. I am not saying that they are criminals; I am saying that their situation will lead to crime in most cases.</para><para>This is a nation of caring people. The government acknowledges the contribution they make to our communities, and that is why we are making a $20 million investment in the ability to do so. I think this will be a terrific program and I look forward to working with organisations such as the Red Cross, the Rotary Club and other organisations that will make daily phone calls to local elderly residents living alone, to check on their security and safety. I am already continuing to work with these communities to further expand the program. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Indigenous Affairs: Deaths in Custody</title><page.no>29969</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>29969</page.no><name role="metadata">Melham, Daryl, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MELHAM</name><name.id>4T4</name.id><electorate>Banks</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On 2 June 2003 in the House I spoke on the death in custody of an Aboriginal person, Douglas Bruce Scott, that occurred on 5 July 1985.

In his summary, he says:</para></talk.start><quote><para>... due to the lack of information forwarded to them—</para></quote><para>that is, the earlier forensic reporters—</para><motion><para>that “whether the manner of death is suicide or homicide cannot be accurately determined based on the submitted material”. I agree with this and in fact state that it would be wrong to assume that the contents of my report imply or should be used to only consider that this was a homicide. The recommendations of the international report go on to say that there were a number of inconsistencies and observations that raised the possibility that the death may not be suicidal. I agree with that.</para></motion><para>There is a further report from Cyril Wecht of Pennsylvania, dated 20 April 2004. He says:</para><quote><para>It is not possible to anticipate what the condition a body may be in following prolonged burial. If Mr Douglas' body has been well preserved, it could be possible to find evidence of some soft tissue injuries involving the head, face and/or neck that would be more compatible with a homicidal strangulation than a suicidal hanging.</para></quote><para>The widow of Mr Scott is seeking exhumation of the body so that further testing can be done. She has never accepted the original report of the royal commission into the death in custody. She believes that there were other possibilities. She has forwarded extensive material to forensic people around the world and they have submitted reports. Ms Scott has taken her case to the Northern Territory Supreme Court, but she is certainly in need of additional finances and resources to pursue a final investigation into her husband's death. This situation will not go away. On the material placed before them, the forensic reporters did not rule out the possibility that it was other than suicide. I think it is in the interests of justice that Ms Scott be given some assistance. I seek leave to table the two forensic reports that I have referred to. </para><para>Leave granted. </para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4T4</name.id><name role="metadata">Melham, Daryl, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MELHAM</name></talker><para>—I have shown them to my colleague. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></talk.start></continue></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Electrical Safety Switches</title><page.no>29969</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>29969</page.no><name role="metadata">Gash, Joanna, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs GASH</name><name.id>AK6</name.id><electorate>Gilmore</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Several months ago, a man in my constituency died from electrocution while working near a swimming pool at his motel business. He had drilled a hole into a brick wall to gain access to wiring for a job he was doing to relocate a power switch. He was not an electrician but he had called a mate, an electrician, to get the job done. The electrician told him not to do anything until he could get there in a few days, but the tradesman, having confidence in his own abilities, went ahead anyway. After he drilled the hole, he inserted a metal wire probe to latch onto the wiring and to draw it out so that he could make the connection to the installation he was working on. Unfortunately, the wiring harness had perished over time, possibly through acid fumes from the pool chemicals. The live wire had become exposed, and when his metal probe made contact with it the electric flow grounded through his body and he died. His wife and teenage son found him in the evening, his body still smoking. It was estimated that he had been hooked up for about an hour. The man's mate was always on his case about having safety switches installed but, for whatever reason, he never got around to it. Now he never will. </para></talk.start><para>Relatively low voltages can be quite dangerous, and people do not fully appreciate the danger they are placing themselves in when playing with electricity. Often it is a case of good fortune rather than wise management that saves them. Some do not even appreciate how close they have come to being killed. At one milliamp, there is no sensation at all. Between one and eight milliamps, you feel a painless sensation of shock. Between eight and 15 milliamps, it starts to hurt. Between 15 and 20 milliamps, not only does it hurt but you lose muscle control as your body's neurones start to spasm and breathing becomes laboured. At or below 75 milliamps, breathing stops. At 100 milliamps, ventricular fibrillation sets in—the heart is not pumping and is in spasm. At and above 200 milliamps, you suffer severe burns and severe muscular contraction. So severe are these contractions that the chest muscles clamp the heart so tightly it stops altogether, and all this occurs instantly, without warning. It would be quicker and easier to duck a bullet.</para><para>The house magazine of the Occupational Health and Safety Commission reported that, between 1989 and 1992, 122 workers died as a result of electrocution in the course of their duties. The magazine describes an example of what can only be termed a `near miss'. A boilermaker was using an electrical welder in the engine room of a fishing boat when he received an electric shock. The ventilation system in the engine room was not turned on, and the boilermaker was perspiring due to the heat—about 45 degrees Celsius—inside the engine room. The perspiration ran down the boilermaker's arms onto the welding handpiece and made it conductive. I do not have enough time to continue, but I would like to say my thanks to Ian Boyd of Bomaderry for drawing this matter to my attention. Ian, may you never give up your fight to have safety switches become mandatory.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health and Ageing: Aged Care</title><page.no>29970</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>29970</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Gavan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR</name><name.id>WU5</name.id><electorate>Corio</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Recently I participated in a national action day on aged care funding sponsored by St Laurence Community Services at Lara in my electorate of Corio. My congratulations go to the CEO of St Laurence Communities Services, Michelle Plane, the staff of the Lara facility and the board of management for organising the day and for their ongoing activity in bringing this issue before the people of the Geelong region. St Laurence has been at the forefront of such community activity, motivated by a deep concern that chronic underfunding of aged care by the Howard government has, at the local level, put in jeopardy the capacity of not-for-profit providers to continue to provide access to affordable, quality aged care services for low-income residents in my electorate.</para></talk.start><para>Today, I present to the House a petition of 92 signatures from residents concerned about the shortfall in aged care funding. The government will of course argue that its budget announcement washes away its responsibility in this matter. It does not. Throughout 2003, the Howard government has starved providers under the guise of the Hogan review. Having received the report late in 2003, the government failed to act until May 2004, when of course it delivered its pre-election budget. Such cynical manipulation of the aged care funding issue and older Australians is to be condemned.</para><para>Significant elements of what is asked in this petition have not been addressed in the budget announcement, and the funding problems still remain. The Howard government can find $1 billion for a war in Iraq but cannot solve many of these aged care funding issues. It can waste $100 million in pre-election advertising and $200 million on the Pacific solution for refugees—a wasteful one at that—yet it cannot address the needs of older Australians. A government with such a warped sense of priorities simply has to go. I have raised this issue of aged care funding with the minister and on the floor of this House on several occasions. I will continue to do so until justice prevails on this matter and older Australians receive the care, attention and access to affordable aged care that they deserve. </para><para><inline font-style="italic">The petition read as follows—</inline></para><quote><para>To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament:</para><para>The petition of the undersigned shows:</para></quote><para>	concerned Australian citizens point out to the House of Representatives:</para><para>Due the increasing shortfall between the income available to deliver aged and community services and the rising costs of delivering those services, Australia is facing the imminent collapse of the aged and community care system as we know it.</para><quote><para>Your Petitioners therefore ask the House of Representatives to:</para></quote><para>	Replace the current system of indexing pricing in the aged and community care sector with a system which reflects the true increases in the costs of running aged and community care services.</para><para>	Immediately inject $10 per day, per bed to restore the existing viability of residential care services.</para><para>	Provide a 10 per cent increase in the prices paid for community care to ensure viability of these important services, which help keep our elderly and disabled in their own homes.</para><para>from 20 citizens.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Herbert Electorate: Letter from the Leader of the Opposition</title><page.no>29971</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>29971</page.no><name role="metadata">Lindsay, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LINDSAY</name><name.id>HK6</name.id><electorate>Herbert</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Yesterday in my electorate a letter from the Leader of the Opposition was distributed to some of my constituents, and I am alarmed at the inaccuracies that have occurred in the letter that the Leader of the Opposition has allowed to be distributed. In the short time available to me I can pick up on only two inaccuracies. The first one I would like to challenge is the Leader of the Opposition's claim in relation to pneumococcal disease—that is, that 50 babies a year are dying. The National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System reports that there were only five deaths for children under five in 2001, nine in 2002 and 10 in 2003. That is nothing like 50 babies dying each year. I would also be interested, as a member of parliament, to know whether these babies who did in fact die were from the high-risk group—that is, the high-risk group that is being covered by the government in any event.</para></talk.start><para>On the second page of the letter there is reference to better access to education and the Labor Party's `Aim Higher' package. The letter claims that the Labor Party will invest $2.34 billion to rebuild, reform and expand our universities and TAFEs. I am very concerned about that particular claim because it is clearly wrong. The federal Minister for Education, Science and Training, Dr Brendan Nelson, has quite plainly indicated that there are incorrect figures in the Labor Party's policy, resulting in the Labor Party having only about $1.3 billion to invest in higher education. That is a long way short of the $2.34 billion claimed.</para><para>I ask residents in my electorate to challenge the information that is being presented to them and not to just accept it at face value. For example, the claim of `reversing the Howard government's unfair 25 per cent HECS hike' is going to cost the Labor Party budget something like $662 million—and there is little indication from the Labor Party as to how they might fund that particular cost. If the Leader of the Opposition is incapable of making correct statements to the electorate and correctly costing his policies, I ask my electorate to think deeply about how on earth the Leader of the Opposition would be an alternative Prime Minister of this country. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

That $600 is much touted but, for the average family in Throsby that is carrying a debt of $711 under a flawed family payments system, getting $600 will be seen as some small recompense, due to the fact that the system, not the individual, has produced the debt and the system is at fault. Yesterday I mentioned the case of the Gaggins, a small local business concern and by no means wealthy. Mrs Gaggin did everything by the book and found that, because there was some discrepancy between the authority to lodge a late tax return and the processes under Centrelink, her family was in debt to the tune of several thousand dollars. </para><para>So I make the point that getting $600 in your bank account is hardly recompense for a system that is fundamentally flawed. It is a system that has seen 2½ thousand families in my electorate accumulate debt of $6.3 million since the inception of the scheme. So you cannot blame people if they feel that the government gesture of the first one-off payment is somewhat cynical in the lead-up to an impending federal election. Of course, we now know that the second $600 may not reach every family because it has to be offset against the continuing debts that the system throws up. On the evidence we already have about the failure of the system, one in three families—about 600,000 families—has an average debt of $900. The second $600 will be offset against the average debt. A lot of families in my electorate are still carrying debts. So the much touted additional benefit of $1,200 in family payments is illusory for many Australian families because many of them may never see a cent of the second payment, and I think that many will see the first payment as some small admission by the government of the flaws in the system.</para><para>In my view it would have been far better to get the system right. Families need assistance. No-one begrudges them extra financial assistance, but they need it every fortnight and not a one-off payment that looks so much like a cynical gesture just prior to a federal election. As I said, I am worried that a lot of families will find on 1 July that the financial benefits promised and advertised in the media will not materialise. The financial gains claimed in the tables that have appeared in local and national papers are grossly overstated at many different income levels. According to our analysis, the gross overstatement is because the tables of alleged benefits that have been drawn up by the Treasurer comprise components such as the $600 one-off family payment calculated as a weekly benefit whereas we know that it will be not paid on a regular basis but will be there as an offset to any debts in the system. The alleged benefits also include a round of tax cuts that will not be delivered for another year and, very cynically, a component of the super co-contribution. Low-income families—if they can afford to pay it; it has to be a minimum of $1,000—cannot draw on that until retirement.</para><para>The gains that are claimed are much more than will be flowing to the pockets of many families. Take, for example, the typical scenario of a family with two children, one of them under five, that has a single income of $55,000. If they look at the tables in the papers, they will believe that they will be getting $32.88 in the pocket. That is five times the actual weekly cash gain which, according to our estimates, will be $6.92. So I and many other people will be getting a lot of calls in early July because people have genuinely assumed that what has been printed is what they will receive. This can only backfire on the government, because people at least expect their politicians to be telling them the truth. They will be angry if they do not get what those tables show. As I indicated yesterday, 91 per cent of the people I represent are getting no relief from tax cuts, so it is their contribution that is funding the tax cuts.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Gash, Joanna, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs Gash</name></talker><para>—Ninety-one per cent?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>JH5</name.id><name role="metadata">George, Jennie, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GEORGE</name></talker><para>—It is 91 per cent of the people in Throsby. I can give you the figures. Around 8,000 people in my electorate earn more than $52,000 a year and 79,000 earn less than $52,000. So 91 per cent of the people in the electorate of Throsby will not receive one cent in tax cuts in this budget. I have the exact figures. Just under 8,000 constituents in Throsby earn more than $52,000 per year but 79,000 constituents get no tax cuts, and that is 91 per cent of the people I represent. If you go through the list, you will find that the figures are as high as that in many electorates. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Overall in Australia, only four out of five taxpayers will get the benefit of the tax cut. In my electorate, the median weekly individual income is around $300 and the median weekly family income is $859. So you can see why people are going to be very angry—no tax cuts for 91 per cent—and come 1 July they will be looking at the tables, thinking they are going to get $600, without the explanation, of course, that this will be offset against debts in the system.</para><para>Families are struggling, and both sides of the political equation do not begrudge the average family assistance. It is a priority and they need relief because they have been struggling under the highest taxing government of all time. While they have been struggling to make ends meet, the cost of basic services has increased. I am very lucky in Throsby; I have very high rates of bulk-billing. But for those who do not get to see a bulk-billing doctor, the average cost, the last time I looked at the data, is in the vicinity of $13 to $14. Multiply that a couple of times if you have young children and you can see the problems there. Families are struggling under the pressure of child-care costs, which have risen by about 13 per cent in the last year. Education costs are up 7½ per cent. If families are covered by private insurance, we all know that the premiums continue to rise.</para><para>Not only will they find that on 1 July the claimed benefits may not be there, but also during the course of Senate estimates this week we now find that families will be putting in their tax return quickly—and many in my electorate will put in their tax return very quickly because they desperately need the money—and only finding out in the first weeks of September whether or not the system has thrown up debts for them in the family payment system. Here they are, on 1 July they open the paper, they are not getting the money they think they are going to get, they rush to get their tax return in, they get the cheque back, and then in September they may or may not be advised as to whether they now owe the government debts that have accrued under the family payment system. You cannot help but ask whether this is a re-run of the 2001 election when, knowing there would be a revolt from the average Australian family, the government agreed to the waiver of, as I recall, $1,000 and then let the faulty, flawed system continue on accruing debts that had nothing to do with the individuals who, in most cases I have dealt with, notified Centrelink immediately that there had been a variation in their estimated and earned income.</para><para>This week we have also learned from Senate estimates that the government has committed to a massive advertising blitz of $109 million—that is just in advertising placement costs alone, not in the cost of creating the advertising campaigns. I believe there are about 21 campaigns which for many people will rightly be seen as little more than the use of taxpayer funds for the free promotion of the Liberal Party and its policies in the lead-up to a federal election. The Medicare campaign placement cost alone is $15.7 million. How much better would it be to redirect the funds to the provision of free pneumococcal vaccines to all babies, which the government cannot afford to do and has not done but has this largesse of taxpayer funds of $109 million to spend on advertising alone? That advertising blitz of $109 million would provide huge relief for the almost half a million Australians languishing on waiting lists for dental care, many of whom are in my electorate and have waited years to get attention to their basic oral needs. This is a government of wrong priorities. It has a plan for the election but not a plan for the future on key issues of concern to all families. As I understand it, in the next six weeks or so, the Australian population will be flooded with the estimated $6 billion one-off spending payments in the lead-up to an election. </para><para>Well, you can fool some people some of the time, but not all of the people all of the time.<inline> A</inline>s all the polls indicate, when people are asked about their priorities, they see investment in basic essential services like health and education as being much more important than the miserable $4 a week tax cuts that they saw last time, which were quickly squandered by increases in costs. When you look at the huge outlay of $52 billion we wonder how you can afford to do that when you ripped out almost a billion dollars in the last hospital agreements, when you have no plans for mental health, when you have no national dental health care scheme, when you have no plans to prioritise public education, when you have no plans for funding schools on the basis of need and when you have no plan for keeping tertiary education affordable. </para><para>Very significantly, as people would know—my region and the Illawarra region generally now has the highest rate of youth unemployment in New South Wales and the fifth highest rate in Australia—this government has no plan for addressing the critical issue of youth unemployment or indeed the numbers of long-term unemployed, which continue to grow. Those issues—health, education, training, employment, jobs—are fundamental. As I say, the government has a plan for seeing its re-election. It is costing a lot of money to do that. I think the people out there understand that a lot of this money could have been more wisely invested in the important national needs that confront our society. I started by quoting an economist's words that you might have thought were my words. I will quote them again: </para><quote><para>We all know the Treasurer's ninth Budget is cynical and unashamedly partisan. But let's be frank: with an election imminent, what did you expect? </para></quote><para>Those are not my words—although that is certainly a sentiment I agree with—but words from Dr Neil Warren, Associate Professor of Economics at the University of New South Wales. He goes on to describe this year's budget as not only cynically and unashamedly partisan, but one that uses `a truckload of cash to address politically chosen problem areas'. I think it would have been much more prudent for this government to address the real and genuine needs of the people that we represent, to make sure that services are well funded in order to improve their living standards. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>29975</page.no><name role="metadata">Smith, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANTHONY SMITH</name><name.id>00APG</name.id><electorate>Casey</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on <inline ref="R1795">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004</inline> and associated bills and, in doing so, to address some of the important national financial issues in the budget and, more particularly, to take the time to talk about how some of the benefits from this budget and from the government's budget approach over the last eight years are benefiting the electorate of Casey in a number of key areas. But before I do that I would like to briefly respond to the previous speaker, the member for Throsby, who really illustrated the dearth of the Labor Party's approach to the budget. Much of her contribution focused on the $600 family payment which she criticised as being too small, not enough. All her criticisms highlighted the fact that Labor have nothing to say for families. Whether she knows it or not, Labor actually did not have family tax benefits. They did not exist before 1996. She was talking about a $600 increase per child not being enough and she seemed completely ignorant of the fact that the Labor Party are actually going to take it away. That is what her shadow minister has announced. Labor will not commit to keeping the very payment that she is criticising. In the days after the budget, when Labor were scrambling to work out how many families there were in Australia, both the shadow finance minister and the shadow Treasurer confirmed within a week that Labor were looking at taking away that $600 payment over the next two years. </para></talk.start><para><inline font-weight="bold">An opposition member</inline>—That is an overstatement.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00APG</name.id><name role="metadata">Smith, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANTHONY SMITH</name></talker><para>—Does that mean you will take away half of it?

As soon as they get the chance, they will snatch them back.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Dealing with the appropriation bills and debating services and the economic conditions in Australia has to be done in context. That context is that the services that are able to be offered today are far above what could be offered the last time those opposite brought down a budget, when government debt was $96 billion, interest rates were 10½ per cent on mortgages and income taxes were higher right across the board. The opportunities for families and small businesses and the sheer state of the Australian economy and what it provided were far less. If you go through some of the benefits that are now able to be provided in the form of tax cuts and family payments and look through the history of them, you see a focused, disciplined budget and a strong and responsible economic policy.</para><para>For families, the investment of $600 per child and everything that goes with that builds on what has been offered since 1996. As I said earlier, in 1996, prior to our election, we promised the introduction of a family tax initiative. Prior to that, a family tax initiative did not exist; there was no distinction for families. That was delivered in full and on time in January 1997. In 2000, as part of the reform of the tax system, we delivered even more help; we more than doubled it. Family tax benefits A and B were created out of 12 separate payments. The taper rates—which some of those opposite criticise so often—the rate at which assistance payments were lost as household income increased, were reduced, helping growing numbers of families with one partner in the work force. We also introduced an important concept—again, a concept that seems to have eluded the previous speaker—topping up where an underestimate occurs. If a family underestimates their income in a financial year, we top it up. When Labor were last in power, no top-ups existed. You can only assume that, if they are ever in power again, the top-ups that benefit so many families at the moment will, like the $600 per child payment that we have just introduced, be removed.</para><para>Building on these initiatives for families can only occur with the sort of responsible budget policy we have had. Paying off debt—paying off the massive budget deficits that those opposite left us—has provided increased resources. The reductions of interest costs on government debt alone have freed up in the order of $4 billion to $5 billion every year to be spent on the services right across the budget. Eight or nine years ago that $4 billion or $5 billion would have been spent on interest costs servicing that $96 billion debt. Every year, in every budget, that money can now be spent on services in the areas of health, family payments, education and the like.</para><para>Those opposite think that they can criticise the services that are now being provided and try and ignore the fact that they are services they could never provide themselves but could only talk about. Two million families will benefit from the $600 per child benefit that we are providing. In addition, the withdrawal rate between the maximum and base rates of family tax benefit A will be further reduced from 30 per cent to 20 per cent. Families receiving family tax benefit B will benefit from a reduction in the income test withdrawal rate. Women who return to work part time will be big beneficiaries.  </para><para>On top of that, to further help families we are introducing the maternity payment of $3,000 from July, which will rise by $1,000 over the next two years up to $5,000 in July 2008. This will be non means tested to reflect the fact that it is a cost that everyone bears with the birth of a child. Under Labor there were no top-ups in the family tax system. Just as they have done on so many issues since the budget, again yesterday in the House they failed to give an undertaking that top-ups would continue and that families would continue to receive their due entitlements should Labor win the next election. </para><para>That is no small thing for the member for Throsby, who talked about the number of families in her electorate she claimed rely on family tax benefits—family tax benefits that did not exist under Labor. In the order of 480,000 families receive a top-up, so many families in her electorate and those of other members opposite are receiving a top-up where they underestimate their income. It is not something you hear too many of the members opposite talk about, but where an underestimation occurs a top-up is paid. It is a top-up that will not be paid should Labor win the next election. Imagine the situation for families when they actually look at the reality. If they are getting a top-up it will be taken away. They are going to get $600 per child per financial year that will be taken away. And there is a new Medicare safety net that has been introduced and you are going to take that away as well. This might not be widely known by the public, but as the days tick by they will realise that Labor's words do not match the reality of what they are actually pledging.</para><para>Another area of the budget where there is increased assistance is the important area of child care. The budget funds an additional 40,000 places in outside school hours child care and provides for 4,000 more family day care places from July. This is an important service and an important program that this government has dramatically expanded. There are many local schools in my area providing out of hours care programs that very much suit the parents, as you would expect in an outer suburban area where there are long travel times and more often than not both parents are in the work force. Some of those schools that have benefited today are Mooroolbark Primary, Bimbadeen Heights, Lilydale West Primary, Chirnside Park Primary, Pembroke Primary, Ruskin Park Primary and Monbulk Primary. </para><para>Another area in which the budget includes a continuation of important funding that has been able to be maintained is firefighting. Part of my electorate takes in the Dandenong Ranges. For those people who live in fire-prone areas, as some members know, it is a constant struggle to keep the best firefighting capacity available. The Dandenong Ranges were the scene of the Ash Wednesday fires and there have been some dangerous fires within the last decade. The capacity to fight them has increased in recent years with some important aids like helicopters and the sky cranes—<inline font-style="italic">Elvis</inline> and the like. I was pleased to see that in the budget funding has continued for some of those welcome initiatives—$16.5 million will be spent in the coming years by the federal government on the provision of these crucial firefighting aircraft. This funding, in conjunction with expenditure by the Victorian and other state and territory governments, will help fund the leasing of a range of aerial firefighting assets that will be available for use in Victoria and other fire-prone areas of southern Australia.</para><para>In outer suburban and partly rural electorates, roads are of critical importance. The road and transport package in this budget—the $11.4 billion of funding—for the new long-term transport plan known as AusLink is very welcome indeed. With more details to come, AusLink incorporates the national highway system and projects known as the Roads of National Importance and other freight links which are important for our nation over the next decade or so. For outer suburban electorates and electorates like that of my colleague, the member for Kalgoorlie—where there is a high degree of tourism and agribusiness and growing exports—it is not just the roads in the immediate vicinity that are important, it is the national link; it is getting that important produce onto a link, be it road or rail. That long-term plan will have very important national benefits and local benefits as well.  </para><para>At the local level, funding for roads has been massively increased under this government. Roads to Recovery, another program that simply did not exist under Labor, has provided $8.3 million in the shires within my electorate to fix, repair and upgrade 11 critical roads—some of the dangerous roads in the Shire of Yarra Ranges and some more of the congested roads in the Maroondah council area. I would like to take the opportunity to commend both the councils which have responsibility for picking the projects, overseeing them and ensuring that they are completed on time. The councils and the shires of Yarra Ranges and Maroondah have done a great job in ensuring that that program has been a big success. I know from talking with colleagues that it has been a success right across the country. The extension of that project, confirmed again in the budget and worth $1.2 billion nationally between 2005 and 2009, will mean that more roads will be funded to the direct benefit of the people of Casey.</para><para>In the area of schools, over the next four years the Howard government will increase funding by $8 billion to $32 billion in total. It will allocate $6.7 billion to schools and students for 2004-05. That is an increase of about eight per cent over the last year. That is important in providing funding for schools and buildings. In 2004-05, over $2.6 billion is being provided for state schools and students—an increase of 5.4 per cent over the past year. It is an increase since 1996 of 68.7 per cent in funding for state schools and students.</para><para>Another area where there is an important education and training priority is that of apprenticeships and the Jobs Pathway program. When Labor were in government, their entire concentration was on higher education. There was no concentration on apprenticeships or trades and consequently the numbers fell dramatically. That is why this government has had a renewed commitment to apprenticeships and trades. They are a critical jobs pathway for young people who do not want to go to university, and they are also critical for the local economy, which has a shortage of trades in some important areas, such as the automotive industry and agribusiness.</para><para>One of the great foundations of the trades area is the apprenticeship system, and it must be reinvigorated to give young people the message that a career in trades is not only very fulfilling but integral to the local and national economy. Many local organisations are doing a great job in this regard—for example, KYM Employment Services, which is moving around schools and assisting in the Job Pathway Program and Careers and Transition projects in Melbourne's eastern region, particularly in secondary schools in the Shire of Yarra Ranges.</para><para>Finally, I would like to touch on the area of health and families, where I began. The budget funds the massive increase in health spending that was announced just prior to the budget, with a 17 per cent increase in the Commonwealth-State Health Agreement and, on top of that, the Strengthening Medicare package, which is providing some real, tangible benefits as it begins to be used within the electorate. One area in particular which I referred to earlier is the Medicare safety net—the new rebate, whereby the government pays 80 per cent of non-hospital costs over $300 for eligible families and 80 per cent of costs for all other individuals and families once the threshold of $700 a year is reached. </para><para>The Minister for Health and Ageing has advised that 200,000 Australians are now enjoying these rebates. As of late May, around $7.5 million had been paid in rebates. These rebates were never part of the original Medicare. Families have always struggled with the out-of-hospital expenses. It has taken the Howard government to introduce this rebate system. It is a system that is going to be welcomed by families as they use it. Unfortunately, it is a rebate system which those opposite have already announced they will abolish. They will abolish the only Medicare rebate system that has been introduced, and they will abolish it to fund other things. Together with some of their quiet announcements on the $600 payment per child and what they plan for private insurance, that is very much part of what will be an evolving story over the next few months with their alternative budget strategy. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>29979</page.no><name role="metadata">Organ, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ORGAN</name><name.id>BNL</name.id><electorate>Cunningham</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on <inline ref="R2040">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2004-2005</inline>. The 2004-05 federal budget is nothing more than old-fashioned, pre-election pork-barrelling. Instead of the increased spending on vital services which the majority of people said they wanted, the Prime Minister in waiting has squandered the money on tax cuts for people who are already well off. A Morgan research poll just nine days before budget night showed that 88.4 per cent of people wanted the budget surplus spent on health, education, aged care, homelessness and poverty relief rather than on tax cuts. All we got was a sop to aged care which is too little to really address the sector's problems. </para></talk.start><para>The latest CPI figures show that the cost of essential services has jumped by as much as 11 per cent in the last year. The government's decision to provide tax cuts only to people earning above $52,000 per year is a slap in the face for low-income earners, particularly the people doing it extra tough in my electorate of Cunningham. The government's neglect of the least well-off people in Australia is an affront to decency. </para><para>The government has hailed this budget as a budget for families, but it is not a family budget because it fails families in the long term. There is a handout to family tax benefit recipients which many families will not see. There are lump sum payments for new mothers that fall well short of a national, paid maternity leave scheme, but there is no action to support the overstressed public services that all of us, and families in particular, rely on. There is no real investment in public health, nothing for public schools, nothing for universities and nothing new for sustaining our environment. The Treasurer, a man who aspires to be Prime Minister, has failed to show any vision for our common future. </para><para>The Greens have a more optimistic vision and a more responsible plan for the investment of our public tax dollars—a vision of free, high-quality public education; nation-building investment in our environment and infrastructure; strengthening Medicare; boosting our overseas aid; and, at home, a fairer and more effective welfare system that guarantees an adequate income for all. These are the kinds of measures that Australians are crying out for in increasing numbers, because these are the kinds of ideas that, unlike election oriented tax cuts, people recognise as offering a concrete path to a better, brighter and healthier future for all Australians.</para><para>Services, not tax cuts—that is what people want. Both Newspoll and the Morgan poll have found that over 70 per cent of Australians are in favour of investment in services over tax cuts. An ANU study found that a clear majority think the standard of health and Medicare has declined over the past two years, and a near majority think the same of education. Voters want these services looked after, and this is not the priority they see reflected in government policy. That is because the Howard government is failing in one of the main responsibilities of government: providing essential public services. This government has shifted the spending on these services from the public sphere, in which all Australians contribute to the cost and share the benefits, to the private sphere, where those with private financial resources buy essential services based on their capacity to pay, rather than their need. It is the poor and the vulnerable who are the biggest losers. </para><para>The Senate report into poverty released in March revealed the extent of need in Australia, estimating that 3.6 million people—that is almost one in five Australians—live on a weekly income of $400 or less, lower than the federal minimum wage. Some 700,000 children live in a household without a wage earner, and a million Australians do not make enough from their paid work to live above the poverty line. These are the people who most need government investment in our public services. Their voices are some of the loudest calling for services, not tax cuts.</para><para>The Australian Council of Social Service identified $4.6 billion of urgent spending needed on health, education, housing and child care. The Treasurer says that the government has increased spending on services, including health and education. But the money has gone to private schools, to privatising higher education, to private health insurance and to privatising health services. The $2.4 billion per annum private health insurance rebate adds around seven per cent to health spending, but it does not pay for health services. It pays for insurance.</para><para>Higher education spending has fallen as a share of total government spending from 3.9 per cent to 2.5 per cent of the budget. When people call for services rather than tax cuts, public education and public health are at the top of their lists. This government has failed a generation of young Australians by not investing in their education and the nation's future. Australia lags behind comparable countries on its public investment in preschool care and education, public schools and tertiary institutions. This government has pursued an ideological agenda of pouring money into the private school sector at the expense of public schools.</para><para>In contrast, the Greens are committed to building a high-quality public education system and, in doing so, turning around the worrying growth trend in private schooling that is dividing our communities. The Greens would scrap the appallingly unfair SES model that funds non-government schools. In doing so we would redirect the $1.5 billion earmarked for the wealthiest private schools over the next four years into priority public schools funding programs. The Greens would freeze the funding of private schools at 2003-04 levels in order to direct those savings into urgently needed catch-up funds for the public sector. Through these and other measures the Greens will continue working to ensure that every child can be guaranteed that an education at a local government school continues to be the best educational, cultural and social experience on offer.</para><para>The forgotten one million Australians who are enrolled at TAFE must also be resourced. TAFE has been a world-leading provider of low-fee postsecondary education, and the Greens would build on that record by returning growth funding to TAFE. A return to free university education is the best way to guarantee that all Australians who are academically qualified to study at university can do so, thereby drawing on the full potential of this nation's talent. The Greens advocate abolishing the HECS system and forgiving all HECS debt, returning Australia to a system of free public tertiary education. This measure would cost just under $2 billion, the same amount of money the Treasurer is spending next year on tax cuts for the rich. </para><para>In the area of health, the Howard government has squandered public funds and a critical opportunity to improve our public health system. Instead of strengthening Medicare, the government has moved Australia closer to a situation where the health care you obtain depends on what you can afford to pay. The government refuses to accept that people happily pay for Medicare through their taxes. They pay for a quality public health care system that provides quality care for all Australians when they need it. The Greens have proposed a number of measures to strengthen Medicare. Abolition of the $2.4 billion of public money going into the private health insurance rebate would allow the redirection of funds to public hospitals, to increasing the bulk-billing rebate for GP services, to mental health services, to preventive health care and to Indigenous health care.</para><para>The Greens would allocate additional funding to have medically necessary dentistry covered under Medicare. Currently, around half a million low-income earners are waiting for dental treatment through public schemes with waiting periods as long as four years. Millions more Australians who do not qualify for a health care card and do not have private health insurance simply miss out on dental treatment. We could fund these kinds of initiatives if we opted for services, not tax cuts.</para><para>We are surrounded by the evidence of the damage that we are doing to the earth—the planet that provides for all our needs, including spiritual nourishment. The Pentagon report on climate change, released earlier this year, should have dispelled any doubts about the threats that we face if we fail to reverse global warming. The <inline font-style="italic">Measures of Australia's Progress</inline> 2004 report, published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics last month, confirmed the extent of the challenge. That report painted a disturbing picture of the deterioration of our natural environment and highlighted the urgent need for us to address major problems. Surface water and groundwater are being extracted at unsustainable rates. Almost 3,000 ecosystems are listed as threatened. In the decade to the year 2003 the number of terrestrial bird and mammal species listed as extinct, endangered or vulnerable in Australia rose by 40 per cent. There were 248,000 hectares cleared in 2001 alone, and 70 per cent of this was in Queensland. Almost six million hectares of land were at risk from salinity in the year 2000.</para><para>The damage we wreak on the earth's natural systems has an economic cost. Using our natural resources wisely and protecting our precious places and wildlife is at the heart of the Australian Greens' work. Climate change is one of our biggest priorities. The Greens propose a carbon levy, as many European countries have, as the best way to encourage the switch to sustainable energy. The proceeds would finance energy conservation, renewable energy and measures to protect low-income earners from higher electricity prices. We also propose a $35 billion, 10-year investment plan to build a sustainable future. By using the government bond market to offer green bonds to green Australia's essential infrastructure, we can help transform the nation, bringing social, environmental and economic benefits. This scheme proposed by the Greens offers a secure investment, guaranteed return and the opportunity to invest in a greener future for this country.</para><para>Greening Australia's infrastructure is only one essential component of making it sustainable. We also need a mindset change to focus on reducing consumption of energy and materials, eliminating waste and improving the quality of services to meet people's needs. The decision to de-fund environmentally beneficial research shows that the Howard government has no commitment to the task of addressing global warming. It has allocated $92 million to fossil fuel cooperative research centres for coal, petroleum and geosequestration, compared with just $10 million for renewable energy, and it has just rejected an application for a solar CRC whilst approving a CRC for the so-called clean power coming from brown coal. </para><para>The government's budget also fails to provide enough funding to restore the health of the Murray River by ensuring that the 1,500 gigalitre minimum increase in environmental flows is achieved within a decade. This is an urgent task that the government has failed to address. Eighty-five per cent of Australians want the federal government to intervene to protect Tasmania's old-growth forests and their wildlife. The Greens have an industry transition strategy that would save the forests and create 500 new jobs, but there is zero allocation in this budget towards such a win-win outcome. </para><para>In this budget the government continues its abysmal record on assisting the world's poorest people. Under the Howard government, Australia's overseas aid has fallen well short of the UN recommended level of 0.7 per cent of gross national income. This financial year, Australia gave just 0.26 per cent. Lifting Australia's official development assistance to the UN recommended level would cost approximately $5,740 million next financial year. Improving the living conditions and life opportunities for the poorest people on the planet is one of the best investments we can make to secure a safer world.</para><para>Let us target the causes of terrorism—that is, global inequality, instability and imperial foreign policy—rather than go to war on the symptoms. Every bomb we drop and every war we fight creates the conditions for more terrorism, costing us in lives and money as the cycle of violence continues. We need to withdraw our troops from Iraq and instead put resources into reconstruction and humanitarian aid managed by the Iraqi people and their future government. Appallingly, Australia's civil aid to Iraq has been almost halved, going from a piddling $40 million to $27 million in this year's budget.</para><para>The Howard government is depriving the poorest nation in our region, East Timor, of billions of dollars in royalties from the exploitation of oil and gas reserves in the Timor Sea whilst cutting direct aid to the East Timorese. Australia refuses to allow independent arbitration of the sea boundary dispute that sits at the heart of this robbery. East Timor's Prime Minister, Mari Alkatiri, says the funds that under international law belong to the struggling nation are needed to pay for schools and health care. `It is,' he says, `literally a matter of life and death.' The Greens support East Timor's internationally recognised claim and call on the Howard government to meet it. Our global responsibilities include providing asylum to refugees. The Greens continue to call for an end to mandatory detention and for savings to be redirected to help asylum seekers live in the community while their claims for asylum are being assessed.</para><para>The cost of housing has skyrocketed in many cities in recent years, pricing many people out of buying or renting a home. The ACTU has calculated that the average house price rose by 70 per cent in the five years to 2003, compared with average full-time wage rises of 26 per cent in the same period. Housing as an investment is driving up prices. The Productivity Commission has identified negative gearing as a factor in this investment trend. The 50 per cent capital gains tax discount introduced by the Howard government has seen people pour millions of dollars into property, but it has not delivered affordable housing. The Greens believe that affordable housing is a right and that governments have a responsibility to facilitate it. We want the capital gains tax concession reversed and negative gearing phased out, with funds redirected to public housing—that is, to public housing with energy and water efficiency features that not only benefit the environment but also save on ongoing expenses. </para><para>The budget contains nothing to promote employment and training for workers who are unemployed. While the official unemployment rate is 5.7 per cent, the real level of unemployment is at least double and possibly higher than this. In my own electorate of Cunningham overall unemployment is stalled at 9.7 per cent while teenage unemployment is over 32 per cent. Those figures are a disgrace. The growth in casual employment—that is, in insecure work with low pay and no standard conditions—and the increasing reliance on part-time employees are major causes of poverty. One in four workers is now employed as a casual, whilst the wages of the lowest paid workers fail to provide a decent living. This is in addition to the hundreds of thousands of Australians and their dependants who do not have paid work.</para><para>The government's maternity payment is no substitute for a proper paid maternity leave scheme. It does not ensure women's rights to return to work nor will it cover the minimum 16 weeks off work that is recommended by the World Health Organisation. Unless a scheme ensures a continuing attachment to the work force, Australian women's rights to engage in paid work will continue to be restricted. The Greens have developed a scheme to deliver replacement income to 75 per cent of women for 18 weeks, with a further 34 weeks of unpaid leave, a right to return to work part time and a right to share the leave period with a partner. This scheme can be funded by redirecting the baby bonus, which the government has abandoned in this budget. Australia can afford a scheme of this kind and Australian women deserve it. Until the government provides practical assistance of this kind to families it has no credibility in claiming to support families.</para><para>Unmet demand for child care, high fees and pay levels as low as $12 an hour for child-care workers are major problems the Howard government has failed to address. The drive for private child care will only exacerbate these problems. The Greens welcome the government's provision of more child-care places in this budget, but the measure only meets one-quarter of the unmet demand in this area. The present federal funding regime has led to the growth in the corporate child-care sector, arguably at the expense of quality care. As at June 2000, some 67 per cent of long day care centres around Australia were privately owned and several child-care companies have now listed on the stock exchange. Taxpayers are effectively subsidising the huge profits being made by corporate operators. The measures announced in the budget will do nothing to curb this alarming trend towards the commercialisation of early childhood care.</para><para>The Greens call on the government to provide funding that prioritises the local government based and community managed child-care sector. This includes a commitment to provide operational and capital grants to establish and develop community based not-for-profit centres—a commitment the government abandoned in 1997. Child care is fundamentally about the nurture and education of the youngest members of our society. We do not allow schools to be run for profit, so why child-care centres?</para><para>A government that is fair dinkum about helping Australian families would invest in public services for families, not in tax cuts. Taxation policy should be used to redistribute wealth and generate it for the future. Under the Howard government, taxation policy has become less progressive. This means that the greatest burden falls on those least able to pay. The Greens support progressive taxation. As part of this we call for the abolition of the GST. The company tax rate should be returned to the 33 per cent it was at before this government gave corporations a tax break before the last election. </para><para>The Australian Council of Social Service, ACOSS, has identified tax loopholes worth $8.2 billion a year which benefit only the very well-off, including a loophole which allows diverting income to a private company and executive perks such as salary-sacrificing for a company car or extra superannuation. These loopholes must be closed and the savings redirected to public services. The Treasurer's tax cuts will cost the Commonwealth $14 billion over the life of the next parliament. Add to that the tax cuts from 2003 and the tax loopholes that have not been closed in the projected surplus, and a massive $71 billion of public money has been wasted by this government. This pool of money could have achieved a fully funded, free tertiary education system, more teachers and better resourced public schools. Together with the abolition of the private health insurance rebate, it could also have paid for the expansion of Medicare to cover such things as necessary dental care, a boost in bulk-billing rates for GPs and the establishment of new community health centres. It could do all this with money left over.</para><para>Instead, we have public schools that are struggling, university students who are being slugged by higher fees, and doctors fees that are rising. The question that the Greens ask is: do we feel richer? The answer is no. The public has a right to expect the government to provide quality public services. When it chooses to give tax cuts instead of providing these services, the public quite rightly feels cheated. When existing services are left to degrade whilst money is poured into rival private schemes, the public feels betrayed. And when governments cry poor with regard to teaching children, saving our rivers and increasing bulk-billing and then spend billions of dollars to illegally invade and occupy another country, the public gets angry. By putting services before tax cuts, the Greens would set Australia in a much better, much fairer policy direction. We will take these progressive policies to the election and ask the Australian people to join us in supporting public services, peace, the nation's environment and a better investment for its future generations.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>29984</page.no><name role="metadata">Barresi, Phillip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BARRESI</name><name.id>ZJ6</name.id><electorate>Deakin</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R2040">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2004-2005</inline> and associated legislation and to inform the House how my constituents in Deakin stand to benefit from the multifaceted assistance the budget includes. In doing so, I will make a marked contrast to the contribution from the member speaking before me. Firstly, it is worth noting that this budget builds on the hard work and vision of the government since it came into office in 1996. Most importantly, this budget tackles serious local issues and represents a major investment into one of the previous Labor government's greatest shortfalls: aged care. It is also a budget that delivers direct financial benefits to tens of thousands of families, while at the same time ensuring that spending on vital services is maintained—services such as health, education, aged care, defence and, in my part of the world, roads.</para></talk.start><para>This budget is a reminder of the excellent economic stewardship that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have given to our country. The government has been able to rein in Australia's debt legacy from the Hawke-Keating era. By providing a stable and strong economy, we have been able to weather the international economic and security crises of the late 1990s and recent years. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WF6</name.id><name role="metadata">Danby, Michael, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZJ6</name.id><name role="metadata">Barresi, Phillip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BARRESI</name></talker><para>—The people of Deakin—and the people of Melbourne Ports—have been able to invest with security and confidence in their and their family's future. The budget brings with it an enhanced focus on the family, which I am sure all agree is a most vital unit in our society.</para></talk.start></continue><para>My constituents often remark that what they seek from the federal government is incentive—the incentive to work, the incentive to be active in the community—and the capacity to strengthen the foundations of our society, to provide for vital services and infrastructure while recognising that the great building block of our society, the family, must also be supported. Families do not seek an overburdening role for government, and they certainly do not need to be told how to raise their children. It is an insult to parents to be told that they must read to their children. It is stating the obvious. It is stating what many parents do without any prompting from a would-be nanny state. What families do need is a helping hand when it is needed most—a helping hand when having children, when raising a family and, importantly, when returning to work.</para><para>The family is a major focus of this budget. However, I find it unfortunate that some opportunistic members opposite would sink to the level of playing politics with the $19.2 billion that this government is investing into the family assistance package. It is disappointing that Latham's Labor is not prepared to commit to delivering the family tax benefits beyond this year. There are conflicting comments from the various frontbenchers of the Labor Party to attest to this.</para><para>The family focus of this budget is not only about managing the balance between work and family, it is about enhancing the faith in our young parents to rear their children. They play a vital role in the shaping of our nation. That being said, it is important to realise that early intervention by community specialists for families in crisis is equally important. The family incentives in this budget, such as the $3,000 maternity payment and the adjustments to the family tax benefit thresholds, complement the $800,000 of funding announced in February for the early intervention program run by UnitingCare Connections. I remind the member for Melbourne Ports, as someone whom I have a degree of warmth towards, that that program actually also runs in his electorate. Based from Deakin, in the eastern suburbs, this program targets young children that face the serious risk of their families becoming dysfunctional. It is imperative for responsible government to assist families that for various reasons are unable to function without the assistance of a qualified helping hand, such as that of the UnitingCare Connections program.</para><para>For the vast majority of families, however, the most valuable assistance that governments can give comes in the form of direct income assistance or direct cuts to their income tax. Claims by members on the other side of the House of tax cuts to the rich are ill-informed and play to the prejudice of those prepared to play the class card. While programs such as the early intervention program target families at risk, provisions in this budget also target families in need of a financial boost. This is what responsible fiscal management is all about—to be able to give back to those in need. When the family tax benefit is claimed through the tax system, a three-child dual-income family in Deakin with an income split of 80/20—that is, the father earns $40,000 per year and the mother earns $10,000 per year—will not pay net income tax until the family income exceeds $50,000. I believe that particular figure is not well understood out there: those lower income families with two incomes and three children will not pay net income tax until their family income exceeds $50,000. </para><para>This budget highlights not only the strengths of sound economic management but also the strengths of choice.

Sadly, for many of my constituents the federal government is the only level of government that listens to the people of Deakin. Contrary to the 2002 election campaign slogan of being a government that `listens, then acts', the Bracks state Labor government has shown contempt for the people of Deakin by ignoring the cries for vital infrastructure and service investments in Melbourne's eastern suburbs. Compounding the state government's inaction and its very poor budget for families, I also have in my part of the world the Whitehorse City Council, which directly represents half of my electorate and has allowed the blind Labor allegiance of majority councillors to dictate policy.</para></talk.start></continue><para><inline font-style="italic">An opposition member interjecting—</inline></para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZJ6</name.id><name role="metadata">Barresi, Phillip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BARRESI</name></talker><para>—There are some excellent councillors, but only some. Central to this issue is procrastination on road maintenance and no official position on the Bracks government's decision to toll the Scoresby Freeway. Acquiescence, obedience and silence are the hallmarks of the local ALP state MPs and the ALP aligned councillors in my area. In contrast, when the Howard government signed the Scoresby transport corridor memorandum of understanding with the Bracks Labor government in 2001 it committed $445 million. This figure represented a fifty-fifty split of the then construction costs for the project. The MOU stated clearly that the freeway, which runs right through Deakin, would be a toll-free road. This budget recommits federal government funding and gives the Bracks Labor government a rare second chance to do the right thing by the people of the eastern suburbs and reverse the toll decision. I take this opportunity to invite the local Labor state government and council representatives to join me, the Maroondah City Council, the local businesses and the overwhelming majority of the residents of Deakin in pressuring the Bracks government to honour the MOU.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This budget has taken steps towards empowering our youth to get back into the vital trades sector. One of the most important goals of the Howard government since 1996 has been to arrest the decline in the availability of apprenticeships under the previous Labor government. I am proud of the positive effect that the New Apprenticeships scheme has had in Deakin. Just last year Starr Performance automotive, in Nunawading, hosted the Prime Minister for the launch of the New Apprenticeships centres program in conjunction with the Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce and Industry. I am happy to say that this project, which includes a New Apprenticeships centre in Mitcham, received a three-year assistance contract from the government. These New Apprenticeships centres provide young school leavers with a valuable start in life and are pivotal in providing new blood to our trades. </para><para>It is heartening to read the statistics that the Minister for Education, Science and Training often states in this place, and rightly so. Since the creation of New Apprenticeships in 1998 more than 1,340,000 new apprenticeships have commenced, and there are currently 406,000 Australians training in new apprenticeships. These are new apprenticeships and lie in stark contrast to the allegations and criticisms from those on the other side who believe that there has been inaction by this government on apprenticeships.</para><para>We all know that more does need to be done to encourage young people to take up apprenticeships. Seventy per cent of our young people do not go on to university, and yet if you were to listen to the speeches and the contributions of members opposite you would think that higher education, tertiary education, was the sole destiny of all young people. We need to encourage school leavers into apprenticeships and traineeships, and we are doing that through various programs such as the one that I mentioned that was announced by the Prime Minister, and there are others in my area.</para><para>I draw the House's attention to research by Group Training Australia Victoria which highlights a falling demand for apprenticeship places, particularly among young people. The study focused on secondary school aged boys and detailed how training organisations in Victoria are having trouble filling vacancies for apprenticeships. Sadly, many positions often remain unfilled for months at a time. The biggest hurdle for trades to overcome is a growing cultural bias towards tertiary education over skills apprenticeship. Pam Jonas, the manager of policy and research for Group Training Australia Victoria, is quoted in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline> as saying:</para><quote><para>The school curriculum has been targeted towards preparing kids for higher education, so the status of trades has slipped.</para></quote><para>This budget is going one step further to tackle the decline in the number of school leavers seeking to enter an apprenticeship or traineeship. Over the past month—and indeed since the election in 2001—I have been working with Ringwood Secondary College, advocating the need to establish an automotive and manufacturing technological centre in the region. The centre, which I envisage to be located in Ringwood, would assist both the youth of the area and the local automotive industry, which has suffered a major skills shortage over many years. A major focus of this shortage has been a dwindling number of young people actively seeking a career in the automotive industry or in the manufacturing industry in general.</para><para>The proposed centre, which will operate in partnership with the Eastern Industry Education Partnership, will target auto skills and manufacturing technology skills, which includes robotics, to the transitional years between early adolescence and the end of secondary school. Importantly, the centre will be available to schools across the eastern region of Melbourne and will not discriminate between public and private school students. This is a program which has great merit and an initiative to which I am very proud to give my full support to ensure that it comes about.</para><para>Young learners and young families are not the only groups to benefit from this budget. Older Australians—the pillars of our community and vital contributors to our economy—are the focus of Australia's changing demographics and intergenerational platform. Mature age employment is a key tenet that Australia needs to embrace if we are to adapt to the requirements of our rapidly ageing population. At present, over 180,000 Australians are being assisted by Job Network providers. This number is set to rise in accordance with Australia's demographics. Over the last few weeks, I have been working with a local network of job providers, Swinburne University's division of business, work and ageing and the local area consultative committee. Together they have formed an umbrella organisation known as 45 Plus Workforce. Of specific relevance to this area is the project aim: 45 jobs in 45 days for people over 45. By working with employers and targeting mature age employees, the project seeks to engage and educate the entire sector to bring together jobs and often highly-skilled workers. The $12.1 million allocated in this budget to mature age employment and workplace strategy is a key step in tackling the issue of mature age unemployment. The package of measures works with local organisations such as the ones I mentioned before to address the entrenched view that mature age employees do not have as much to offer as their younger counterparts. </para><para>Finally, I would like to talk about another aspect of this budget, the significant increase in funding for aged care. Since coming to office in 1996, the federal government has increased aged care places by over 55,000. Not only has this worked in accordance with Australia's ageing population; it has also helped to gradually address the 10,000-bed shortage left by the Keating government and acknowledged in the Gregory report. The $2.2 billion allocated in 2003-04 over the next four years is the greatest investment in aged care by any Australian government. This major funding injection into the sector will take the government's commitment to aged care to $30 billion over the next four years.</para><para>The blueprint for aged care in this budget is a key achievement for this government and has far-reaching benefits for the aged community in Deakin. In line with the government's reforms since 1996, this funding takes into account quality, affordability, accessibility and sustainability in the aged care sector. Unfortunately, recent headlines in Deakin have not focused on the forward-thinking approach of the Hogan review. The proposed sale of Inala Village by the Salvation Army, coupled with the political scaremongering of local ALP figures, has caused some unease in the local senior community. But that was a decision by the Salvos for the southern region, and it stands in stark contrast with their decision to remain within the aged care sector for the eastern region. I have met with Inala management and its residents groups—as has the minister—to listen to their viewpoints. I will be keeping an observing eye on the on-selling process to ensure that the rights of the residents—the quality and conditions for the residents—and, of course, staff entitlements are maintained by the new owners.</para><para>The aged care sector in Deakin is a major focus of mine. Just this year I had the opportunity to establish the Deakin Aged Care Council, a representative body drawn from across the electorate. The body provides a forum for feedback on the government's aged care policy within Deakin as well as identifying solutions to social policy areas that will only increase in importance. The aged care council draws on the strength of local providers to discuss current and pending issues in the sector. One such provider is Coronella Retirement Village and Nursing Home at Nunawading, which I have had a long association with, having been a member of its capital development board for a number of years.</para><para>The centre's CEO, Ruth Welling, echoes the sentiments of many aged care providers in the Deakin electorate and the surrounding eastern suburbs of Melbourne. Mrs Welling states that this budget's increased funding has been of particular benefit to her establishment. In particular, she highlights a oneoff payment of $3,500 per resident as providing a significant boost to the centre. Mrs Welling supports the method of the government's approach to aged care funding, which places an emphasis on performance and staff. Furthermore, changes to allow ACAT assessments to be done inhouse for residents moving from low to high care, thereby reducing administrative costs and time wastage, have also been welcomed. The extra $877 million over four years through a conditional adjustment package will place aged care providers in a better position to pay their staff. Establishments such as Coronella add that this adjustment will help them to meet the recent eight per cent nurses' pay rise, which has been at the heart of some dispute in Victoria and across the country. </para><para>This budget is a testament to the premier economic management and strategic planning skills of the Howard government. In line with what responsible government should do, this budget builds upon the achievements of previous budgets. In particular, Australia's often overlooked middle-income earners have received tax relief which complements the tax cuts which targeted lower income earners in the 2000 and 2003 budgets. I firmly support the measures of this budget, as they offer real assistance to my constituents in Deakin. I urge those on the other side to support the family tax incentive measures as well as the tax cuts which have been outlined by the Treasurer.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>29989</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MURPHY</name><name.id>83D</name.id><electorate>Lowe</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Sadly, this budget is more to do with securing the Howard government's re-election than serving the needs of Australian families or securing Australia's future. It is a wasted opportunity because it ignores the services that millions of Australians believe should be the government's priority, in particular universal health care, affordable education and accessible child care and aged care. </para></talk.start><para>In an overwhelmingly cynical attempt to buy the votes it needs to cling to power, the government in this budget is spending a record $52 billion on tax cuts and one-off payments for families. The tax cuts fail to include middle and low-income families. No doubt the Prime Minister and the government now believe themselves unbeatable, especially when you consider that the government is cynically spending $108 million of taxpayers' hard earned money advertising on television screens and radio and in the newspapers, not to mention its glossy pamphlets, all trying to seduce Australians to vote for it in the forthcoming federal election.</para><para>In speaking in debate on the <inline ref="R2040">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2004-2005</inline>, I support the second reading amendment moved by the member for Hotham, the Hon. Simon Crean, that:</para><quote><para>... the House</para></quote><para>(1)	condemns the government for its cynical election driven spending spree which - while spending a record $52 billion over the forward estimates - failed to deliver crucial services to Australians, including:</para><para>funding the pneumococcal vaccine for children</para><para>funding VET in schools so young Australians can either Earn or Learn</para><para>ensuring access to Higher Education without excessive fees or increasing student debt levels</para><para>ensuring all Australians can access bulkbilling services</para><para>ensuring adequate measures to respond to Australia's skill shortage, and</para><para>(2)	also condemns the Government for failing to present a strategy to adequately address the long term fiscal challenges facing the nation. </para><para>The scandal of this budget is that 8½ million forgotten Australian families do not receive a single cent in either tax cuts or increased family payments—not a single cent for three out of five taxpayers. For example, in my electorate of Lowe, according to income levels measured in the 2001 census, 77,992 constituents do not get a tax cut in this budget. The government is spending a record $52 billion, yet 81 per cent of those in my electorate of Lowe do not receive any tax relief. In addition, the government is playing a confidence trick on the 600,000 Australian families who are likely to have their family payments eaten up by existing family payment debts. The government is only attempting to compensate families for bad policy and its inability to solve the family debt crisis. In budget estimates last year it was revealed that some 232,278 customers had their family tax benefit overpayments partially or fully recovered from their tax returns. For families who find it very difficult to estimate their annual income, such as part-time and casual workers, a $600 payment at best is a token form of compensation.</para><para>Yesterday we learned that the government will use public funds to advertise the one-off family payment but will delay the clawing back of overpayments until after the election. Compare this debt recovery strategy with the government's lethargy towards stamping out the tax avoidance industry. Since February 2002 I have asked over 100 questions associated with the rorting of our tax system. The government has shown a shameful lack of action, until belatedly announcing its draft legislation two weeks ago to crack down on the outrageous tax avoidance industry in Australia. The government is more interested in chasing after working families than the people who have quite improperly used family law and bankruptcy to avoid paying their fair share of tax. In many cases, they have paid no tax.</para><para>In October 2003 we learned that the Australian Taxation Office was pursuing $9.2 billion of disputed tax debt. There were 287 cases where barristers owed $51.6 million in tax debt. In addition to paying little or no tax, hundreds of other barristers were not up to date with the lodgment of their tax returns. For example, one QC had not even lodged a tax return for 45 years. Answers to my questions also confirmed that another QC worked for the tax office for eight years and did not even lodge a tax return in that period. The government has been very slow to deal with these cheats and has not adequately assisted the ATO in pursuing these parasites, who doubtlessly possess a Medicare card and enjoy other benefits that only honest taxpayers should enjoy.</para><para>Australians understand that the Howard government is the highest taxing government on record. Australians are paying an average of $9,000 more in Commonwealth tax, including GST, than they were when the Howard government came to office eight years ago. By the end of the forward estimates, Australians will be paying an average of $12,000 more. My constituents in Burwood, Drummoyne, Five Dock and Strathfield find it impossible to understand why, despite this heavy tax burden and high economic growth, they are struggling to access affordable health care and medicines. Why are so many hardworking families in my electorate of Lowe battling as they struggle against rising costs for basic services? Why are they having difficulty accessing a bulk-billing doctor? Why are so many families in my electorate unable to find the child-care places they need? Why do older children who are hardworking students have to incur enormous HECS debts to access a higher education? Why is affordable, quality aged care so difficult to find? </para><para>The real tragedy of this budget is that it is a wasted opportunity. The Howard government has run out of ideas and it chooses to underfund vital health services and education programs. The government continues to ignore the 18,028 constituents in my electorate of Lowe who signed my `save Medicare' petition—the largest `save Medicare' petition tabled in the House during the current parliament. My constituents understand the importance of a universal health system. They know that under the Howard government bulk-billing rates in Australia have taken a nosedive. They also know that if this alarming trend continues their credit cards are going to be more important than their Medicare cards.</para><para>Only Labor understand that Medicare is a universal health system. Basic health care should never be about one's ability to pay an up-front fee, and it should never require safety nets. If it is not universal, it is not Medicare. A Latham Labor government will get doctors bulk-billing again, restore bulk-billing rates to 80 per cent and make Medicare accessible for all Australians. Our Australian dental care plan will get half a million Australians off dental waiting lists and into dentist's chairs. We will fund a pneumococcal vaccine. We will bring Medicare teams of doctors and nurses into areas of urgent need. Labor are committed to a comprehensive health reform process, including prevention and primary care strategies, responding to the mental health crisis, unifying the funding of our health system and putting an end to the Commonwealth and state buck-passing on health care. This will also include unifying all information in the health system and linking important information across the health system. These are all important priorities the Howard government prefers to ignore.</para><para>Critical to a universal health care system are quality and affordable medicines underpinned by our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Unfortunately, the Howard government is happy to put this at risk in its pursuit of the Australia-United States free trade agreement. The FTA changes the PBS process to allow American drug companies to seek reviews of PBS decisions. Why has the Howard government agreed to an appeals mechanism whereby industry can challenge the decisions of the committee that advises the government on PBS listings? Labor will not support a free trade agreement that harms Australia's PBS and burdens Australians with higher prices for medicines. </para><para>The Howard government does not understand that health remains a critical priority for Australian families, deserving greater attention than expensive, feelgood television advertising campaigns such as those we are currently experiencing. Australians want a government committed to a universal health system: Medicare. All Australians, especially the thousands of families in my electorate of Lowe who have grown up visiting doctors that bulk-bill and who enjoy reasonable access to essential medicines, know Labor has a plan to restore bulk-billing and protect the PBS. </para><para>My constituents also know that a Latham Labor government will grant Concord Repatriation General Hospital a licence to operate a much needed Medicare eligible magnetic resonance imaging service. On this important health issue for my electorate the Howard government continues to fail my constituents. Over the last two years, on numerous occasions I have asked the former Minister for Health and Ageing, Senator Patterson, and the current Minister for Health and Ageing, Mr Abbott, to grant Concord hospital the Medicare eligible MRI licence, but to date the Howard government continues to refuse my request on behalf of my constituents and the staff of Concord hospital and the University of Sydney.  </para><para>I have tabled eight petitions with a total of 8,759 signatures, demanding that the Howard government match the commitment of the New South Wales government, which has agreed to provide the MRI machine and grant Concord hospital a licence to operate a Medicare eligible MRI service. Concord hospital is still waiting while the sick, elderly and frail residents of the inner west of Sydney, who are admitted to Concord hospital and who require this important service, are forced to travel to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital at Camperdown, Westmead Hospital or the Royal North Shore Hospital for their MRI scans. </para><para>Our fight on this issue will continue. My constituents in Lowe are telling me the government's lack of action in this area is deplorable. Not only is Concord hospital critical to the residents of the inner west in my electorate, it also has a proud history serving the veterans community and is a teaching hospital of the University of Sydney. While the government is refusing Concord hospital a Medicare eligible MRI service and failing the patients of the inner west, it expects families to pay more to see a doctor. The consequence of this policy means more pressure on all public hospitals. So I will continue to fight for the families and patients of my electorate and to ensure that a Medicare eligible MRI service is soon available to Concord hospital on the election of a Latham government. </para><para>Unfortunately, it is not only in health that the government's priorities are misplaced. The lack of any new ideas in this budget in the area of education confirms the low priority the Howard government places on education. There is not one extra cent for new TAFE places, despite 15,000 young people missing out on a place every year and many industries facing serious skills shortages. This budget fails the 20,000 qualified Australians who are turned away from university every year because the Howard government refuses to fund enough places. Labor is committed to creating an extra 20,000 university places and 20,000 TAFE places each year. </para><para>Shamefully, the Howard government's Higher Education Contribution Scheme changes will cost the average university student an extra $25 a week. We also know the budget will ensure mortgage like student debt, including steep penalties when a student takes out a loan to pay fees. The Howard government's appalling education legacy is fewer public places and six-figure fees to secure a university degree. To the thousands of working families with young children that currently cannot access quality, affordable centre based child care, the budget brings little relief. </para><para>In one child-care centre in my electorate, the Abbotsford Long Day Care Centre, not far up the road from where I live, there is a waiting list of 200 for a child-care place. I recently received a letter from my constituent, Mr Aldo Crisafulli, President of the Strathfield South Shopkeepers Association, addressed to the Mayor of Strathfield but also copied to me and to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, asking for help and support in the establishment of an affordable long day care centre at Strathfield South. Mr Crisafulli writes: </para><quote><para>Over the past one to two years we have been asking for this type of facility and have approached all three levels of Government. Although both Council and State Government representatives have offered support, in principle, we are no closer to the establishment of such a centre.</para></quote><para>The Howard government continues to ignore the key issues child-care advocates have been raising for years, including the fast-tracking of the National Early Childhood Strategy relevant to child care, preschools, early childhood development and parenting programs; reversing the cutbacks in centre based long day care places; highlighting the shortfall of 20,000 places for outside school hours care; and the poor industrial conditions that many child-care workers are facing, including the deplorable pay rate of $13 per hour. </para><para>I said earlier that this budget is a wasted opportunity. Day after day my constituents are asking me to explain why the most urgent community services are being neglected by the Howard government. Another example of this is the crisis in aged care. Adele Horin, in yesterday's <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>, wrote `Elderly forced to wait as aged care crisis worsens' and reported:</para><quote><para>More than 20,000 elderly people are on waiting lists for nursing homes and aged care hostels in NSW and the ACT ...</para><para>They are waiting longer for a vacancy than they did in 2001.</para><para>In some cases, people could wait for two years or longer for entry to facilities that specialised in dementia.</para></quote><para>I believe there can be little doubt that far too many elderly people are waiting in public hospitals, again adding undue pressure to our public hospital system, because the Howard government does not believe aged care is a priority.</para><para>Sadly, I have received the same message of outrage and disappointment from many of my constituents in the veteran community. Revealed in the fine print of this budget is a cut for veterans of almost $4 million for 2004-05 to the Home and Community Care program. This will hurt over 65,000 veterans and war widows receiving services under the HACC program. This is madness. Veterans' home care was initiated to assist ageing veterans and war widows to remain in their own home rather than having to enter high-cost retirement or nursing homes—yet hours of domestic assistance and personal care have been cut across the board. It is no wonder so many feel cheated.</para><para>I keep saying that this budget is a wasted opportunity, but Australians would be wrong to think this was due only to the government's indolence. There is no doubt the Howard government believes its survival is assured by serving its most powerful benefactors whatever the cost to our community or the environment. Constituents in my electorate of Lowe understand this very well. There is no better example of the Howard government's betrayal of my electorate of Lowe and the electorates of Grayndler and Sydney than the government's decision to sell Sydney airport to its mates at Southern Cross consortium and Macquarie Bank—something the government promised it would not do until aircraft noise sharing problems were resolved—and then this year the decision to sign off on the master plan for Sydney airport.</para><para>The people of the inner west of Sydney, people living north of the airport, are still receiving twice the amount of noise promised by the government under its long-term operating plan for Sydney airport. The master plan for Sydney airport forecasts a massive increase in air traffic movements in and out of Sydney airport over the next 20 years. But the Howard government says that Sydney will not need another airport for at least 20 years—and both the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister this week reinforced that message in the parliament and in the media. The Howard government is more interested in ensuring that the new owners of the Sydney airport milk as much as profit out of their new purchase by maximising air traffic movements in and out of the airport, all at the expense of those residents living to the north of the airport in my electorate who are copping ever-increasing levels of aircraft noise. </para><para>Another example of the government's determination to look after its most powerful supporters is its plans to sell out Australia's democracy by changing Australia's cross-media laws, which will allow the largest media proprietors to own television stations, radio stations and newspapers in the same city. If this legislation goes through, it will lead to fewer newsrooms, fewer journalists, fewer opinions and irreparable damage to Australia's democracy. We need to guarantee media diversity in Australia, not allow it to be concentrated with the main players being allowed to buy more. It is just as important as maintaining our parliament and our courts.</para><para>My constituents understand that we should always adequately fund and support our public broadcaster, the ABC, for the invaluable contribution it makes to our democracy. We should also, as a matter of urgency, restore the credibility and public confidence in our communications regulator, the Australian Broadcasting Authority, by immediately removing from the board the hopelessly flawed chairman, Professor David Flint. I believe that, regardless of one's political persuasion, no-one can honestly support the government's agenda to concentrate media ownership and attack the ABC and believe that that is good for our democracy.</para><para>Again I say this budget is a wasted opportunity because it fails to address far too many of the basic concerns of Australian families. The budget is evidence of a tired and arrogant Howard government no longer serving the interests of my constituents or the majority of Australian families. I look forward to the people of Australia electing a Latham Labor government—a government that will provide opportunity for all and govern for all. People in my electorate are sick and tired of the government making decisions which are only in the interests of the most powerful people in Australia. That was evidenced in my referral to the sale of Sydney airport, which is a critical issue for my electorate at a time when aircraft noise is becoming even more unbearable. And, even more important for the future of our democracy, leading to the mortgaging of the public interest and the future of our democracy to Australia's most powerful media proprietors, is the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill, which is currently stalled in the Senate. It is a critical bit of legislation. I hope that the two government members here today, more than on anything else I have said this morning, take a message back to the Prime Minister that that legislation should be defeated. We want more diversity of media ownership in Australia. That is good for a democracy and good for the future of Australia, and I ask government members to take that message back to the government. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>29994</page.no><name role="metadata">Ticehurst, Kenneth, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TICEHURST</name><name.id>00ANF</name.id><electorate>Dobell</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I stand here today to support the <inline ref="R2040">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2004-2005</inline>. Many people in my local area have benefited from the Howard government's seventh budget. It is a budget that puts the interests of all families, in my electorate of Dobell and Australia wide, first and foremost. The Howard government has delivered on its promise to the people of Dobell to reform the tax and family benefit systems to allow mothers a genuine choice in being able to look after their families while going back to the work force. The budget includes the largest packet of assistance for families ever—an additional cost of $19.2 billion over five years, of which the Central Coast will receive $288 million. This figure includes a lump sum payment of $600 for each dependent child under changes to the family tax benefit. Most families in Dobell will receive $600 before 30 June this year and be eligible for a further $600 per child after their 2003-04 reconciliation of entitlement. That is an additional $1,200 per child over the next 12 months. Families under family tax benefit A will also receive an increase of $600 per child per year. </para></talk.start><para>Increases in size and eligibility for family tax benefit by relaxing the income test to give more families access to this benefit and at higher income levels will significantly help families with the cost of raising children and improve rewards for working. The budget includes measures to help families balance their work and family responsibilities, including increased direct financial assistance in the form of a new maternity payment of $3,000 without means test, rising to $5,000 by 2008, for every mother on the birth of a child. There are up to 500 new child-care places in Dobell, and the lowering of the income test for family tax benefit B means that more mothers can access this payment while still in part-time work.</para><para>Why has the Howard government invested so much in Australian families? Because the Howard government appreciates that the family is the greatest institution society has known. It is the greatest source of nourishment to children, as they are taught the values of life. The benefits that flow through to our society from united families are immeasurable. Even though families are Australia's most important unit block, Labor and the Leader of the Opposition continue to be lost on family benefits and taxation policy. As reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline> on 17 May:</para><quote><para>Labor's tax plans remained in confusion yesterday as Opposition Leader Mark Latham promised broader and fairer cuts but refused to guarantee everyone would receive extra cash.</para></quote><para>The Leader of the Opposition is still making policy on the run. Labor will not act to help families and simply cannot be trusted to build and secure Australia's economy.</para><para>The truth is that a strong economy greatly benefits families. Good economic management means that we can afford to give something back to hardworking Australian families, including those in my local area. Without job security for workers and low interest rates for home buyers, they and their families would have less security and fewer choices. Strong economic management is not a given. It is not something that comes about by accident or just exists, as Labor would have people believe. The reason this budget has been able to provide so much for so many is that our Prime Minister has made the hard decisions, the tough decisions, over the last eight years to protect and secure Australia.</para><para>This government has made decisions that have seen $70 billion of Labor's irresponsible $96 billion debt repaid. It has made decisions that have taken interest rates down to their lowest levels in a generation, making it much easier to pay off the family home. In 1996 Labor left office with official home interest rates of 10½ per cent—this is after they peaked at 17 per cent in 1989—compared to coalition home interest rates of 6.55 per cent. This means that under Labor the extra interest on a loan of $150,000 would be $493 every month. In my case my home loan peaked at 18 per cent, and the overdraft rate on small business was 22 per cent during the last years of the Labor government.</para><para>Responsible economic management has helped bring unemployment to under six per cent and has provided solid conditions for Australia's future in an uncertain world. Under Labor, unemployment peaked at 10.9 per cent in 1992 and remained high, at 8.2 per cent, when they left office in 1996. The Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer, the member for Hotham—Mr Magic Pudding—have no idea about managing the Australian economy. They have no idea how they are going to pay for their most vague ideas. In response to this budget, the Labor Party does not like to give detail. The Labor Party does not want to know about detail and is crying to anyone who will listen that the government has created a class of forgotten people—that is, those earning under $52,000 per annum. This is simply not true. The budget is part of a series of budgets and a comprehensive range of initiatives, and from all of these there have been a range of benefits provided to people in my electorate. </para><para>The government provided significant allowances for the lower income tax bracket in past budgets—when A New Tax System was introduced in 2000 and again in the 2003-04 budget when income tax thresholds were further adjusted. Major income tax reform since 2000 means that today taxpayers in Dobell earning $20,000 are paying $625 per year, or $12 a week, less now, representing a tax cut of 23 per cent. Taxpayers on $30,000 a year are paying $1,050 per year, or $20 a week, less now, representing a tax cut of 17 per cent. Someone on $40,000 per annum is paying $1,630 a year, or $31 a week, less now; that is a tax cut of 17 per cent.</para><para>All lower income earners will also get access to a generous matched government superannuation co-contribution. This is worth a maximum of $1,500 for somebody on $20,000; $1,400 for somebody on $30,000; and $900 for someone on $40,000. A reduction in the marginal tax rate by $14.7 billion over the next four years means that the majority of taxpayers that earn between $21,600 and $63,000 will not face any increase at all in their tax rate as their income increases. This means that when people do overtime they keep the benefit for the entire family.</para><para>The Howard government has also introduced a bill that aims to increase the Medicare levy low-income threshold for individuals and families, in line with consumer price index increases. The low-income threshold in the Medicare levy surcharge provisions will similarly be increased. These changes will ensure that low-income individuals and families will continue to be exempt from the Medicare levy or surcharge.</para><para>The coalition has also sought to address the shortage of GPs and practice nurses, with 1,500 more doctors and 1,600 more practice nurses, while providing GPs with an incentive to bulk-bill. We have already seen the incentive increase the rate of bulk-billing. These new measures will provide substantial support for the Central Coast GPs to provide patients with speedier medical services and a greater diversity of them. This means more hands on deck at the surgery to assist patients on the Central Coast. In fact, under the Australian government's More Doctors for Outer Metropolitan Areas measure, five new doctors have just moved into underserviced areas in my electorate of Dobell. There will be one doctor to service Hamlyn Terrace, one for Berkeley Vale, two for Wyong and one for Ourimbah. This is a good start and a great indication that the scheme is working. I am confident that more doctors will be attracted to the coast under this scheme.</para><para>One project that I have been working on for many months now is jointly funding a new medical research centre at North Wyong. I have been working behind the scenes with the Central Coast Division of General Practice, Wyong Shire Council, Central Coast Area Health Service and health minister Tony Abbott for many months now. I have invited Minister Abbott to visit the coast in the next few weeks to discuss this issue with the Division of General Practice and assist me in finalising this matter.</para><para>I can confidently say that, through the combined efforts of a group of dedicated locals, things are definitely moving in the right direction. In this budget the government has also demonstrated its commitment to school funding by investing a record $32 billion over the next four years. That is an increase of $8.2 billion over the previous four years. Whether parents choose to send their children to a state, Catholic or independent school, the Howard government wants to continue to support parents for making the choice that they believe is best for their children. Every parent, having paid their taxes, deserves some level of public assistance to support the education of their child, regardless of which school the child attends. This is why the Howard government continues to fund state schools even though, under the Australian Constitution, state schools are the primary responsibility of state and territory governments who own the schools and have the responsibility of managing them. </para><para>Since 1985 Australian governments, Labor and coalition, have been the primary source of funds for Catholic and independent schools. But the Labor Party never acknowledge this. They would never acknowledge that 50 per cent of all the money that state governments raise in this country comes from the federal government. The Labor Party distort the truth. They do not think the general public deserves to know the real details. The New South Wales Teachers Federation has been used by the Labor Party as a pawn to exacerbate these campaigns of deception. Labor also like to ignore the fact that every time parents on the Central Coast decide to send their children to what the opposition pleases itself by calling `elite private schools'—although many of the parents of children at private schools are anything but elite in terms of their income levels—they are effectively saving the Australian taxpayer around $10,000 annually.</para><para>If state and territory governments had increased their funding to their schools at the same rate as the federal government did in the 2003 budget, there would have been an additional $667.8 million available for state government schools across Australia this year. The Labor Party are very good at distracting attention from the fact that the state governments are underfunding state schools that they have the primary responsibility for managing, regulating and funding.</para><para>The severe shortcomings of the New South Wales Labor government should be a very good indication of what a Latham Labor government would be like. The announcement in the federal budget of 34,000 new university places to be allocated Australia-wide, of which Ourimbah campus is set to greatly benefit, is good news for the Central Coast campus. We have a rapidly growing population, and the federal government is committed to ensuring that we have additional places to support this growth. While the deputy vice-chancellor of the University of Newcastle, Professor Brian English, has publicly expressed his delight with this package, Labor continues to express disappointment with it. Labor continues to moan with utter disappointment that the campus did not receive regional status, even though the deputy vice-chancellor of the university has publicly said that the new package would leave the Central Coast campus far better off than if it had received regional status. At a meeting with university officials and local MPs early this year, Professor English said:</para><quote><para>Under the new package we're talking about receiving an extra 10 percent places to meet demand. Regional loading would have only meant a 1.5 percent loading on current places.</para></quote><para>Labor are playing politics of the lowest kind and are taking residents in my electorate of Dobell for dupes. Unlike Labor, who have voted against these additional places in parliament, I have been fighting for these places, for which the first allocation of funding has been made in the 2004-05 budget. </para><para>Aged care provisions are also very important in my electorate of Dobell, with an ageing population on the Central Coast. The Howard government has announced a massive new investment of $2.2 billion over five years so that the aged care sector is able to continue to provide affordable and quality aged care for an increasing number of older Australians. I am particularly delighted with the one-off payment of $3,500 per resident to be made before 30 June 2004 to all nursing homes in Dobell. This measure, when multiplied by the number of nursing home patients, will equate to an immediate injection of $2.75 million to build new capital buildings to house those extra nursing home patients. While there is still more to be done for aged care on the coast, our current situation is a far cry from the massive aged care place shortages left by Labor—a 10,000 shortfall across the nation. </para><para>I also welcome the Howard government's decision to appreciate the value of the work hundreds of carers in Dobell perform every day in a selfless way. Nearly 1,200 carers across the Central Coast who provide constant care for a disabled person or a child are to receive an additional one-off payment of $1,000 from 1 July 2004.</para><para>I know that many people in Dobell are pleased that the coalition government is extending funding to the Natural Heritage Trust. This is the largest environmental restoration program in Australia's history, with an additional $300 million to be spent in 2007-08. My local area has already reaped the rewards of over $1.2 million spent on important environmental projects in Dobell over the last three years. The Leader of the Opposition does not seem to have any practical plan to protect the fragile environment. In fact, the Labor Party opposed the creation of the Natural Heritage Trust, and in 13 years of government Labor was unable to create or implement any national environmental protection measures.</para><para>Up until recently in Dobell the New South Wales Labor government, the New South Wales environment minister and the state member for The Entrance have refused to work with the council and the federal government to fund an environmentally friendly solution for disposing of 15,000 cubic metres of dredged sludge from a choked up Tumbi Creek. Up to this point the New South Wales government have actively supported dumping the silt into Tuggerah Lakes—a shallow estuarine lake that they have the prime responsibility for.</para><para>During the Leader of the Opposition's visit to the Central Coast some months back he promised that he would look into the issue and talk to his New South Wales colleagues. We have not heard from him since. It was very disappointing that the New South Wales Labor government have failed to acknowledge their responsibility for Tuggerah Lakes. However, I am hopeful that as a result of a recent meeting involving all levels of government the Labor Party will realise that this issue is an important one that will affect hundreds of residents of Dobell, our tourist industry and future generations.</para><para>One group that is vital to Australia's future and a strong economy is small business. Australia's 1.1 million small businesses employ 90 per cent of all workers. Under Labor's maternity leave scheme, small businesses will have to hold open a part-time position for up to five years. This would cripple small businesses, which are the lifeblood of the economy in my electorate of Dobell. But we all know who the Labor Party are beholden to, and it is not small business. Few workers in Dobell belong to unions. Labor are only interested in big governments, big companies and big unions. Why? Because they bring big dividends, just like the rolled gold rent rip-off rort of Centenary House in Barton—a $36 million gift courtesy of hardworking taxpayers.</para><para>In the Howard government's 2004-05 budget the compliance red tape for almost three-quarters of small businesses has been significantly pared back. Small businesses which have an annual turnover of less than $50,000 and voluntarily register for GST will be able to report and pay their GST annually. This means they will no longer be required to lodge a quarterly business activity and will allow them to complete all their GST requirements in one end-of-financial-year visit to the accountant. </para><para>With a background in both large and small business, I understand what this means for small businesses in Dobell. The Howard government is the only government that is committed to helping small businesses grow and develop and the only government that recognises that you cannot take the one-size-fits-all approach with small business, because each small business is so different.</para><para>Small business operators are ordinary, everyday people who are busting a gut to get from A to B. They do not sit all day within the confines of luxurious airconditioned offices overlooking the city with their secretaries at their beck and call. They do not hire and fire workers as they please because they are the workers. They are plumbers, bus drivers and dry cleaners who have been prepared to take a risk to create some wealth for themselves and their families and to actively climb the ladder of opportunity. We would not like to see them sliding down the snake of a Labor government. That is what the Howard government's seventh budget, and indeed our philosophy, is all about. It is about giving people incentive to work hard and rewarding them when they do. It is about fostering growth and helping people to help themselves. I commend these bills to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>29999</page.no><name role="metadata">Zahra, Christian, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ZAHRA</name><name.id>84H</name.id><electorate>McMillan</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In this House we get the opportunity to talk about those matters which directly confront people who live in our electoral districts. Today I want to talk about a group of people who are doing it very tough at the moment: the dairy farmers of Australia. People on the land are really finding it very hard at the moment where the dairy industry is concerned.</para></talk.start><para>In the dairy industry we have something very wrong in the market forces which are operating. We have very low milk prices being offered. Unfortunately, the milk prices which are being offered by the milk companies and the dairy cooperatives are almost uniform. So you have someone on a dairy farm in west Gippsland or south Gippsland who has worked hard, whose farm is producing more milk and is more productive this year than last year, getting paid substantially less than what they got in the previous year. If they want to shop around and look at who might purchase their milk, they have only a limited choice. The milk companies and dairy cooperatives are offering almost identical milk prices.</para><para>A government report just a month or two ago showed that the price that the consumer is paying at the local corner store for a litre of milk is $1.50 or $1.60, but the person who makes the milk—the dairy farmer—is getting about 24c or 25c a litre. This is the biggest disparity in history between what the dairy farmer is getting paid and what the consumer is paying for the product.</para><para>I say to the House that the milk processing task is not turning gravel into gold. It is not turning water into wine. It is turning milk into processed milk. The people who take the financial risk in running a dairy farm and who contribute, through their effort and their sacrifice, to creating the basic product should get a better share of that $1.60 than 24c. I say to the House that we need to make sure that people who take these financial risks and who do the hard work associated with being on a farm—often at huge personal cost to their family because of the impact it has on the amount of time they can spend doing other things—get a fair return for their work and their sacrifice. That is not happening right now. </para><para>I appeal to the members opposite and other country members in this place. We have a lot in common. If you have a look at us, whether we are in the Liberal Party or the Labor Party or The Nationals, the big thing that really joins the country members is the fact that we represent country districts. Our work is different. The industries in our electorate are different. On an issue like this we should be able to have a look at the common factor: the basic fact that the person who is on the farm is getting 24c and you and I buying it at the supermarket or the corner store are getting it for $1.60.</para><para>The farmers are telling me—and I am sure they are telling my colleague the member for Hinkler and other country members in this place—that 24c is not enough. It is not enough. If we want people to stay in the dairy industry we have to make sure that they get a fair return. I appeal, in a bipartisan way, to members opposite who represent country districts for them to try and get the message through that something needs to be done here.</para><para>It is my strong conviction that what needs to be done is to make sure that there are proper market signals and market forces working in this industry. They work in other places. We should make sure that they work here for dairy farmers, so they can get not just the risks and the downsides associated with market forces—which is what is happening now—but also the benefits in being able to have market forces working for them to create some competition in the milk companies and the dairy cooperatives. At present they are amazingly offering almost a uniform price and I do not think that works in the interests of country communities. I know that it does not work in the interests of dairy farmers. That is one issue that I wanted to mention today in my contribution to the debate.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>KV5</name.id><name role="metadata">Neville, Paul, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Neville</name></talker><para>—Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek an intervention.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Mossfield, Frank (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Mossfield)</inline>—Will the member allow a question?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>84H</name.id><name role="metadata">Zahra, Christian, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ZAHRA</name></talker><para>—I will from the member for Hinkler.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>KV5</name.id><name role="metadata">Neville, Paul, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Neville</name></talker><para>—While broadly in agreement with the honourable member's thrust, could I ask him two questions: first, is it not true that the Victorian growers, by referendum of their own members, decided to deregulate and, second, could he suggest to me—and I do not say this with any malice; it is a genuine question—in what way he would re-regulate the industry to make that happen?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>84H</name.id><name role="metadata">Zahra, Christian, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ZAHRA</name></talker><para>—I thank my colleague and friend the member for Hinkler for his question. If it had been anyone but him, I do not think I would have allowed it. I think it is a good question asked in the best spirit of this place and I would answer his question in this way: I think the dairy farmers had put before them the idea that the industry was going to be deregulated, `so take your choice—this package or nothing'. I think people had a gun to their heads in relation to that. On the second question, I do not think there is a serious argument for going back to the system of regulation that we had before. But I think that there is an argument, coming from dairy farmers themselves, that we want to end up with a situation where we get some civilising force into the planning associated with the industry.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Right now what we have is the worst of market forces but none of the best of market forces. I say to my colleague the member for Hinkler that I think we can develop a plan and a model to try and make things better for dairy farmers. I just come back to where I started in this: I have dairy farmers in my electorate who are producing hundreds of thousands of litres more milk this year than they did last year and getting paid hundreds of thousands of dollars less. How can anyone say that that is a reasonable market signal? What that says is that, if you produce more—you work hard and are more productive—you get less. We are all talking about the dairy industry as being one of the great flagships of Australian trade and enterprise and one of the great agricultural industries in our country. How can we reasonably expect people to stay in the industry if we are not able to give them proper market signals which encourage them to produce more and generate more wealth for our country? </para><para>So I thank the member for Hinkler for his question—it is a good question—and I come back to the point I made before: between the country members of this place we should be able to create a better way for dairy farmers and for others in agricultural industries to be able to plan sensibly for their future knowing with some certainty what the likely returns will be and knowing that there are proper market forces operating. That is not happening now and it is to the detriment of our country and to the detriment of those people who make the financial sacrifices and work their guts out on farms, often for little or no return.</para><para>The next matter I want to raise is an unusual circumstance which has happened in another agricultural industry and is associated with the implementation of the GST. There is a company, Pureharvest, which operates in my electoral district with a factory in Drouin. They made a good point in a letter sent to me recently. They believe there is an anomaly in the list of foods which attract the GST. They point out that, whilst soy and rice milks are exempt from the GST, oat milk attracts the GST. They say that `the processes for manufacture are basically the same for all three products'.</para><para>I am not here to bang the government around the head about the GST; I think that that debate has been had, but it seems to me that we have an anomaly here. It does not seem fair on the basis of what has been pointed out by this company, Pureharvest, in relation to their product. I would urge the government to take on board the point made in this letter that it does seem like a genuine anomaly. It seems like a mistake that the government have made, and they should be big enough to do something about it and act to make sure that we have some sort of consistency in products that have the GST applied to them and products that are exempt. When you think about it, rice milk, soy milk and oat milk are really in the same family of products that people might have an interest in—non-dairy products. I guess they have much the same market, and it just stands to reason that the production process would be very similar.</para><para>So I say to the Howard government: `Please have a look into this, and please see whether you can give some clarity on it.' It would seem to me to be obvious that we need to make sure that oat milk gets the same exemption as rice milk and soy milk. So I would appreciate, and I am sure that Pureharvest and the people that they employ would appreciate, the Howard government having a look at that and trying to clear up this anomaly.</para><para>I also want to talk briefly today about the important issue of petrol prices. For those of us who represent country districts, this is a very important issue, because we do not have the range of public transport opportunities that are available to our good friends who live in the capital cities. We do not have the tram going past our front doors; we do not have the silver train close by, linked to a suburban rail system; and bus services are infrequent. How we get around in country districts is in our cars, and often we have to drive considerable distances just to do our ordinary business. Having a car is not a luxury in a country area. </para><para>I want to read out to the House a letter I saw written to the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun </inline>newspaper by one of my constituents which I think sums it up pretty well. It was written by Julie Ettery, who lives in Leongatha. She wrote, in the 50-50 section of the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun </inline>on 31 May:</para><quote><para>Petrol prices go up, and we are told to either walk or cycle. I drive 60 kilometres to Monash University three times a week. If I walk, maybe I could get there three times a month. If I could do it on a bike, I would be on my way to Athens.</para></quote><para>I think she makes a good point. Cars are not a luxury for people who live in country districts, and we have really been hurt by the very big increases in the cost of petrol which have occurred over the course of the last few months in particular.</para><para>There is a real opportunity for us to do something to try and create some fair dinkum competition in the petroleum industry. I know that governments have, for a long time, looked at this and had report after report into this but have not had the guts to really have a fair dinkum crack at this industry. My view is that we have at our disposal laws which could make a difference in terms of the way petrol prices are determined in Australia. Even blind Freddy could see that there is too much price collusion in the petroleum industry, and this is really to the detriment of ordinary consumers of petroleum products. In particular, it is of great detriment to those people who live in country districts. We often pay petrol prices which are considerably higher than those on offer in the big capital cities. Often we have to look at a very big price differential between what we pay and what people in town pay. We know that there is a cost associated with transporting petrol from the big cities out to where we are. We know that that is true, but we have a rough idea of what the cost is, and it is often about one-tenth of the price differential. We could accept that it costs 1c or 2c per litre to deliver out to somewhere in South Gippsland, West Gippsland or the Latrobe Valley, but it is often not 1c or 2c per litre more that we have to pay—sometimes it is 8c, 9c, 10c, 11c or 12c more. We think there should be some fairness in the system, and the Labor Party has a plan to try and do something about that. These high petrol prices are a huge problem for country people. We have seen over the period that roughly follows the course of the Iraq war a real increase in the instability of the Middle East region, which has led to increases in the petrol prices that people pay at the bowser in South Gippsland, West Gippsland and the Latrobe Valley.</para><para>The Howard government's approach to this issue is to say, `These are international factors; there is nothing we can do about them.' That is not good enough. The federal government is no paper tiger—it is not a weak outfit that is powerless to do anything in the circumstances. The federal government has the opportunity to make laws which will provide for increased competition. We think that that should happen. The Labor Party has put together a plan to try to create some fair competition in the petroleum industry and break the power of big oil companies and to try to help motorists, particularly those in country areas who depend on their cars just to get around to do the ordinary things that make up their daily activities.</para><para>Our plan includes amending the Trade Practices Act to guarantee independent wholesalers and retailers access to fuel supplies from the terminals of the major oil companies on fair terms. Our plan includes allowing independent wholesalers and retailers to bargain collectively when seeking fuel supplies from the terminals of major oil companies. Our plan involves the outlawing of predatory pricing under the Trade Practices Act and strengthening section 46, the abuse of market power provision. That will protect the independents against the market powers of big companies. Our plan also involves giving the ACCC the power to issue cease and desist orders to provide immediate relief against market abuse and anticompetitive behaviour. </para><para>We think that those parts of our plan will make a real difference in creating some fair dinkum competition in the petroleum industry. That will make a big difference to people living in South Gippsland, West Gippsland and the Latrobe Valley, and to people who live in the Pakenham district who are commuting big distances just to get to their jobs every day. You need to have regard for the effect of high fuel costs on people's weekly budgets. People often pay $100 a week for petrol. That is a huge cost. When petrol prices go up, as we have seen in the last few months in particular and particularly over the last eight or nine months, it has a huge impact on people's weekly budgets. That is why we have developed our plan and why we think that the government should take a similar line and do something about addressing this important issue.</para><para>In my remaining time let me mention one of the other great agricultural and horticultural industries of Australia: the apple and pear industry. It is a great industry in which people have made a great contribution to the nation's economy over many generations. Over the last four or five years we have had a big debate in this place about whether we should allow apples from New Zealand which are infected with fire blight to come into Australia.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">A division having been called in the House of Representatives—</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Sitting suspended from 12.09 p.m. to 12.20 p.m.</inline></para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>84H</name.id><name role="metadata">Zahra, Christian, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ZAHRA</name></talker><para>—The risk of fire blight affected apples coming into Australia is a very real threat to the apple and pear industry. I appeal to the government not to allow this issue to drag on any longer. We have had four or five years of apple and pear growers having to campaign to keep fire blight apples out of the country, instead of being able to focus on their businesses. Apple and pear growers have said to me that they feel this is a huge amount of time that they could be using for more productive purposes for their businesses—and, I am sure, for the apple and pear industry more generally.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I say to the government: what right does anyone have to destroy someone's livelihood in the interests of trade? We have apple and pear growers in this country, in many cases second and third generation people, who have worked hard their whole lives and struggled to be part of an industry that has generated a lot of prosperity for Australia. They have been good contributors in our local communities, and I think the federal government owes them something better than what is going on now with the politicisation of the import risk assessment process.</para><para>We want a system which is based only on science. Under the Howard government, we have not seen a system which is based only on science. I appeal to the government to ban the importation of fire blight affected apples and give this industry the certainty they need to put this issue behind them and focus on growing their businesses and the industry in the best interests of our country. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>30003</page.no><name role="metadata">Prosser, Geoff, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PROSSER</name><name.id>RI4</name.id><electorate>Forrest</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R2040">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2004-2005</inline> and to support this government's ninth budget.

By repaying the debt and running budget surpluses, we have been able to redirect money that previously went to paying interest on Labor's debt into national security and defence, health, education and better lives for our families. Australia's fiscal outlook remains positive, and this government will maintain the budget in surplus after providing $36.7 billion in new assistance for families through family tax benefit arrangements; maternity payments and child-care funding; cutting income tax; boosting retirement savings; and providing for carers and aged care. </para></talk.start><para>Residents and businesses in my electorate of Forrest in the south-west of Western Australia—and, indeed, throughout Australia—have benefited from the continued sound economic management of this federal Liberal government.

It is expected that a stronger world economy in 2004-05 will provide a renewed source of demand for our exports.

The percentage of the working age population in employment is at its highest level for 30 years, and the prospects remain good for keeping unemployment below six per cent over the forecast horizon.</para><para>I enjoy explaining the economic background and debt reduction to my constituents so they can understand that reducing debt and reducing the interest payment burden gives this government opportunities to spend on other priorities. This government is about putting the dividends of good economic management back into the community, whether that be through more money for services, increased family tax benefits or tax cuts for individuals.</para><para>This budget ensures that spending on health has more than doubled under the Liberal coalition, from $17 billion in 1996-97 to $35 billion today. Medicare has been strengthened with a new safety net that protects Australians from high out-of-hospital medical bills and with funding for 1,500 more doctors and 1,600 more practice nurses, as well as more bulk-billing incentives. In this budget, help will be given to those who find it difficult to control diabetes with injections, and I am very pleased with the funding assistance provided for profoundly deaf children for cochlear implant speech processors.</para><para>This budget provides a range of measures to ensure aged care services are affordable, accessible, appropriate and of high quality into the future. The demographics of my electorate in the south-west of Western Australia indicate huge growth, but obviously with that growth comes higher demand for aged care facilities with a lot of people moving to coastal areas. Since coming to office in 1996, the Howard government has provided more than 55,600 new places in community care and residential care. In responding to the growing demand, we are on target to meet our aim of 200,000 places by June 2006.</para><para>This budget continues to provide increases in the number of aged care places—in fact, $58 million for 27,900 new places over the next three years, including 13,000 this year, which represents 770 aged care places for Western Australia. The quality of care in aged care homes will be improved by enhancing the skills of aged care workers, while 1,600 aged care nurses will begin training over the next four years to better prepare for the growth in our ageing population. These are important responses to our direct longterm problem of an ageing nation. But solving these sorts of problems is not a cheap or easy exercise. In 2002 the percentage of our population over 65 was 12.8 per cent; in 2042 it will be 24.5 per cent. This represents unique challenges. </para><para>Locally in my electorate of Forrest, in the south-west of Western Australia, we are doing pretty well with aged care, but that has not always been the case. When I identified there was a problem, I called in the local providers and assessed what needed to be done and we set about achieving outcomes. I am delighted today to be able to say that, over the last few budgets, many of our local providers' problems have been solved. There will be a 160-bed facility owned by Churches of Christ in Leschenault and we have addressed capital and bed requirements in Donnybrook, Bridgetown, Manjimup and Busselton. We are currently working on additional places for Harvey and a home in Dunsborough and we are fixing the problems in Collie. It again shows that, if you have the money to address these priorities, effective local representation and the necessary commitment, the results will follow.</para><para>Local carers who make a great contribution to our community have also been acknowledged in this budget with the one-off $1,000 lump sum bonus payment to be paid to eligible carers in June, in recognition of the approximately 80,000 people who carry out their role in caring for a person with a disability. Also a $600 bonus payment will be provided to 300,000 recipients of the carer allowance at the payment date. This bonus, I might add, is tax-free free and will not be treated as income when calculating social security payments. People who are devoted to caring for disabled people are Australia's unsung heroes; the budget can afford to deliver more help and there is no group more deserving. From 1 July 2005 the coalition will allocate $107 million to enable approximately 13,000 carers who provide substantial levels of personal care while not living with the recipient to receive the carers allowance. Also a further $99 million will be allocated to expand the access of carers to respite services.</para><para>What were not so well publicised were the extra childcare places to be allocated: an additional 40,000 family day care places and 40,000 outside school hours places. Since 1996, there has been an 85 per cent increase in the number of day care places. The south-west has been a major beneficiary of this increase. It was not so long ago that parents could not get places locally, either in a centre or in a local community, with some centres having waiting lists on which there were as many as 60 names. Now there is plenty of choice. Places like Pemberton and Harvey now have centres and we are working towards having a community centre in Walpole. I am acutely aware that we are still short on family day care locally, but with this budget announcement of new places and my working with the minister we should be able to solve this problem. The new maternity payment and the expansion of outside school hours child care and family day care places will assist families in balancing work and family commitments. These changes to family tax benefits will help women re-enter the work force after having children. Good economic management has a direct bearing on the services we are able to supply locally.</para><para>The government are committed to investing in our next generation by investing in education to ensure a skilled, productive and healthy work force and society. Funding for schools at $32 billion represents an increase of $8.2 billion over the last four years, conditional on the states implementing standards of reporting to parents on the progress of their children's literacy skills. The coalition will provide $2.6 billion over five years in new funding for universities and deliver reforms that allow universities to better tailor their courses to student demand. The coalition will further increase our focus on the 70 per cent of students who do not go directly to university by spending more than $725 million on new apprenticeships. Currently 406,900 Australians are training as apprentices. </para><para>In order to increase the efficiency and productivity of our economy, which naturally leads to increased demand on road and rail, the government is providing a further $1.1 billion over five years for our road and rail system. This is in addition to the $2 billion announced in January this year to upgrade our road and rail system. This will improve the safety of Australia's major highways and make it quicker and cheaper to transport freight. This funding is in addition to the funding already announced under the Roads to Recovery program, where my electorate of Forrest has seen high spending by the Commonwealth government, money going direct to local governments, for improving roads that the local community deem important. It is disappointing that, at a time when the federal government is putting more money into roads, the state government is not matching it and in fact is cutting its vital funding to road infrastructure.</para><para>Next week the minister will be making further announcements on specific spending proposals to be contained in the AusLink package, which is our road and rail infrastructure investment program. I am looking forward to the funding announcement this week of the Mandurah Bypass—or the Peel Deviation, as it is sometimes known—as part of the AusLink package. The Mandurah Bypass will mean faster road access from Perth through to the south-west regional centres like Bunbury, Busselton and Margaret River and further south to Manjimup, Pemberton, Northcliffe and beyond, and, obviously, better access for products and producers in the south-west to markets in the city and export destinations.</para><para>The small business community has not been forgotten, with numerous measures to help streamline the tax process, one of which will see businesses with sales of less than $50,000 able to keep and use the GST for a year. This will reduce the compliance cost for up to 740,000 small businesses, as well as 30,000 non-profit organisations. WET, the wine tax relief, is another important initiative for industry and small business in my electorate. I was heavily involved in lobbying the Prime Minister for WET relief for local wineries from Harvey through to Capel, Margaret River and Pemberton. The $290,000 WET rebate will mean that a vast majority of local wineries will not pay WET, which I know will make a huge difference to the industry.</para><para>I believe the south-west of Western Australia contains the world's premium wine-producing areas, from Harvey to Margaret River and through to Pemberton. This will make a big difference to their trading. I have worked hard for WET relief, along with a number of my colleagues. I brought the Treasurer to my electorate in 2002 to meet representatives of the wine industry and view these premium wine-growing areas. The WET relief for wine producers will effectively take some 90 per cent of wine producers out of the WET system. I am delighted that this proposal has been adopted.</para><para>I am also pleased with the additional funding of $54.4 million from 1 July 2005 for three years to boost ABC regional and local programming. This funding will allow the continuation of successful regional and local programming initiatives already in place and provide the ABC with certainty in developing its forward plans for local and regional programming and operations. Regional communities are the major beneficiaries of improved locally driven programs and content. I am pleased to hear that there will also be additional employment opportunities in Bunbury, with the ABC having funding for extra staff. </para><para>I am also very happy to report that the government has provided $15 million in this budget for the Western Australian forestry industry and its communities to help rebuild the once vibrant industry and to help offset the effects of the Western Australian government's decision to drastically reduce logging quotas. The Howard government is committed to providing those in the industry with the security they need at this crucial time. We have provided two funding streams for the industry. The first program will provide $12.5 million over two years under the forestry assistance program for Western Australia to promote investment and long-term job creation in the industry. The second funding stream will provide a further $2.5 million for Western Australian timber communities under the grants for forest communities program. The Australian government is determined to assist country communities to help themselves through a range of projects that can restore morale, and this program will provide grants of between $5,000 and $100,000 for eligible community based initiatives.</para><para>Some people look at budgets and say, `What's in it for me?' and, if they do not get a tax cut or a discount, conclude that it is not a good budget. The point is that they look at budgets in isolation—from year to year—when, in reality, the government must balance the priorities over an entire three-year term. More than balancing priorities, budgets must also be framed with economic circumstances in mind. You can spend money only when it has been collected—and that occurs only when people have jobs and businesses are doing well.</para><para>The 2001-02 budget focused on seniors and self-funded retirees as well as defence spending; the 2002-03 budget focused on national security, health and higher education; and last year's budget produced across-the-board tax cuts. This budget has seen the emphasis placed on families, tax cuts for those on incomes above $52,000 and wine tax relief as well as continuing our commitment to road funding and aged care. So, on the whole, people have gained some benefits from the last three budgets, while we have endeavoured to keep the economy strong and keep our borders secure.</para><para>I emphasise again that the government can and should provide dividends but only when they are affordable. This component of the budget has basically delivered ongoing tax reform from when we started the process on 1 July 2000. The tax cuts in this budget improve rewards for working overtime and for gaining promotion. They increase the income threshold for the 42 per cent tax rate to $58,000 in 2004-05 and increase it again to $63,000 in the 2005-06 financial year. The income threshold for the 47 per cent tax rate will be increased to $70,000 in the 2004-05 budget year and to $80,000 in the 2005-06 financial year. These reforms will mean that 80 per cent of workers will remain in the 30 per cent tax bracket for at least the next four years.</para><para>By boosting retirement savings we can better prepare our ageing population. The allocation of $2.7 billion will enhance the superannuation co-contribution scheme and reduce the superannuation surcharge, which will boost incentives for such retirement savings. We estimate that more than three-quarters of the benefits will go to low- and middle-income earners.</para><para>Although I have outlined only some of the major focuses of this budget, some people have said to me, `There's no tax cut in it for me,' or `I don't have a family.' To those people I say that you cannot view a budget in isolation; you must look at the budgets over the three years to see the full plan. Secondly, I say that the best education, tax and health policies come from a strong economy. The reason for that is that it gives you choices. Not having to repay, as we did, $8,700 million in interest payments on the previous government's debts, frees up money for other things—families, health, education and roads. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>30008</page.no><name role="metadata">Snowdon, Warren, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SNOWDON</name><name.id>IJ4</name.id><electorate>Lingiari</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In the context of this debate on the <inline ref="R2040">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2004-2005</inline>, which I understand is a broad-ranging discussion on matters, I want to for a moment refer to the drivers of small business—and one in particular. I note that my friend the member for Holt, who is sitting in the chamber, is fully aware of these people, because his father has made a massive contribution to the economy of the Northern Territory, particularly in the mining industry where he was responsible for the development and running of Giants Reef, which is a magnificent resource in the Tennant Creek district. But it is not about that that I want to talk. I do however want to talk about someone who spent some time in Tennant Creek—although a long time before the time of my dear friend's father. I want to speak about Len Kittle, who passed away in Alice Springs early in the week at the age of 86. I want to use a small amount of the time that I have this afternoon to pay tribute to Len.</para></talk.start><para>Len arrived in Tennant Creek in Central Australia in the thirties. He went away to war and afterwards came back to Tennant Creek and set up a business, which flourished. That business still survives. He was awarded the General Motors franchise in November 1945. That business, Kittle Bros, flourished in Tennant Creek. Len and his wife Phyllis had a family and decided to relocate to Alice Springs, which at that stage, in 1958, had a population of around 3,000 and clearly more amenities than Tennant Creek. Len took over the GMH dealership in Alice Springs and since then Len's company, Kittle Bros, has been operating on a continuous basis selling vehicles in Central Australia. </para><para>It is important that we appreciate that Len and his family have made an enormous contribution not only to the economic life of Central Australia but also to the community generally. That has been earmarked by his involvement with the Rotary Club of Alice Springs, the Central Australian Show Society, the Alice Springs Town Council and the Alice Springs Youth Centre. This was all recognised in 1982, when Len was awarded the Order of Australia. It was very much deserved. Len was also a founding member of the Country Liberal Party in the Northern Territory at its formation in 1974. Whilst we may have shared different political allegiances, it is very clear that he and his family had an enormous commitment to Central Australia and to developing business opportunities in the Centre. </para><para>I pay tribute to Len and his family. He was a very devoted family man. He and his wife Phyllis had six children, which is an indication of their commitment to each other and also to the Centre. Len is survived by his family: his wife, Phyllis; sons Robert and Peter; daughters, Heather, Gwen, Sylvia and Shirley; and his 14 grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren. To these people, I offer my greatest sympathies. I want them to know that their father, their grandfather, made an enormous contribution to the life of Central Australia and made an enormous impression on all those people he came in contact with. </para><para>Now let me address some of the important items in the budget. One of the issues which I have already spoken about in this place or in the main chamber on a number of occasions is the Treasurer announced tax cuts in the budget. It is worthwhile noting that the ABS publishes income statistics for individuals aged 15 and over by electorate. These figures are bracketed into segments ranging from zero dollars per week to $1,500 or more. By eliminating the top brackets where individuals earn more than $1,000 per week—$52,000 a year—you get the number of income earners in the electorate who will get any benefit from the new tax thresholds that were announced in the budget. In my own electorate, 88 per cent of wage earners, salary earners, income earners, will get no benefit at all from these tax cuts. In the seat of Solomon, which is my neighbouring electorate to the north, 85 per cent of the electorate will get no benefit from these tax cuts.  </para><para>I ought to point out that this is in contrast to some of the seats of my blue-blood friends in the Liberal Party. If you go to the seat of North Sydney, held by Mr Hockey, only 65 per cent of the electorate will not benefit from these tax cuts. Such electorates have a material advantage, which is no surprise, given the nature of this government. What we need to understand is that there are localities that benefit most from the tax cuts—by and large, metropolitan localities—although it is also true that some of those more depressed suburbs in Western Sydney do very badly out of this arrangement.</para><para>In my electorate a greater number are disadvantaged—with no tax cut. My electorate has less home ownership, fewer schools, and less access to health services than the electorates of North Sydney, Bennelong, Bradford, which I mentioned, and other electorates which I am sure people are aware of and understand what I am talking about in relation to my blue-blooded friends opposite. I wonder how many of the constituents of the member in the chamber, the member for Boothby, are going to be deprived of a tax cut. I am sure it will be nowhere near the number of constituents I have who are deprived of a tax cut as a result of this government's decisions.</para><para>But if there are a large number, let him say so. I do not hear many of the government members waltzing around the electorate saying so. Indeed, the member for Solomon has not walked into the electorate and said: `Hello, I earn just over a hundred grand a year; I've just got a tax cut. It's terrific! But you poor beggars who earn less than $52,000 a year'—85 per cent of my electorate—`are going to miss out.'

In the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> of 13 May this year, an item by economics editor Alan Mitchell referred to the issue of bracket creep. He said:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>Average tax rates will rise, even for those taxpayers whose top marginal tax rate remains constant at 30 per cent.</para><para>In fact, bracket creep will make quite a handy contribution to the financing of the Howard government's election-year spending promises. </para><para>Most ... spending programs are costed over four or five years. Over that period, bracket creep will claw back between $9 billion and $13 billion.</para></quote><para>I think the situation is very clear. On what electorates is this burden now falling at a greater rate—electorates with larger incomes and more home ownership? No; it impacts on electorates like Lingiari, where access to basic services such as education and health and infrastructure such as roads and telecommunications are not to a standard you see in the seat of Bradford—or I am sure in my good friend opposite's electorate—and certainly not in the seats of Bennelong or North Sydney. In the electorate of Lingiari, this budget has not delivered for, as I said, the 88 per cent of income earners who do not receive tax cuts. </para><para>There are a number of issues that clearly demonstrate the disadvantage faced by those people, particularly those who live in more remote communities, which have not been properly addressed in this budget. The first of those issues is roads. The previously announced next round of funding for the Roads to Recovery program reveals little for the electors of Lingiari. It is more of the same, and Territorians living in remote communities and travelling on roads in unincorporated areas will be disappointed. For them there is no relief from the winding-up of the Fuel Sales Grants Scheme.</para><para>There are a number of questions that need to be answered following the announcement by Ministers Anderson and Campbell of a new Roads to Recovery program. Question 1 is: is there any funding for bush roads in unincorporated areas? The government's argument is that Territorian road users need to be aware that any increase in fuel prices due to the winding-up of the fuel sales grant scheme will be compensated by increased road funding. That is the federal government's argument. If this is the case, the Territory should get a substantial increase in road funding. It would not be unreasonable for the Northern Territory to get an increase of at least $10 million to $15 million in road funding, given the fuel sales grant was worth in the order of $3 million annually to the Territory. Question 2: has the percentage of national funding allocated to the Northern Territory been increased? Remember that in the previous funding package the Territory's cut was reduced from 2.3 per cent of the national total to 1.7 per cent—a reduction of $8.1 million from $28.1 million to $20 million.</para><para>Question 3 is: under the new arrangements how much more will regional and remote Australians pay for fuel in comparison to their city cousins, and why are Territorians still paying the highest fuel taxes in Australia? In Alice Springs unleaded fuel is currently 115.9c a litre. Along the Stuart Highway it is as high as $1.30 to $1.40. In off-road communities it is probably $1.50 or $1.60. Question 4: a component of the new Roads to Recovery program is not formula based. How will the minister for transport decide how the non-formula component is spent? Of course he will just wind up the old marginal seats exercise. He will do as he has done previously. These are the basic questions that require answering. He should also tell us why he has not come good with the $20 million he offered the cattlemen in the Northern Territory for beef roads—$20 million over four years. It does not appear anywhere. Will they get it out of this new Roads to Recovery program? What is he going to do about providing appropriate funding for roads on unincorporated land?</para><para>Another important issue arises out of proposals in the Department of Education, Science and Training. In April the minister announced some major changes to funding the Indigenous Education Direct Assistance Program. The changes have come about following a review of the Indigenous Education Direct Assistance Program. The reform of the existing program is raising a number of questions amongst parents and school groups in the electorate and indeed in other parts of Australia. They are raising questions about the redirection of resources and they are concerned that Indigenous students in remote areas—those in greatest need of assistance—will continue to miss out under the new arrangements. An essential plank of IEDA since 1991 has been the development of Aboriginal student support and parent awareness committees. There are currently 3,900 of those committees around Australia. They have achieved great success in involving Indigenous people in education decision making. They have led to partnerships and better understanding across the community and this value adding has benefited Australian education across the board. </para><para>My electorate of Lingiari has an Indigenous population of around 45 per cent of the total population. I have been well placed to identify and see activities in action in communities over many years. I have seen greater participation and interaction with Indigenous parents in schools across the Territory and greater cooperation between parents, teachers and communities, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous, to improve the access of Indigenous students to education and bring about greater attendance and improved educational outcomes. These are long-term activities which go beyond the easily identifiable activities of ASSPA committees such as enabling Indigenous students to participate in school based education, sporting excursions and cultural activities. Parent representatives of ASSPA committees and school principals have contacted my office, expressing their concerns that the new arrangements for ASSPA committees will no longer formally exist and that the discontinuance of formula based funding will negatively impact on the progress that has been made during the last 12 to 14 years.</para><para>There is concern that the shift to submission based funding will remove the essential elements of parent participation and decision making from the hands of Indigenous parents at the grassroots level in the classrooms and schools and into the hands of skilled submission writers and bureaucrats who are removed from the areas of need. Concern has also been expressed again by teachers, principals and parents about the extent of the review of the Indigenous Education Direct Assistance Program and the conclusion that the government has drawn from the review in order to change the arrangements for direct assistance. There is a feeling that the consultation was not extensive and that opportunities for input were not extensively canvassed. Further, parents, principals and teachers are concerned that information about the changes is not reaching those most targeted by the changes: parents in Indigenous communities in remote communities. </para><para>I can speak with authority on these issues. There are communities in my electorate where English is a second, third or fourth language. How have these communities been informed about the changes that are to take place? Were they consulted? Why have they not been told of the changes? Or do they understand how the new arrangements will work? I fear not. In fact I know, because I had a meeting with a number of teachers and parents from the Walpiri Triangle schools, Willowra and Lajamanu, and recently at Yuendumu. I asked those present at the service whether they were aware of the changes. They had no idea of them. That is not surprising, because we learnt yesterday in estimates about the consultation process for this little exercise, which was clearly drummed up inside the department, notably, I suspect at the direction of the minister. </para><para>There were two internal discussion papers. A third discussion paper was distributed to 400 of the 3,900 ASSPA committees that exist. So, instead of having an extensive and wide consultation with all of the ASSPA committees around Australia, they selected 400 ASSPA committees. How many responses do you think they got from those ASSPA committees? Only 10. What percentage is 10 out of 3,900? I will get my colleague Mr Byrne, who is here, to work it out and in a moment he will tell me and I will come back with the answer. But it ain't a lot.</para><para>We also know that they only had 62 written submissions. That included the 10 from the ASSPA committees. This process of consultation with Indigenous Australians was a selective exercise. There was no going out and talking to parent communities, there was no talking to school communities, there was no talking to school principals and their committees together, there was no talking to teachers; yet here we have a government that says it is trying to do something to assist Indigenous Australians in education. What they have done, quite clearly and deliberately, in this budget is reduce the funding for ASSPA committees from $19 million across Australia to $15 million.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>008K0</name.id><name role="metadata">Byrne, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Byrne</name></talker><para>—It is 0.25 per cent.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>IJ4</name.id><name role="metadata">Snowdon, Warren, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SNOWDON</name></talker><para>—The number of responses from ASSPA committees to this proposal was 0.25 per cent of the total number of ASSPA committees. How could that be seen as any serious attempt at consultation or even information sharing? There was no serious attempt. The people who are going to suffer as result of this pre-emptive action by this government are going to be Indigenous Australians, those people who most need assistance in education. I have spoken about that issue time and time again in this parliament. We also hear that the government are going to change the Tutorial Assistance Program so that you can only get tutorial assistance in years 3, 5 and 7. Why is this? Because it is after years of MAP testing. What they are saying is that they are not prepared to provide early intervention tutorial assistance for kids who start primary school.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We know, in Indigenous education, that students need this assistance throughout their school lives. The additional assistance which is provided by these funds ought to be made available throughout the school lives of these students, not when they have fallen through the cracks. That is just not good enough. What the government are proposing to do is to identify those people who fail and then try to bring them up. Why would you not start at the very beginning and say: `We'll give you the best opportunity that we possibly can. We'll provide you with the best information, the best assistance, the best advice, the best support that is currently available,' instead of being selective about it? This is a shame and something which needs to be addressed by the government. It is something which I believe will have a serious impact upon the educational opportunities for many Indigenous Australians and certainly those Indigenous Australians who live in my electorate.</para><para>How can the government say that there is not going to be any material impact on these ASSPA committees? The government have cut the expenditure from $19 million a year to just over $15 million a year and have then said, as they have said in these proposals, that all the funds will now be submission based. They are expecting these small Indigenous schools in very remote communities to write submissions to the department to get access to these funds. What lunacy! That shows an absolute ignorance and an absolute neglect of the needs of Indigenous Australians, and particularly those who live in remote communities. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>30013</page.no><name role="metadata">Anthony, Larry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANTHONY</name><name.id>XJ6</name.id><electorate>Richmond</electorate><party>NATS</party><role>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It gives me great pleasure to talk on this <inline ref="R2040">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2004-2005</inline> and, in particular, about the federal budget and the huge win for Australian families.

As the first ever Minister for Children and Youth Affairs I unashamedly have pushed for a greater family focus in this budget, which delivers real assistance where it counts. The budget will help local families to raise their children and manage the balancing act of work and home life. Over 13,000 families in Richmond will receive a $600 one-off payment for each child before July 2004. On top of this, to families receiving family tax benefit A we will be delivering an ongoing increase in the maximum base rates worth $600 for each child for 2004-05 and every year thereafter. In real terms, these changes mean that an eligible North Coast family with two children will be $2,400 a year better off in their hip pocket in 2004-05.</para></talk.start><para>To assist families with the cost of newborns, the federal budget will deliver a universal maternity payment of $3,000, rising to $5,000 in 2004. The real area of interest is child care, where there has been a very large boost in assistance. From 5 July 2004, almost 6,000 families in the Richmond electorate will receive an increase in their child-care benefit payment. Local families with one child in full-time care will receive an extra $3.50 per week and those with two children will receive $7.50 per week. Richmond families will have their share of the 40,000 outside school hours care places and the 4,000 family day care places that we have allocated in the budget.</para><para>There are tremendous advantages for Richmond families, but also for the carers, who I think have not been spoken about enough. One of the key components of the budget is the $255 million that will assist those on carer payment or carer allowance. The $1,000 bonus for recipients of carers payment will go to over 800 Richmond residents, and the $600 payment for the carer allowance will assist 2,500 recipients. I have to say that these people do a remarkable job looking after their loved ones. It might be a wife or husband looking after their loved one or a disabled child, or it could even be a child or a parent looking after a disabled grandparent. </para><para>The expansion of the eligibility criteria for the carer allowance is worth $470 million over four years. We have increased access to respite care, which is particularly important for older carers. Again, when it comes to aged care, on the North Coast of New South Wales we certainly see a high elderly population. So the increases in the budget for aged care—in particular, the $3,500 payment for each resident—are very welcome. When Julie Bishop comes to the Richmond electorate next week she will be opening Bangalor Retreat, a world-class age-in-placement retirement facility. She will also have the opportunity of visiting a community based hostel at Womin Bay, along with a lot of the respite carers in the Tweed and Alstonville. They will benefit substantially from the budget. They will have their fair share of the 28,000 places that will be allocated over the next three years.</para><para>Another aged group are the veterans. We have over 7,000 residents in Richmond who are receiving some sort of support payment from the Department of Veterans' Affairs and they will be big beneficiaries, particularly from the government's commitment to defence and to recognising those people who have served their country. There will be $481 million for veterans over the next four years in this budget. This includes $158 million over four years for: the exemption of veterans disability pension—aided by Centrelink—from the means test that is applied to income support payments; the extension of rent assistance of up to $95 per fortnight for war widows and widowers; the ex gratia payment of $25,000 for surviving prisoners of war who were held in captivity in the Korean War; an increase in the maximum funeral benefit; and, very importantly, more money for supporting war graves and other commemorative activities. The budget is very positive when it comes to the aged population, veterans and, most importantly, families. The tax cuts will mean that 80 per cent of taxpayers will pay no more than 30 per cent tax in their tax bracket. </para><para>Health is particularly important to the high population of elderly people, families and young people in Richmond. The new MedicarePlus package is about encouraging more doctors and nurses to come to the North Coast and trying to help with out-of-pocket expenses. That is why the Medicare safety net is so important. It is most regrettable that the Labor Party has opposed this safety net which will benefit thousands of Richmond constituents. When they reach the $300 mark in medical expenses we will pick up 80 per cent beyond that. Those who are not receiving the family tax benefit will also benefit once they have paid over $700.</para><para>What I like about the safety net is that it covers not just GP and specialist consultations but also blood tests, X-rays, radiotherapy and pap smears. I will be ensuring that we can get our fair share of those extra 1,500 doctors in MedicarePlus. The real kicker is that bulk-billing rates no doubt will start to move back up on the North Coast with that additional $7.50 payment to doctors for bulk-billing. This is a very positive initiative and I cannot understand why the ALP blocked these measures.</para><para>Unemployment is complex and a serious issue. Encouragingly, we have seen a falling unemployment rate on the North Coast. I have been working hard, along with the government, to provide opportunities for both casual and long-term permanent employment. It is great to say that construction is in progress of the new Centrelink call centre. That will be completed by the middle of this year or a bit beyond that. We are looking at an additional 100 jobs on top of the 200 already in place through a call centre placed there a few years ago. Financial assistance through Sustainable Regions is going to Boral in Murwillumbah, again yielding 100 new jobs. Through the Sustainable Regions program we have been able to assist local businesses such as Sunnybrand chicken hatchery, a big project in the electorate of Page. I had the pleasure of visiting their operation in Byron Bay, where they do a lot of the killing of the chickens. Again, employment will be rising at Sunnybrand Byron Bay by 15 per cent to over 300 staff. It is a very good example of where the Commonwealth can directly help private enterprise create more jobs and more opportunity.</para><para>We have also seen new apprenticeships at an all-time high. The Green Corps program is yielding fantastic results for young people right across the electorate. The good thing is that the unemployment rate is continuing to fall. The official unemployment rate for the North Coast is at a record low of 7.7 per cent, down from 10.7 per cent in March 1996 and very significantly down from the halcyon days of Hawke and Keating in 1992, when we had unemployment rates around 17 per cent. While the official unemployment figure for youth sits at 14.9 per cent, this also is trending down from 23.4 per cent when we came to office in 1996. I must admit I am sick and tired of seeing Labor Party candidates in particular skewing unemployment figures trying to paint the population of the North Coast and Richmond as second-class citizens. I am sick and tired of Labor being so negative about the Richmond electorate when we have so much that is positive to offer. Words are cheap; they are certainly cheap from the Labor Party. But these are complex problems and through sustained economic growth, through good management, through local programs, we are actually starting to alleviate some of the real hardship and are providing job opportunities for the young and the not so young who lose their jobs later in life. </para><para>On the environment, I must say that I am very passionate that we live in such a beautiful area of the country. Environmentally we have access to World Heritage listed national parks, marine parks and nature reserves. There is no other area that has such concentration and diversity of flora and fauna, right up to the north-eastern corner. That is why it is even more important to protect and maintain our pristine coastal environment and manage the conflicting interests that we see in people moving to the area and development.</para><para>Earlier this year it was great that we had Dr David Kemp come up to the Far North Coast and announce a $2.5 million investment in the region. Of that, $400,000 went into the Murwillumbah-Tweed region in particular, again identifying the border ranges for their biodiversity—there is a real hotspot there—and providing a strategy of managing those values. Funding also went into the Northern Rivers catchment area, where it is very important to address the acid sulfate problems which we see extensively now in our coastal rivers. I have to say, though, hats off to those in the rural sector, particularly those cane growers who have taken control of their own destiny and are doing a terrific job in managing those acid sulfate soils. This has direct consequences for the broader catchment area. It is good to see stream bank rehabilitation as well, where on the beautiful Tweed River $60,000 was allocated, along with emphasis being placed on other estuaries like the Brunswick River, going down into your area, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, the Richmond River and beyond. </para><para>I congratulate all those hardworking community groups who are involved in that area. Particularly I would like to name a few who have been beneficiaries of grants in the past. We have Carool Community Network, Tweed Brunswick Care Coordinating Committee, Brunswick Catchment Forest Landcare Group, Tyagarah Landcare Group, High Ridges and Brushbox Valley Catchment Area, Duck Creek Landcare Group, Rainforest Way Landcare Group and the Subtropical Farm Forestry Association. They have all been beneficiaries of some of this funding and do a great job, along with Envirofund, which works very hard.</para><para>I want to make particular mention of the Landcare groups. I think Landcare, and the role that the coalition government has taken in supporting Landcare, has been a great way of bridging the divide between traditional residents of the area and a lot of the new residents. Landcare concentrates on local projects in its communities and organises, through conservation volunteers, groups in areas such as Huonbrook and Wilsons Creek. Hats off to Sue Riley, and John and Kyrsia McLeod for what they are doing in that part of the Byron shire.</para><para>We also see this happening with Coastcare, including in areas down on Flat Rock near Ballina and near Lennox Head. Significant work is being done by the Angels Beach Dune Care and Reafforestation Group. I take my hat off to Shirley White and people such as Councillor Alan Rich, who has a real interest there. Whilst on that note, I would like to congratulate Ballina Shire Council, particularly the mayor who got re-elected, Phil Silver, and the other mayors in the area—Jan Barham in the Byron Shire and the re-elected Warren Polglase, who is doing a great job in the Tweed Shire. </para><para>One thing I want to spend some time on—something I am very concerned about—is that, whilst the Commonwealth government is putting more and more money into transport issues, the New South Wales Labor government has made the destructive and vandalistic decision to close the Casino to Murwillumbah line. This is an absolute disgrace. There has been vigorous community support by local councils and private citizens—and, I might even say, by some members of the Labor Party, although not by their elected officials—in opposing this vandalistic decision to close down a railway line which has served us well for over a hundred years. At a time when we are expanding railways—it took us 100 years to connect the line from Alice Springs to Darwin—and we are putting the line back in from Brisbane to the Tweed border that was ripped out over 50 years ago, we have this ridiculous decision to shut down the branch line when, quite frankly, we should be encouraging people to get off the road and onto rail. We should get freight off the road and onto rail, particularly in New South Wales, where the freight task will triple over the next 20 years.</para><para>I am extremely disappointed that we have not seen any commitment, or even pressure on the state government, from the federal ALP to overturn this arrogant and contemptuous decision, which just further emphasises that the New South Wales state government is a Sydney-centric government. I suppose if we saw a federal Labor government in power then we would also see a centralisation of views to either the outer western suburbs of Sydney or other metropolitan areas, at the expense of rural and regional Australia. There is no doubt that they have failed to preserve the line that we have or to provide a vision of where we could be in the future.</para><para>Some lateral decisions could be made here. Putting rail motors on the North Coast line could help solve some of our public transport issues, particularly for people in Byron shire and people travelling to Southern Cross University. The huge traffic congestion that we see in Byron Bay in particular could be overcome tomorrow by running light trains between our villages. This would also accommodate for a track which has deteriorated over the last few years. But what we see is a decision by the state ALP government to shut down the railway line. At the same time, though, they are quite happy to spend $1.5 billion on airconditioning trains on the Sydney rail network, at the expense of regional communities. Replacing country services with buses is unacceptable. Elderly and disabled people cannot get on them and, quite frankly, in the last two weeks we have seen that the patronage levels have been appalling, with only one to two people.</para><para>This contrasts very significantly—and I congratulate John Anderson—with the amount of money in the budget that we are putting into transport—into road and, in particular, into rail. We will announce next week that, through the Australian Rail Track Corporation, there are hundreds of millions of dollars that will go into rail, particularly into the main lines. Again, this is about encouraging freight to get off the road and onto rail. I cannot fathom, when we are putting this huge capital expenditure into the main lines, why the state government cannot keep the branch lines open. Passenger services are their responsibility. Be that as it may, the member for Page and I have argued for a feasibility study, which the government will be funding, to see what can be done on that track through light trains. Tenders are being sought from Tweed Shire Council, and I want to congratulate the mayors who have worked on that, including those from Tweed and Lismore. It is not often that I fight side by side with a Green mayor, but I have to say Jan Barham has been right on the money when it comes to supporting our railway line against an ALP state government that is hell bent on treating us like second-class citizens. </para><para>The other area is the sugar package. There has been a very large increase in funding through our sugar industry reform package to try to provide a sustainable industry through the cogeneration project, and we wish them well, along with the New South Wales Sugar Milling Cooperative, in getting that off the ground.</para><para>There is massive expenditure on roads, $11.4 billion, which will go into transport, particularly Roads to Recovery and the national Black Spots Roads Program. There is a direct commitment of over $3.1 billion to major transport networks. However, a priority is to ensure that Sexton Hill is upgraded—it is called the Banora Point deviation—which is a responsibility of the New South Wales government that they have failed to fulfil, notwithstanding the money that we have put in through our 10-year agreement. The Ballina bypass is another road where more effort needs to be made.</para><para>We hope that through our initiative next week we can at least get the ball rolling and push a recalcitrant New South Wales government into fulfilling their part of the bargain and starting to take local roads seriously. They cannot have it both ways; they cannot shut down our railway lines and not fix the roads. Until last week they refused even to support the Tugun bypass; they would not put one cent into it—and of course now they are practising brinkmanship and trying to blackmail the federal government over responsibility for the Pacific Highway, which they should bear. So we hope that they honour their commitment and start building vital infrastructure for the local families and the elderly that use those transport systems.</para><para>The budget provides $10.4 billion in Commonwealth funding for education in New South Wales over the next four years. It is a very large increase. There is $2 billion to assist students with special learning needs and $1.5 billion for upgrades to schools, and there is money for migrant school students to learn English and money for languages education. Through this package, the Commonwealth will spend $904 million on New South Wales government schools—90 per cent more than the federal Labor government spent in its last year in office. It is a bit rich when the New South Wales government do not do their bit. The very least they could do is increase school funding in line with the rate of inflation. Last year New South Wales increased their spending by only 0.8 per cent. They must deliver a greater commitment to this area.</para><para>But I want to say that the schools on the North Coast are doing a terrific job, whether they are public, non-government, Catholic or independent schools. Again, it is all about providing families with choice; that is particularly important. There are two new schools in my electorate. Bognagar Public School is a wonderful facility—hats off to the new principal, Wendy Graham, who has a challenging job in starting from scratch, and hats off to  the young families and students who go there. I was delighted that we were able to contribute $2.7 million to the construction of that school. The other school is Banora Point High School, where the principal, Alan Deece, is doing a fantastic job. We provided $10 million to that school. We have also provided Kingscliff Public School with up to $100,000 as part of the Australian government's Boys Education Lighthouse Schools initiative, which is all about putting greater emphasis on boys' education. </para><para>Finally, I want to talk about the wonderful work that volunteers do. Without volunteers, so many of the elderly, so many of the young and so many environmental groups would not have that extra assistance. It is great that we have been able to assist them through small capital equipment grants: over $8,500 went to volunteer groups from the Alstonville Wollongbar plateau; $15,500 went to Tweed Heads and Tweed Coast groups; nine groups in Murwillumbah received substantial funding; and $22,000 went into the Byron Shire and Brunswick Heads area. Hats off to them. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>30018</page.no><name role="metadata">Adams, Dick, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ADAMS</name><name.id>BV5</name.id><electorate>Lyons</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to speak on the <inline ref="R2040">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2004-2005</inline> and cognate bills for the purpose of highlighting veterans' needs, which appear to have been forgotten in the military push by this government. It is all very well to have soldiers go overseas to various theatres of war to defend Australia against terrorism, but we now have many of our soldiers back in their own country, discharged and suffering from the effects of their service, or who have done their duty and are now retired. Even the health of veterans' children has now been recognised as being influenced by their parents' service to their country. This was noted in the first health study of Vietnam veterans conducted by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare in 1998. It was found that there were greater instances of congenital abnormalities in these children than in the overall population. </para></talk.start><para>In the budget the government again cut services to veterans. One service in particular that helps keep veterans in their own homes has been severely chopped again. The Veterans Home Care program provides vital assistance, yet it is now down to about half an hour a fortnight. This is painfully inadequate. There is a gaping hole in the gold card, as doctors and medical specialists across the country refuse to accept the gold card because the government is not prepared to pay the full gap. Simple things like medals are small tokens of recognition of service but important in dealing with the ravages of war. Funding for repatriation hospitals and places dedicated to veterans has now been reduced to a few dollars interspersed through the health and veterans' affairs portfolios. I do not think this is good enough or gives proper recognition to our Defence Force personnel. We must do more.</para><para>I want to tell you a story about one such veteran from my town, Longford, in Tasmania who passed away on 21 April this year. He was an ordinary serving soldier who heeded the call to defend Australia against the Japanese during the Second World War. He went off to war with his brothers, leaving the family with little knowledge or hope that he might return. At his funeral, the family and friends of George Ernest Green gathered together at Christ Church Longford to celebrate George's life. One of the eulogies, given by his daughter-in-law, Rae Green, told of an ordinary man who went to war for his country and his friends and who suffered huge deprivation. He was a prisoner of the Japanese and was starved and beaten. He was lost to his family for two years before finally emerging, damaged but not beaten, to go back to his home in Cressy.</para><para>His was a hair-raising story, like that of the thousands who suffered under detention in Thailand for that period. Yet the very fact that this man from a little country town in Tasmania overcame the enormous odds and survived to return to his family was not considered, at the time, terribly different. His subsequent life and times were as those of many country people in the 1950s and 1960s. Nowadays I think we have a greater understanding of what these people went through, and we should be honouring them by ensuring that in their lives outside the defence forces they can cope with the impact that war service can have on their families and health. </para><para>I would like to put on record the life of Georgie Green as written by his daughter-in-law, Rae, who is married to his eldest son, Phillip, an old schoolmate of mine. Born in Ross on 20 May 1919, he was the third son of Percy and Emily Green. Later, upon moving to Cressy, he became one of the privileged few to attend the Green Rises State School. He then spent a short time at the Elphinstone school before attending the high school at Blackwood Creek, which was called a high school because it was up on a hill. He left school at 13 and began work at Macrae's Hill. He then worked at Woodfield, where his father worked and where the family also lived at that time.</para><para>George was a bit of a sporting hero in his day. In 1938 he won the Cressy wheel race, completing the 45-mile course in the record time of two hours and 13 minutes. The Percy and Arthur Green memorial bike race, to which I make a contribution, is still held annually in the family's honour at Cressy. In 1940, George rode his father's horse, Green Isle, to win the Cressy Cup. Back then it was a trotting race, without a cart and with the rider on the horse's back.</para><para>With his brothers Ted and Arthur, George enlisted in the Australian Army on 3 May 1941. Ted joined the 2/12 Battalion and saw action in Tobruk, New Guinea and Borneo. George and Arthur were recruited to the 2/40 Battalion, a famous Tasmanian battalion. In May 2004 it will be 63 years since they left the Brighton army camp. This camp was recently sold for a song by this government and now it is a wasteland in Brighton with no recognition of its historical military role in Tasmania.</para><para>The family say they are lucky because George kept all the letters that were sent to him or from him during the next five years, allowing them great insight into the important events and social history of the time and into his family's love for him and his devotion to them. A letter to Darwin in the year of his enlistment expressed the hope that he would be home for Christmas in 1941. Instead, he departed from Darwin to spend Christmas Day in an army camp on Timor. The subsequent conflict is well known. After facing those extreme odds—about 23,000 Japanese soldiers against about 4,000 Aussies—and the subsequent Australian casualties, he became a prisoner of war. We know that some of his colleagues went with a small group to East Timor and were well looked after by the East Timorese.</para><para>Following the signing in Singapore of the ceasefire agreement in February 1942, he was transported to Java with his mates, where they remained for nearly a year. I think this was known as the Bicycle Camp. In January 1943 they were loaded into a ship and undertook a cramped sea voyage to Singapore, where they were sent in a cattle wagon on a train to Thailand to provide the slave labour for the construction of the railway from Thailand to Burma. The railway was planned to allow the Japanese to expand their territory and to attack India through Burma. We all know the stories of the hardship that these soldiers endured, the terrible deprivations and the horrors of torture told so graphically by those who wrote about their experiences. No-one knew where they were until almost two years later. </para><para>In June 1943, the Green family received a telegram that confirmed that George was alive but a prisoner of war in Java. By this time, both George and Arthur were already enduring torture and deprivation under the systematic policy of brutality of the Japanese Imperial Army. Imagine what it might have been like for the family back at Cressy not to have known for this length of time if two of their sons were dead or alive and having another son in another theatre of war.  </para><para>The boys were to endure another two and a half years of captivity, with their parents unsure of their fate. During this time, Arthur and George were in the same camp for a few weeks only in the early months. Lucky for George, as Artie saved him from a certain beating or death on one occasion. George was burning bamboo, watched by a guard who kept ordering him to throw more on. The fire was already throwing out tremendous heat in the steamy climate and George responded by giving him a mouthful of Australian unprintables. Unfortunately for him, the guard understood and called him over, stood him to attention and hit him on the side of the face. George was ready to hit him back until he heard Artie calling for him to stop. They were to see each other twice in the next few years, once when Arthur stopped briefly for rice at a camp George was in and then at the end of the war in Singapore while waiting to return home. </para><para>Following the American bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the surrender of the Japanese Imperial Army on 17 August 1945, George became optimistic about his return to Australia. Two days prior to this, he had believed that they had been digging their own mass grave as a Japanese guard repeatedly informed them, `All men go to paradise.' A month later back at home at Cressy, two and a half years after receiving the last telegram about his capture, his family received another telegram: `TX5409, reported alive in Siam, 15.9.1945'. George's war was over. He would be home for Christmas at last. It had taken four years. Looking back at it, he had survived his captivity due to a great deal of courage and determination, the support of his mates and a large amount of luck. </para><para>Upon his return to Cressy he went back to his old life and he worked on a property called Woodfield until deciding to go to the mainland to learn how to shear. He must have been reasonably successful at this, as he became a gun shearer, shearing up to 200 sheep a day, 1,000 sheep a week—and not with wide combs either. By 1948 he had met and fallen in love with Marjorie Joyce Howard. They married on 10 May 1950 and Phillip, the first of their five children, was born a year later. They were happily married for 54 years. George became a good farmer, commonly gaining the top price for lambs and wool at Killafaddy. </para><para>The family has happy memories of the time farming at Kelford and Glenroy. During this time George became a real expert in handling sheepdogs. Tip was his first, followed by Freckles and Dot. He regularly attended sheepdog trials and won numerous rural show championships, with Judy, Mack and Minnieburn Sam. In 1974 and 1975, George and his dogs won the Tasmanian Open Sheepdog Championship, winning him representation at the national championships in Canberra in 1976. He won the first year and gained an admirable second place the following year. Due to poor health, which was probably related to his wartime service, George retired from farming. He was 58 years old. George and family moved into Cressy.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Sitting suspended from 1.30 p.m. to 4.01 p.m.</inline></para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>BV5</name.id><name role="metadata">Adams, Dick, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ADAMS</name></talker><para>—Despite all predictions, George had enjoyed a rich and full retirement and was approaching his 85th birthday in May. The last five years had been difficult due to his illness. When medical advice said no further treatment, he kept on asking for more, such was his determination to stay with his family. However, at 11.30 a.m. on Tuesday, 21 April 2004 a whirlwind blew around the apple tree and dropped the remaining autumn leaves from a rose bush and then was gone, leaving a noticeable silence in the garden at George's home. In that minute George had left us.  </para></talk.start></continue><para>It was one of George's dearest wishes to have 15 August, the day that victory was declared against the Japanese or victory in the Pacific, declared as VJ Day and recognised on the RSL calendar. George and his mates spent 50 years debating with the RSL their desire to have that happen. Their argument was that the threat this war posed to Australia's freedom from Japanese occupation was considerable and that they would like to have it remembered. Twenty thousand soldiers of the Australian infantry fought in this war. Of them, 8,000 became prisoners of war, and 920 of those men were predominantly from the Tasmanian 2/40th, of whom 264 lost their lives, mostly following capture by the Japanese. The remaining veterans in Launceston have celebrated that day for the past two years but they wish to see this commemoration expanded into the Australian community. </para><para>Thank you, Rae, for putting together this information about your father-in-law. I hope you and Phillip feel that this is a suitable tribute to him. I know that he was well respected by the veterans and northern midlands community and I will do my best to see if we can have 15 August gazetted as that special day.</para><para>James Green, George's grandson, who is currently on a Rotary exchange program in Europe, spent Anzac Day 2004 in Belgium and laid wreaths for the Australian community at Menin Gate and Tyne Cot in memory, more than anything else, of his grandfather George. He was proud to be there, despite being very sad at the loss of his grandfather, and had spent some time researching where the services where and actually getting there by buses and trains. This boy understood what his grandfather went through; he was prepared to take time out to honour that veterans service. So too should we in honouring all our veterans. This story shows what we really owe to those in major conflicts, the latest of whom are receiving a battering in Iraq. The veterans do not expect much but they hope that when they have health and family problems their community is there to help them, just as they have served for their community. Vale George Ernest Green. You have been an inspiration to your family, the community and many generations, now and to come.</para><para>I started this speech by dealing with the budget and its failure to deal with veterans' issues. I talked about the recognition of the health of veterans' children—about how serving can also affect the health of servicemen's children when they return—and I mentioned the congenital abnormalities that showed up in a report done by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare as occurring much more in veterans' children than in the normal population. Some of the things that showed up were spina bifida, cleft palate, acute myeloid leukaemia and adrenal gland cancer. Other major issues included the fact that there was three times the expected rate of suicide and that death from other causes, including accidents, was doubled. This all showed up in this work and needs to be looked at and attended to. Veterans and their families need more assurance and help where it is needed.</para><para>I also touched on the home care program for veterans. There has been about $4 million cut out of the 2004-05 program for veterans. Hours of domestic assistance and personal care have been cut for most across the board. It is no wonder that veterans feel really cheated by the Howard government. Some of them have individual needs which we could meet through a good program, but 30 minutes per fortnight is hardly what it should be. This is tragic, because it is a very valuable program but it is now failing because of this government's actions. Demand from ageing veterans and widows is increasing, but this budget denies that that is so. </para><para>The present Minister for Veterans' Affairs, who has really failed to take up veterans' issues and fight out their battles in the cabinet or through the various funding committees of the government, has very little credibility with veterans. The increase in the veterans budget due to an increase in health expenditure basically shows up because of the ageing of veterans. I understand that the minister has falsely included four-year funding figures in her $10.6 billion annual expenditure, and she has inflated the figure by including $6 million for political promotion and ribbon cutting which goes on around the world. That should be set separately, rather than saying, `This is $6 million to help veterans.' Also, a $25 million hole will have to be plugged next year because specialists will not pick up the gold card. An extra $25 million will go down that hole because of bad negotiations, because of being unable to get these things right when negotiating with the medical profession.</para><para>Most of the new expenditure has already been announced, after long delays and mismanagement of the response to the Clarke report. That should have been handled much better. I think the government's own party room stood the minister up and changed the way that she was going to reply to the Clarke report. So there is not much credibility left for this minister—none at all, as I hear it round the traps. I think our veterans deserve some care and honour. That is the Australian Labor Party's policy, which can be read by any veteran. We will give them care and assistance. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>30022</page.no><name role="metadata">Cadman, Alan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CADMAN</name><name.id>SD4</name.id><electorate>Mitchell</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is a delight to be able to speak on the <inline ref="R2040">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2004-2005</inline> in this cognate debate on this year's budget. I want to focus my remarks on Australian families. There has been much discussion about Australian families. For some time, with some of my colleagues, I have been raising the issue of the tax-free threshold for parents. I am so pleased with the efforts that the government has made to meet some of the obvious deficiencies that are apparent in the tax system as it applies to families, particularly those with children. Raising the tax-free threshold appeared to me to be one of the only mechanisms available which would neither cause dislocation in the work force nor encourage unnecessary welfare dependency. For instance, by raising the tax-free threshold by $4,000 for the first child and an additional $2,000 for the second child, choice would be restored for parents—no longer would there be the penalty of a loss of benefits, weighed up against increased income and tax for mothers, should they seek to work part time.</para></talk.start><para>That is what most families and most women seem to want. It is generally the mum who goes back to work part time and seeks to supplement the family income for a period, either to meet short-term family goals or to ease the strain on the week-to-week pressures of the cost of living. The part-time option for many women has carried penalties with it. In many instances, for women on quite low incomes, there has been a very severe penalty that they have to carry. For example, in a family with three dependent children where the father earns $759 per week and the mother earns as little as $11.70 per hour, they find that the effective tax rate is above 80 per cent. If the mother works from five to 20 hours, it can rise by as much as 20 per cent, so there is no benefit in working. The loss of part A or part B of the tax rebate and the cost of child care, plus the tax factors that are already in place, are sufficient to make it almost not an option to work part time. That is why many women refuse to work more than a few hours a week. The ability to take on work for two or three days a week, which would be their preference in many instances, is often denied to them because of the penalties that the process carries. </para><para>The choice is often whether to work full time or part time but it is an easy choice because it comes down to this: work full time or not at all. I believe that is a damage to families. It is at a point where no choice is being exercised. The preferences of the family, the best options and the optimal arrangements for the family, are not available to them. This budget seeks to redress much of that problem. I have studied a series of comments by NATSEM, had the Parliamentary Library chase information, been to the Centre of Independent Studies and have looked at the work of a range of people to see what has been the impact of the budget. I would have to say that most experts are very favourably inclined towards the budget and its impact on Australian families with children. The impact on family payments—and that aspect of the budget—has increased the disposable income across the range of families with children. There is no doubt about that. And there is no doubt that the tapering process is a wonderful improvement. For many it will improve their conditions, from 10 per cent to 20 per cent, and the problems of the estimated family income will probably be less acute. They have not been removed completely, but I think it is a great step forward.</para><para>In addition to those factors that I have been concentrating on, there is the ability for families with children to claim, on reconciliation, $600 from the beginning of this month—provided they fit within family tax benefit A. They can, on reconciliation next year, claim a further $600. This is a total of $1,200 per child within a short period of time, and then there is an ongoing $600 per year. There have been complaints about the clawback process, that some families may have underestimated their incomes, received greater benefits than they should and therefore need to reconcile that. This $600 will help to alleviate that process. People will be able to say, `The $600 is there. It's coming through at the right time. We can adjust it within the $600, and there is going to be a surplus left,' thereby removing the difficulties that were obvious with the reconciliation process. I have looked at the reconciliation process for family tax benefit A and B, and I cannot see how it can be done other than to work on the total amount, unless a family were willing to have a fortnightly adjustment, which seems to me be the most sensible way. But many families want to wait until the end of the year, and therefore there is reconciliation, and the $600 helps to resolve that problem.</para><para>NATSEM, in their studies of family tax, pointed out that for families with an income of, say, $1,000 per week and the mother earning perhaps $20 an hour the effective marginal tax rate ranges from 40 per cent up to 80 per cent at the eighth hour of work. So, even on fairly high income, for the couple there is a pretty severe tax penalty created by loss of benefit, added to by the tax regime and increased by the need for family day care or child care of some sort. A tax-free threshold adjustment would solve much of that, but the government has instead chosen to lift the availability of the benefits despite the second income. That is another neat way of producing the same result with a tapered effect so that the marginal tax rates on a family come into play at a much higher level so that families with children can benefit.</para><para>I have looked at some of the work of Maley and Saunders of the Centre for Independent Studies, and they are very sure that Australian conditions match those of both Europe and Britain—and, to some degree, the United States. Where families are comfortable and given more choice, there is always the option of an additional child. With a fertility rate of about 1.7, Australia is right on the verge of not being at a replacement level. It is my view that it is far better, if we can, to replace our population from within, rather than relying on immigration. If Australian women and families feel more comfortable and secure, and they have the provision to and wish to—because I do not think there is any process of manipulation that is going to get people to have more children—they are more likely to have additional children. That is a very desirable goal for this country. I do not want to see a situation in a few years time where our population drops off and we are facing the situation that Japan will be facing, where there are large numbers of elderly and only a small number of young people. The situation in China will be worse, because of their one child policy. But that is not something that is going to impact very seriously on them or have any large economic impact. </para><para>Fertility rates in most countries are falling, but some countries, such as Norway, Sweden and France, have arrested that decline with fertility rates that are stable or rising slightly. The United States remains high and is at the upper end of the range, behind Turkey only. According to Dr Lucy Sullivan, who did a paper for the Menzies Research Centre, government expenditure does not necessarily produce increased fertility, because one can look at a range of fertility rates and see that Germany and Greece have very generous family support regimes and they have not produced any significant impact on fertility. However, at the other end of the spectrum, the United States, where there is a significantly high fertility rate, there has traditionally been very little expenditure on families by the government; neither is there significant expenditure on families in Turkey. There is a range of options available. South Korea has a very low expenditure on families and its fertility rate is mid-range.</para><para>Where does Australia figure in all of this? We have a fairly modest fertility rate and a reasonable expenditure on families. In fact, we are at about the median of expenditure on families and towards the upper end of the spectrum on fertility rates. I think this budget is going to do a great deal to ease the pressure on Australian families with children. I am delighted with the tack the government has taken as it relieves those at the lower end of the spectrum, because that is where the greatest need occurs and where the greatest benefit will be received. The upper income end is significant in dollar terms but, if you look at the percentage or the variation of income, it is a small percentage as compared with the lower income brackets.</para><para>I think that these changes will produce a great result. Another interesting result is the payment this year of $3,000 to families having children, rising to $4,000 in 2005 and $5,000 in 2006. This is a collapsing of the maternity allowance and the baby bonus scheme into one worthwhile product, and I think that $60 or so a week will be a significant support for families raising children. Some would argue that the later teenage years represent the greatest expenditure for families and that that is where we should be directing most of the benefits. I do not necessarily agree with that, because the family tax rebate that we have introduced helps cover that by relating to both income and to the number of children and does vary by age group. There is a greater benefit to those families with older children, so that is a compensating factor which I think the government has dealt with nicely. If there is any need for movement in the future, I would argue that there is still room to increase the tax-free threshold, because that would help compensate for some of the bumps that are still in the system but which have been largely removed. That could be a future objective.</para><para>A range of families are assisted by the government's comprehensive tax policy. Peter McDonald tends not to be a philosophical supporter of this government but he has said some interesting things about family incomes and the support of families. Commentators ranging from McDonald to the Centre for Independent Studies consistently say that the government is on track and that these are very substantial improvements in the budget for the benefit of families. If anybody argues against that, I point out that they would be tackling a range of experts that have made a lifetime study of the impact of income on families. They have also looked closely at fertility rates. According to my analysis, the commentators, whether they be Lucy Sullivan of the Centre for Independent Studies, Peter McDonald, NATSEM or any other well known authorities, consistently say the same thing. There are continuing problems, as I have said, at the higher end of the disposable income range which are caused by the stacking effect of family tax benefits parts A and B, but that has always been a feature. The only way to remove it is to do something about the tax-free threshold. </para><para>The other areas of great interest in the budget have been well documented. There has been a massive reaction to it. I know what people have said about the opinion polls. I must say that I cannot find that reaction in the community. I think they are waiting to see the government deliver. The government will deliver because the funds are there. They have been carefully husbanded and they will be carefully paid out because Australia has come through a time of recovery. We are now on track. We do not need to go back to a regime which creates—for example, look at the Labor Party's proposal—an impossible set of ideals and goals that are fairly typical of a poorly managed economy: all the high ideals but no capacity to deliver them.</para><para>The latest set of Labor's promises include more spending. The spending results are out there—we hear them every day in the parliament and in shadow spokesmen's speeches. We hear the shadow Treasurer talk about bigger tax cuts. We know that there cannot be bigger tax cuts, more spending, larger surpluses, a reduction in debt and lower taxation and spending as a share of GDP. It just cannot be done. Government members are looking very carefully at the opposition. We are looking at where the fudging is going to take place. There will be cuts in areas that people will not like if that regime is to be maintained. There must be cuts. You have to ask, `Where is the money coming from?' You cannot make those inconsistent claims and produce a desirable result. As far as the tax cut regime is concerned, the government, in a targeted and well-thought-through way, is encouraging savings and supporting families and more spending on the elderly. There is massive expenditure on the elderly and retirees, because we need to consolidate funds and prepare for the future. The government has given attention to the need to resource our security and our defence. Those are sensible judgments. </para><para>There has also been an emphasis on encouraging small businesses and employment rates. Despite the increase in the size of the work force, the unemployment rate is the lowest it has been for decades. The Australian Labor Party say, `We are going to do even better by spending more, giving bigger tax cuts, providing larger surpluses, reducing debt and lowering taxation and spending as a share of GDP.' It cannot be done. There would have to be massive cuts somewhere. Where is the money coming from? We can only say that we will wait and see what smoke and mirrors come out of the opposition. </para><para>I commend the budget to the House. From the point of view of the Australian family with children it is a most desirable outcome. Everybody seems to agree that it has been well done and that it has removed some of the anomalies that were obvious prior to the budget.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>30025</page.no><name role="metadata">Sawford, Rod, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SAWFORD</name><name.id>3J4</name.id><electorate>Port Adelaide</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Budgets do not come more cynical than this one. The member for Mitchell has been around long enough. He would remember that this is almost like Groundhog Day for 1977 and 1980, and we know what happened after that, don't we? It is the government's ninth budget and its sole purpose is to get itself elected for the fourth time and to ingratiate itself with the electorate in the hope of winning another term. To be a successful Treasurer in the federal government of this country requires a greater scope of vision than just the nine-four the current Treasurer can muster. If he had some guts, he would have changed the taxation rates that the member for Mitchell was referring to.  </para></talk.start><para>It is not good enough to use the position of Treasurer of this country simply to perpetuate office. The Treasurer seems to think that he can use the same trick term after term—tax everybody heavily for two years and then give big handouts to selected parts of the community in the lead up to an election. How does the Treasurer determine which parts of the community get the handout? For example, does he hand it back to those who are most in need? Does he determine which parts of the economy need assistance for jobs growth? Does he commit to big national infrastructure projects like the development of ports, bridges and railways and help streamline the economy? No, he does not do any of that. The Treasurer hands it back to groups which Liberal party polling has determined are the key to being successful at the next election. As I said, budgets do not come more cynical than this one, and neither do Treasurers nor Prime Ministers.</para><para>This is not the way to run a country. This is not the way to build an economy or a cohesive community. The Treasurer's tax cuts start at $52,000. While nobody is saying that $52,000 is a high wage, it is much more than most people get in my seat of Port Adelaide. It is impossible to understand why those above $52,000 will get tax cuts, while those earning less than $52,000 will get nothing. Over the past three years the government has gorged itself on new taxes and has stuffed the coffers to the brim with takings from the GST. But this money did not come from Mars—it came out of the pockets of ordinary men and women working in this country, and to give it back as tax cuts only to those earning over $52,000 runs contrary to any notion of fairness and responsible administration. </para><para>This is the biggest taxing government in Australia's history. Australians have never had as much tax taken from their pay as they do today. Most Australians accept that they have to pay tax to enable the government to facilitate the building of the nation. People want to see their tax money fairly spent on facilities for themselves and their families. They want to know that our schools and higher education institutions can provide their children with the skills and the knowledge that they will need to succeed. They want to know that our hospitals and Medicare are being looked after so that they do not have to be on a large waiting list when they need help. They want to know that their taxes are being used to build the infrastructure of a strong economy so that they and their children can be assured of secure jobs and good incomes.</para><para>The people's expectations about how the government should use their hard-earned taxes have not been met by this budget. Schools, hospitals and infrastructure have been ignored, while the big spending items are transitory. It is true that many people will be pleased to receive a $600 cheque—</para><para><inline font-style="italic">A division having been called in the House of Representatives—</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Sitting suspended from 4.33 p.m. to 4.59 p.m.</inline></para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sawford, Rod, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SAWFORD</name></talker><para>—It is true that many people will be pleased to receive a $600 cheque in the mail before the end of the financial year and another cheque before the election. No-one is going to return the cheques to sender. That is not to say that they consider this wild spending of taxpayers' money wise or fair-minded. The government is committed to spending $52 billion over five years, including $6 billion in the next six weeks. Two out of five families will receive a cheque in the mail and one out of five taxpayers will receive a tax cut. It will not last too long with the interest rate rise in September, but that is another story. The way the tax cuts are structured, however, means that those on or just over $52,000 should not get too excited. The tax cuts might start at $52,000, but they only really begin to bite on incomes much higher than that. The Treasurer's tax cut, for example, will probably be bigger than the cheque many people will receive in the mail. And he will get that not just once but every payday until he challenges the Prime Minister for the top job. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Nothing about this budget is sustainable or will provide long-term benefit to the country. For example, the government has done nothing about bracket creep whatsoever. Okay, there is a tax cut, but that will be wiped out as soon as working people advance to the next tax bracket. In fact, it will be before that: they will lose it when the interest rate rise comes in September. The real challenge of reforming the rates got lost—that takes a bit of courage. For many families the cheque in the mail will not even match their debt against the so-called family tax benefit. If it gets past that hole it will be gone soon enough when home mortgage rates, as I say, rise again shortly after the election—in fact, a week after the election. You can be sure they will rise. It is a certainty. That is exactly what happened after the last election. The Reserve Bank governor, surprisingly, admitted as much when he implied that he held off raising interest rates before the last election for the electoral benefit of the government. In my view, that comment should have been accompanied by a resignation statement. Instead, he survived and is set to play the same trick again, for the benefit of the same Prime Minister and the same Treasurer.</para><para>This country is crying out for infrastructure development, to build a stronger economy and to provide more jobs. That should be the core role of government, yet there is next to nothing in this budget for infrastructure. Out of an expenditure of $52 billion it should not have been too difficult to find $100 million or so to help build the Port of Adelaide into a world-class port. I am sure every state has similar vital infrastructure which needs development for the benefit of taxpayers. But it has all been overlooked. Obviously, in the eyes of the Liberal Party pollsters there is not a vote in it, so for the Treasurer there is not a dollar committed to it. The Queen Elizabeth Hospital, in my electorate, is in desperate need. Again there is not a cent for health care in western Adelaide. There is also no money to vaccinate Australians against the deadly pneumococcal disease, to fund early child development or to help our young people into education, training or a job.</para><para>On the Commonwealth funding of public and private schools, the Prime Minister's record speaks for itself. From 1977 until now, as Treasurer in the Fraser government and now Prime Minister, John Howard has totally reversed the proportion of Commonwealth funding going to public and private schools, totally turned it around. In 1977, 67 per cent of Commonwealth money went to public schools, 33 per cent to private. This is an appropriate ratio, reflecting the proportions of students in public and private schools. But in 24 years as Treasurer and as Prime Minister John Howard has progressively reduced funds going to public schools and increased funds going to private schools. The result is that today 67 per cent of Commonwealth education funding goes to private schools and 33 per cent to public schools. It is a national disgrace. This is despite the fact that two-thirds of all students still receive their education in the public area. </para><para>Whatever happened to the PM at Canterbury Boys High School? He has certainly vented his spleen on public education ever since, in his roles as Treasurer and PM. I wonder what really did happen at Canterbury Boys High? He never goes back. No-one wants to deny private schools and private school students a fair slice of the cake, but it must be a fair slice. This requires a change of focus from whether the school is public or private to making sure that all schools have the resources needed to provide their students with the same high-quality education. Labor's policy does this by tailoring support for each school so that every child can receive a high-quality education, no matter which school they attend.</para><para>The government has constructed its ninth budget simply to win votes. Will it? I suppose we will learn that within a couple of months. Labor's approach to governance is very different. We will use the tax revenue contributed by working people in this nation to build a strong economy with well-resourced essential services. The provision of first-class services in health and education will be of much greater benefit to families and singles than any tax cut or any one-off cheque in the mail. For example, Labor's commitment to restore bulk-billing to the level it was before Medicare was run down by the current government will greatly assist many family budgets. Labor's new national dental scheme will do likewise. Dental care is a prohibitive expense for most people, especially for larger families, those on lower incomes and those in rural and regional Australia. Labor's promise to create 20,000 new places in higher education and 20,000 in TAFE will help young people to achieve their career goals and increase their earning potential for the future.</para><para>Australian families have never been under such financial stress. They are working harder and longer but find they are unable to get ahead, and it is not hard to find the reasons why. The responsibility for this state of affairs lies squarely at the feet of the Treasurer. Household debt is now at record levels and credit card debt has trebled to $22 billion. Families owe nearly $600 million to the government because of the botched family tax benefit, with over 670,000 families owing an average $850. It is not hard to see where most of the vote-buying cheques will go: they will go straight into paying off current debts—and these families will still be worse off.</para><para>The government has failed to act to restrain the imposition of new and higher fees by banks and other providers of essential services. For example, the government has sat on its hands while banks fees have doubled in the past seven years. That inaction has encouraged others to get on the fee bandwagon. What about Telstra: what a cheek they have. They now charge a fee when customers pay their accounts by credit card. In the recent Senate estimates—how is this for arrogance—Telstra was asked why they have brought in this new fee, and the answer was simple: `Because we can.' This shows just how arrogant the big end of town has become under the current federal government. They know that the government will not move to protect the interests of consumers against their ugly profit--grabbing. There is nothing wrong with profit but it needs to be fair. It is about time that the government reminded Telstra, their chief executive officer and their underlings that their brief is to provide the highest quality communications services to the Australian people. Currently, all they seem to be doing is fattening themselves up on fees and higher line charges to maximise their market value for privatisation. The $90 per quarter charge for the provision of a line is simply a cruel joke—in no way can that charge reflect the minimal ongoing costs involved.  </para><para>The fourth indicator of just how hard it has become for families is that household savings are now at record low levels. Families now save around just 3c for every dollar they earn. And it now takes nine years of wages to buy a home, which is an extra 27 months of wages compared with seven years ago. The proportion of new home buyers is now the second lowest on record and the average size of these loans has increased by 67 per cent. And of course tax is at the highest levels ever recorded in this country. </para><para>This hardship for families has been compounded by the loss of government provided essential services in the areas of health, child care and education. In health care, bulk-billing GPs are harder to find—in fact, a GP is hard to find—and the out-of-pocket cost to see a doctor who does not bulk-bill is now an average $12.78. In some areas it is $25 minimum. This is a rise of 55 per cent or, at $25, 100 per cent, during the years of the current Howard-Costello government. And in child care, funds for children with special needs have been frozen and too many children with disabilities cannot get a place. I thought civilised societies cared for young people, for aged and for people with disabilities. This one did not even get a mention. In education, student fees have jumped 85 per cent and some students are now paying $100,000 for a degree. </para><para>This budget contains the largest pre--election spend in our nation's history from the highest taxing government in history. This is a fact—Commonwealth taxes are set to hit a record high next year at $217 billion, which is up by 90 per cent since 1996. By next year, total personal income tax will be up 80 per cent since 1996. Working men and women in Australia are already paying an average of $9,000 more in Commonwealth taxes than in 1996, and this will grow to $12,000 over the forward estimates in the budget. Where did the money for this record pre-election splurge come from? The answer is simple: it came from the pockets of ordinary working men and women of this country via a raft of new taxes, including the GST. It came out of the pockets of everyone and has been fed back into the pockets of a select few. And we know that those select few were chosen by the Liberal Party pollsters for electoral reasons—not by analysis of need and of what would be best for the development of our nation. </para><para>Labor's plan is to restore services in the first instance and to put more money back in the pockets of families that way. Labor will also offer tax relief for a much broader section of the community in our tax policy. Our policy will be broader and fairer. Labor believe that, because everybody puts in, everybody should see and feel the benefits of their taxes at work. The Treasurer's latest budget—it will be his last—was a pitiful grab for votes. It contained nothing for the nation in the way of productivity and growth. There was nothing to boost competition or to assist the development of new technologies and innovation to help business succeed in the competitive world marketplace—not one thing. There was nothing to contain the surging fees of institutions or to reduce the BAS paperwork for small business. There was no new investment in TAFE and universities and nothing to help increase the skills and qualifications of our work force. There was nothing for major infrastructure projects that this nation so badly needs, especially in the area of roads and rail transport. And there was nothing to help our ailing river system and ensure that my state of South Australia can be guaranteed good fresh water in decades to come.</para><para>These structural issues that are so critical to our nation's future have been comprehensively ignored in the budget in favour of a grubby grab for votes. Instead of dealing with the national interest, taxpayers' money was dispensed as a political ploy, simply to win votes. It was a gutless effort; no more, no less. It is a bit like Groundhog Day. For those of us who can remember the 1977 and 1980 elections, there is a bit of deja vu about all of this. They were also campaigns that ran on a fistful of dollars, particularly the 1980 election campaign. We know what happened when Malcolm Fraser and John Howard got together in that terrible election—the terribly wasted opportunities that many people on the current frontbench have acknowledged. I think the member for Mayo, on a number of occasions, has made mention of the lost opportunities of the Fraser years. </para><para>The person who was the Treasurer at that time is the current Prime Minister. We know what happened. In 1983, when the election was called—ironically at a time when Malcolm Fraser could not win—that big spend of 1980 and the subsequent three years created 10 per cent unemployment, 10 per cent inflation and 10 per cent interest rates; the trifecta of doom. Malcolm Fraser, tears or no tears, found it very difficult to accept that that negligence of the nation and the nation's future interest in 1977-80 and 1980 to 1983 was the prime reason he lost office. But there was another person there—the member for Bennelong and Treasurer at that time—who was doing exactly the same thing. The member for Bennelong, the current Prime Minister and former Treasurer, has never changed his spots: whether it be education, he has always had it in for public education; whether it be health, he has always had it in for Medicare; whether it be public ownership of communications like Telstra, he has always favoured privatisation.</para><para>If Howard wins the record of being, next to Menzies, the longest-serving Prime Minister in office, he might also, like Menzies, leave a legacy to the nation that is minimal. Menzies had lots of opportunities too. In the early 1950s, some of the great inventions of the world—the hi-fi, the colour photocopier or whatever—were all invented here, in Australia. In fact, one of the scientists was a guy called Alwyn Clements, who lived in my electorate. He was a very smart man. Did we develop those inventions? No. Under the years of Menzies, all those sorts of things went offshore. Menzies was supposed to have said to Clements, `Your transistor will never replace the valve.' That is what Menzies said to one of the great scientists of this country.</para><para>Can you imagine Australia now being the leading country in the world in television, hi-fi and photocopying technology? We had those opportunities but we blew them. We blew them because of the lousy, rotten leadership of the country at that time. Here we go again: we cannot invest in something substantive, we cannot invest in the future, we cannot put down a legacy for our children and our grandchildren—the government are just going to spend, grab and bribe their way back into power. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>30030</page.no><name role="metadata">Ley, Sussan, MP</name><name role="display">Ms LEY</name><name.id>00AMN</name.id><electorate>Farrer</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on <inline ref="R2040">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2004-2005</inline>. I am glad that that electors of Farrer do not have such a sad and depressing tale to tell as the member for Port Adelaide does. I appreciate the opportunity to speak in support of the government's recent budget and, in doing so, to outline why I and the people whom I represent believe that it is of great benefit to rural Australia and indeed to Australia generally. A discussion of the budget measures must surely start with the More Help for Families package, which is the largest ever package of assistance for families—an additional $19.2 billion over five years. This includes extra payments and it also takes in changes to family tax benefit B that improve the rewards for women re-entering the work force after having children. Naturally, it is a difficult time—those of us who have been through that phase in our lives remember that it is a difficult time. Important decisions need to be made about whether to stay out of the work force, for how long, and when you return to it. Sometimes it seems that going back to work is not worth it, even though the family is under financial pressure. Perhaps the mother wishes to do some part-time work in order to keep her skills in a particular area. It is difficult to get that balance right. But by raising the income threshold at which you can still receive family tax benefit B from approximately $1,800 to $4,000 a year, it is much easier to manage the transition from being at home full time and working part time. </para></talk.start><para>Each family receiving family tax benefit A—that is, two million Australian families—will receive an additional $600 per child before 30 June 2004, and another $600 per child is available upon reconciliation of a family's 2004 family tax received against their income, in about September this year. Further help for families is provided by the new maternity payment of $3,000, rising to $5,000 in July 2008. This is a non-means-tested payment. It is paid for every newborn child. There will also be 40,000 more outside school hours places and 4,000 more family day care places provided in the budget. That is really practical assistance for families.</para><para>The tax relief measures in the budget are also particularly welcome. The income threshold for the 42 per cent tax rate will be raised from $52,001 to $58,001 in July 2004 and to $63,001 in July 2005. The income threshold for the 47 per cent tax rate will be raised from $62,501 to $70,000 in July 2004 and to $80,001 in July 2005. The Treasurer has made the point many times that rather than selecting this group of medium- to high-income earners to target them with tax relief, as has been suggested by the Labor Party, we are going back to where we were when we introduced the new tax system, when we offered tax relief across the board and the Labor Party in the Senate would not pass the tax relief measures for this group of income earners. In fact, the percentage reduction in tax paid by this group is less than it is for lower income earners. We are maintaining the integrity and the progressiveness of our tax system.</para><para>The Labor Party generally are philosophically against tax decreases if you have a choice between lowering taxes and cutting spending on government programs, because that is in keeping with their beliefs of tax, spend and interfere. They promote the line that most people would prefer increased spending on health and education rather than tax cuts. I think that is a generally accepted proposition but, interestingly, it is not actually the case. </para><para>I will start with some interesting estimates on how much governments spend on social welfare programs before we look at voter preferences. Estimates show that the combined expenditure for 2003-04 on social security, aged care, family payments and health was $112.3 billion out of total expenses of $184 billion. This is certainly proof that a high proportion of Commonwealth tax revenue funds from the federal budget go towards social welfare programs.</para><para>Polls on tax taken over the last 20 years show that the electorate prefers lower tax. A research brief, <inline font-style="italic">Less tax or more social spending: twenty years of opinion polling</inline>, provided by the Parliamentary Library and authored by Richard Grant, says:</para><quote><para>In terms of the trade-off between less tax and more spending on social services, more people have preferred less tax to higher social service outlays in all polls since the mid 1980s.</para></quote><para>However, the paper finds there is greater public support for more social spending in Australia and suggests that this probably reflects the need to redress the perceived decline in health service standards. We know that concern about health is increasing. I suspect that in New South Wales this is very much the case, because the provision of health care by the New South Wales government at the moment is quite appalling. </para><para>But in giving voters tax relief we are giving voters what they want. We are also recognising, with the large outlays generally on social programs, that voters do want a floor, a safety net, a good health service, a good education service et cetera. So I believe that this government is responding to what voters in fact ask of us. Unfortunately, people persist in thinking that the federal government is at fault and that, if it is not at fault, it has the power to force the states to build a better health system. It is not the case—I wish it were—and I think all government members are frustrated with that situation.</para><para>It cannot be repeated enough: all GST is paid to the states, delivering them a secure and growing revenue base. They do have an obligation to fund hospitals with this money. In 2004-05, every state will receive more revenue than it would have if the Australian government had not implemented tax reform. My state, New South Wales, will receive $113.7 million more, and the benefits will increase over time as the GST revenue grows.</para><para>Looking at the relationship between local government and state government, you would think that the states might consider allocating local governments a portion of the GST so that they had access to this growing pool of revenue to help them meet their obligations. Naturally, the states resist this—but they are more than happy to let local government continue to do battle with less money and an obligation to provide more to their local communities. Many of these obligations are forced on them by increases in planning laws, occupational health and safety and all sorts of other somewhat draconian state laws that local councils are forced to comply with. The cost of compliance means that there is more of a burden on local ratepayers, and state governments are not allowing their local governments to access the growth tax that we give the states, which is the GST.</para><para>In my area the recent policy of forced amalgamations highlights the state governments' need—their desire—to strip local councils of the resources and the people that they need to effectively look after local communities. The states are hanging onto all the GST revenue, they are running down hospitals and schools and they are stripping money out of regional areas where local governments provide such valuable and effective community support. </para><para>I note that Premier Carr has been using New South Wales taxpayers' money to run a ridiculous campaign about the cuts being made by the federal government to New South Wales under the Commonwealth Grants Commission funding. I wish to place the facts on record—and I have had to explain this to many constituents who have written in, outraged over the cuts that the federal government is making when of course nothing could be further from the truth. The allocation of money to the states is managed by the independent Commonwealth Grants Commission, and this commission has held this responsibility since 1933. The distribution is not managed by the Prime Minister and it is not managed by the Treasurer. The Treasurer has stated that if New South Wales has a case to make it needs to make it to the commission, because the Commonwealth government has no control whatsoever over the process. The argument really is between the states, who as a whole receive the total GST collected by the Commonwealth; it is approximately $34 billion and it gives them that ongoing growth revenue. </para><para>I have read Premier Carr's media releases and background material on this matter and I have found them to be quite misleading. In raising the issue of a $376 million supposed cut, the inference is that the Commonwealth government is keeping this money for itself. This is not the case, because all of the GST revenue is allocated to the states. What is under discussion are the formulae used to divide this money between the states. Every state has signed off on the methodology the Grants Commission uses to allocate the GST pie, and that needs to be remembered.</para><para>The AusLink proposals contained in this budget are visionary and far reaching. If you include the $2 billion announced in January, there will be, I believe, a $3.1 billion allocation over the next five years. This investment will boost productivity and position Australia for an expected doubling of the land freight task over the next 20 years. If you ask people in regional Australia what they want to see from government, infrastructure will nearly always be very high on the list. These people are great users of roads, they would probably like to be more frequent users of rail, and they understand that, without a solid commitment to infrastructure—which may not necessarily have the cost-benefit returns that it would in the city—their futures are not particularly secure.</para><para>On a practical level, in my local area the communities along the Hume Highway have worked long and hard in arguing their case for duplication of the highway from the Sturt Highway intersection south to Albury, which is pretty well all of the remaining non-duplicated section of the Hume. There have been some tragic accidents along this stretch of road—too many since I became the local member, only three years ago. Members of the emergency services have been very angry at what they see as an unwillingness by governments to fix the problem. I understand that anger completely, because while we are tucked up in our beds at home or with our feet up in front of the TV—those of us who are lucky enough to have time to sit in front of the TV—the men and women of our state emergency services are out in the wind, the rain and the fog, dealing with the horrors of roadside trauma. These people are volunteers. They volunteer their time and they have not asked for anything for themselves. They have asked, consistently and for a long time, for the Hume Highway to be made a dual carriageway.</para><para>The Hume Highway Action Group, including me and the member for Riverina, met with the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads prior to the budget. We were happy with the undertaking that when AusLink projects are announced in more detail a five-year funding plan for the Hume Highway will be known. I look forward to a visit to the area by the Deputy Prime Minister, to the particularly important single-lane carriageway section of the Hume Highway, to make some important announcements soon. </para><para>I want to touch on a couple of other important issues in my electorate at the moment. In the east of my electorate, centred on the town of Batlow, there is great concern over biosecurity. The apple growers there are having an important public meeting tonight. I wish I could be there but, because parliament is sitting, I cannot. But I will be there in spirit, and I do send them my support. They have been through this fight before. I have spoken in this place about their fight and I have spoken about my commitment to the apple growers in my region and, indeed, all the apple growers in regional Australia. It is fair to say that they are probably greatly concerned about the draft import risk assessment that is out for public comment at the moment. I know that they will be galvanising the science that they need to make their case to the expert panel of scientists, who will take additional evidence into account when they release the final import risk assessment. We are only at the draft stage at the moment. </para><para>This is an exhaustive process if you are an apple grower. You are faced with uncertainty. You know that there is a draft process, an evaluation by the expert panel, a decision from Biosecurity, an appeal process and so on, and a final signing off by, I think, the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. This is a long, hard process. I believe that our Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and the Prime Minister will not compromise the quarantine status of this country. If the people I have talked to have a case to make—and I know they do, because they have made it to me, and it is very sound—then we will make that case and we will convince those that need to be convinced that the science is not sound and, if we allow the protocol that allows the importation of these apple into Australia, we are going to compromise an industry that is very important. The devastation that may result is too frightening to contemplate. I repeat, from our minister for agriculture: we will not compromise the quarantine status.</para><para>Another important issue in my electorate, since the Murray River in New South Wales runs along the southern boundary of Farrer, is water. I am a member of a government committee, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, which recently released an interim report into future water supplies for Australian rural industries. This report quoted extensively from evidence heard in a public hearing held in Deniliquin in my electorate. The report was quite well publicised when it was released, and the committee attracted a lot of criticism. We were characterised in many quarters as spoiling the whole national water initiative and having our heads in the sand about the need for environmental flows in the River Murray. I simply say to those who think we came to our views right at the end of our committee hearings: a bipartisan committee of Labor, Liberal and Independent members travelled extensively throughout the Murray-Darling Basin, had hearings extensively over 15 months, possibly more, and came to its conclusions after taking an enormous amount of evidence and looking at it very closely.</para><para>We concluded that there was insufficient emphasis on the vital links between catchment health and river health, of which river flows and the increasing need for river flows is only one factor. People may not know that of the indicators of catchment health only two out of 22 relate to environmental flows. Yet we have everybody focusing on environmental flows in the Murray River and ignoring all those other important indicators of catchment health.</para><para>The recent poli-pedal—so wonderfully led by Tony Abbott, our Minister for Health and Ageing, and supported by Kevin Andrews; the member for Parramatta, Ross Cameron; the member for Deakin, Phil Barresi; and other MPs from time to time—travelled through the electorate, and I made sure that they stopped for morning tea on the banks of the Murray at Tocumwal. I said to them as we rode our pushbikes up the hill: `You will be seeing the Murray shortly. Expect it to look absolutely dreadful, to be a dying sewer, to be full of blue-green algae and for the issue to be demanding instant remedial action.' What they saw was an extremely healthy river, flowing well—almost a banker—with lots of evidence of biodiversity; of animal, bird and wetland life in the region. They were quite surprised.</para><para>It is a point that I make over and over again. There are all sorts of reasons why it would be devastating to my electorate if a Labor government were to achieve office at the next election but the one that hurts me the most is the idea that a Labor government would put 1,500 gigalitres of water, regardless of any science, into the Murray River and would destroy the rural communities that I represent. And for what? For really not very much return at all. </para><para>I support the national water initiative and the icon sites approach. What our committee said was, `For goodness sake: let's put something in place that collects the physical data that demonstrates the case.' We cannot use models—as we have been doing—that rely simply on the opinion of expert panels, because if you are going to withdraw resources to that extent from rural communities you have to be able to say to them, `We're doing this for very good reasons and we're doing this because the catchment is in crisis if we don't.' The thought of going through all this pain and then finding that we have not really achieved a great deal at the end of it is pretty awful.</para><para>I am very supportive of the interim report that our committee brought down. I am very supportive of the irrigated agriculture in my electorate. I am not an environmental vandal and, believe me, none of the farmers that I represent are either. They simply would like somebody to come and do a socioeconomic study that says, `If you withdraw the water, these are the effects that there will be,' so that we can demonstrate what will happen to the communities. You cannot sacrifice communities and close down towns—I am not exaggerating.</para><para>A couple of other measures that I was delighted to see in the budget related to aged care. I have some wonderful non-profit aged care providers in the electorate of Farrer. They have fought a long, hard case with me. They have argued very well with our Minister for Health and Ageing, with the previous minister, with me and with anyone whose ear they could get into about the need for us to remember rural aged care providers in any package that we present, and I believe we have. We have injected cash into the sector and have made some changes that will make our aged care homes able to run a lot more profitably and in a lot better fashion. Nothing is more important for older people than knowing that they can retire to a home in the area where they have lived their whole lives and be looked after.</para><para>On this score, I must save the highest praise for the aged care nurses in those homes. They are struggling with limited resources and with low numbers. They are doing a marvellous job in caring for large numbers of older Australians, many of them suffering from dementia and many of them not long for this world. It is very important that in those final days and months they are comfortable, they are well looked after and they are happy. I think that our aged care nurses deserve so much for what they give every single day.</para><para>The WET relief we saw in this budget was also an important thing that I argued for in the electorate. That means that small to medium wineries will receive some relief on the so-called wine equalisation tax that they pay. I am committed to making sure that works its way through the system properly so that they are not overburdened with book work and it interacts sufficiently well with the state taxes that also have to be rebated for them to get the full 29c rebate on the wholesale sales that they make.</para><para>In concluding, the Farrer electorate has a prosperous and bright future under the Howard government and I look forward to important announcements by the Prime Minister that look to the future. We are not resting on our laurels, either—we have the lowest debt-to-GDP ratio in the Western world, we have paid back $70 billion of Labor's $90 billion debt and we look in good shape for the future. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>30036</page.no><name role="metadata">King, Catherine, MP</name><name role="display">Ms KING</name><name.id>00AMR</name.id><electorate>Ballarat</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In this debate on the <inline ref="R2040">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2004-2005</inline> and cognate bills, I want to start by focusing on the general economic overview and move onto some of the social policy areas not contained in the budget, and then on to specific local issues for my electorate. In the second of his series of so-called headland speeches in the lead-up to the 1996 election, the then Leader of the Opposition, John Howard, said:</para></talk.start><quote><para>The $2.9 billion—</para></quote><para>current account deficit—</para><quote><para>figure for May was not only bad news in itself but symbolised the utter failure of current policies to address this problem.</para></quote><para>Today, under the stewardship of the Howard-Costello government, the current account deficit has risen to $11.997 billion. This is 15.8 per cent worse than the current account deficit of a year ago. Whose policy failure is it now? In the same headland speech, the then Leader of the Opposition, John Howard, stated:</para><quote><para>When I left office, net foreign debt stood at a manageable $23 billion. Today, our foreign debt burden is a crippling $167 billion. That's nearly $10,000 for every man, woman and child in Australia.</para></quote><para>Today, under the stewardship of the current Prime Minister and the Treasurer, foreign debt is $373.778 billion. According to their preferred formula, foreign debt for every man, woman and child in Australia is now $18,668.</para><para>When I look at these figures I am reminded of the Hans Christian Andersen tale, <inline font-style="italic">The Emperor</inline><inline font-style="italic">'</inline><inline font-style="italic">s New Clothes</inline>, where the emperor is sold a set of clothes by a scoundrel who tells him his new suit is invisible to fools. Because no-one wants to be thought a fool, the clothes are lavishly praised. The emperor travels the streets naked until a child exposes the truth: the emperor is wearing no clothes. I have listened with a sense of disbelief to those opposite praise lavishly the clothes of this Treasurer. Let me say what those on this side of the House know—the emperor has no clothes; the poor economic credentials of this government are exposed. They include record foreign debt, record current account deficit, record trade deficit, record household debt, record credit card debt, record pre-election spending spree, record pre-election spending spree on advertising to get re-elected, record low proportion of first homebuyers in the market and record tax take as the highest-taxing government in our history. The economic credentials of the government are yet another tale it likes to tell about itself.</para><para>Having already spoken on the tax and family assistance bills previously, I will keep my comments on both of these brief, but I want to reiterate the following points. In the government's record pre-election spending budget of $52 billion, taxpayers on less than $52,000 a year were the losers. They were the losers in terms of tax cuts, but they are also bearing the brunt of the government's services deficit. This is the group the Prime Minister was pretty quick to tell last year, `You should be grateful for the sandwich and milkshake tax cut'—a tax cut that has long since disappeared with the rising costs of seeing a GP and Telstra line rentals. These are Howard's forgotten people.</para><para>In my electorate of Ballarat 81,129 people reported in the 2001 census that they had incomes of less than $52,000. Only 6,769 reported that they had incomes higher than $52,000. That is 81,129 people who the government has determined have not worked hard enough to earn a tax cut. As a member who represents a regional seat, it would be remiss of me not to point out that the tax cuts are skewed against country people. People do not have as many options to earn high salaries in country areas. In fact, the Minister for Health and Ageing is on record as saying that this is a good thing and we ought to accept smaller salaries in regional areas. There are very few positions in my district that have salaries higher than $52,000. </para><para>Like other members of the House, I have had numerous complaints about the family tax benefit system. Under the current system one in three families each year has been slugged with debts. The latest family payments data shows that the government's family tax benefit is having a sharp financial impact on families whose income varies during the year, particularly families where a parent is returning to work after time out of the work force caring for a child. The government's refusal to correct the family payment system, which cannot pay families the right amount when they need it, limits parents' ability to balance work and family.</para><para>The government's work and family package was drawn up more than a year ago but not released, because it did not suit the government's election timetable. In that time families have been hit with 1.5 million family payment debts at a cost of $1.6 billion. They have been denied outside school hours places and other child-care places and they have had babies without the benefit of any baby care payment. The government has now increased family payments for some families without fixing the flaws in the system which for some will result in money being clawed back. To add insult to injury, the government is asking them to fund a $20 million campaign of television commercials so that it can tell families what a good job it is doing.</para><para>The government in the budget focused—I would have to say `failed to focus'—on a number of key social policy areas. I want to turn my attention to some of these. In particular, I want to turn to the area of women's policy. This was the first budget in 20 years where the government did not provide a women's budget statement, and it speaks volumes about the lack of commitment this government has to overall women's policy. I want to commend the adoption by the government of Labor's policy on what is in essence paid maternity leave for women in the paid and unpaid work force. But I want to put on the record how deeply offended I was at the Treasurer's comment that we should all go out and produce `one for the country'. It inspired a particularly blokey atmosphere in this place for the rest of the week, and for the first time in my time here women colleagues from both sides of the House were commenting at just how uncomfortable they felt during that week. It has been a long time in this country since the only context in which women have been the focus of policy attention is their reproductive capacity.</para><para>There has been a failure of this government to understand and address the complexity of women's lives. It was illustrated to me the week after the budget when I went to speak to the year 11 and 12 class of politics students at one of my local girls schools. These young women will probably at some time during their lives become mothers, but between them they also have hopes to go to university, to get a job that pays well, to achieve great things in sport, to have their families be proud of them, to travel, to write, to argue, to create, to contribute something to their community, to be well and to have fun.</para><para>The women in this place and those that came before us fought long and hard to get the vote, to stand for parliament, to achieve pay equity and to have our voices heard, and it is our voices that have demanded paid maternity leave, better child care, better education and better health services. It is our voices that have demanded that the balance between work and family be the centre of policy making. We know that the lives and aspirations of women and the girls who will follow us are much bigger, broader and more complex than this government can ever imagine. If you think women are going to be satisfied with what is on offer in this budget then you have got it wrong. </para><para>I want to mention a couple of areas where the government has failed women. Women are the biggest users of Medicare. In the crucial child-bearing and child-rearing years between 20 and 45, women use twice as many Medicare services as men. In the Ballarat region the shortage of doctors, coupled with the huge reduction of access to bulk-billing—we are at 42.3 per cent, according to the last figures we were able to access—has the potential to compromise the health and future health of women and their families. I do not think it is too much to ask that women have access to affordable and accessible health care.</para><para>It has been almost 30 years since the International Year of Women, and it is significant to celebrate the achievements of working women. Equal pay for equal work, affirmative action policies and antidiscrimination policies have all made it possible for women to engage in the work force. However, all the laws in the world cannot make up for lack of access to affordable long day care. The reality for many women that I talk to in my role as a federal member is that their lives are severely impacted upon by the lack of access to affordable child care and by work environments that do not support families. The government has failed to address these issues.</para><para>The budget failed abysmally in addressing another key social policy area, that of unemployment for young people aged between 15 and 19. Our estimates are that amongst this cohort of young people in the City of Ballarat the unemployment rate is 23.4 per cent. I am proud that Labor has put this lost generation back on the agenda with our youth guarantee, a youth guarantee that will see all 15- to 18-year-olds getting support to either be studying at school, TAFE or university or be in a job or apprenticeship. The government needs to recognise the value of Labor's proposal and, instead of trying to carp about where the name of the program came from or trying to argue on narrow definitional lines about who constitutes a young person and who constitutes a teenager, and somehow by doing that assume that it has no responsibility for a policy about them, it should work to actually fix the problem.</para><para>In terms of social policy and what was not contained within the budget for older people, I want to welcome the aged care funding. We have certainly been experiencing a crisis in aged care in my own electorate, with Hepburn Health Services operating with a $1 million deficit each year because of its aged care facilities and Djerriwarrh Health Services operating with a $250,000 deficit each year. You had to say that the crisis needed to be addressed. Look at what was in the budget for older people and look at what it was saying about older people. Three per cent of older people end up in nursing homes. We have to look after them, and we have to look after them well, but the budget did not talk about the rest of the older population.</para><para>What is happening for those people? What is happening for the over-65s who are socially isolated? You could be recognising the enormous contribution you can make through small amounts of money in community care; recognising the broader role that older people play within our community; recognising the mentoring role that they can play within our community; recognising that many older people, particularly those on pensions who do not own their own homes and are in public housing, are in terrible, desperate trouble; and ending some further age discrimination that we have within our current systems. All of those things are things that I hoped to see in the budget but which were not there. </para><para>In my remaining few minutes, I want to turn to some of the local issues within my electorate. I want to acknowledge the good things that were in the budget for my electorate. One thing was the extension of the national initiatives program for the ABC. This was initially announced in the lead-up to the previous election, and we managed to get a terrific radio station in Ballarat that the minister came to open. But until the budget there were no guarantees that this funding would continue from next year. Huge amounts of infrastructure have been poured in, there is local employment and there is obviously a loyal local listening audience, so it is terrific to see that that national initiatives program has been continued in the budget. However, I would also have liked to see the government try not to continue it and try to take—</para><para><inline font-style="italic">A division having been called in the House of Representatives—</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Sitting suspended from 5.47 p.m. to 5.59 p.m.</inline></para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AMR</name.id><name role="metadata">King, Catherine, MP</name><name role="display">Ms KING</name></talker><para>—I was saying in relation to the ABC funding and the national initiatives program that I would have liked to see them try to take it off us, to be quite honest! I would have had a pretty riotous community on my hands had they done so. I certainly welcome the government's extension of the national initiatives program and, therefore, the ABC radio station in Ballarat.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I also want to talk about the wine equalisation tax. As the chair of the Labor caucus wine industry task force—and I note the presence of the member for Burke who is a great member of that subcommittee—I can say that this is an issue we have been fighting for for quite some time. We have to remember that this is a tax of the government's own making. We welcome the fact that they have removed it from small to medium wineries. I understand that there is a slight problem in that the government have announced the policy without reference to the states and are now having to do a bit of a policy patch-up, trying to negotiate with them. We have not seen any legislation as yet, and I hope very much that the Winemakers Federation has not been taken for another election ride on this issue.</para><para>Small wineries in my electorate will certainly benefit greatly from this policy when it comes into effect. They have been struggling with the drought, they have been struggling with the production of their grapes and they have certainly been struggling under the burden of an incredibly unfair tax. I want to acknowledge particularly the work of Jane Lessock from Mount Beckworth Wines. Before I was elected—I think almost the day after becoming a candidate in the previous election campaign—she emailed me about this issue and made me aware of the impact it was having on small wineries in my district. She made me a passionate advocate for this as an area of policy that is vital for my district. So I certainly want to acknowledge Jane Lessock's role in teaching me about the wine equalisation tax and her tireless campaigning locally and with the regional winemakers federation.</para><para>I want to talk a little about what was not in the budget. This year we will commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Eureka Stockade. It is a very significant event in the history of not only Ballarat but also Australia. Most historians and those who know anything about the stockade will acknowledge that it did contribute significantly to the structure and system of democracy in Victoria and the extension of rights to people to stand and to vote for our parliaments. That rebellion is fairly significant. I know that John Malony, author of the book <inline font-style="italic">Eureka</inline>, does not like me to call it a rebellion but it is a word I sometimes slip into using. Certainly, when we look at the history of Australia, the Eureka Stockade is one of only two civil uprisings ever to occur in our entire history. The first event occurred in Darwin and is not widely reported, and the second is the Eureka Stockade. There was an uprising of prisoners at Vinegar Hill in New South Wales, which I note is also getting quite a bit of recognition this year. </para><para>To commemorate this incredible and significant part of Australian history, the state government has committed $1.5 million—but there is nothing in the federal budget at all. In December this year we will commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Eureka Stockade uprising. Obviously I have been campaigning on an issue that this parliament could do something about, which is flying the flag within the precinct. But I am also campaigning on the need to commit money particularly to the democracy conference occurring in Ballarat and also at VUT, which will be an important event at which to talk about the importance of democracy in Australia and the role that the Eureka Stockade played within it.</para><para>Also not within the budget was funding for the ex-prisoner of war memorial, which the ex-prisoner of war memorial committee in Ballarat have secured funding for. We had 10,000 people at the dedication of the memorial; it was an incredibly moving event. This is a national memorial, despite the government refusing to recognise it as such; it contains 35,000 names of ex-prisoners of war from all wars that this country has fought in. But there was no money in the federal budget to help the city of Ballarat and the ex-prisoner of war memorial committee to maintain this magnificent facility. It certainly will be something that I will be campaigning quite hard on.</para><para>The next issue is a little road that is down my way called the Deer Park bypass, which is pretty important. The Western Highway is a national highway; it is the main artery running between Adelaide and Melbourne. It carries over 40,000 pieces of freight each year and it is the main artery for goods and services for people from the western district both to Melbourne and to Adelaide. The Deer Park bypass is a 100 per cent Commonwealth project and, again, we heard no announcement in the budget speech that this project will get any recognition at all. I note that the Calder did get some mention, but the Deer Park bypass did not get any mention at all. Hopefully, with the AusLink announcement on Monday, we will see some funding for the Deer Park bypass. </para><para>I know that the minister has been performing a couple of stunts in my electorate of late. One was with my Liberal opponent when, on congratulating her on what a great campaign she has been running on this issue, he accidentally called her by my name. So it is good to note that, in fact, Minister Ian Campbell knows that `Catherine' has been campaigning incredibly hard; noone has worked harder to try and get the Deer Park bypass funded. Let us hope that he has heard our pleas.</para><para>I also want to talk briefly about drought funding. In my district we have had the lowest rainfall on record for the last eight years. You only have to go to Lake Wendouree, a pretty significant icon in my district—as a rower, I row across it—to see the evidence. At the moment, you can stand in the middle of it. If anyone can tell me why—with the level of water in that lake and in Lake Learmonth and the appalling circumstances being faced by farmers, small businesses and the community out at Learmonth—we cannot get exceptional circumstances funding, I just do not get it. We still have not heard any announcement about exceptional circumstances, despite having the lowest rainfall in my district in eight years. It is continuing. There is no evidence whatsoever that that is changing. They need drought funding. </para><para>I started my speech with some quotes, so I want to conclude with a quote:</para><quote><para>... honesty is being swamped by cynical election campaigns based on fear, the big scare, the massive lie.</para></quote><para>That comes not from our side of the House or from any of those left-wing journalists that the government likes to rail against but from the then Leader of the Opposition, John Howard, in his first headland speech in the lead-up to the 1996 election. But I guess the question that remains for this upcoming election is: which fear or big scare will the government use? Will it be asylum seekers again or Indigenous people or, as we have seen debated today, same sex couples? Which massive lie will the Prime Minister rely on this time?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>30041</page.no><name role="metadata">Nairn, Gary, MP</name><name role="display">Mr NAIRN</name><name.id>OK6</name.id><electorate>Eden-Monaro</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am very pleased to speak on <inline ref="R2040">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2004-2005 </inline>and the cognate bills which are the result of the excellent budget brought down last month by the Treasurer. With federal budgets, I think the key issue we should talk about is the overall running of the Australian economy and not whether this road or that road got some funding or whether this little pet project for somebody got a guernsey. I think people often forget that this is a national budget that sets the framework for the nation. The nation then progresses one way or another, depending on the quality of the overall economic management of the government of the day.</para></talk.start><para>This is certainly an excellent budget when you put it together with the budgets since the coalition came to government. We talk about economic management—this is the seventh budget in a row that is in surplus. We have now paid off $70 billion of the debt we inherited when we came into government in 1996—$70 billion of the $96 billion is now paid. We have projected growth of 3½ per cent over the next three years. Inflation is running at about two per cent. Unemployment is below six per cent. Interest rates—the cash rate—were today kept at 5.25 per cent by the Reserve Bank Governor. These are very good figures. The economy is going so well because of good budgeting by the government, and all the other things that occur in our nation can progress as a result of that.</para><para>If you do not get these things right then you run into difficulties all over the place. Once again, we can contrast these sorts of numbers with what we remember having in the last few years of the previous government. I have spoken a number of times over the last eight years about that, but it is something you cannot remind people of too many times. The experience of the late eighties and early nineties will constantly haunt me and many other people. I think 21.75 per cent was the highest interest rate I paid on my business overdraft which, at the time, was a six-figure overdraft and was keeping 25 people employed during the recession that we had to have. They were interesting days, that is for sure. Those days taught me a huge amount, but it was a lesson that I hope nobody else has to go through in the future. When I compare those circumstances with what we have today and have had for a number of years it is quite incredible.</para><para>The real benefit that has come out of this good management is that many more people are in a job. If you are in a job, you can solve many other problems. If you are not in job, all sorts of issues and problems will arise. But getting people into work, from a government point of view, is by far the best thing that we can do. We see in Eden-Monaro at the moment, as a result of this good management, unemployment now down around the national figure. This is unheard of—it is historic—in Eden-Monaro. In parts of Eden-Monaro we still have high unemployment—higher than I would like. Down on the coast, where unemployment has traditionally been very high, it is still high but over the whole electorate it falls below the six per cent figure, similar to the national figure. That similarity has never been there before. Only a few years ago, the unemployment rate on the coastal parts of the electorate was up into the high teens. Now we are below 10 per cent on one part of the coast and below seven per cent in the other parts. So there are dramatic differences. You can see the changes: the shopping centres are full, the shops are no longer vacant and there is real activity, which is terrific.  </para><para>This budget continues to address issues about jobs and it continues to make sure that interest rates are kept low. Home loan affordability remains at a good level. If interest rates took off, we would certainly see some problems for home buyers, but they are being kept low. Older Australians and families are targeted for assistance. We make no apologies for targeting families in this budget. Look at a number of budgets in a row and see how we have made various changes. If you package them together, which is what you have to do, you can see how various parts of our communities have been assisted over a number of years. You can never do everything at once. If you try to help every little aspect of the economy and the community every time you do your budgeting, you will never do anything substantial for anybody. One of those areas is obviously tax cuts. </para><para>Critics have made much about single people on less than $52,000 not receiving tax cuts but they ignore what has been done over a number of years. It is quite interesting to look at that. For instance, somebody on $20,000 is now paying $625 per year less than they were paying before the A New Tax System was introduced in 2000. We had changes to the tax system in 2000, changes in the 2003-04 budget and changes in the recent budget. Somebody on $20,000, because of those changes that have taken place over a number of years, is paying $625 per year less. Someone on $30,000 is paying $1,050 less, someone on $35,000 is paying $1,250 a year less, someone on $40,000 is paying $1,630 a year less, someone on $45,000 is paying $2,280 a year less, and someone on $50,000 is paying $2,930 less tax per year than they were paying before those first changes were made. Changing the tax scales, which we have done in this budget, is unfinished business from what we tried to do during 2003-04—substantial changes to the tax system which we have continued in this budget. </para><para>The other benefit to families is in the family tax benefit. We see a $600 increase in family tax benefit A, which means that the base rate goes up from $1,095 to $1,695. The income test has eased as well. This is a substantial issue. You can use all sorts of cameos, and families out there in Eden-Monaro can get some idea from some of the examples as to where they fall in. That is why I have given a range of different incomes. The phase-out for the maximum payment of the family tax benefit will be softened so that a family with three children will still receive some payment when earning up to $70,920 per year. The cut-off income for a base payment for a family with three children will be raised to $105,572. They are really quite substantial changes, so you can see that a lot of people are benefiting from those.</para><para>The other major change is with respect to a single income where you have a part-time second earner. Around 90 per cent of these families will receive the additional $600 per child that I mentioned before. That $600 is before 30 June. They will then receive another $600 once their tax is reconciled at the start of the next financial year. That is likely to be in around September, depending on when they get their income tax returns in.</para><para>We also have the maternity allowance of $3,000 on the birth of a baby after 1 July this year. That will rise to $5,000 by 1 July 2008. There are also extra child-care places. We have seen some big increases in child-care places. I have some very strong, growing areas in my electorate, and I have been pleased that we have constantly been able to provide additional child-care places in those fast-growing areas. The budget announced an extra 30,000 outside school hours care places and an extra 1,500 family day care places. That will mean that from 1 July there will be an extra 40,000 places for outside school hours care and 4,000 family day care places—all fairly substantial amounts. </para><para>Carers were well looked after. Eighty thousand people receiving carers payments will get a payment of $1,000 before the end of June. All members of parliament increasingly hear of either people who are caring for elderly people or, all too often, older people looking after younger disabled people. They are receiving carers payments, so they will certainly be pleased to receive that additional support.</para><para>There is $3.1 billion of additional money over the next five years going into roads, and that is on top of $5.6 billion that covers funding for the national highway system and roads of national importance. I know the two ministers responsible will be making further announcements about that money, but the key there is that the money is budgeted. I see the opposition running around in various places, including in my electorate of Eden-Monaro, making all sorts of promises about roads, but we have not seen what sort of programs they are talking about and where the money would come from. For the things that I have been able to talk about in my electorate that could be funded over the next few years, the money is there—it is in the budget. That is a key issue.</para><para>Aged care is a very important part of the budget, and certainly the changes to aged care have been well received throughout my electorate. We are looking at overall payments of about $3.6 million into Eden-Monaro by the end of June to all of our aged care facilities. Having spoken to many of those facilities, I can say they are certainly extremely pleased about the extra assistance that they will be receiving. I will go through the various aged care facilities because they are so important and are key to looking after our older people. It is really a key thing in our rural towns to have great facilities, and all of our facilities are superb. Most of them are community based in one way or the other, and they do a great job.</para><para>Banksia Village down at Broulee will be eligible for a $112,000 payment by the end of June. I took the Prime Minister down there the other day to meet those people, and he enjoyed the visit. Bimbimbie Retirement Village at Merimbula, $182,000; Casuarina Hostel in Bega, $108,500; Crown Gardens in Batemans Bay, $140,000; Currawanna Home in Bombala, $140,00; Dalmeny Retirement Village, $126,000; Edgewood Park facility at Batemans Bay, $269,500; the Eurobodalla Shire Residential Care Facility at Dalmeny, $192,500; George Forbes House in Queanbeyan, $297,500; Hillgrove House in Bega, $203,000; Imlay House at Pambula, $182,000; Keweree Lodge in Queanbeyan, $133,000; Maranatha Lodge in Batemans Bay, which was extended quite substantially recently, $332,500; Mariner Park at Tura Beach, $84,000; Moruya Hostel, $105,000; Nullica Lodge at Eden, 45,500; Queanbeyan Nursing Home $385,000; Sir William Hudson Memorial centre in Cooma $182,000; Snowy River Hostel, the small one at Berriedale $35,000; and Yallambee Lodge in Cooma $84,000. They are substantial payments to all of these aged care facilities which will really help them with what they do—not to mention the additional places that have been announced and the increase in the formula from 100 places per thousand people over the age of 70, to 108 per thousand. That will put substantial new places into our area. </para><para>There are just a few other key issues. The member for Ballarat mentioned the WET tax. The change was well received by all the small wineries in the greater Canberra area and down the coast. There was a $290,000 rebate for wineries up to $1 million. Across the nation, 90 per cent of producers will be eligible. I cannot absolutely confirm it, but I think 100 per cent of the wineries within my electorate will be eligible.</para><para>Drought assistance for exceptional circumstances will be forking out $73 million in income support and interest rate subsidies between 2003-04 and 2005-06, giving a total of $1.1 billion in drought assistance between 2002-03 and 2005-06. It is certainly well received and needed in many parts of my electorate. The drought has certainly not gone from the Monaro. People know that it is extremely dry around the Canberra area and in the far South Coast as well. Dairy farmers down there have been eligible for exceptional circumstances for some time, and I know the Monaro farmers are currently going through that application process also.</para><para>Small business will certainly benefit. In fact, I was quite surprised that 740,000 small businesses and 30,000 not-for-profit community groups will be eligible for the change in GST reporting to once a year. It is quite a large number that fall within the categories of turnover of less than $50,00 for small businesses and $100,000 for the not-for-profit groups, and certainly they will benefit from that. </para><para>While I am talking about GST, I want to reinforce the fact that all of the GST that is collected does go to the states. It was good to see the Treasurer announce in the budget that from this coming year all states now are in a bonus situation—that is, they will be collecting or being paid more in GST than they would have been getting under the old financial system between the Commonwealth and the states.</para><para>I was particularly amazed to be given a copy of a letter to a constituent from the Labor state member for Monaro, who tries to justify the New South Wales government's axing of the Mature Workers Program as part of their mini-budget. In that mini-budget, they also whacked an extra stamp duty on houses when you sell them and introduced all sorts of other incredible taxes. In trying to justify it—as the states always do, they just blame the Commonwealth—he says, `On top of this, we're yet to see a single cent of the money raised from the GST.' I could not believe that. Even if you want to argue about whether or not they are getting a bonus, they are getting all the GST and have done so ever since it started. But he writes to a constituent and says that the state government have never seen the GST. He—and I will quote it again—says, `On top of this, we're yet to see a single cent of the money raised from the GST.' These are the sorts of lies that seem to get thrown around by some people in the political process. It is an outrageous thing to say in a letter to a constituent. New South Wales not only have been getting every single cent but also this year—all the other states have already got this in past years—are getting more money than they would have under the old arrangements.</para><para>This is a very good budget. It continues the very sound economic management that the coalition have demonstrated ever since we came to government. That is the key to a national budget—to get all those national things right. We have seen the benefits of good economic management over the last number of years, particularly with the flow-on to falling unemployment. Eden-Monaro has certainly received this budget well and knows that it can grow into the future, as a result of that good management.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>30045</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Brendan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR</name><name.id>00AN3</name.id><electorate>Burke</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on that <inline ref="R2040">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2004-2005 </inline>in this cognate debate. This budget handed down on 12 May this year is the largest spending budget in our history. The budget will expend $52 billion, but somehow it leaves so many Australians in receipt of nothing. The budget targets income earners on $52,000 per annum—effectively $1,000 a week—or over, but it provides no income tax cut for those earning below that amount. The fact is that in my electorate—and I am sure in most electorates of both government members and opposition members—well over the majority of Australians will not receive an income tax cut. </para></talk.start><para>I estimate that almost 90 per cent of income earners in my electorate will not be in receipt of an income tax cut, and I think that is comparable to most electorates. In fact, once you get out of the capital cities, you find that that proportion grows. As we heard in question time today, when the opposition leader asked questions of the government in relation to this, it is clear that, in many seats held by The Nationals, the proportion of Australians not in receipt of income tax cuts increases. It is a sad day when a Treasurer can hand down a budget that is so large in total but so narrow in its application to beneficiaries.</para><para>It is a too-clever-by-half budget. This was an attempt by the Treasurer to niche target what he and the Prime Minister see as a certain demographic in marginal seats. This was designed purely to win the next election. They are narrowly targeted income tax cuts for those who are perceived by the government and their pollsters to be swinging voters in marginal seats. However, what it has done to the electorate of Burke is to ensure that, as I said, almost 90 per cent of PAYE income earners will be left with nothing in their pocket in relation to income tax cuts.</para><para>There has been some song and dance about the family tax benefit. I welcome the fact that there will be some relief in terms of the family tax benefit for families with children. It is certainly going to provide some relief, particularly to those who are struggling to make ends meet with the increased costs they experience in their daily lives. But the fact is that not all recipients of the family tax benefit will indeed receive the second instalment. We hear the Treasurer boast about the first instalment of $600 to be paid before 30 June this year. But we are also acutely aware of the many constituents who have complained about the system which has compelled them to find money to repay the Commonwealth because of the way in which income is assessed. What we are aware of is that up to one-third of recipients of the family tax benefit have an average debt of over $800—I think it is closer to $900. So in other words, one-third of recipients will in fact not only not receive the second instalment to be paid but also will still be in debt after that first amount is taken from their debt. It certainly will provide some relief but the view of the Labor Party and of other commentators is that this is not a good policy. </para><para>This is a two-part bribe by the government: pick up your $600 cheque, signed by the Prime Minister, on your way to the ballot box. That is the intention. That is the modus operandi of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer: to try and buy people's votes in the forthcoming election. We recall vividly how much fiscal and monetary responsibility went out the window prior to the 2001 election, when the Prime Minister and the government sought to buy themselves out of trouble. We see again this spike in expenditure that arises just preceding a federal election. What will occur in the event of a re-election of a Howard coalition government is that they will find ways to claw back and take back moneys that were expended. We are aware—and this has gone unchallenged by independent commentators—that this is the highest taxing government since Federation. In terms of proportion of GDP, the Commonwealth, whether it is through GST or through other means, has in fact imposed a greater tax burden upon Australians than any other government in history. That is not going to change if there is a re-election of this government. </para><para>While the Treasurer likes to boast about the income tax cuts, we see that they are confined to fewer than 10 per cent of income earners. Indeed, when it comes to the family tax benefit we see that many will not be in receipt of the second instalment. Despite the spending, despite the huge largesse that has been expended by the Treasurer, money does not go into the pockets of the majority of Australians. Indeed, those people not defined as family—and I presume under the Prime Minister's description that would be 2.4 children, a man and a woman as father and mother and probably a dog and a picket fence—and outside of that construct will not be in receipt of any income tax cut or other relief unless they earn more than $52,000.</para><para>I know many occupational groups and many people in quite deserving occupations who will not receive a cent. They do not have children, or they do not have dependent children—that is more important in relation to this budget—and they are contributing greatly to this country. But they will not be in receipt of any relief whatsoever. Many teachers, nurses, home carers and child-care workers will not be in receipt of any money at all as a result of this budget. The Treasurer has been too tricky about his application here. The Treasurer and the Prime Minister have gone into a room—it has taken them six months—with pollsters and asked, `How do we target a group that will get us over the line?' But I think the Australian community has seen this for what it really is: a bribe on the way to the ballot box by this government.</para><para>We should not be too surprised. When I was contacted by local media I indicated that this should not be a surprise because, in philosophical terms, this is a Liberal Party budget. There is no point feigning surprise when you see that the income tax cuts are directed at the top end of the income scale. Of course, the Liberal Party is in office and you would expect the Liberal Party to look after those at the higher income end rather than those at the middle or lower income ends. So I am not particularly surprised; I am just disappointed that there has been no effort to look after the majority of Australians.</para><para>It is also in accordance with Liberal Party philosophy to continue to pay elite non-government schools greater increases in real terms than public schools and very needy independent schools. This has been a trend now for some years. The fact is that we are aware that the old school tie applies to everyone, I suppose, except for the Prime Minister. If the Prime Minister applied the old school tie he might look after public schools, because he is, I know, one of the very few people on the frontbench who went to a government school, although he does not seem to return and visit there often, if at all.</para><para>The fact is that this government has been paying increases in real terms to elite non-government schools like King's College, Geelong Grammar and others at the expense of public schools in my electorate and very needy independent schools that are not getting the increases. For example, the deal that was hatched recently to the Catholic school system provided approximately a three per cent increase, which was pretty much a CPI increase for that system. The Catholic school system is one of the very few systems where negotiations can be centralised, given the way in which the system is structured. I have to say that there were some that lauded it as a very good offer made by the Commonwealth. But, if you look at the amount each school in the Catholic school system receives and compare that with the elite category 1 schools, you find that, in fact, they have not received a good increase. </para><para>Most importantly, the public school system is in much need of injected capital. I do not think there is any concern shown in this budget for looking after schools like Deer Park Secondary College and Brookside college, which are public schools in my electorate that are doing it tough. They have fantastic teachers and wonderful students. I have had the great fortune of meeting many of them—that is, both teachers and principals of those schools and the students. What those students want is the same opportunity. Students who reside in Deer Park and the surrounding suburbs in western Melbourne want to be given the same opportunity as kids in the leafier suburbs of Melbourne such as Canterbury, Toorak, Hawthorn and Kew. They want the same opportunity and they are not going to get it if there is no effort to address the inequity in funding.</para><para>Again, I am not surprised—it is in keeping with Liberal Party philosophy, certainly in recent times, to look after the better off at the expense of those who are most in need. But it is disappointing to see a government in this day and age failing to realise that we need to invest equitably in our future. One of the best ways to do that is to invest in our young people and provide them with opportunities. That has not been shown. There has been no vision, no equity, no sense of egalitarianism and no fair go being exhibited by the Treasurer or the Prime Minister in relation to this budget. I think that is a major concern.</para><para>The other concern I have is that, whilst it is good in some senses that the government has followed Labor and decided to have some form of maternity payment, as it likes to call it, to women who have children and to provide some relief so that they can care for their children, we do not accept that the up-front payment is the most sensible approach to providing relief for those mothers. We believe that it is an inferior approach to the one that has been outlined by the Leader of the Opposition and others.</para><para>There are some grave concerns. Looking at the other side of the ledger, it is fair to say that there has been not only a failure by the government in the broader package but also a failure to really target those things that are most needed. For example, look at the lousy proposal in the area of dental care that has been put forward by the Commonwealth government as opposed to the opposition's proposal. The fact is that we now need a comprehensive dental program to look after those in need—not when their teeth and gums are so badly in need of care that it is an emergency situation. What we need and what Labor is proposing is a $300 million-plus proposal that will cater for people in need, particularly the elderly in our community. People who have already pitched in—people who have contributed to this country for many decades—should be the recipients of a decent dental care scheme. It is tragic to see elderly people in particular in my electorate who cannot get care for their teeth and gums that are clearly infected. It is a real problem and it is not being addressed by the government. It will be addressed by Labor.</para><para>It is the same story when it comes to expenditure on health. More money is being spent on advertising by this government than is being spent on dental care. Over $100 million will be spent on advertising—on propaganda. It would make Goebbels blush. Instead, that money could be expended on proper health care and indeed on targeting the problems of declining access to doctors who bulk-bill. The Prime Minister has been on the record wanting to destroy Medicare. He clearly knows that it is so popular that he cannot come out with a frontal attack, so he wants it to wither on the vine. He wants his favourite, Tony Abbott, to do his bidding for him. By comparison it is an inferior policy because it does not target saving Medicare. It is about dividing up the system into two classes: those who can afford it and those who cannot. It is an inferior system for those who cannot afford it. </para><para>Again, like the dental care proposal, the government missed an opportunity to properly look after infants. We know it is a lot of money to spend on pneumococcal vaccination. There is even a question mark over how many infant deaths there have been as a result of this disease. But I could not fathom the minister for education wishing to quibble whether it was 50, 20, 10 or 35. The fact is that one death is one too many. When we know that we can prevent those deaths, we should be expending in that area. The Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister for health have rightly targeted that area as a special case in order to prevent more tragic deaths.</para><para>In relation to health and education the problem is that the government has got it wrong. It listens to the pollsters about demographics and possible swinging voters in marginal seats but it does not listen to the people. The difference between Mark Latham and John Howard going to a town hall is quite obvious: we know that there are no bouncers on the door when Mark Latham is speaking; there is no-one stopping people coming in to speak with him. He has an open-door policy when it comes to speaking to members of the public when he goes around Australia. We do not see that with the Prime Minister. </para><para>By comparison, we see a Prime Minister who stage-manages everything. I recall on one occasion in Melbourne recently—I think you were there, Mr Deputy Speaker Barresi—a woman whose name happened to be Latham was thrown out. That woman, who had no relationship whatsoever with the Leader of the Opposition, was ejected from that room—in fact, she was a Liberal Party voter, from what I understand—because they were too worried that she might cause a commotion. That is the difference between the way the Prime Minister operates and the way the Leader of the Opposition operates. One of the consequences of that behaviour is that, as we are listening to the cries for help from the community, the Prime Minister and Treasurer are focusing on pollsters. That is the big difference between the Leader of the Opposition and the Prime Minister, and I think it is a real problem.</para><para>The last thing I wanted to touch on—I have managed to speak on these issues a couple of times, because there was a tax bill that went through recently and I spoke on that—is the Treasurer himself. We do not know, if the coalition wins government at the next election, who is going to be Prime Minister for that term. I do not think the Prime Minister or the Treasurer have been honest. I do not think the Prime Minister has been honest with the Treasurer and I do not think the Treasurer and the Prime Minister have been honest with the public. That is the position.</para><para>The Treasurer had a chance in 1994. If he had had the guts, he could have challenged—he could have taken up the leadership. But he thought he might lose so he did not. The Treasurer thought he might lose, so he did not; he waited. Last year the Leader of the Opposition thought he might win a challenge, and he did. The difference between the Treasurer and the Leader of the Opposition is that the Leader of the Opposition took his chance—and the problem for the Treasurer is he may never get a chance. The fact is we do not know what is going to happen, because the Prime Minister and the Treasurer will not tell the public the truth. I think the public deserve an honest answer, but it appears we are not going to get one. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>30049</page.no><name role="metadata">Elson, Kay, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs ELSON</name><name.id>6K6</name.id><electorate>Forde</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am very happy to have this opportunity to speak today on the 2004-05 federal budget through the <inline ref="R2040">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2004-2005</inline> and cognate bills. There are so many significant aspects of this budget, it is hard to know exactly where to start. We have witnessed yet another healthy surplus, and $70 billion of Labor's $96 billion debt has now been repaid, saving a massive $5.5 billion per year in interest payments alone. There are tax cuts that will make sure that more than 80 per cent of all taxpayers pay a top marginal rate of 30 per cent or less. There is a $2.2 billion aged care package to provide more places and better nursing-home care. There is an extra $1.5 billion in Defence spending to help increase our capability and upgrade national security. There is an extra $8 billion for schools over the next five years and more funding for new apprenticeships.</para></talk.start><para>The list goes on and on. There are also bonus payments to carers to recognise the great work they do. There is an increase in the government's contribution to superannuation for low- and middle-income workers. There is an extra $300 million for the Natural Heritage Trust, which delivers real, practical environmental solutions to local problems. There is an extra $3.1 billion to upgrade our local road and rail systems. These are really significant improvements and benefits for our nation. We are delivering on our commitment as a government to get on with the job and always do what is right in the national interest.</para><para>But the most important and most significant aspect of the budget in my view is that it delivers over $19 billion to Australian families—the largest family assistance package ever put forward by an Australian government. The significance of this lies not so much in dollar terms—although the financial support will be warmly welcomed—but in the recognition it gives to parents throughout the country that their work is important and that we realise the unique challenges that they face daily. It further reinforces the great truth that not only is the rearing of children one of the most enriching and important things that a person can do but it is also vital for the future of this country and it is a lasting contribution to our society.</para><para>That fact seems to have been sadly overlooked by those who are fuelling that `why should we pay for other people's children' debate. Can I say I think this is a particularly mean-spirited approach, to say nothing of the fact that it denies the clear economic importance of children to our nation. The fact is that our taxes pay for a range of things, including health care for people of all ages, age pensions, university education, scientific research, services and support to veterans, nursing-home care, roads, public transport and defence. To a degree we support and subsidise the arts, various community organisations and charities, and provide a very diverse range of other services through these taxes. Yet a modest increase in family payments to help families meet the costs of raising children is met with a `What about me?' response from some quarters.</para><para>I happen to think that is a very sad indictment on the way some sections of our community view parenting and the value of families to our nation. It is all the more reason why we should, wherever possible, increase government support to families and children to give proper recognition of the importance that we place on them as the cornerstone of our society. As someone who has raised a large family—I actually had two for myself, two for my husband and then a further four for the country—I know the challenges that parents face, not just financially. There are also the greater responsibilities and the joys and difficulties of family life at different stages. Knowing that your efforts are valued by the government and community and that you are helping contribute to the nation's future is, I believe, very important. Of course, that is not why anyone decides to become a parent. There is enormous personal benefit, fulfilment and satisfaction. Parenting equips you with important skills, personal values and emotional experiences you never knew possible—and I fully understand that those who have not had children yet cannot fully comprehend what I have just said. </para><para>There are so many negative messages these days about parenting and the costs of children that I believe it is important that, as a government, we provide tangible recognition that this is a worthwhile, important role to fulfil in life. I thought it was a very sad indictment several years ago when then Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett was roundly criticised for pointing out to a group of year 12 students that becoming a parent was a worthy aspiration and should form a central part of their plans for the future. Why this was such an outrageous suggestion is beyond me, but the outcry was loud and long at the time. I believe we have come a long way since then, and I hope that the Howard government's pro-family policies have helped raise the status, so to speak, of children and families.</para><para>This budget gives very practical and real assistance to families by increasing by $600 per child the rate of family tax benefit A. Each family receiving family tax benefit A will also receive a one-off payment of $600 per child before 30 June this year. Further, we have adjusted the withdrawal rate between the maximum and base rates of FTB A from 30 per cent to 20 per cent. In addition, we have reduced the income test withdrawal rate for family tax benefit B to help women returning to part-time work. To help families with the birth of a new baby, we will also provide a new maternity payment of $3,000, which will increase to $5,000 by July 2008. We do not pretend that this begins to cover the full cost of having a baby but, again, it is recognition that this is a time of change and adjustment for many families and a time when they need and deserve a little extra financial support. I really appreciate how the government has handled the child-care issues in the budget. This budget provides an extra 40,000 outside school hours child-care places and 4,000 more family day care places to provide families with help to juggle their work and family responsibilities.</para><para>I have been dismayed by the Labor Party's negative response to these important budget measures for children and families. While they have agreed to vote for these measures—because even they can see that they are deserving, practical measures that will help Australian families—they have done nothing but whine and complain from the sidelines, to the point where you wonder whether Labor will retain these benefits if they are elected to office. It is still anyone's guess what Labor will do if they are elected to office, apart from reading to and mentoring a very small percentage of disadvantaged young Australians. While that is a worthwhile task, there is certainly a lot more to government. But when Labor had the gall to criticise this generous, positive budget as having `forgotten some people', you just had to cast your mind back to the last few Labor budgets when they were in government to see what they meant. What exactly did Labor mean by `a budget for everyone'? It is true that there were no forgotten people in, for example, the Labor budget of 1993—their last budget. Everyone got slugged extra petrol excise, everyone got slugged extra wholesale sales tax, everyone missed out on the l-a-w law tax cuts that were promised but never delivered, and everyone ultimately paid the price for Labor's ongoing budget deficits. That was certainly a budget for all, and no-one was spared.</para><para>Those who have had this `what's in it for me' approach to the budget should cast their minds back to what budget night was like under Labor. It was never a question of `What do I get?' but of `How much more will I be out of pocket? Will deeming rates rise? Will I pay more for my beer and petrol? Will I continue to pay ridiculously high marginal tax rates?' Those were the sorts of budget night questions that continually confronted us under the Labor government. In between budgets we had the eternal worry of when interest rates would rise again, thanks to Labor's poor economic management. As someone who had to take out a second mortgage at that time, I know first-hand what a burden that was for families. </para><para>That was in the past, and Labor and some sections of the media would like us to forget all about it now, pretend it did not happen and look to the future. I am all for looking to the future, but the fact is that the best predictor of the future is the past. Given what we have seen of their `magic pudding' approach to economic management under the member for Hotham, you have to assume that that is what we will be facing again if Labor get into government. At the coming election it will be a very clear choice, as never before, between responsible government and strong economic management under the Howard government and a return to the big spending, high taxing, union led government of Labor.</para><para>When you look at the breadth and scope of the positive measures in this budget, you see a stark contrast to what Labor have to offer. The Leader of the Opposition seems to think that a few platitudes and warm and fuzzy statements will be enough to see him coast to victory. But do these election friendly statements ever reflect Labor's true position? Reading to children is of course very noble, and the vast majority of Australian parents already have the marvellous habit of reading to their children. The vast majority of children today are attaining excellent literacy and numeracy levels. But Labor in government let literacy and numeracy standards drop to dangerously low levels—in fact, 30 per cent of students did not meet basic literacy and numeracy standards. We had to fight the unions tooth and nail to introduce national literacy and numeracy standards and we are still fighting state Labor governments to make sure results are reported to parents. You have to believe that, despite their rhetoric about reading to kiddies, this would be at risk if Labor were in government.</para><para>Labor now have a catchy `earn or learn' policy for young people, yet Labor and their union mates opposed the whole principle of Work for the Dole. They still despise it. They admit they would scrap this successful program that brings real benefits for the community and put in place another airy-fairy, expensive scheme like the infamous Working Nation. Apprenticeships are another area where Labor are trying to claim the high ground, yet under Labor apprenticeships fell to the lowest level in 30 years, such was their elitist focus on university education above all else. Since we came to office we have been boosting apprenticeship and traineeship numbers so that now we have more than 406,000 Australians training as apprentices. This budget provides $725 million for new apprenticeships. Again, as with much of Labor's warm and fuzzy talk, it is a case of looking at what they do and what they really believe rather than what they say.</para><para>Labor have been grandstanding lately about pneumococcal vaccination, yet, when they were in office, ensuring children were vaccinated properly was such a low priority that only around 53 per cent of children were fully immunised. That is a lower rate than in Third World countries. Our government have worked hard to increase immunisation levels to over 90 per cent and we have worked in a very diligent and genuine way to ensure that the vaccination schedule is updated and upgraded as necessary. Again Labor are quick with the rhetoric, but again they have form that does not match that rhetoric. </para><para>The really big hypocrisy is in education. Labor say we should spend more money on education. This budget increases funding for schools over the next four years by $8 billion to a massive $31.3 billion. In fact, since coming to office the Howard government have increased school funding by over 60 per cent, while inflation during that time has been around 20 per cent. I must say that I am disturbed at the divide caused by the Labor members in this House and their constant misleading statements about state school funding. The results have been, especially in my electorate, mums and dads are taking their children out of public school and running off to private schools, thinking that is the only way that their children can get a decent education. I tell people throughout my electorate as often as I can how good state schools are. I have had eight children attend state schools and I currently have seven grandchildren attending state schools, and I can tell people that they do not miss out on anything. Their parents tell me how good their teachers are and what a top-class education they are receiving through them. I am pleading with Labor to stop this nonsense and let us get on with looking after our children.</para><para>We also know that the state Labor governments—who actually have the responsibility for school funding—have failed to match our funding increases. In fact, if state Labor in Queensland had matched our funding increase last year there would have been an extra $116 million for Queensland public schools. That is just by matching our increase and not by doing anything more. Like Labor claims, this should have happened. State Labor have failed to even match what we are doing. But where is the outcry from the opposition leader or Labor's union mates? Again with Labor it is all talk. What do they actually do in government? The rhetoric just does not match their actions. It would be laughable if it were not such a serious matter.</para><para>We all know that cheap jibes and glib comments are easy from opposition. Off the cuff comments like, `I'll bring the troops home by Christmas,' made without any real consideration of not just the situation on the ground but the wider political ramifications, may be just a silly mistake in opposition but in government the cost could be very high. Government is a serious business.</para><para>Balancing the budget is one of the most fundamental tasks of the government. No amount of responsible spending can take place unless the fundamentals are managed properly. In this, the Howard government's ninth budget, we have continued to deliver benefits where they are needed most without raising taxes and without cutting important spending but by responsible economic management. In fact, each year we are currently saving $5.5 billion interest that we would have been otherwise paying each year if we had not paid back $70 billion of Labor's $96 billion debt. And it is interesting to note that $70 billion is the exact figure that Labor managed to run up as debt in their last five budgets. Yes, it took Labor just five short years to saddle Australia with an extra interest bill of $5.5 billion every single year—a wasted $5.5 billion every single year because they ran up budget deficits. And I should point out too that most of the time they actually said the budget would be in surplus. The budget never ended up that way, though. That just goes to show that a lot of damage can be done in a short time if a government does not know how to properly manage an economy. And that is another reality from which the Leader of the Opposition cannot hide.</para><para>In fact, he has some personal experience and form, having saddled Liverpool Council with a huge recurrent debt during his time as mayor. Once again I point out that the best predictor of the future is the past. Labor have not learnt from the past. They will never admit they badly messed up the economy; they will never show any regret or remorse for home loan interest rates of 17 per cent. If they cannot learn from the past then, as the saying goes, they are doomed to repeat it—not if we on this side of the House can help it. </para><para>I am very proud of the government's economic track record, not because of raw facts and figures—excellent thought they are—but because having balanced the budget we have been able to deliver real, practical benefits: tax cuts, increased family benefits, more funding for schools, better aged care, more apprenticeships and reduced business taxes. And economic stability, which increases business investment, which in turn brings about a huge reduction in our unemployment figure. The list could go on and on. These are real, tangible benefits that make a difference in the lives of everyday Australians.</para><para>This budget builds on the work we have done and sets out a plan for the future—a plan that would all be at risk under Labor. I want to congratulate the Treasurer on another excellent budget. His contribution to Australia's future is undoubtedly significant and ongoing. My only hope is that Labor does not get the opportunity to ruin his years of hard work. I am pleased to commend the <inline ref="R2040">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2004-2005</inline> and related bills to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>30053</page.no><name role="metadata">Price, Roger, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PRICE</name><name.id>QI4</name.id><electorate>Chifley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R2040">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2004-2005</inline>, and I am provoked into making a couple of comments by the honourable member for Forde. She raised the question of interest rates. There is no doubt that we had high interest rates at a time when there were high interest rates throughout the world. But the reality of what we are facing today is that, internationally, Australia has amongst the highest interest rates in the world. We are at world's best practice in terms of high interest rates. But that is not my big point. As a proportion of their salary and wages, people are paying far more on their mortgages today than they ever did under Labor. In fact, people now, particularly first home owners and those who have recently gone into a mortgage, are highly sensitive to the smallest interest rate increase.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AMP</name.id><name role="metadata">Grierson, Sharon, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Price, Roger, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PRICE</name></talker><para>—Yes, it wipes them out. Mortgages are so large that even a tiny increase in interest rates puts enormous pressure on struggling families. If you have paid your home off, you do not feel that pressure. But in my electorate of Chifley there are a lot of families feeling that pressure. In Western Sydney there are a lot of families feeling that pressure. For government members who keep on berating us about interest rates when we were in government, let me repeat: people are paying more in mortgage repayments today, in 2004—notwithstanding the historically low interest rates in Australia, which are high by international standards—than they have ever paid before.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I was very interested in the comments about state schools. I have a belief that parents have freedom of choice and that schools, whether they are independent or public, need to stand by their own results. I am thrilled to say that at St Mary's Senior High School we actually attract heaps of students from the private sector. It is one of those schools that is reversing the trend. I find it funny that the honourable member for Forde stands up and says, `I support public schools,' when her Prime Minister says that they have no values and do not deliver. I have never thought that. I have always argued for education reform, particularly in my electorate. I do it today and I will do it tomorrow. But to suggest that public schools do not have any values is outrageous. About 75 per cent of all students in Australia go to public schools. We should cherish and value public schools, not deride them. Please, member for Forde, talk to your Prime Minister. </para><para>There is always the argument that the member for Forde used, as does the Minister for Education, Science and Training, that: `We've increased our percentage of money to schools'—primarily, I might say, to private schools—`so why don't the state governments do the same?' There is a very good reason. Take my own state of New South Wales. Over $8 billion of the state budget goes to schools. Of that $8 billion, only about $585 million goes to private schools, by way of interest subsidies and special programs. So states have a much higher proportion of money that goes to the public schools. If we were to increase the state budget to schools—and I wish we could—by 10 per cent, that would be $800 million. And this is from a state where the Commonwealth has recently cut out $356 million. I am not aware of any of my public schools getting extra money out of the budget, but I do know that King's School does very well. All the elite schools do very well. The group of schools in our society that has seen the highest increase in the percentage terms that the member for Forde wants to talk about is the elite schools. What a disgrace. I do not object to elite schools, but do not advance the argument to me that parents cannot afford them.</para><para>If, as the member for Forde says, the past is the best predictor of the future, let me say to my constituents in the Chifley electorate that the one thing that you can be sure about with the Howard government is that they will squeeze you dry like a lemon over two years and they will give something back in election year. Is this any exception? Of course not. There is not $20 billion in this budget, as we had before the 2001 election. This is the all time record. This is $52 billion, with $6 billion to be spent before the end of the financial year. If a Labor government did that, we would have all of the commentators saying, `What a profligate government this is—it has no financial responsibility and no concern for the future.' That would be just about the $6 billion. All up, it is $52 billion. Of course, they would be writing editorials about how irresponsible we were. But, as the member for Forde says, look to the past to understand the future. You are getting money back now but you will pay later.</para><para>On the tax cuts I have already said in another debate that 93 per cent of people in my electorate get zip. Do you know how much pensioners get out of it? Zip. If you are on a disability pension or an aged pension you get zip out of this budget. If you were to say, `Look, there is some money in there for aged pensioners and retirees and for aged care facilities, so each facility is getting $3,500 per bed,' then I know that those facilities that are operated by the not-for-profit sector would make good use of it. But there is absolutely no probity or tests associated with this windfall handout. Have a guess who is the biggest winner: of course, those well-known Liberal supporters, the Moran family. Do you know what accountability they are required to provide? In 2008 their facilities need to meet the new standards. There is absolutely nothing in the legislation to stop those proprietors from pocketing the money and then selling their facilities before 2008, and this government would have given them a windfall.</para><para>I did want to say that, in my electorate of Chifley, there is great concern about Mt Druitt Hospital. I would love to stand up here and say, `I am really pleased because the government is providing more nurses and doctors for Mt Druitt Hospital and—do you know—we are going to be able to reopen the intensive care unit,' or `There was some money in here for a dental program, so the state government's dental program is going to be able to be doubled to meet the demand and lower the waiting list.' I cannot say that. </para><para>There is real pressure on state hospitals. In fact, in my electorate there is a great belief that the Mt Druitt Hospital is going to close. Let me just put this on the record. I was the chairman, by invitation, of the local committee which was fighting for that hospital. I was the inaugural deputy chairman of that hospital. I might say that a want of ecclesiastical qualifications prevented me from aspiring to the position of chair. That was occupied by `Spud' Murphy, as some call him, but I would be more respectful and say Bishop Murphy. I have had a long and proud history and association with that hospital, as has my state colleague the Hon. Richard Amery, the member for Mt Druitt. That hospital will close over our dead bodies. It is not going to close.</para><para>It is true that, at the instigation of doctors, a discussion paper has been developed which is looking at what facilities should be centred at Mt Druitt and what facilities should be centred at Blacktown Hospital. To my constituents, particularly the people of Mt Druitt and all of those who look to the Mt Druitt Hospital with its very distinguished record of service, I will just say this: the department never wanted that hospital. Never, ever did the department of health want that hospital at Mt Druitt. We got it. It is there. It will continue to operate and we will not allow it to be converted to any other allied use. We will get the best deal for our constituents and for Mt Druitt Hospital. I just wanted to put that on the record. I might say that that is with no assistance from the federal government. There is nothing in this budget that will ease the pressure on state hospitals. We all know—everyone knows—what pressure those hospitals, doctors and nurses are under.</para><para>Perhaps a little unusually, I want to talk about the report <inline font-style="italic">Every picture tells a story</inline>. You will remember that the terms of reference for this inquiry were announced by no less than the Prime Minister. I think the committee and its chair, Kay Hull, did a terrific job. We were under a tremendous amount of pressure to bring down the report before the end of December—and we did; it was a unanimous report. The honourable member for Hinkler knows that family law, child support and counselling are difficult areas.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>KV5</name.id><name role="metadata">Neville, Paul, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Neville</name></talker><para>—I gave evidence to that inquiry.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Price, Roger, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PRICE</name></talker><para>—As did a number of your colleagues. I know that, on the backbench of both sides of the House, there is a great deal of interest in getting reform and change. Madam Deputy Speaker Corcoran, I wish I could stand up before you and my constituents and say that the recommendations have been adopted. They have not been, and that is a real disappointment. If we are to get reform in this area, we need the cooperation of the major parties. It is no good the coalition going off on one track and Labor on another. We actually need bipartisan support, and I think a tremendous platform has been laid here.</para></talk.start></continue><para>But the committee members have been under vicious attack from the media and the former Chief Justice that the proposition of a tribunal was unconstitutional. I resent that. It is not unconstitutional. The committee had access, in a private briefing, to the chief legal adviser of the Commonwealth. As the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> reported—not through me, I might say—we have called him back and had another briefing, and he stands by his recommendations that the tribunal is constitutional. Anyone running around this parliament trying to suggest otherwise is causing mischief, giving the former Chief Justice of the Family Court his greatest victory in retirement and, I think, hindering progress.</para><para>Importantly, no-one should be under any illusions. It was said: `You won't lessen the case load, because anything involving domestic violence or sexual abuse will still have to be dealt with by the courts.' The tribunal can hear those cases, but you would not expect it to hear the majority of cases. Difficult cases involving domestic violence—and, in my belief, sexual abuse—should be dealt with by the courts and fast-tracked. But that does not stop the tribunal from having a once-only look in. Contact and residency are repeatedly brought up as the most difficult issues in the area of enforcement. There is nothing to stop the tribunal from making decisions and enforceable orders via conciliation and then arbitration. If those orders are not adhered to and a case is made out, the tribunal can vary those orders, which is always the greater sanction. But if they want to enforce it by way of incarceration or fines—and we have never argued that that would be the case—that has to be done by a court; that is judicial. </para><para>But there will be judicial review. If there is an error of law or a denial of natural justice, of course the courts will be involved. But if you get up on judicial review it is most likely that all the court will do is remit it back to the tribunal for further consideration. One of the things I am most keen about is that, if both parties agree, the tribunal can settle all matters. It is true that there are big losers in all this, and they are the legal profession. We have no idea how much money the parties to family law—or their parents or grandparents—are spending. A study on that has never been done, but I suggest that it is in the hundreds of millions of dollars. What we are doing for ordinary people—the majority of Australians—is giving them a no-frills, no-cost means of settling these difficult issues.</para><para>I just say this: Prime Minister, you announced it; you have exceeded the time to respond to the report; isn't it about time that you responded? We are running out of time for bipartisan cooperation in this parliament about it. You set up huge expectations about the report. The parliamentary committee system has delivered a unanimous report. Please show the people of Australia that you are interested, by way of action, by way of legislation, by way of initiative for families that are separated. These are Australians; they are no lesser Australians. There are one million children involved—the centrepiece of this report.</para><para>I also wanted to make a couple of points about youth unemployment. In Chifley, we have one of the highest percentages, I regret to say, of children living in unemployed families. The proportion of children aged 15 years or under living in families in which no parents are employed is 29.8 per cent. We could rail against those families, but that is a challenge to us in this place: to develop schemes that work with those families and those children to get them into the world of work. I have not given up, but I think as we move through society it is worth while spending money on people—investing in people, as I like to say—and getting them engaged in the economy. We should not try to count success as a full-time job, or even, necessarily, so many hours of a part-time job, but just get them engaged bit by bit. However, you have to spend the money.</para><para>I am really thrilled with the shadow minister for employment services, Anthony Albanese, the member for Grayndler, and his development of proposals for youth in the `learn or earn' policy. I like it. It is an appropriate challenge. We are spending nearly $700 million on these proposals. For example, we are abolishing TAFE fees for secondary school students. When I went around with the Western Sydney task force this was an issue for those students who were undertaking TAFE courses. I am disappointed at the low number of school based traineeships in New South Wales compared to other states. I think that we have got a long way to go. There is also the new support to keep 15,000 15- to 18-year-olds at school each year, and there are a whole range of other initiatives. </para><para>Last but not least, I asked a question in the parliament about Plumpton High, Glen Sargeant and the babies from Plumpton. Given what the Prime Minister said, I went back there last Friday. I have to say that Glen Sargeant has not changed his mind one iota. The real joy for me was that I spoke to one of the participants that was on the program. I think she is a tremendous young lady—a heroine, if you do not mind me saying so—showing great courage with two children, not in any way bowed in her ambition or her determination to do the HSC and go on to university. I was really uplifted by the experience. I do not want to go into the detail of it, but talking with her reinforced in my mind the proposition that it is folly to provide this lump sum payment. I do not believe the Prime Minister intends it for one minute, but I think he is being foolish in denying the reality that it may tempt some young, vulnerable teenagers into having a pregnancy to get that $3,000. Labor's 14 weekly payment system is an infinitely better proposition, especially for that vulnerable group of people that I spoke of.</para><para>There is much to be disappointed about in this budget. I am not sure that the people of Australia are going to reward the government in the way that they anticipate. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Main Committee adjourned at 7.25 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate></maincomm.xscript></hansard>
