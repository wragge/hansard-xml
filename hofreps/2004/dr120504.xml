						<para>—Last night I spoke about the effects of the <inline ref="R2020">Veterans' Entitlements (Clarke Review) Bill 2004</inline>. My final point was that the bill extends operational service under the act to include persons who have been awarded, or who are eligible to be awarded, certain minesweeping and bomb clearance awards. I believe that that part of the bill still does not make it clear who is eligible to get a benefit under that provision. There were a group of about 40 people who were involved in bomb clearing during World War II, about 50 years ago, and it is estimated that there are about 20 of those men left. A constituent of mine, Bill Kelly,  has  been  making  representations through me to various ministers for veterans affairs, defence and personnel. I remember making representations to Ros Kelly, when she was the minister, and to Con Sciacca, Bruce Scott and Bronwyn Bishop when they were ministers, and we still have not had a resolution of this. I give notice that I will be pursuing this with the minister. The complication is in the definitions of ‘qualifying service’ and ‘operational service’, because these Australian soldiers, who were being paid by the Australian government at the time, were under British command even though they were Australian servicemen in Australian uniforms. Because of that anomalous situation, they are not entitled to benefits. I hope that this provision in the act does extend benefits to them.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>I do not believe that anyone can argue against the measures in this bill. We may discuss what else needs to be done or how we could do something differently, but I do not believe any members will oppose these enhancements to veterans’ entitlements. I am very pleased that the opposition is supporting this bill. This bill provides for an ex gratia payment of $25,000 to be made to surviving prisoners of war of the North Koreans—or to their widows—for the extraordinary hardships they suffered. The government accepted the Clarke committee’s finding that, while such a payment should not be paid to all surviving Australian POWs, there is significant evidence that the treatment and cir- cumstances experienced by POWs in Korea were similar to those suffered by POWs incarcerated by the Japanese.</para>
					<para>This  bill  implements  two  significant measures to address key issues for veterans in receipt of disability pensions. The first measure will benefit more than 45,000 of our most disabled veterans by providing that all of their disability pension, not just part of it, is indexed with reference to the movements in the consumer price index and male total average weekly earnings.  Currently, any amount above the general rate of pension is not indexed. The second measure affecting disability pensions is the introduction of a Defence Force income support allowance. It will be paid by the Department of Veterans’ Affairs to eligible veterans, and it replaces the current income support payment from Centrelink. This will eliminate the difference between a veteran’s Centrelink benefit and the amount they would receive if their disability pension were assessed under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act. More than 19,000 disability pensioners who currently receive their income support from Centrelink will benefit from this change.</para>
					<para>Other benefits included in the bill are the raising of the maximum amount of funeral benefit and changes to rent assistance. The changes to rent assistance will benefit 11,000 war widows and war widowers renting in the private market. Currently rent assistance is paid only within the ceiling rate of the income support supplement. This bill will mean that rent assistance can now be paid in addition to the income support supplement—instead of simply being a component of it. This initiative reflects the findings of the Clarke report that war widows and war widowers renting in the private market are disadvantaged because those renting government owned properties already have their rent subsidised.</para>
					<para>I am particularly pleased to speak on the last of the measures contained in this bill, because they extend operational service un- der the act to include persons who have been awarded, or who are eligible to be awarded, certain minesweeping and bomb clearance awards. This extends the disability pension to surviving veterans involved in the Berlin airlift, to those involved in minesweeping and bomb clearance and to the aircrew of RAAF No. 2 Squadron who served on the Malay-Thai border. The Howard govern- ment, like the community, appreciates the work of our veterans and recognises the need to help them and care for them. That is the purpose of this bill, and I commend it to the House.</para>

						<para>—The Clarke review into veterans’ entitlements has been around for over a year, and the government has had more than enough time to come up with a response. The reasons for the urgency of legislative changes to the Veterans’ Entitlements Act can be simply expressed in terms of declining numbers of veterans of the Second World War. Despite the words of the song, old soldiers do not just fade away, they do die. Like a number of members of this House, part of my daily routine is to scan the death notices of the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>. It is a rare day when you do not see at least a handful of notices headed by the rising sun emblem of the AIF. Those old soldiers are dying, and it seems our nation’s memory is the only thing that is fading away.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>The Clarke review made some 109 recommendations, but 46 of the 56 recommendations which the government has accepted called for no change to the present entitlements. Almost half of the issues looked at by Clarke and accepted by the government have left things the way they were. Another 29 recommendations are either noted or deferred—put into the too-hard basket, left for another inquiry—and this has been the pattern for the last 60 years.</para>
					<para>I would be the first to admit that assessing veterans’ entitlements is a complex task and one that has to try to be as fair as possible, and that is one of the greatest difficulties: unless we look at each individual case, we can only look at the broad definitions of dates and places that dictate eligibility for entitlements. When we see eligibility defined in terms of service on certain ships at particular times we get some idea of how complex determining eligibility can be. But there will always be comparisons made between similar service at different times. Talk in the mess hall or, later, the RSL club will always find reasons for accepting or not accepting service as qualifying.</para>
					<para>I will use two quotes that you get from watching too many law shows on TV. The first quote is, ‘Justice must not only be done; it must be seen to be done.’ Decisions on eligibility must be clearly explained if we are to avoid disputes that go on for years—disputes which leave many veterans believing that they have been dudded out of entitlements. The second quote is, ‘Justice delayed is justice denied.’ I note that in the <inline ref="R2020">Veterans' Entitlements (Clarke Review) Bill 2004</inline> the government accepts the Clarke committee’s recommendation to extend an ex gratia payment of $25,000 to all surviving prisoners of war held captive during the Korean War or their surviving widows or widowers. That payment follows from earlier payments to World War II prisoners of the Japanese. However, the Clarke committee recommended against ex gratia payments to POWs and civilians interned by German and Italian forces.</para>
					<para>The differences between these may not be like splitting hairs, but it worries me that should an ex gratia payment be made at some time in the future many of those eligible will have passed on. As I said, justice delayed is justice denied. A further example of this can be found in the government’s rejection of the Clarke committee’s recommendations 2 and 5, which deal with service in Northern Australia in the Second World War. Here we are, 60 years later, still debating questions of qualifying service. Imagine this parliament 60 years from now, in 2064, debating issues of veterans’ entitlements for our troops currently serving in Iraq. That is basically what we are doing in this legislative response to the Clarke report, and that is the injustice of this process.</para>
					<para>Even if a concession were made, few of those eligible to benefit would still be alive. While the Clarke committee recommended the recognition of those who served in Northern Australia after November 1943 or with the British Commonwealth occupation force in Japan from February 1946 to June 1947 as qualifying service, the government has rejected the committee’s recommendations. If or when there is another inquiry, these issues will again be raised. But, if a favourable decision is then made by the government of the day, how many of those who would have been eligible will have gone to their graves without the assistance afforded by that entitlement? That is the question.</para>
					<para>The same could be said for those cases not supported by the Clarke committee—claims such as those of naval vessels HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Diamantina</inline> and HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Moresby</inline> during confrontation, visits by HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Vampire</inline> and HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Quickmatch</inline>  to South Vietnam in 1962, and claims for RAAF service at Ubon between 1962 and 1965. It would be nice to think that we could draw a line under these and the many other instances where Australian forces have served in areas of conflict. In recent years we have seen our forces serving in a wide variety of arenas. Decisions on whether each one qualifies for veterans’ entitlements will not get any easier, and later conflicts may cause us to reconsider earlier decisions to reject claims for qualifying service.</para>
					<para>The welcome extension of operational service to personnel involved in minesweeping and bomb clearance after World War II, nearly 60 years later, is a good example of how long it has taken to address those anomalies. As much as we would like to see some certainty in defining eligibility, I am afraid that in 60 years we could still find ourselves in much the same position as we are in now. As we know, in the long term we are dead, so it is pleasing to see that the government will increase the maximum funeral benefit from $572 to $1,000. I am sure that this additional sum is welcome, but I have to say that it is a long way short of the cost of even a modest funeral these days.</para>
					<para>When it comes to dealing with the participation of Australian Defence Force personnel in British atomic tests the government has indicated that it will respond positively to the needs of those affected, pending the outcome of the cancer incidence and mortality study. I would note that the results of that study are due later this year and I would expect the government to act swiftly in response to the study and extend the coverage of the act accordingly. Again, we have an ageing group which may have an entitlement and should not be delayed any further in receiving that entitlement.</para>
					<para>While most of the issues I have raised so far affect specific groups of veterans, the government’s response to the Clarke committee’s report and its recommendations for changes to the disability compensation structure affect a wider range of veterans. I note that the government’s response accepts the Clarke committee’s conclusion that current benefit levels are adequate. From discussions that I have had with veteran groups in my electorate, I can say that the committee’s conclusion and the government’s agreement have not met with applause from veterans. The changes to the indexation proposed are definitely long overdue. An adjustment based on both movements in the consumer price index and male total weekly earnings should produce a result which more closely reflects movements in incomes. While these changes will include back payment to last March, there will not be any allowance for the loss of value of those pensions over the time since they were granted. The minister makes mention of 45,000 disability pensioners to benefit from this adjustment, but there has been no effort to realign the full value of those pensions with the relative amount that they should be worth today. In short, the value of those pensions is less today than when they were introduced. While the measures contained within this bill will prevent their further erosion, there is no allowance for the erosion that has already taken place.</para>
					<para>This adjustment goes to the heart of veterans’ grievances with the system of compensation and support that disability pensions and TPI pensions are meant to address. In my discussions with veterans’ groups, there is always an assumption that the loss suffered by veterans is not just the modest income they would be expected to receive for the rest of their working lives; when veterans compare their income and living standards with their peers who did not undertake war service they see, in most cases, that their friends and relatives have been far more successful in life, that they have developed careers, earning much more in later life than they were paid in their early years. The veterans see people who have built successful businesses and have profited well from them. They see people who have had the good fortune of being able to prosper as part of welladjusted families. They see people who, as a result of what we would regard as a normal life, are better off in many ways. And, yes, Mr Speaker, you might say they are envious. They find it hard to reconcile that if it were not for their war service they, too, might have succeeded in the same way. They were very hurt by comments by the minister that many of them were paid more than some members of the minister’s staff.</para>
					<para>This is an important point to realise: our veterans’ entitlements are not some sort of handout to enable disabled veterans to get by in life. When veterans look at the prospects for their children they see their disappointment. One survey I was shown indicates youth suicide rates 300 per cent higher for the children of disabled veterans than the Australian average. I know from my own family experience the disruption to family life that comes from having a disabled veteran father. I have also seen first-hand how disabilities can cut short a civilian career after war service. So, I must say that I was disappointed when I heard of the minister’s remarks about disabled veterans being better off than some of her staff. Veterans’ groups know that funds for pensions do not come from a bottomless pit, but every one will tell you that nothing has been gained without a long, drawn out fight. The same can be said for each individual in receipt of a pension. Their eligibility has so often come after a long battle that has sapped their remaining strength and left them far worse off for their effort.</para>
					<para>In this bill we have the government’s response to the Clarke report, but the Clarke report itself is based on the assumption that the existing TPI package is adequate. No wonder the minister seems to think TPIs are well off. Well, my father is a TPI and he is not well off. But the Clarke committee made the fatal mistake of finding that the current levels of benefit are adequate, and that has let the minister off the hook. All she has to say to veterans’ groups is that the Clarke committee thought that TPI benefits were adequate. Even though the Clarke committee did make a number of recommendations which it felt were justified, the minister rejected them. The minister rejected the committee’s recommendation for a new disability compensation structure. The Clarke committee called on the government to:</para>
					<quote>
						<para>... consider how additional assistance can be provided to veterans who experience difficulties in maintaining housing equity and to children of veterans who wish to undertake tertiary education.</para>
					</quote>
					<para>But the minister rejected that call. These are the areas of real concern to disabled veterans, to the veterans that I represent in my electorate. How do you provide for the needs of your family for good housing and the opportunity for your children to get the best education? When I talk to veterans that is what they say. They feel as if they have failed to provide properly for their families. They feel ashamed that they cannot provide what other fathers can provide. I should also note that this is felt by many disabled veterans, particularly those of the Vietnam War. Those veterans hold the belief that their children have suffered disabilities as a result of their parents’ exposure to chemical agents and that the disability pension system should allow for compensation for these children.</para>
					<para>The Clarke committee made recommendations which would have seen assistance for veterans to provide private health insurance for their families—something that at present is out of the reach of many. The way that the government is funding health in this country is almost forcing people into private health insurance, but the minister does not seem to think the families of disabled veterans deserve private health coverage. Those who have served Australia in time of war and suffered disability as a result of their service should never feel ashamed of anything. What they are asking for and what this minister has turned down are not expensive or unreasonable claims, but they would make so much difference to the lives of so many veterans throughout Australia.</para>
					<para>One last point is that the Clarke committee recommended a number of extensions to the gold card, and here I find a not unreasonable request from veterans groups. They feel that the gold card is becoming devalued. We know that many medical specialists no longer accept the gold card. In particular, many of the concessions are offered by state and local government as well as private organisations and it is felt that, as access to the gold card is offered to more and more groups, some of those concessions may be withdrawn. This would be most unfortunate, as those concessions are highly valued by disabled veterans who hold a gold card. So, while it may be desirable to offer the basic gold card benefits to other groups, it may be necessary to provide some other identifying badge to allow those currently provided with concessions to continue to enjoy them. We may need to introduce a platinum card for existing holders to ensure that they do not lose concessions.</para>
					<para>I am pleased to see that the government has proceeded with this legislation at such an early stage in this session. Certainly we all would have preferred to have seen it earlier so that the improvements going to our disabled veterans could have been provided even sooner. Those items recommended by the Clarke committee but not yet acted upon I hope the government does not leave in the too-hard basket. We need to see action on all those matters at the earliest opportunity. Although a number of issues were rejected by the committee, I am sure that in the coming years they will continue to be advocated for by veterans groups. Having said that, the changes contained in this legislation are most welcome—and they are definitely long overdue.</para>

						<para>—Mr Speaker, I thought I heard you say that a lot of hot air was coming from that side of the chamber—but that would be unkind at this time of the morning! I would like to start my contribution to this debate with a mild challenge to the member for Fowler in relation to her comments about the devaluation of the gold card. She would be quite right to be concerned, as we all would be, if the opportunities we give to veterans were devalued over a period of time. However, I am pleased to advise the member for Fowler that in last night’s budget an extra $158 million was provided to ensure that veterans can get to see specialists in a timely manner. She has been aware, just as I have been, of the problems that had surfaced. The government addressed them in last night’s budget—and I know that those in the veterans community will be very happy to see the priority that has been given to them.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>When the <inline ref="R2020">Veterans' Entitlements (Clarke Review) Bill 2004</inline> was developed in response to the Clarke report it had somewhat of a rocky road, but really it is an example of how well this parliament and its members work in the interests of all Australians. At that time members of the government had a proposal put to them as to what the response should be and it has been widely reported that they were not happy with that proposal, which was then taken back and reworked. That was seen as some sort of a negative for the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs; it was not. It was a very good process which was seen to be working, where members of parliament can say to the executive, ‘No, we don’t accept this and would like to see some further improvements made’—and, in fact, that was the outcome. I know that veterans were very pleased to see that process occur. They are very proud of the service they have given to our nation that has resulted in we, the current members of the Australian parliament, being able to stand up for them, have our voices heard and make significant changes for the better. This particular matter should be seen in that light and not in the light in which the media of the day has cast it. Indeed, Major General Bill Crews, the National President of the RSL, certainly welcomed the final package, saying:</para>
					<quote>
						<para>... it does address some of the more significant inadequacies in veteran entitlements, particularly for TPI pensioners, and the RSL certainly welcomes much of this package as a good first move to fix these problems.</para>
					</quote>
					<para>I was pleased to see that support and the support of others. I was also pleased locally in Townsville to have the support of people like Les Hiddins. Les Hiddins will not be known to you as Les Hiddins, but he will be known to you as the Bush Tucker Man on ABC television. He resides in Wulguru in Townsville and is a Vietnam veteran. He was certainly very helpful to me in giving me guidance about how the veterans community was feeling. I certainly thank him for the input he had—just as I thank all the other members of the veterans community who corresponded with me at the time. It is a really good process where members these days can basically be available for open access by their constituents. It is a great process where our veterans can have direct access to their member through all manner of means these days. I found myself philosophising on that last Sunday morning. A constituent sent me an email at about five to 11 the previous evening and I sent him a response at 5.25 a.m. that Sunday morning. That is probably the way our lives are going—things are getting busier and busier. But it is a good process, and there is open access to members of parliament. There was no more open access than in the development of this bill that we see before the parliament today.</para>
					<para>What pleases me particularly is that more than 11,000 war widows and widowers renting private accommodation will benefit from the accelerated introduction of rent assistance. The early introduction will increase the value of this benefit from $73 million to $78 million. That payment will now be made from 1 January 2005, which is several months earlier than I previously thought possible. I am pleased to see that that will occur. In responding to the review of veterans’ entitlements— the Clarke report—the bill now delivers on the government’s election commitment to review perceived anomalies in veterans’ entitlements and concerns about the level of benefits and support provided to disabled veterans. This bill builds on the government’s strong track record in veterans affairs, and perhaps there is some room for a bit more philosophy. Veterans constantly talk to their member of parliament about the amount of support that they give to the government, and it is instructive when you ask them: ‘Do you know how much the government spends on veterans affairs?’ Their answer is usually: ‘No, I do not, but it is not enough.’ But when you point out that we spend $15 billion—that is $15,000 million— on the Defence Force each year and then you tell them that we spend $10,000 million on veterans each year, they are quite surprised. They then think that perhaps a lot of that money goes on administration but in fact, when you look at the cost of running Veterans’ Affairs, the administration cost is minuscule. The majority of that $10,000 million gets delivered directly to the veteran community in Australia. I am pleased to be able to say that in the life of this government we have seen funding for veterans go from $4 billion in 1996 to a record $10-pointsomething billion this year. That is terrific support for veterans, and it underlines the Howard government’s commitment to our veteran community.</para>
					<para>New indexing arrangements will mean that those in receipt of the above general rate of disability pension will have that component of their pension indexed in a similar way to the service pension by reference to both the CPI and the MTAWE. I am hoping that this bill will go through the House and the Senate quickly, because if it does we can have early back payment of the new indexation rates. That will be back paid to 20 March of this year, and that will benefit some 45,000 veteran disability pensioners. The bill also includes the introduction of the Defence Force income support allowance from September of this year, which will effectively exempt the disability pension from the means test applied to veterans’ income support at Centrelink. That has been widely welcomed. That is something that veterans have been trying to achieve for some time, and I know that the veterans in my community in Townsville and Thuringowa were certainly very pleased when they saw the government announce that as part of this package of measures.</para>
					<para>The government’s response today is effectively $267 million of new money to assist the most disabled of our veterans and the poorest of our war widows. I am delighted to see that, in addition to the money provided in response to the Clarke report, the budget announced last night includes $328.9 million over four years for the Veterans’ Affairs portfolio in brand new issues. That is a tremendous result, and I know that our veterans will be absolutely delighted to see that extra money flowing from the budget last night. There are other initiatives, smaller in scale but nevertheless not unimportant to those who are affected. These initiatives include the ex gratia payment to former Australian prisoners of war during the Korean War, which was a very difficult time, the funeral benefit increases and an extension of operational service to personnel involved in minesweeping, bomb clearance and so on. They all affect smaller segments of the veterans community, but nonetheless they are certainly something I am very pleased to see being put before the parliament today. Once again, I thank the veteran community in Townsville and Thuringowa for their feedback and help in guiding the government’s response to the Clarke report through the parliament. It has been a great outcome, and I know that our veterans community will strongly and warmly welcome it.</para>

						<para>—I rise to support the <inline ref="R2020">Veterans' Entitlements (Clarke Review) Bill 2004</inline> and, in doing so, endorse the remarks concerning this legislation made yesterday by the member for Cowan. As he identified, the bill delivers a small number of important benefits to veterans. As we are all aware, the bill is the government’s response the Clarke review report. There is a small number of matters I want to raise in the House concerning the report, this legislation and the process in between. Accepting that this is my first term in the parliament and I am not used to these sorts of government processes, this seems to be an extraordinary situation. I say this, in particular, because of a constituent whom I met in my first months of taking office and whom I will talk about subsequently.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>The Clarke report indicates that it is yet another in a long line of reviews of veterans’ entitlements. Indeed, the list of reviews is contained in pages 223 to 227 of the report. As I understand it, there have been some 12 reviews of veterans’ entitlements since 1970, and I thank the Parliamentary Library for providing me with some background information on those.</para>
					<para>It became clear to me very early on that there is, as someone described it, a patchwork quilt approach to veterans policies in Australia. Maybe this is a direct consequence of having 12 reviews in 30 years, with different people and considerations involved in the reviews and, perhaps, different policy or methodology behind them. There is one additional recommendation I would make to the government in the area of veterans policy: that ongoing consideration of veterans assistance be done using consistent methodology and based on policy and principles that are set out, explained, understood and, one might even anticipate, agreed. It seems to me that, if you set out those policy benchmarks and principles, you can then deal with the variety of different issues that often confront people in this area.</para>
					<para>I raise this because if you look at the process of the Clarke review leading to this legislation it has taken almost the entire term of this government. It was an election promise by the current government to review veterans’ entitlements in the 2001 election. I think most people with any experience in the area have some idea of what the hot or controversial issues in veterans legislation were. Frankly, all members of parliament have probably received numerous pieces of correspondence from the veterans’ community, listing those hot and controversial issues. Indeed, I note that there are people from the department in the advisers box who could probably have sat down prior to the review and listed the five controversial issues that needed to be resolved, and they probably would have had some very good recommendations about how that might be done.</para>
					<para>Nevertheless, the review was promised as part of election commitments. Over 3,000 submissions were received, which is a fairly high number of submissions. It reported in February 2003 and, in what is a proper application of the democratic process, the government then decided to consult with the veterans’ community and ex-service personnel organisations on their response to the recommendations. As we know, it took over 12 months to do that. Indeed, we know of the drama that occurred on 17 February, and I am grateful for the backbench revolt by those members of the government which saw substantial changes to the cabinet’s first proposed response to the Clarke review in February, which then led to the improvements announced on 1 March and the introduction of this bill now.</para>
					<para>If ever there was a process over two years that could have been done differently or better, this is certainly one of them. When you examine the outcome, there were a large number of recommendations that simply endorsed the status quo—that there should be no change—which was contrary to many submissions—surprise, surprise—given that the areas of controversy were well-known and identified prior to the Clarke review. The government rejected most of the recommendations that dealt with the hot issues and the recommended changes. In my opinion, those issues continue to be unresolved and will cause ongoing concerns in the veterans and wider communities in times to come. From my limited understanding of the area, of those recommendations that have been accepted, any government, even those prior to the Liberal-National coalition, could have decided to make those changes and implemented them 10 years ago. There does not seem to be any great science involved in the process.</para>
					<para>This has had an effect on one of my constituents. I have a constituent who served in the Royal Navy. He is part of the BCOF group who have not had their concerns addressed in this particular legislation. He first came to me shortly after I was elected. He explained that he had been identified as suffering from asbestosis and that that disease had been contracted as a result of his many years service with the Navy. I made representations on his behalf and of course was subsequently advised of the establishment of the Clarke review. I encouraged my constituent and his representative organisation to make submissions regarding their service. That was a process he was involved in some time in late August 2002.</para>
					<para>You can imagine both his and my delight in February 2003 when we read recommendation 63 of the Clarke review report and thought that at last there was perhaps some hope that his situation might be resolved. We again wrote to the minister asking for a timetable as to when she thought we might have a response. We waited until March 2004 for that response and here we are in May 2004 implementing the legislation. That is a period of well over two years. My constituent is sick and his health has been declining. I have been with him through what has been a fairly turbulent time of hard work, hope, excitement, joy—when we saw the recommendations— disappointment when we had the government’s response and, for my constituent, Mr Weekes, now anger and a great deal of sadness at what has been two years with no resolution to his problem.</para>
					<para>I imagine that that personal experience may well have been the case for thousands of veterans whose particular issues, concerns or demands were caught up in the Clarke review. They too may have been taken on that roller-coaster ride over the last two years. As a result of experiencing—albeit secondhand— the traumas of my constituent, it seems to me that a process such as this one undertaken in the area of veterans’ entitlements is completely inappropriate. I urge the government to consider for the longer term some sort of mechanism which allows ongoing consideration of veterans’ assistance— particularly now as we have seen in the last 2½ years an increased number of veterans being created as a consequence of our involvement in activities in East Timor, Iraq and other places.</para>
					<para>Veterans’ entitlements, and disease and disability caused by service, are issues that we are going to have an ongoing need to deal with, and I think we need to do that with a consistent methodology. We should treat all our veterans in a consistent fashion, irrespective of what conflict they have been involved in, and we should do so within an established range of policy principles. These policy principles should be clearly set out and explained to and understood by people as they enter the various services, before they become veterans— and, hopefully, with a bipartisan approach, these principles would be agreed. Surely there can be little difference between us in this place with regard to the respect that we must give to our veterans and the regard they deserve from us for the service they have given on behalf of their country.</para>
					<para>I do not really want to say much more. I think other speakers have canvassed in detail those benefits that are contained within the legislation. Those benefits will provide some relief, albeit late—and, I say cynically, on the eve of an election. Nevertheless, the benefits are there. I am grateful to members of the government’s backbench who took action to improve this package prior to it being presented to the parliament, and I am pleased to see those small improvements.</para>
					<para>I urge those people who have missed out, been disappointed or feel unfairly treated as a consequence of this process to take heart that we will continue to try to develop in Australia a process for dealing with veterans’ entitlements which is consistent and fair and provides them with due respect.</para>

						<para>—I rise in the House today to speak on the <inline ref="R2020">Veterans' Entitlements (Clarke Review) Bill 2004</inline>. I am proud to speak on this bill and I certainly approve of the additional $267 million commitment to Australia’s veterans and their families. Veterans form a major part of my constituency in the electorate of Cowper. As I travel the electorate, from Yamba in the north to South West Rocks in the south, I often come into contact with veterans and I take the time to discuss with them issues of concern.
</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>What stands out about our veteran community is not only the sacrifice that they made for this country in time of war but also their continued contribution to our community today. Many of our older veterans are the leaders in many community groups and are at the forefront of the community in so many activities and should be commended for that. It shows not only the moral fibre that they displayed on the battlefield many years ago but also the commitment that they make to our community every day.</para>
					<para>Our nation owes a great debt of gratitude to our veterans, our service men and women and, importantly, their families. Those who lost their lives obviously made the ultimate sacrifice, but it is impossible to put into words the courage and selflessness displayed by those who represented the Australian armed forces on the battlefields around the world. But, while the focus has rightly been on those who actually served and, in many cases, lost their lives on foreign shores, we should never underestimate the toll that it took on those who were fortunate enough to return home.</para>
					<para>Similarly, we must acknowledge the pain and sacrifice endured by the families and friends of soldiers who did not return. For every lost Australian life, there was a mother who lost a son, a sister who lost a brother and, in many cases, a child who lost a father. One can never put a price on the impact that such a loss had on the deceased’s immediate family. In many cases, they were left to pick up the pieces of their fractured lives and somehow carve out a future which held them together.</para>
					<para>I think it is important to note that, in history books, we read of the activities of a particular division or of a particular army but, in reality, war is not fought by divisions or by armies; it is fought by people—people like the man down the street or the lady across the road. Wars are fought by people. As I said, these people displayed great courage. One story comes to mind. A veteran, a very modest man, recounted to me the contents of his diary on the day of an attack in which he was involved. He said he had 109 rounds of ammunition. In preparing for the battle, he found an additional two rounds, making a total of 111 rounds of ammunition for a forthcoming attack. What stood out from that was that the weapon that this serviceman was issued fired 600 rounds a minute. This was an Australian serviceman going into battle, many years ago, with approximately 10 seconds worth of ammunition. For those recalling that incident today, the bravery it would take to participate in an attack with only 10 seconds of ammunition is quite staggering.</para>
					<para>As a nation, we cannot give back what war has taken away from some of these men and women, but we can certainly make their lives, these days, a little easier. Quite rightly, the focus of this bill is to improve service delivery to veterans. This legislation represents a further positive step in recognising the contribution of our veterans and in making their lives a little easier and a bit better. I think this bill provides a fair response—and a fully costed response at that—to the needs of veterans. I welcome the legislation before us and trust that all members of the House will support this bill.</para>
					<para>The bill provides an additional $267 million, over five years, for veterans, war widows and widowers. It builds on our strong record on veterans. Over the years, governments of both persuasions have been keen to support our veterans. But this government has certainly raised the bar, with expenditure on veterans rising from some $6½ billion in 1996-97 to around $10 billion today. I welcome the words of support from the members opposite who commend this bill.</para>
					<para>The Clarke report made some 109 recommendations, many of which were recommendations of no change to the current practices. The report also considered issues such as service eligibility, disability pension arrangements and the gold card, among other things. One of the key areas of interest to many of my veterans is indexation. Under this legislation, the indexation of above general rate payments will occur in the same way as for a service pension—by a combination of the CPI and MTAWE. This move will assist some 45,000 veterans and ensure that the most disabled veterans—those who cannot work, or who can only work part-time— receive the maximum level of support through appropriate indexation. The explanatory memorandum to the bill says:</para>
					<quote>
						<para>These changes will index the amount of intermediate rate, special rate and extreme disablement adjustment disability pension that is paid above the general rate by the same percentage as the increases in the maximum basic rate of service pension. The maximum basic rate of service pension increases in response to both the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Male Total Average Weekly Earnings (MTAWE). If the CPI increase to the maximum rate service pension results in a new rate that is less than 25% of MTAWE, then the new rate for maximum rate service pension will be increased to equal 25% of MTAWE. The resultant percentage increase between the old rate of maximum basic rate service pension and the new maximum basic rate service pension is the factor that will be applied to the indexation of the amount of disability pension paid above the general rate.</para>
					</quote>
					<para>There are more than 19,000 veterans receiving a Department of Veterans’ Affairs disability pension and income support from Centrelink. They will receive, on average, an additional $40 per fortnight as part of the government’s $267 million response to the Clarke report. DVA disability pensioners, such as a single veteran in receipt of a totally and permanently incapacitated pension and a Centrelink income support payment with no other income, will be eligible to receive up to an additional $257.60 a fortnight. We are effectively exempting the disability pension from the means test applied by Centrelink to veterans’ income support.</para>
					<para>The government has listened to the feedback from the TPI and veteran community and is addressing the key areas of concern regarding the disability pension. The government will introduce a new Defence Force income support allowance to be paid by the Department of Veterans’ Affairs, which will counter the effect of the disability pension being included as income in the assessment of Centrelink benefits. The new allowance will be paid to eligible veterans receiving a range of Centrelink benefits, including the age pension, disability support pension, carer payment—and we welcome the changes to the carer payment which were announced by the Treasurer in the budget last night— Newstart allowance, parenting payment, youth allowance and Austudy.</para>
					<para>I think all members of this House would agree that there is no more deserving group in our community than war widows. This bill provides them with an income support supplement: $73 million will be allocated to benefit 11,000 war widows by up to $94.40 per fortnight. In addition to the income support supplement, rent assistance will be paid to eligible war widows and widowers. Currently rent assistance is paid with the income support supplement maximum rate of $134.40 a fortnight. This addresses the needs of our poorest war widows and widowers.</para>
					<para>These latest initiatives follow on from other funding commitments which the coalition has made since 1996. Funding for the war widows and widowers pension has increased to $1.37 billion in 2003-04 from $933 million in 1996-97, and that is benefiting more than 114,000 widows and widowers. Indexing the war widows and widowers pension to MTAWE in 1998-99 was certainly a great improvement. Restoring benefits, at a cost of $86.6 million, to war widows and widowers who remarried prior to May 1984 is also a welcome benefit. Removing the freeze initiated by Labor in 1986 on the ceiling rate of the income support supplement for war widows and widowers in the 2002-03 year, at a cost of $84.7 million, was also welcomed.</para>
					<para>This government has a solid record of support for veterans and this bill is a major plank in that support. There is a range of other measures, such as the increase in the funeral benefit, which is a contribution to the cost of funerals. It does not cover the whole cost, but it certainly is a welcome increase in the contribution—from $572 to $1,000. There will be an ex gratia payment of $25,000 in recognition of the horrendous suffering that prisoners of war in Korea had to endure. There is also provision for the eligibility of those involved in minesweeping operations after World War II.</para>
					<para>The British atomic test program is another issue that has been of great importance to the many veterans affected by it. When the outcome of the Australian participants in the British nuclear test program cancer incidence and mortality study is known, the government will respond appropriately. I certainly think, as this nation does, that the efforts of our veterans in time of war must be very highly commended. The veterans in my community display great continuing service to their community now that they are back home. We as a nation must continue to support our veterans for the great contribution that they made in time of war. I commend this bill to the House.</para>

						<para>—I rise to join in the support for the <inline ref="R2020">Veterans' Entitlements (Clarke Review) Bill 2004</inline> and associate myself with the remarks of the previous speaker, who outlined in great detail the assistance and the additional financial commitment that the government is providing to our veterans following the Clarke review. The Clarke review was an important part of the Howard government’s commitment to look after those who have served our nation in so many conflicts over more than a century.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>As the previous speaker and those before him have outlined, the measures in this bill are the result of an election commitment by the Howard government. This bill delivers on a promise to hold a high profile and independent review to consider anomalies within the eligibility criteria for veterans entitlements. A committee comprising Air Marshal Doug Riding, Dr David Rosalky and Justice Clarke was given the task of examining our veterans’ entitlement provisions with a fine toothcomb. Justice Clarke and his fellow reviewers made more than 100 recommendations and this bill seeks to implement many of those. Accordingly, this bill is welcome news to veterans and their families across Australia and within the federal electorate of Casey.</para>
					<para>Since coming to office in 1996, the Howard government has increased spending on veterans’ affairs from around $6 billion to $10 billion in the current financial year. Over the years the needs of veterans and their families have naturally changed. In response, the Howard government has extended the gold card to Australian veterans aged over 70 years with qualifying service, has made it easier to receive quality care in private hospitals and has helped veterans and war widows to continue to live at home through important programs like HomeFront and Veterans Home Care.</para>
					<para>Following the Clarke review, the government announced additional funding of around $270 million, which will be spent over the next five years to implement the Clarke review’s recommendations which have been accepted. Broadly, these recommendations can be grouped into five areas. Firstly, 65 of the 109 recommendations relate to service eligibility and 38 of the 65 suggested there be no change to the current provisions. In my dealings with veterans and older residents in Casey and in the RSLs throughout my electorate and in talking to the people who do such a great job, it is these issues that most regularly come up in discussion. Most veterans will be pleased that the government will continue to protect the integrity of qualifying service so as to continue to give special recognition and benefits to those who served their country while at risk of personal injury and death from an armed enemy.</para>
					<para>Despite the well-put arguments for a broadening of the relevant qualifying tests, Minister Vale was correct when she said:</para>
					<quote>
						<para>Public support and confidence in the generosity of our Repatriation System depends on the ‘incurred danger test’ remaining objective. We would create anomalies if we were to confuse a state of readiness, or presence in a former enemy’s territory, with the real and tangible risks of facing an armed and hostile enemy.</para>
					</quote>
					<para>This bill provides for an ex gratia payment of $25,000 to surviving prisoners of war from Korea, and/or their widows or widowers who were alive on 1 July 2003, in recognition of the difficult and inhumane conditions they suffered. With regard to another regularly discussed issue, it is worth noting that the government carefully considered the recommendations relating to British Commonwealth and Allied veterans. On the basis that extending further benefits to these veterans would be a departure from the important principle that nations are responsible for their own veterans, the government has not adopted the relevant recommendations.</para>
					<para>Secondly, as members would know, the gold card provides free access to comprehensive health care for eligible veterans, including medical and hospital treatment, allied health care, community nursing and support at home. In recent years the Howard government has extended eligibility for the gold card to all Australian veterans and mariners aged 70 years or over who have qualifying or warlike service from any conflict. Ex-prisoners of war, for example, get a gold card automatically. In total, 273,000 veterans and their families hold the gold card.</para>
					<para>Thirdly, the review committee received a number of submissions addressing the adequacy of benefits and support available to totally and permanently incapacitated and other veteran disability benefit recipients. This bill introduces a Defence Force income support allowance, to commence from September this year. The allowance will be paid by the Department of Veterans’ Affairs to eligible veterans receiving income support from Centrelink. The allowance will eliminate the difference between a veteran’s Centrelink benefit and the amount they would receive if their disability pension were assessed under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act. More than 19,000 disability pensioners will benefit from this change and, on average, will receive an additional $40 a fortnight.</para>
					<para>Fourthly, this bill will ensure that some 11,000 war widows and widowers will receive an increase in their income support payments, following the government’s decision to pay rent assistance in addition to the ceiling rate of income support payment. For those who are eligible, this will deliver up to an additional $94.40 a fortnight. As the previous speaker indicated, the government is also increasing the maximum funeral benefit from $572 to $1,000.</para>
					<para>I wish to acknowledge and thank the presidents, the secretaries and the many volunteers from each of the RSLs in my local community—in Croydon, Lilydale, Monbulk and Mount Evelyn. These individuals are well known in the community. They are tireless community leaders who work for the benefit of the veterans in their community. Their input and thoughts on a range of important issues were appreciated as we went through this process. In turn, I made sure that the minister and the government were aware of the concerns and that those concerns were taken into account in the framing of the government’s response.</para>
					<para>Throughout our nation’s history, hundreds of thousands of Australians have served on our behalf. As a nation we owe them so much. Collectively we must do all we can to provide the help and assistance that is needed by our veterans. Importantly, we must continue to preserve the memory of their deeds as part of our nation’s history. The Howard government are committed to ensuring that veterans and their families get the right treatment in their hour of need. In over eight years of government we have had a good record of doing that and of constantly improving the resources available to veterans. This commitment will continue into the future. As a government, on behalf of our nation, we are committing more and more resources to helping our veterans. This bill forms an important part of that task and I commend it to the House.</para>

						<para>—It gives me great pleasure today to speak on the <inline ref="R2020">Veterans' Entitlements (Clarke Review) Bill 2004</inline>, particularly as a member of the government policy committee on defence and veterans’ affairs. The government response to the Clarke review—which contained 109 recommendations—unfortunately took some time to finalise, but I am delighted that the government’s response has been far-reaching and indeed supportive of our veterans, war widows and former prisoners of war in Korea.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>There is no doubt that the opposition will seize the moment by criticising the government for the length of time it took to respond to the Clarke review, but today I would like to focus on the positive. I would like to focus on the positive outcomes and the level of benefits and support that will be provided to those very special men and women who have served this country in times of conflict, to the families who have been left behind and to our war widows, who in many cases have suffered so much through caring for our veterans on their return home from areas of conflict.</para>
					<para>It will always be difficult for any government to quantify just what veterans, their wives or their families—their children— suffer with regard to lifestyle when health, including mental and psychological health, is not what it should be and when families know that these illnesses will require ongoing professional help for many years or a lifetime. I stand here today and say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, that I could never imagine what it would be like to go to war. I cannot for a moment imagine the horrors of war: the loneliness, the deprivation. I cannot imagine what it would be like to face the enemy and know that he is trained to kill. I cannot imagine what it would be like to be wounded in the service of one’s country and to return home to your loved ones, who would in many cases have the ongoing role of caring for you for the remainder of your life, dealing with deep psychological illnesses and war related injuries. But I can say today that, having spoken to hundreds of veterans and having compared our compensation package with a number of those in other countries, Australia does have a generous compensation scheme for our returned servicemen and servicewomen.</para>
					<para>But, of course, there is always room for more. Most Australians recognise that our veterans are the men and women who gave us the democracy and the freedoms that we enjoy today. These men and women and their families must never be forgotten. We need to ensure that we continue to monitor the ongoing needs of the veterans community. We must never forget the ultimate price that so many paid, and we as a nation must never forget that we have an ongoing obligation to look after those most in need in our veterans community.</para>
					<para>The bill before the House today implements changes announced by the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs on 2 March 2004 and covers a number of benefits that will continue to enhance the entitlements of veterans and their families. An additional $267 million over the next five years will be committed to veterans and war widows. This bill addresses a number of recommendations that came from the Clarke review. It contains benefits for disability pension recipients and compensates those former prisoners of the Korean War, also known as the forgotten war. Around 29 ex-POWs or their widows will benefit with an ex gratia payment of $25,000. There will be increased assistance to war widows and widowers and an extension of operational service to minesweeping personnel.</para>
					<para>It is important to note that the veterans community was encouraged to participate in the review. In fact, there were more than 3,000 submissions to the review and there was ongoing consultation with the veterans community before the final response was presented by the minister. I would like to put on record my personal thanks to a number of special people who gave me the benefit of their wisdom during these deliberations. I thank Mr Doug Henderson, a Vietnam veteran and former Queensland state president and national vice-president of the Vietnam Veterans Federation, who has become a personal friend and mentor with regard to veterans issues. His patience and valued time helped me to have a clearer understanding of veterans issues. He has always been at the end of a phone or available for a meeting to discuss veterans issues with me and help me to understand the needs and concerns of veterans and the background of war service compensation.</para>
					<para>I thank many other members of my veterans community: Mr Ron Workman OAM, President of the Currumbin-Palm Beach RSL; Mr Glenn Mylne, Gold Coast District President of the Returned &amp; Services League of Australia, Queensland branch; Mr Tony Stepney, President of Mudgeeraba RSL; Mr Alan Ross, Secretary of Mudgeeraba RSL; Mr Chris Keating, President of Burleigh RSL; and so many others. They have all been generous with their time and input into helping me understand and appreciate the sacrifices so many Australian men and women have made on behalf of our country and they have given me a clearer understanding on the difficulties veterans face every day.</para>
					<para>As I said earlier, the Clarke review made 109 recommendations. Around half of these recommendations suggested no change to current practice, but the review did canvass a number of issues, including service eligibility, disability pension arrangements and the gold card entitlement, amongst other things. The bill before the House today will assist the most disabled of our veterans and the poorest of our war widows. The new indexation arrangements will mean that our most disabled veterans will have that portion of their disability pension paid above 100 per cent of the general rate indexed by the same proportion as the service pension and the war widows and widowers pension. In other words, the above general rate will now be indexed to the greater of the cost of living and movements of the average wage, or MTAWE, and will therefore keep up with community incomes.</para>
					<para>My only hope is that the opposition in the Senate will ensure the swift passage of this bill to allow an early back payment of the increased indexation to 20 March 2004, which will benefit more than 45,000 disability pensioners. From September 2004 the government will introduce the Defence Force income support allowance. This measure addresses a key issue of concern regarding the inclusion of the disability pension as income for pensions and benefits paid to recipients and their partners under social security law. This measure will ensure equity amongst veterans, regardless of whether they receive their income support from the Department of Veterans’ Affairs or Centrelink.</para>
					<para>As I said earlier, there will be an ex gratia payment of $25,000 to former prisoners of the Korean War, and this payment will be made in the same way as the payment to former prisoners of war held by Japan during World War II. The payment is in recognition of the extremely inhumane conditions endured by Australian POWs during the Korean War. The payment will also be made to a surviving spouse. In relation to war widows and widowers, the government will pay rent assistance, in addition to the ceiling rate of the income support supplement, to some 11,000 war widows and widowers who are renting private accommodation. Currently, rent assistance is paid within the ceiling rate of the income support supplement. A small number of war widows who are also veterans in their own right, receiving the ceiling rate of service pension and renting privately, will also benefit from increased rent assistance under this measure. This initiative reflects the finding of the Clarke review that war widows and widowers renting in the private market are in need of additional assistance. Rent assistance is not available to those renting government owned properties, as their rent is already subsidised.</para>
					<para>The government has also accepted the recommendations by the Clarke review to extend qualifying service to the aircrew of 2nd squadron RAAF who served on the Malay- Thai border between 1962 and 1966 and to extend operational service to members of the RAAF directly involved in the Berlin airlift. The government has also accepted that operational service eligibility should be extended wherever qualifying service has been recognised—a decision that would immediately benefit a small group of minesweeping personnel. There are a number of other measures in the bill. The coalition government is also committed to responding positively to the needs of those affected by the British atomic test program when the results of the cancer incidence and mortality study are available later this year.</para>
					<para>There will always be more that can be done, but I believe this package, which is the government’s response to the Clarke review, has enduring benefits to veterans and war widows across Australia. It builds on our strong commitment to ensure our veterans and war widows are looked after. Since 1996 this government has increased spending on veterans issues by a massive $4 billion. I commend the bill to the House and make a commitment to continue to strongly represent Gold Coast veterans in the national parliament. I think it is incumbent on all of us to keep remembering the veterans of our local communities and what they have given to this country, and I think that it is important that we see the passage of the Veterans’ Entitlements (Clarke Review) Bill 2004 continue very smoothly through both houses of parliament so that the veterans of our communities can benefit from those arrangements we are putting in place.</para>

						<para>—I thank the previous speaker, the member for McPherson, who made some vital final comments in her contribution on this very important topic, the <inline ref="R2020">Veterans' Entitlements (Clarke Review) Bill 2004</inline>. I am sure all members of parliament attended Anzac Day services recently. I went to three Anzac Day services. The first was the dawn service at Tuross Head on the Far South Coast. It is probably the closest thing you could get to Gallipoli, as far as its geography is concerned. With waves breaking on the cliffs below and the sun coming up over the sea, it was quite a spectacular location for a dawn service. I then attended a very small service at a place called Bergalia, which is between Narooma and Moruya. There is a memorial there that was only found a few years ago. It had been totally overgrown, but some locals found it and upgraded it with some assistance from the federal government under our memorials program. The third service was just before lunch at Batemans Bay.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>Attending those sorts of functions, you understand exactly what is occurring within the veteran community. You get to meet some quite amazing people at those sorts of ceremonies, including those who had war service in the Second World War, Korea, Vietnam and various other confrontations, and peacekeepers—you find the lot. It is terrific that those people and their families, particularly young children, are out there each Anzac Day. We had 500 or 600 people at the dawn service at Tuross Head, which is quite amazing.</para>
					<para>It is extremely important that the government of the day continues to assist our veterans and their families as much as we possibly can. That is why the government set up the Clarke review. It was called by the government to look at a whole variety of aspects to do with veterans’ entitlements, to make sure that we are still assisting our veterans in the most appropriate way. The terms of reference for the Clarke review were very broad. It was asked to:</para>
					<quote>
						<para>Recommend possible changes to address any anomalies and to facilitate the equitable and efficient administration of the VEA.</para>
					</quote>
					<para>One specific point in the terms of reference was:</para>
					<quote>
						<para>Consider perceived anomalies with eligibility for access to VEA benefits and Qualifying Service that might be raised by some World War II veterans, veterans of the British Commonwealth Occupation Forces in Japan, Australian participants in British Atomic testing in Australia, Australian service personnel engaged in counter terrorist and special recovery training and other interested parties—</para>
					</quote>
					<para>It was a very comprehensive review and a huge number of recommendations were made. The government looked at those recommendations quite exhaustively, and a very thorough job was done of looking at which of those recommendations we could afford and which were appropriate to implement. There was some debate in the media about the response to the Clarke review and what would and would not be accepted. I do not back off for one second from saying that I was one of the people who looked very closely at what was being proposed in the first instance by government. I congratulate the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs for the very thorough job she did on this. She went in to bat on behalf of veterans, as she always does, to get the best possible result from cabinet.</para>
					<para>We have a great democracy on this side of the parliament, where these matters do come back to the party as a whole to consider. Initially, I and a number of my colleagues were not absolutely happy with what was being proposed in the response that came back. So, to the minister’s credit, she engaged the party generally in debate about the various issues. Those of us who have a larger number of veterans than average in our electorates were certainly well briefed by the many veterans we have, so we understand their circumstances— and, as I said, you really do get a good idea about your veteran community from attending Anzac Day ceremonies and things like that.</para>
					<para>I felt quite strongly about the indexation issue. When we came to government in 1996, one of the very first things we did was change the way in which the age pension was indexed. Previously, it was indexed to the CPI and only every now and again—and it might be after a number of years— compared with male total average weekly earnings, and then other adjustments were made. We said that that was not good enough and that the age pension ought to be indexed so that it could never fall below 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings. My view is that if it is good enough for the age pension it is also good enough for our veterans. The initial cabinet proposal was that that would not be the case. Isn’t it terrific that we have a Prime Minister, a minister and a cabinet who are prepared to listen to the representations made by their colleagues within the parliament?</para>
					<para>Contrary to front-page newspaper reports of backbench revolts et cetera, there was nothing of the sort at all. It was a great discussion. The Prime Minister himself met with quite a number of his colleagues, and we talked through the issues and debated the issues. We put forward our arguments as to why some additional assistance ought to be provided. To the Prime Minister’s credit, he listened and took it back to cabinet and some changes were made.</para>
					<para>Too often people say to me, ‘You’re only a backbencher, you have to toe the party line.’ That is not the case. Our democratic processes within the coalition are such that you get many opportunities to have input and change things. A lot of things get changed that do not make it to the front page of the paper, because backbenchers, through our committee process, have the right sort of input. They provide the information and the arguments and, with a minister prepared to listen and take that back to cabinet, you do get changes made. So there is none of this so-called toeing the party line. Here is a prime case. If the argument that we put had not been accepted by the minister and cabinet, the front page would have said, ‘Backbenchers are ineffective,’ but, because we were able to put a good argument and that argument was accepted, all of a sudden it was a backbench revolt. Well, we all know— all those of us who were part of it—that it was nothing like a revolt. It was a great discussion, and I am really pleased that the various changes that we argued for were accepted by the minister, the Prime Minister and, ultimately, cabinet—and we saw those changes.</para>
					<para>I want to briefly go through some of those things that have come out of this Clarke review. There are quite a number, but I would just like to cover a few things today. There is the one-off ex gratia payment of $25,000 to all surviving prisoners of war of the Korean War and their surviving spouses. I think that is a great extra entitlement to come from the review. The indexation, which I talked about before, is now based on male total average weekly earnings. That has been well received by the veteran community, and the feedback from around my electorate has certainly been extremely positive in that respect. Aspects to do with all those changes to the general rate of disability pension are, I think, excellent and will be of great benefit to quite a wide range of veterans throughout Eden-Monaro.</para>
					<para>There is also the aspect of rent assistance, which a number of us felt quite strongly about. The Clarke review examined the level of payments that were available and recommended rent assistance. I am certainly pleased that that was ultimately picked up. It probably means something in the order of $90 to $95 per fortnight to the veteran or widow who really needs it. There are a variety of payments, depending on what rent people are paying, but effectively it is in that sort of order. For a single person with no dependent children, the maximum payment per fortnight will be $95.40; for a couple with no dependent children, the maximum payment will be $90.20. Regarding the funeral benefit, at the time that our veterans pass away there is an added financial strain to a widow or widower. The proposal was to increase the benefit. It has not gone up for a long time—I cannot recall for how long, but for a long time it was $572 and it did not change at all. Clearly, costs have increased substantially and the funeral benefit is now going up to $1,000. I think that is another key issue.</para>
					<para>Those are just some of the aspects of the package, and there are many other parts to it. It is a very comprehensive package. One particular issue that I would like to raise that I think will still continue to cause some debate within the veteran community relates to gold cards. I can certainly speak from a personal point of view on this, because when my father, who was a World War II veteran, passed away just under three years ago he had a gold card and that flowed on to my mother, which I think was warranted. It has certainly been a huge assistance to her, as a pensioner on her own. But there is an issue about eligibility for the gold card. I think it is a really difficult one, because you have to try to prove whether a death is war related, and all sorts of things get dragged up. I know about it because I went through it for my mother. We went through all the medical history of my dad during the war and how aspects of what occurred to him then were significant in contributing to the causes of his death. A number of people have raised the issue that, in those sorts of instances, eligibility should automatically flow on to widows. I think there is actually a strong argument to support that. I know that is not something that the government has accepted at this stage.</para>
					<para>I have had some excellent representations from somebody in my electorate called Ted Aust. He is from down the coast, and he has put together a very comprehensive submission on this, arguing quite a good case for that sort of assistance. He is a veteran and is now in his 80s. It really means a lot to these people to know that—in the case of male veterans—their wives will have the security of a gold card. They are almost pleading when they say, ‘I’ll go and feel good about it, if I know my wife has a gold card.’ The wife is often the person who has had to nurse them through some very difficult years. In particular, for many of those who came back from World War II there were no such things as counselling and those types of things that occur now. Wives of veterans who went through horrific aspects of, say, World War II really bore the brunt of a lot of that. I think it can be argued that an automatic gold card for those surviving widows is not a huge thing to ask for. But that is something that we can, I think, take further and debate further within government in the coming months as well.</para>
					<para>In closing, I would also like to say that, with the budget brought down last night, another aspect of the veterans package—the additional payments of $158 million over four years to increase payments to medical specialists treating eligible veteran patients— will certainly be well received. I have had quite a number of representations from veterans on that in recent months, from all over my electorate. I congratulate the minister and the cabinet on being able to do that extra bit for them, because they need that assistance and they need to be able to access it easily and to be able to afford it. Overall this is a great bill. I recommend it to the House. The government has responded superbly to the Clarke review. In addition, the cabinet has responded well to the many members on this side of the House that made representations on behalf of the veterans of their communities.</para>

						<para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R2020">Veterans' Entitlements (Clarke Review) Bill 2004</inline>. A few weeks ago I had the pleasure of attending Anzac Day services at my local RSLs in Aston. As always, Anzac Day this year provided Australians with an opportunity to reflect on, honour and recognise the special service and sacrifice made by our veterans and war widows. The media reports of increased attendance numbers at major Anzac Day services across the country—and, indeed, around the world—demonstrate that as Australians we take the opportunity afforded by Anzac Day seriously and value very highly the contribution made by all our veterans, who have served across the many and various conflicts throughout our nation’s history.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>The Howard government is a strong supporter of Anzac Day and believes it is vital that the service of our veterans continues to be honoured publicly and proudly by all Australians, and particularly by younger Australians. But, while Anzac Day is a focal point, our veterans and war widows are supported each and every day of the year by the Howard government. That is because the government believes that our veteran community deserve generous and ongoing support, care, compensation and commemoration, through a simple, fair and responsive system that recognises their unique needs. I am proud to say that the government has backed up that commitment with significant funding increases. Since 1996 the Howard government has increased funding for veterans and war widows by over $4 billion to a record $10 billion this year. As part of that significant boost, the government has increased funding on income support and compensation by over $1 billion and increased funding for health care and support by over $2 billion.</para>
					<para>At the last election, the Howard government committed to reviewing access to veterans’ entitlements under our veterans’ affairs policy called Supporting Those Who Served. This was the result of the government’s concern that some ex-servicemen and women that had claims to entitlements were being denied access by perceived anomalies in the definition of qualifying service. Following the election, an independent committee was appointed to undertake the review. The committee was chaired by the Hon. John Clarke QC, a former judge and national serviceman. The committee also included Air Marshal Douglas Riding, a former vice chief of the defence forces, and Dr David Rosalky, a former departmental secretary. The terms of reference were focused on providing fair, consistent and appropriate benefits to Australian veterans.</para>
					<para>The two key areas for review and recommendation under the terms of reference were, firstly, the current policy relating to eligibility for access to benefits and qualifying service under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act; and, secondly, the benefits available to disability compensation veterans under the act. Throughout the review, the committee received over 3,000 submissions from exservice organisations, veterans and the community. Many of the submissions were from veterans in my electorate of Aston to whom I had written advising of the review. I would like to again thank them for their contributions to improving our support for veterans. It is also worth noting that the committee held public meetings in each state and territory as part of the consultation process.</para>
					<para>As a result of the review, the committee made 109 recommendations in their report, which covered a range of complex issues. These included such things as the eligibility for qualifying service and hazardous service under the act; access to health care under the gold card; eligibility and assistance for widows; and benefits and support for recipients of the special or TPI and intermediate rates of veteran disability pension. I think it is worth noting that more than half of the committee’s recommendations called for no change to current arrangements.</para>
					<para>The government’s response was announced by the Prime Minister in March, and a number of these measures are embodied in this bill, the Veterans’ Entitlements (Clarke Review) Bill 2004. The total package of measures is worth $267 million over five years and builds on the government’s strong track record in veterans’ affairs. This bill provides new indexation arrangements that will mean the above general rate of the veteran disability pension will be indexed by the consumer price index or male total average weekly earnings, whichever is higher. This measure will benefit around 45,000 veterans and, in particular, will ensure the most disabled veterans, such as those who cannot work, receive the maximum level of support.</para>
					<para>This bill establishes a new Defence Force income support allowance to address concerns about the inclusion of the disability pension as income under social security law. This allowance will be provided at the rate of difference between the amount of income support received under social security law and the amount that would be received if the disability pension was not counted as income under the current social security assessment.</para>
					<para>The bill provides for an ex gratia payment of $25,000 for former Australian prisoners of war held during the Korean War or their surviving widows. The payment will be made in the same way as the payment to former prisoners of war held by Japan during World War II, in recognition of the extremely inhumane conditions endured by Australian POWs during the Korean War.</para>
					<para>The bill provides for the payment of rent assistance in addition to the ceiling rate of income support supplement to around 11,000 war widows and widowers currently renting private accommodation. Currently, rent assistance is paid within the ceiling rate of income support supplement. The increased assistance is expected to be worth around $73 million and will help address the needs of the poorest of our war widows and widowers.</para>
					<para>Under this bill, the maximum funeral benefit will increase from $572 to $1,000. The funeral benefit is designed to reduce the funeral expenses for eligible veterans and certain dependants, including former prisoners of war and recipients of the TPI pension and the extreme disablement adjustment rate.</para>
					<para>Finally, to address a current anomaly, the bill extends operational service to personnel involved in minesweeping and bomb clearance operations after World War II who have qualifying service.</para>
					<para>There are currently over 2,000 residents receiving veterans’ entitlements in my electorate of Aston, and many of those 2,000 will benefit from the measures in this bill. All of them, of course, have benefited from the Howard government’s increased investment in veterans’ affairs since coming to office in 1996. I am pleased to say that, as the House heard, last night’s budget announcement by the Treasurer ensures that veterans will continue to benefit under the Howard government.</para>
					<para>The budget assures veterans access to free, comprehensive medical care, with an additional $158 million over four years to ensure that gold and white card holders receive quality specialist care. In addition, more than $190 million of new funding for aged care services announced last night will directly benefit veterans and war widows. Importantly, this budget continues the government’s strong track record in meeting the changing needs of the veteran community, honouring their service and confirming our commitment to building a repatriation system for the 21st century. Finally, I want to assure all veterans in Aston that as their local member I will continue to work to secure greater support for them in recognition of their outstanding service to our nation.</para>

						<para>—I support the words of the member for Aston and I note the long and distinguished list of government members who have spoken in support of the <inline ref="R2020">Veterans' Entitlements (Clarke Review) Bill 2004</inline>. Our veterans community is served well by the government. The Howard team has done a great deal since it was elected. The veterans budget this year is over $10 billion, up from about $6 billion at the time the Howard government was elected, so there are some serious resources directed towards caring for our veterans community. Probably one of the least heralded but most helpful is the resource of the government members, who are keen to bring—as the member for Aston has done—the practical concerns and on-the-ground experience of our veterans community to the attention of the government, as we seek to further develop and finetune what is the best repatriation and veterans support system in the world.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>I make those opening remarks because that goes to the heart of what the Clarke review was about. I am sure that you, Mr Deputy Speaker Hawker, like many people in this place, have had the experience of a veteran coming to you in your office and talking about their war service experience and the way in which their personal circumstances interact with what is a comprehensive, firstclass— in fact, world-leading—support system for our veterans community. There are times, though, when the best endeavours of all of us may not meet the expectations of the veteran or the veteran’s family. We do our best to work within this comprehensive and sometimes a little complicated system to get the best outcome for them.</para>
					<para>It is in that light that the government, prior to the last election, undertook to conduct the review that is now called the Clarke review and to look at where there are perceived anomalies regarding veterans’ entitlements. That was an appropriate and entirely thoughtful response to the at times very individual experience of our veterans: to look at the veterans’ needs, their war service and the damage that we as a nation have done to them in their service for our country and to see how we can best make sure that they are getting their needs met and the support that they deserve. Case by case it is difficult, but we need to work through those. A process such as the Clarke review allowed individual veterans and veterans organisations to put their case about where they think some of the current policies or the way that they are calibrated may produce some anomalies. So that was a very wise election commitment, made prior to November 2001, and a distinguished panel of people came together to carry out that review. I will not go over that ground because I think my colleagues have very well outlined the etymology of the Clarke review and the composition of the panel.</para>
					<para>I would like to emphasise, though, that in the brief that was given to the Clarke review team a clear disposition was conveyed in the terms of reference. There is a proactive effort being made by the government to identify anomalies. It is not as if the government were saying, ‘Here’s a fantastic, world-class system that is admired by veterans right around the world, and we’re going to bunker down and armour up against any criticism and deflect, defend and bounce back perceived anomalies.’ It was not that at all. The review was actually welcoming people’s input and encouraging organisations and veterans themselves to bring forward ideas about where they thought it could be further enhanced and where there was some inconsistency or anomaly in the way people were treated.</para>
					<para>There was actually encouragement to have the provisions that relate to qualifying service examined. We were putting it out there, saying: ‘These parameters have been tested in the courts over years and they have gone through refinement upon refinement—layer upon layer of re-examination—but, if we still haven’t got that quite right, tell us. Tell us where it is not right. Please make those submissions. Speak to the rest of the repatriation of veterans support system.’ So it was actually a welcoming position—an encouragement for people to come forward—not a defensive position, that the government took when it instigated the Clarke review. I commend the government for doing that. That is a posture that says: ‘We are open to input. We are keen to learn from practical experience, and, where we can enhance our system and remove perceived anomalies, we are keen to do so.’</para>
					<para>It was at that level that submissions were sought, and there was an abundance of them. I was pleased to provide my input to the review, based on my experience. There was a lot of discussion in the veterans community about the special rate and the rates of disability pensions and whether they were appropriate. The government encouraged the Clarke review to seek advice. Again I am emphasising the point that it was not a defensive position of holding the fort; it was more one of welcoming input to see where we can improve what we are doing.</para>
					<para>For the purpose of context, let me outline the experience I had when visiting the United Kingdom. As some of the people in this place would know, I have spoken about the UK service personnel. In my electorate, I have people living a couple of streets apart from each other who flew in the same Lancaster bombers. One of them happened to be from the RAAF, the Royal Australian Air Force. But their friend and colleague, someone with whom they went flying over Holland in Lancaster bombers—the same aircraft, the same experience—happened to be employed by the Royal Air Force.</para>
					<para>Different employing organisations have different systems, as you would well be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker Hawker. Many of the benefits that are put in place for our veterans carry forward what we would more regularly understand to be workers compensation and support for those doing what was asked of them by their employer. In this case, the employer is the Commonwealth of Australia, the task is one of defending peace and the values that we share, and the dividend is peace, prosperity and pluralism in this country— a great dividend. But what is difficult for some people to grasp is that allies doing the same work in exactly the same aircraft, returning to live in the same neighbourhood, are treated differently.</para>
					<para>The wonderful system that we have in Australia, viewed through British eyes, is quite remarkable. Let me explain it this way: we sent our young service men and women into harm’s way. Harm did not come after them—the rare exception being Darwin in the north of Australia. But in general terms we sent our people into harm’s way to defend, protect and try to preserve the things that we believed in.</para>
					<para>When I talk to veterans organisations in the UK, they marvel at our system. Interestingly, in the UK they do not have a separate veterans’ affairs department; it is all part of the defence department. I was talking to a general there, who was explaining the great steps forwards they have made in the UK by establishing a call centre in London, with four people in it. That was servicing all the British vets. The general was saying: ‘Look what we’ve done. We’ve enhanced our veterans program by creating a call centre. It’s got four people in it.’ I said, ‘This is a great step forward, but there are actually four people in a veterans office in my city alone.’ The response was: ‘You always do this veterans thing better than we do.’</para>
					<para>He went on to explain to me, though, that a civilian living in London during the raids was probably in greater danger than an RAF person at an airfield up in Wales. He said that if the UK government was to replicate the benefits we make available to our veterans in this country there would be a riot because civilians were as exposed in London as any service personnel were. But in Australia we can make that distinction because we sent people into harm’s way, and the way in which we appropriate and provide benefits and support services reflects the danger to which we exposed those people.</para>
					<para>The whole concept of qualifying service meaning exposure to hazardous duty in the face of the enemy distinguishes some levels of benefits that veterans receive. That is something that gets tested every time one of these reviews is carried out. The people we send into harm’s way are treated differently from those whom we do not send into harm’s way, notwithstanding their preparedness to serve in the same way. The people that we damage, harm and disadvantage as a result of their work on behalf of our country are treated differently from those who are not so damaged.</para>
					<para>Those distinctions are important. They are central to our system of repatriation and veterans benefits. One of the things that comes up—and it came up in the Clarke review—as we always seek, where we are able and can afford it, to improve the benefits made available to our veterans is not to lose that distinction, because that distinction speaks to the veterans, to their organisation and to their individual experiences. If we were to mull over that and fog up those distinctions, we would not please anybody. When one looks at recommendations to expand and enhance veterans’ benefits, we cannot lose sight of that distinction. This is where qualifying service becomes so difficult. What is the nature of the harm? What is the risk? Where is the hostile force? They are some of the tenets of our system that were tested through the Clarke review.</para>
					<para>Frankly, I am pleased the government did not accept one of the Clarke review recommendations— that is, one of the recommendations to replace the current arrangement built up in a historical context, bringing into play those points that I described about different experiences and different levels of danger, harm and activity by enemy forces. I am glad we did not move to what Clarke touched upon. Do not mistake what I am saying for a defence in total of the current arrangement, because there are some anomalies and we continue to work on those. Here we have embraced such activities as minesweeping after the war. Prior to this, the argument was that the war was over—what danger were you in? But the mines were still armed and they still represented a huge threat. So minesweeping operations are significant. We have recognised that risk, and I am very positive about that, because there is empirical data to validate that risk and the threat that the service personnel were exposed to.</para>
					<para>In his review, Clarke made a recommendation which said: ‘Set aside these at times frustrating distinctions and introduce a new concept.’ He said: ‘Currently, it is not the bee’s knees. Why don’t we try something different?’ He was introducing the concept of perception of fear. I am glad the government has not embraced that recommendation. The difficulties we have at the moment would only be multiplied many times over if we went away from factual, empirical data that took account of actual activities, actual military engagement and real threat by an active enemy where the hazard is there, and introduced a concept of perceived fear. Where would that leave us? Where would that leave the distinctions that I outlined earlier where we have higher levels of benefits and assistance for people, depending on the nature of their service and the damage done to them that has resulted from them carrying out what the nation asked of them? I am pleased that recommendation was not embraced. It would have thrown out decades of trying to get these factual and evidence based arrangements in place. It would have thrown that out of the door and introduced a concept of perception, and where would that have taken us? I cannot think of a veteran who would have thanked us for that. The solid ground, as frustrating, as technically difficult and as complex as it is—as any idea that is tested over and over again in the courts and in appeal processes is—and as complicated as all that is, beats the daylights out of a perception.</para>
					<para>We have work still to do in those areas, and I have flagged some of them. Some of the things that our veterans were exposed to have damaged them, and we need to make sure the nation is prepared to support their needs, to meet their health requirements and to provide the financial assistance that is required. In relation to the veterans who are called atomic veterans—that is the shorthand version for our military personnel who were involved in testing of atomic weapons—let us go back to what I described. Where was the enemy then? There was none. It was our friends and our allies who let off these bombs. In my community I think of Mr Miller and others who were involved in that testing. Another gentleman, whose name I will not mention, who barely has a healthy cell in his body, has been damaged by his military service. It was not by a hostile force; it was by a friend. That shows where the current method of determining qualifying service does need to be enhanced. I am grateful that we are waiting for some medical advice on what the mortality and health consequences have been for that category of veterans. I am pleased we are looking for that evidence. It is a chance to place a better evidence based system into the qualifying service arrangement which we know can be frustrating and is not perfect but which, heavens above, is infinitely better than introducing a concept of perception—and where would that take us?</para>
					<para>I am using that just to illustrate the point that our work continues. I am unashamedly one of those pressing for a better deal for veterans. As long as there is breath in my body and I earn the support of my electorate, I will always go into bat for my veterans. The peace, prosperity and pluralism that we enjoy in this country came at a great expense and, more than any of us, the veterans carried that burden. There are other aspects of this package that I could talk about, but I am mindful that my friend and colleague the member for Gilmore, another fearless advocate for our veterans community, is seeking the call.</para>
					<para>This is work in progress: looking after our veterans needs, as we learn more about their experience and the consequences of their service on behalf of our nation. But this is a very constructive, positive and welcome step forward. It is an excellent injection of cash. It is recognising that our widows, in particular, have a huge burden to carry, where we have damaged their loved ones who have returned to the family home not as they were when they left. I am grateful that those benefits are being extended to our widows and widowers and also for the embracing of MTAWE as a basis for indexation of DVA disability pensions. I was keenly reading Clarke’s report to see what the review thought of the level of those benefits. I was encouraged to read of the conclusion that those benefits were adequate. I know some people disagree with that. My campaign was to always say that, if we are going to argue that they are adequate, we must make sure that they remain so. If they are adequate today, and we determine their adequacy by reference to MTAWE, which is what part of the Clarke report was about, it is only appropriate that we maintain that adequacy by having them indexed either to CPI or MTAWE, whichever delivers the best outcome for our veterans. I commend the bill to the House, and I thank our veterans and ensure them that we will remember them.</para>

						<para>—I rise to speak to the <inline ref="R2020">Veterans' Entitlements (Clarke Review) Bill 2004</inline>. One of the most important outcomes of the Clarke review, to my mind, is the reinforcement of the philosophy underpinning the Veterans’ Entitlements Act: the fact that returned servicemen should be entitled to specific consideration ahead of all others for the service rendered to their country.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>Since the Clarke report was released, I have addressed many ex-service organisations, heard their stories and listened to their views on veteran entitlements. The feature which came out most prominently is the number of non-veteran ex-servicemen who are now seeking entitlement under the act— in effect, seeking to have those provisions extended beyond the qualifying criteria or having the qualifying criteria relaxed to allow more generous eligibility. In the course of my research for those speeches, I found that the Veterans’ Entitlements Act contains the most generous provisions in the world. These latest recommendations adopted by the government make the act even more generous.</para>
					<para>As a result, I predict more and more exservicemen will require access as they get older, and that is a perfectly legitimate and understandable aspiration. I have my views on who should be entitled and who should not, as indeed the rest of the population has. But benefits that flow to veterans are not determined by Joanna Gash but by the law of the land. And whether we like it or not, it still is the law of the land that determines eligibility. So the process that was gone through to arrive at this report and this bill reflects democracy at work. There were many veterans and ex-service submissions that were considered by the committee, and I would like to express my appreciation at the thoroughness and professional approach of the committee. The fact that they supported no change in provisions in about half of their recommendations reflects the integrity of the existing provisions, which were moulded over decades of administrations.</para>
					<para>As expected, not everyone was happy with the outcome. But, in general terms, it was a very satisfactory result. The fact that we connected with the people concerned is an important point. Rather than arbitrarily deciding what we thought was best for people, we actually went to the effort of asking and listening. That point needs to be emphasised along with the fact that we had the courage to pursue improved benefits for our veteran community. It is something that we are proud of and will continue to strive for through changing circumstances.</para>
					<para>The review was also instrumental in drawing attention to the changing face of war in the guise of terrorism and the fact that a new and appropriate response was needed to reflect changing circumstances. For too long the view has been held of defined battle lines with a visible enemy, fought to the rules of engagement. No more is this the case. We now have to deal with a shadowy, dogmatic and ruthless enemy that has no centre of control, has no national borders and knows no authority to contain its excesses. In short, we are dealing with mass murderers whose aim is not to win so much as to exploit the fear that their terrorist tactics bring. It is a battle as deadly as any conventional war but it is far more insidious. It is a battle we cannot afford to lose. The Australian men and women who take on this enemy face dangers never before experienced and they are doing this to protect us. The least we can do is to make sure they do not suffer for their service to us and are not deprived in any way at all as a result. The dangers they face in terms of biological, chemical and nuclear threats are horrible but no less final than the dangers encountered by their predecessors.</para>
					<para>I welcome these new initiatives which have been introduced by the minister, especially those that address the inconsistencies under the Social Security Act. I also applaud the decision to award an ex gratia payment to the prisoners of war of the Korean conflict. It is important that we continue to maintain the integrity of the act, although, as I indicated earlier, we must keep an open mind about future developments. The fact that we were prepared to deal with obvious anomalies, such as those of minesweeping and bomb clearing after World War II, demonstrates our commitment to a fair deal for those who served. Despite the fact that it was a long time coming, it was this government that took the stand. This government has certainly been proactive in terms of consideration for Australia’s armed forces and returned service personnel. These latest provisions amply demonstrate that commitment.</para>
					<para>Finally, I would like to commend my backbench committee, the minister and the Prime Minister for consulting and then having the courage to see that the concerns that were raised during the consultation process were addressed and mostly adopted. Contrary to the belief of the opposition, democracy is alive and well in this government. I would also like to thank all of those from the electorate of Gilmore who made submissions. Gilmore has a very alert veteran community which takes a keen interest in defence and veteran matters. My only regret is that I cannot deliver to it a fulfilment of some of its wishes. For instance, the BCOF members want their exposure to radiation following postings near Hiroshima to be viewed as a war related hazard, and the veterans of the Korean conflict, many of whom served with the BCOF, have legitimate claims along the same lines. But I do enjoy their hospitality and advice because it is well intentioned and I trust their honesty.</para>
					<para>These amendments are very necessary and overdue. They reflect our ongoing commitment to our veterans in the past, now and in the future. As the minister explained in her second reading speech on the bill, the provisions seek to address anomalies that were identified in the Clarke report. It shows that this government takes extra interest, beyond the provisions of the statutes, for the sacrifices made. Similarly, the treatment of the veterans’ disability pension and indexation arrangements are laudable initiatives. All in all, it shows that this government is prepared to look to the future needs of veterans and is not content with just sitting on its hands with established but outmoded provisions. Our veterans deserve better and they are getting better from this government. I commend the bill to the House.</para>

						<para>—There are not many in the House who do not wholly support the <inline ref="R2020">Veterans' Entitlements (Clarke Review) Bill 2004</inline>. I certainly support it as far as it goes and I optimistically look to the future to see some other areas addressed which have not been addressed in this bill. I will deal with those later in my speech. The bill is a catalyst for increasing government benefits to eligible Australian war veterans, which in effect will give proper recognition to the huge sacrifices these men and women made for our country in armed conflict. There are simply no words adequate to describe the service, sacrifice and suffering of our veterans and what they lived through—and what some are still living through—to defend our way of life.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>I am patron of the Vietnam Veterans Association in my district. The amount of psychological damage that occurred to Vietnam veterans never ceases to amaze me. I am very sensitive to their needs. Having been sensitised to their needs, I see some other groups in the veteran community that I think we could give some more attention to. It is my duty as a federal MP to represent my constituency to the best of my ability. In light of the almost inconceivable experiences of our war veterans, especially some of the Vietnam veterans, it is the least I can do.</para>
					<para>Quite simply, we are honour bound to acknowledge and repay veterans for their contribution to the sort of lifestyle that we live in Australia today. Although our gestures can never fully compensate veterans for their experiences, the proposed changes to the Veterans’ Entitlements Act which would be enacted through this bill go some small way towards doing that. Australia embraces its veteran community and there is tremendous respect and affection for our diggers, as we saw in the increased numbers at many parades, dawn services and citizens parades during the recent Anzac Day celebrations. The fact that more than 3,000 submissions were made to this review is testimony of the respect in which those veterans are held. I and several other coalition colleagues felt so strongly about this issue that we used our joint party meeting to push the envelope of the government’s initial response to the Clarke review. I heartily welcome the government’s immediate reconsideration of the matter and I thank the Prime Minister for it.</para>
					<para>Of all the points raised by members in the party room, a few struck me as being most valid. Among them was the improved indexation for TPI pensions for our most disabled veterans. I was quite pleased to see this measure included in the bill by way of indexing the above general rate for the TPI pension or that portion over and above the standard pension payment to both the consumer price index and male total average weekly earnings, bringing it into line with the service pension and the widows and widowers pension. Even better, the extra funds are being back paid to 20 March for the 45,000 eligible veterans. Quite clearly, the government is responding to the needs of those veterans, with more than half of its response to the Clarke report—$166 million out of $267 million—being spent in addressing their needs.</para>
					<para>Along the same lines of improving the immediate financial situation of some of our veterans, the government will introduce a Defence Force income support allowance for up to 19,000 eligible veterans and partners. This payment will negate the impact of the DVA disability pension being counted as assessable income by Centrelink—in effect, it will make up the difference between the amount of income support a person is currently receiving from Centrelink, and the amount they would receive if their disability pension were not counted in the assessment of their social security payment. I also argued for proper recognition of the people who carried out dangerous duties during times of conflict and since, of those who dismantled ordnance such as shells, bombs, mines and sea mines. This group is one that was very badly neglected. From 1944 to 1947, these people undertook some of the most dangerous work of the lot. There is nothing more dangerous than defusing unstable ordnance—one slip of a screwdriver or a wrench could kill everyone around. To say that they did not face the enemy is not recognising the fact that most of that unstable ordnance was put there by the enemy. I very warmly welcome the inclusion of those people in the bill.</para>
					<para>A one-off ex gratia payment of $25,000 will also be made to veterans who were interned during the Korean War or to their surviving spouses. This payment will be similar to the one made to veterans who were prisoners of war in the Japanese theatre of World War II and their spouses. The payment is being made in recognition of the POWs’ limited protection under the Geneva Convention, their lack of access to International Red Cross assistance and the systematic mistreatment of these prisoners by their captors. The bill will also implement rent assistance payments for the 11,000 or so war widows and widowers who are already receiving the maximum rate of income support supplement.</para>
					<para>This government has already made giant inroads in terms of helping our war widows and widowers during the past eight years, with their pensions already indexed to male total average weekly earnings, the restoration of entitlements to widows who remarried prior to May 1984, and the indexation of income support supplement and service pension paid to war widows. Finally, funeral benefits for eligible veterans will rise from $572 to $1,000, which will go some way to lifting the burden of the burying of loved ones at a time of great sorrow and grief.</para>
					<para>I have covered the essence of the bill, but I want to speak further about the personal effect it had on veterans in my area. My electorate office was inundated with messages of support for the measures contained in the bill, and expressions of gratitude for the government’s reconsideration of its original response to the Clarke review. Among them was a message, which read in part:</para>
					<quote>
						<para>Thank you all very much for standing up in the party room and showing support for TPI entitlements and the necessity to link our pension with the MTAWE. Your support in this matter is very much appreciated and won’t be forgotten.</para>
					</quote>
					<para>Another message said:</para>
					<quote>
						<para>Sir, I have a system of ranking people which begins with the question, ‘Would I have this person in my Platoon?’ Your good self and a section size group of pollies made my ‘A’ list today by an act of bravery which will lead to the saving of many lives and the diminishing of some of the torment of many Veterans and their families. In the last couple of years I have been awarded the Centenary Medal for my work with Veterans and their children, a Centenary of Federation Peoplescape Award and Life Membership of the Vietnam Vets Association. I’d swap all that for an afternoon in Canberra with your colleagues for an audience.</para>
					</quote>
					<para>Having said all that and reflected on the good and proper work conducted by the government as a result of the Clarke review, I should also give voice to my concerns for another veteran group which is not covered by these measures. It goes to the issue of qualifying service. There is a group of veterans who signed up offshore, not on Australian soil, who are not entitled to the same range of veterans’ entitlements as other veterans. I understand the protocol that exists between Commonwealth and allied countries, and that is that veterans’ benefits are paid by the country in which you signed up. I do not have any argument with the broad principle of that. I am not suggesting that, in this measure, everyone who signed up in a Commonwealth or allied unit who comes to Australia should be entitled to the full range of benefits. I am not arguing that case at all, but there are some exceptional cases and they are: veterans who signed up at the beginning of the war with allied or largely Commonwealth units—some in Canada and some in the UK—because they could not get back to Australia to sign up.</para>
					<para>The case I would like to raise this morning is the case of those who signed up in Fiji. Why, you might ask, Fiji? At the time, the sugar industry in Fiji was run largely by British and Australian operatives. Many young men—administrators, scientists, sugar mill workers and supervisors—went to Fiji and worked in companies like CSR. When the war broke out, they signed up to the British Army in Fiji. Fiji at the time, of course, was a colony, not a republic within the Commonwealth as it is today. These young men who worked for CSR would have preferred to have come back to Australia to sign up, but they did not have that opportunity. They went through the rigours of war, like everyone else. But while they did not face the enemy in any direct conflict they were on alert for most of the war because, Fiji being a South Pacific island, anything could happen at any time.</para>
					<para>I would like to raise the case of Mrs Vint, one of my constituents. Her husband signed up to the British Army in Fiji. Like many veterans, they were encouraged to smoke. In later life he developed emphysema, which tragically took his life some years ago. We generally recognise cases like that, in our own Defence Force structures, as being attributable to war service. However, Mrs Vint will not get any of those sorts of entitlements because the argument is made that her husband was not a member of the Australian Army, he was a member of the British Army. He did not have the opportunity to be a member of the Australian Army.</para>
					<para>We should also recognise that Australians who served in garrisons on Pacific islands also did a great service not just to the British Army but also to the defence of Australia because those garrisoned Pacific islands were very much a part of the shield around Australia. We had young Australians, albeit in the British Army, serving in that capacity. Mrs Vint receives a small entitlement from the Fijian government, but that goes nowhere to serving her needs or acknowledging the fact that her husband, who served there in the Army and subsequently came back to Australia and put in a lifetime of service in industry, should be recognised. I find that very hard to stomach and I am sure there were similar cases of people who joined the Air Force in Canada and the UK. I reiterate: I am not saying that everyone from every country who joined a Commonwealth or allied unit should be entitled to Australian pensions; I am saying, however, that those Australians who, through circumstances, were pressured into or forced to join Commonwealth units offshore and who subsequently returned to Australia should be recognised.</para>
					<para>Another group that was not covered in the bill—and I would like the government to revisit this at some future stage—was the members of the Commonwealth occupation forces in Japan. Having seen the work of the Australian troops in East Timor and, more recently, in Iraq, I have some sympathy for those who were in the occupation force in Japan. Although Japan had effectively been brought to its knees, these troops still faced tense and sometimes dangerous situations. There was obviously resentment there. There were obviously the dangers associated with a postwar situation. I call on the government at some time in the future to reconsider their case. I commend the bill as far as it goes. I think it is a very good bill. It picks up on TPIs, Korean prisoners of war, war widows and war widowers and it acknowledges those people who carried out the dangerous work of dismantling ordnance. I hope that those two other groups that I have mentioned will be given future consideration by the government as our veteran community ages and we look to the particular needs of those people.</para>

						<para>—in reply—The <inline ref="R2020">Veterans' Entitlements (Clarke Review) Bill 2004</inline>implements the increases in benefits announced by the government in March in our response to the Clarke committee’s review of veterans’ entitlements. I note that I have been criticised by members on the other side as being a minister for no action, but this government and I, as minister, have delivered significant initiatives for the veterans and war widows.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>We have increased financial support for service pensioners and war widowers, we have increased compensation payments for veterans with disabilities and we have improved health care for older veterans and veterans with disabilities. This means that the most significant increase has been for funding for veterans’ health care, which has increased from $1.8 billion in 1996 to a massive $4.4 billion in 2004-05. We have increased funding for income support and compensation from $4.6 billion in 1996 to $5.9 billion in 2004. We have increased funding for commemorations, as a small but very special component of this government’s funding for veterans and respect for veterans.</para>
					<para>This bill implements two significant changes which will benefit veterans receiving a disability pension. First, new indexation arrangements will assist the most disabled. The portion of their disability pension above 100 per cent of the general rate will be indexed in the same way as the service pension and war widows and widowers pensions. Adjustments now will be based on movements in both the consumer price index and the male total average weekly earnings, not just the CPI. Increases in pensions will be backdated to 20 March 2004. Second, the government will introduce the Defence Force income support allowance, known as DFISA, from 20 September. The supplement will offset the loss of income resulting from inclusion of the disability pension in the means test for pensions and benefits paid by Centrelink to recipients and their partners under the social security law.</para>
					<para>The new allowance will be the difference between the income support received under social security law and the amount that would be received if the pension were not counted as income in the assessment of the social security payment and if a disability pension income test for rent assistance applied. The allowance is expected to benefit more than 19,000 disability pensioners and their partners by an average of $40 a fortnight. However, a single TPI pensioner with no other income may receive up to $257 a fortnight.</para>
					<para>In 2001 Australia followed the precedent of the United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand by making an ex gratia payment to the prisoners of war of the Japanese in recognition of the extremely inhumane conditions that they endured. This bill grants a $25,000 payment to the surviving prisoners of war of the North Korean forces or their widows or widowers who were alive at the beginning of July 2003, for inhumane treatment like that experienced by the prisoners of war of the Japanese during World War II.</para>
					<para>War widows and widowers will benefit from our decision to pay rent assistance as well as the ceiling rate of the income support supplement or the service pension. The rent supplement will help war widows and widowers who rent privately. This payment will begin on 1 January. The bill also raises the maximum funeral benefit from $572 to $1,000 for a deceased eligible veteran from 1 July, to help families with the cost of a funeral. The bill will extend operational service to personnel who were involved in minesweeping and bomb clearance operations after World War II and have qualifying service. This corrects an anomaly whereby a small number of personnel received the medal necessary to be eligible for qualifying service but were not veterans because their service fell outside the operational service period specified in the Veterans’ Entitlements Act.</para>
					<para>Before concluding I wish to address briefly some criticisms of the bill. We have been criticised during this debate for doing the obvious and for doing it late, but I simply ask: if these benefits were that obvious and if they were that overdue, why didn’t Labor offer them to veterans and war widows in its own election policy? I have looked particularly at its policy from the last election but there is not one mention of war widows.</para>
					<para>The attempt to discount and talk down the assistance that this government has given to widows is particularly insensitive. War widows have been consistent beneficiaries of this government’s concern. Two of the measures we have introduced were simply to correct hardships imposed upon war widows by previous Labor governments. It was the Howard coalition government which restored entitlements to those war widows who remarried before May 1984, who were simply ignored by Labor, and it was the Howard coalition government which indexed the war widows income support supplement, which Labor froze in 1986-87. It was the Howard coalition government which indexed the war widows pension by reference to male total average weekly earnings in 1997-98.</para>
					<para>This bill delivers a responsible package of measures to enhance the benefits and the support the government gives to veterans, war widows and war widowers. Again I thank the members of the Clarke committee and the people and the organisations who took part in this inquiry, including many thousands of veterans. Mr Deputy Speaker, we have heard that there were over 3,000 submissions to the Clarke inquiry. I would like to acknowledge the members of the defence and veterans’ affairs committee, chaired by the member for Gilmore, who have taken a keen interest in the government’s response on behalf of our veterans. I also acknowledge the strong advocacy from the members for Gilmore, Blair, McPherson, Riverina, Cowper, Eden-Monaro and Dickson on behalf of the veterans in their own electorates. I also thank the members of the House for their contribution in the consideration of this bill.</para>

						<para>—The <inline ref="R2043">Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (More Help for Families—One-off Payments) Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2044">Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (More Help for Families—Increased Payments) Bill 2004</inline> go to the heart of the federal government’s budget, delivered last evening. When you look at them in total you can draw only one conclusion: that this is a shameful budget. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer have decided to turn their backs on average Australian households who earn less than $52,000 a year. They have turned their backs on at least 600,000 Australian families who have been caught in the family payment debt trap.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>I think we now all know who will lead the Liberal Party after the next election. It will be Peter Costello. He will be Leader of the Opposition. We know that from this budget because rarely, if ever, has a Treasurer boasted so loudly and delivered so little for Australian families. Let us look at the outright dishonesty of the tables published by the government last night in the budget, which have appeared in all of the national media today. They are outright dishonest. They would lead Australian families to think that the figuring in the tables is real, but it is not real. These tables give the impression that there will be very substantial gains delivered to Australian families on 1 July this year. It is that impression that has led to all of the headlines this morning claiming that for many Australian families there is a cash bonanza in the family payments system. Sadly, that is simply not true. It is some of the most obnoxious, deceptive propaganda ever published by a political official in this country.</para>
					<para>Let me give you some examples. Let us consider a single-income household earning $30,000 a year. What is the actual weekly gain from 1 July 2004 that will be delivered to that family as a result of the changes in the budget last night? These tables try to give the impression that the gains will be delivered from 1 July this year. Down at the bottom of the tables, however, is a little note that says ‘1 July 2005’. But what will the average family in this country receive from 1 July 2004 as a result of the budget? The budget papers claim that a single-income household on $30,000 will receive $34.62. That is what Treasurer Costello claims. But they will get zero on 1 July this year. A single-income household earning $30,000 will get zero, but the claimed benefit for 1 July is $34.62. What will a dual-income household earning $30,000 get on 1 July this year? The claimed benefit is $58.28. The actual benefit is $23.88. There is a huge gap between the reality and the propaganda from the Howard government.</para>
					<para>Let us look at a single-income family or household earning $55,000 a year. The claimed benefit is $32.88. The actual benefit is $6.92. That is a huge gap. Let us look at a dual-income household earning $55,000 a year. What would they have delivered to them on 1 July this year? The claimed benefit is $40.30. The actual benefit is $7.92. Isn’t this so John Howard? Isn’t this so Peter Costello? This gap between the reality and the claim is another mean and sneaky trick from the Howard government, communicated at great public expense right across this nation.</para>
					<para>The truth is this: the fortnightly benefit is what people need and what they will not get from the Howard government. Part of the reason for the huge discrepancy is that the second $600 payment has been factored into these tables as if it were being received by the family on a weekly basis. Nothing could be further from the truth. Families do need their payments on a fortnightly basis to feed, clothe and educate their kids. The kids’ feet do not stop growing because John Howard and Peter Costello want to pay people on an annual basis. Kids do not stop eating because the Treasurer has prepared a table that claims that families get money during the year which they do not get. The fact is that 95 per cent of families in the family payments system opt to take their payments on a fortnightly basis because they cannot afford to do anything else. I have never noticed the Treasurer decide to take his salary on an annual basis. But that is precisely the premise built into the second $600 bribe that has been put into the budget. The government have factored that $600 payment into these tables as if families are going to receive it—and that is before we get to the problem with the family debt trap.</para>
					<para>There is one thing that we really know about our Treasurer: no matter what other people think of him, he absolutely fascinates himself. He has exceeded himself in this budget. He has been so fascinated with himself that he has left the people out. So much of this budget has been delivered in the context of the struggle between the Treasurer and the Prime Minister. Only someone as out of touch as this Treasurer could take a decision to deny regular, accurate payments to families on a weekly basis. That is the problem. The fact is that he has published data which claims that families are going to get payments which they are not going to get. That is the absolute deception that lies at the core of this budget.</para>
					<para>Half the money that the government is promising is scheduled for delivery after 1 July this year. This is the second great deception. A lot of families—we can say, probably with some accuracy, a third of all families— will never see the second $600. Why will they never see the second $600? Because it is going to be offset against their family payment debt. We did not hear anything about that from the Treasurer last night. At least the Department of Family and Community Services has been honest enough to admit that the $600 payment is actually there to offset debt, but we did not hear those words from the Treasurer last night. He was not game enough to come into this House and admit that the second $600 payment will be offset against debt.</para>
					<para>What does that tell you about election timing? The first $600 payment made this year bears no relationship to anything else in the family payment system and will be paid regardless of any objective fact, but when most people’s family payment bill from this year is reconciled next year the second $600 payment paid after 1 July will be offset against their debt. What do we know about the family payment system? We know that one-third of all families get into debt: 600,000 families have an average debt of $900. So for a third of all families mentioned in these tables the $600 which has been put into these tables on a fortnightly basis will never materialise. It will never be there. Shane Stone, where are you now? Let’s pen a new memo: mean and tricky again! Does this Treasurer ever learn? He always returns to the scene of the crime. Shane Stone was right three years ago and he is right now. That is what is demonstrated in these tables.</para>
					<para>Contrary to what the government have been saying, the second $600 payment—not the $600 election bribe that turns up before 30 June—is not an increase in the family payment system. It does not appear as an increase in the base rate. It is not there. The fiddle in all of this is that they have had to create a new payment. It is called the ‘get Peter Costello elected payment’. That is what has been created. If they were really serious about the second $600, it would have been built into the base rate of the payment, but it has not been. They have created a new payment called the ‘get Peter Costello elected payment’. But what the Treasurer did not tell people last night is that he is going to claw it back, because it is offset against debts. That is what you find when you go to the FaCS web site, but it was not in the Treasurer’s speech last night. Half the money the government are promising is scheduled for the period following 1 July. As I said before, many of these families will never see it. What we really have here is a fraud on Australian families.</para>
					<para>The Treasurer came in here last night and created the impression that he was going to deliver $1,200 per child to all Australian families who received the family tax benefit. That is what he did. Their expectations are really high. As they read these tables this morning they are saying: ‘Terrific! We can pay off some of the credit card. Perhaps we can fix the fridge. We can do something with the school fees. We can help out with buying some extra gear for the sporting team,’ or whatever. But what is going to happen on 1 July? These figures will not be there. There will be people who will be planning their family budget on the basis of these figures, but the money will not be there. It will not be in their pocket, because that second $600 will be offset against debt. These fraudulent tables show that this budget is simply about one thing: satisfying the political needs of Peter Costello—not about satisfying the needs of Australian families; it has nothing to do with that. If the government were really interested in satisfying the needs of families, they would reconstruct and create a new plan for the family payment system which gives payments to families accurately and in a timely manner when they need them.</para>
					<para>As I said before, 95 per cent of all families still opt to take their payments on a fortnightly basis precisely because they cannot afford not to have them. I do not see Peter Costello deciding to pay himself an annual salary, but he expects the family payment system to be constructed around payments which come annually. What sort of policy is that? How cynical and cruel is it? What a hoax it is to pretend that any of these things address the fundamental problems in the family payment system. These bills are really here today to give $600 to families because John Howard and Peter Costello have simply refused to fix the debt trap in the family payment system. They have consistently refused to do that for the last three years because they want to create the illusion that the budget is much more generous than it really is. The $600 bandaid will simply be swallowed up in debt, and many of these families will still incur a debt next year, probably after the election. Fortunately, by that stage we may well have a Latham Labor government committed to a fundamental change in the system—a new plan—to ease the financial pressures on Australian families in the long term.</para>
					<para>These one-off payments and other changes do little to lower the punishing rates of tax that families with children pay when they work harder, work overtime or have an unexpected increase in earnings. After the tapered changes in these bills, many families will still only pocket 40c in every additional dollar of overtime. So for the Treasurer to wander into this House and suddenly claim he had had a conversion on this question of punishing rates of tax through family payment withdrawal is a farce. This was the same Treasurer who came into the House when we asked him about this problem and said that it was not a policy problem and that he never intended to do anything about it. Suddenly, we have had this conversion. He has suddenly discovered the punishing rates of withdrawal of family payments, what they do to families and how they affect incentives. He might have discovered it, but he still has not done anything substantial about it.</para>
					<para>The families of Australia can rely on a Latham Labor government to fix that problem because, under Costello’s budget, families are still going to be punished by the very steep and punishing rates of family payments when they work harder, work overtime or leave the work force to have a child and then return to work. That problem still exists right through the system, and you are going to be hearing a lot more from Labor about it, because this Treasurer has not done anything to fix that problem. All the construction that we have seen here is based on the construction the government has put in place over the last three years, which has one objective: design a system to claw back as much of the payments as you can possibly get away with politically. In the last three years, the government has clawed back $1.5 billion worth of debt from Australian families.</para>
					<para>Of course, we have been there before, haven’t we? On the eve of the last election—just around the Aston by-election—when the government was in trouble, the Prime Minister suddenly had a revelation and said, ‘To solve the family debt problem out there we’ll offer a one-off waiver of $1,000. That will fix the problem, because we know that in the future the debts won’t be there, because we’ll communicate better and we’ll make some administrative changes.’ What happened? The debt problem remained absolutely huge.</para>
					<para>So during the three years since the last election, something like 1.5 million to 1.6 million families have accumulated debts totalling around the same amount. The problem did not go away. But that is not what the Prime Minister told Laurie Oakes on 1 July 2001, when he was admitting that they were going to provide a $1,000 waiver. He said that he would give $1,000 ‘just for a transitional year’. Laurie Oakes asked, ‘Will that be repeated, Prime Minister? Will you ever do that again?’ Howard replied:</para>
					<quote>
						<para>It won’t be repeated and with the benefit of the information we now have we’re going to be able to more closely target people.</para>
					</quote>
					<para>They targeted people all right: the number of families in debt stayed at 600,000 for the next three years. The government punished families, causing immense financial and emotional crises in so many houses around this country, and now the Prime Minister is back doing it again—and the government expect people to believe them!</para>
					<para>These guys are incredible. They have cancelled Christmas two years in a row and now they have suddenly decided to have a really big one just before the election. They have done it all before. The $1,000 promised just before the last election was all clawed back. There was the claw—out there, clawing it back. They did the same thing to the pensioners. They promised a four per cent pension increase but took two per cent of that away in March 2001. They promised a $1,000 family payment waiver but there were debts for the next three years. The claw was out there gouging all the time, and they come back on the eve of this election with the same tactic again and expect people to believe them! Well I say that the families of Australia will be once bitten, twice shy. They have seen all this before, because this government have no new ideas for this country, no vision and no understanding of the financial pressures on Australian families—none whatsoever.</para>

							<para>—It is the same size as well. If they had a heart, we would be constructing a family payments system that would deliver to people in the long term; we would be constructing payments for carers that would deliver to those families in the long term. But it is not there. It is not there because everything is subservient to the Treasurer’s political goal.</para>
						</talk.start>
					</continue>
					<para>That brings me to those people earning under $52,000, who have got nothing. The government says, ‘Oh, well, a lot of lowincome families have got additional family payments.’ They have, but they are the two million who are in the family payments system. Eight out of 10 people out there have been left out. Lots of low-income households who do not have children have been left out. They have all worked hard to make this economy strong. Why aren’t they entitled to some share in its bounty? What is wrong with them? This Prime Minister was elected on the claim that he stood up for the battlers, but no Prime Minister has done more to create battlers in this community and no Prime Minister has done less to help them—and this budget absolutely demonstrates that fact. Those people have worked hard to create a strong economy. Why are they suddenly left out? This is part of the continual division that the Prime Minister is putting into Australian society. It is part of the development of the two Australias—those at the top are doing well, those in the middle are being squeezed—and some are falling behind— and those on low incomes are falling behind all of the time. But the Prime Minister and the Treasurer go out there and pretend that there is something in this budget for those on low incomes. It is simply obscene for them to continue to argue that.</para>
					<para>All of those problems emerge before you get to the most central flaw in this budget. All of these people absolutely depend upon access to affordable health and education, and what is not in this budget is as remarkable as what is. Where is the solution for Medicare? Where is the solution for education? If you go through those tables that I read out before—the actual gains as opposed to the gains the Treasurer claims—how far does that money go when a family has to take their kids to the doctor in the middle of the night? How far does $20 go when someone has to go to the doctor in the middle of the night and fork out over $100? How far does that $20 increase really go? So it is not just the shame of ignoring all of those people earning under $52,000 or constructing a family payments system that continues the debt burden and punishes over 600,000 Australian families and offers them no long-term relief; it is what the government have not done. It has been in the destruction of Medicare and its affordability and in the destruction of the affordability of education—and that says so much about the Howard government.</para>
					<para>What we have in these budget bills is nothing more than an indictment of the Howard government, and it sums up so much about their record. I mean, it is just incredible: has anybody seen the Minister for Family and Community Services in the last three months? Has she been anywhere? Do we have one? Where has she been? Nowhere. This is a policy which has been delivered by the Treasurer of this country to suit his political circumstances, and it says so much about his political priorities and so much about his lack of understanding of the lifestyles and income levels of most families. He is completely out of whack with the way in which Australians live and what they earn. This family payments system continues to punish families on modest and middle incomes who work harder. The withdrawal of social security benefits and the interaction of the tax system still mean that hundreds of thousands of low- and middle-income families are going to be absolutely clobbered when they work overtime. That has not been touched because the government have refused to engage in long-term change and have a plan for the family payments system. That has not been touched at all.</para>
					<para>But it is worse than that. The fact that the Treasurer can publish tables claiming that the dollar gains are two and three times the actual gains simply shows that this government have come to the end of the line. This government will say anything and they will do anything to be elected, but they will not engage in reform. That is because they do not actually have a long-term plan for the future of Australia; they simply have a plan for an election. I have enough faith in the people of this country to see that they will understand the trickery that lies at the heart of this budget. This budget does not deliver fundamental reform and enduring financial relief for Australian families. Yes, there will be the one-off election bribe. That will be delivered before 30 June—and I am sure that will be welcomed, because low- and middle-income earners in this country have been absolutely squeezed under the Howard government. That $600 payment per child will be welcomed.</para>
					<para>But the con that is evident in these bills, where the second $600 payment will simply be used as an offset for many families for their debt, goes to the heart of what is wrong with the Howard government: no plan for the future; no new ideas; just a plan to try and paper over the cracks in the system so it can get through the next election. This government really only has one solution: that is, to always construct some form of trick just to get by for the election. There is nothing enduring for families in the long term, nothing whatsoever—no vision, no new ideas, no plan for the future. Also, what is absolutely offensive about this whole budget is that it strikes at the heart of the Australian belief in the fair go—that, not only do people deserve access to affordable health and education but they also deserve to get a fair go overall in the tax system. That is simply not evident in any of the initiatives that are before the House today. These bills are a plan for an election, not a plan for a prosperous and fair Australia.</para>

						<para>—Having heard all of that, it will be interesting to see which way the Australian Labor Party votes for the <inline ref="R2043">Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (More Help for Families—One-off Payments) Bill 2004</inline>. Do you know what, Mr Deputy Speaker? They are going to vote for it. That, of course, is the hypocrisy in what we hear from them. This is supposed to be the worst piece of public policy that you could ever see, but the Australian Labor Party will vote with the government, because they know and they understand that this is good for the families of Australia. What puzzles me about the Labor Party is that this is a package of $19 billion—19 thousand million dollars—going to Australian families. How could that be a negative? Goodness gracious me, how could that be something that was trickery? It is money going directly to Australian families—in Townsville and Thuringowa, in Mackay, in Proserpine and the Burdekin and all around this great country of ours. How could this be trickery?</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>Of course, the average family, when they woke up this morning and saw the details of the budget, saw that on average they would get about another $50. That is not something that is unwelcome. It is a great initiative from the Howard government. How have we been able to manage to do that? We hear the Labor Party claiming that we slug the less well-off in the community. That is not the case at all. This is being paid for through sound economic management. It is being paid for because the corporations of this country have never been more profitable. That means they have never paid so much tax. The government believes that we have a responsibility: if we collect this tax from corporate Australia, we should pay it back to those people who live and work in this country.</para>
					<para>I think that it is opportune to really look at what is behind these bills and how, as a government, we have been able to achieve this position. It has been achieved simply by running a sound economy. Every year, the Australian Labor Party say that the government come in with some mean and tricky thing to get re-elected. But what they refuse to recognise and understand is that Australia is probably the best performing economy in the world. That does not come easily. You do not just fluke that. You do that by hard work, making the tough decisions and making sure that things are managed properly—and it is only through running a sound economy that you can best benefit those who are less welloff in our community. They are in fact the biggest beneficiaries of a sound economy.</para>
					<para>In the budget last night, you saw that on top of all this extra spending—massive increases in spending—we have still ended up with a surplus of $2.4 thousand million. We have ended up paying off significant extra debt, which was left to us by the Labor Party. We have ended up in a position where our debt to GDP ratio now is only three per cent, whereas for the United States economy it is running at 50 per cent and for the Japanese economy it is running at 130 per cent. We are in the box seat for the next decade because of the work of the Howard government and the Treasurer of this country.</para>
					<para>The Labor Party get very excited and say this is an election bribe. This is an election year. You always have to have a budget in an election year. If there is the opportunity—as there has been, because the economy has performed well—to feed some of that performance back to the people of Australia, we make no bones about doing it: we feed those benefits back to the people of Australia. Forget all this talk about election bribes, porkbarrelling, stunts and so on. This is what ordinary Australians want to see their government doing. They want to see benefits come back, and certainly the Howard government will do that.</para>
					<para>The member for Lilley, when talking about the new measures in the bill being debated this afternoon before the parliament, quite predictably said that they are going to be swallowed up by debt. Well, what rubbish. No-one needs to have a debt. Some people do, but you do not need to have a debt. The member for Lilley continually runs this scare tactic about debt. I think the scare that the people of Australia should really be aware of is the risk of a Latham government. If we get a Latham government elected at the next election, boy, people will know about debt. We will see the country go back into deficit because of the usual Labor Party tactic of spending more money than we have. The economy of the country will go right off the rails once again. There is certainly a very strong track record to suggest that that will happen.</para>
					<para>I do not understand why the member for Lilley talks about punishing rates of tax when working overtime, when our marginal tax rate brackets have been increased. He will likely be wanting to link that to the family tax benefits, but it is worthwhile for people to do overtime these days. Under the new regime more than 80 per cent of Australians will pay no more than 30 per cent as their top marginal rate of tax. It is worth their while to work the extra overtime to get their families forward if they wish, and to do it with confidence.</para>
					<para>The member for Lilley also claims that people with incomes under $52,000 get nothing. That is another scare tactic. Of course they get something, if they have children. Of course they get something, if they contribute to their superannuation schemes. In measures announced in the budget last night, the government will make a super co-contribution of $1.50 for every dollar that a person contributes to their super up to $28,000, with a taper from there. That is very valuable for helping people to plan for their retirement. The families in Townsville and Thuringowa very strongly support the government’s new measures announced last night.</para>
					<para>The member for Lilley also said, ‘Where is the solution for Medicare?’ I do not know where he has been, but $2.8 billion of extra money in the budget last night is not a bad solution. I am very comfortable, and my local GPs are now telling me that they have increased the amount of bulk-billing that they do. That is the desirable outcome, and we will continue to see that come through.</para>
					<para>In relation to the measures that we are discussing, there are two bills before the parliament. One bill contains five elements. The first element is an ongoing increase in the maximum base rates of family tax benefit part A. The second element is a reduction in the rate at which family tax benefit part A reduces from the maximum rate to the base rate. The third element is a new maternity payment of $3,000, which will be payable as a lump sum to all mothers, regardless of income— and the maternity payment is going to increase to $4,000 in July 2006 and $5,000 in July 2008. The Treasurer was asked on radio about the possibility that some young girls might have babies just to get the money. That is a fair question. It would be very sad if that were the case. I do not think anybody is going to decide to have a child just to get $3,000, because once you have a child there is a lot of ongoing responsibility, and mums should be aware of that. The Treasurer has said that certain measures will be looked at in relation to that, but I do not think that needs to be further considered. The fourth element in the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (More Help for Families—Increased Payments) Bill is a reduction of the rate at which the family tax benefit part B is withdrawn, and the fifth is an increase in the amount of income a secondary earner in a partnered relationship can earn before the entitlement to family tax benefit part B is affected.</para>
					<para>In the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (More Help for Families—Oneoff Payments) Bill there will be a one-off payment of $600 per child to families. There will be certain links to that. There will be a second one-off payment of $1,000 to recipients of carer payment on budget night and a third one-off payment to recipients of carer allowances on budget night. Those payments will be credited directly to customers’ bank accounts, without the need for a formal claim process, so that administration will be significantly reduced. The bill also contains provisions to ensure that the one-off payments will be exempt from tax and not included as income for the purposes of social security law. As a broad principle—and I am pleased to see this—there will be no debts arising from these one-off payments. That is terrific.</para>
					<para>The total measures in the first bill certainly demonstrate the government’s firm commitment to assisting families with raising their children. They will cost $2.2 billion in 2003-04. The Howard government is committed to looking after Australian families. The two bills under debate this afternoon certainly demonstrate the government’s commitment in a very real way—in a $19 billion way. I am very pleased to be able to support these bills. I know that the people of Townsville and Thuringowa warmly welcome the government’s commitment to their families, and long may that be so.</para>

						<para>—I rise this afternoon to speak on the <inline ref="R2043">Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (More Help for Families—One-off Payments) Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2044">Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (More Help for Families—Increased Payments) Bill 2004</inline>. These bills include the government’s proposals to introduce an immediate $600 payment to families and a $600 annual payment, changes to tapers for family tax benefit B and A, the oneoff carer payment of $1,000 and the maternity payment which is a direct duplication of the Labor baby care package. These were announced in the budget last night. It is somewhat unusual to be debating budget legislation on the day after the budget, but I guess, when you are desperate for a quick political fix, no time is soon enough, particularly when it looks like an early election budget. And that is just what this legislation is. It is a political fix.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>Extra family payments are certainly welcome, and they would be welcomed by the families in my electorate because these families are under pressure. They have been under pressure for the eight years of this Howard government. They have been under pressure because their child-care costs have been skyrocketing. They have been under pressure because they have not been able to access child care and, if they have, their costs have been skyrocketing. They have been under pressure because they cannot access a bulkbilling doctor, and they are still having trouble accessing a bulk-billing doctor in my electorate, with only 43 per cent of general practitioner consultations being bulk-billed. Their mortgage payments have gone up because housing affordability has been more and more difficult. The Telstra line rental has just recently gone up, yet again. It is now around $30 on average. The GST on services has hit many families hard as well. If you look at families under pressure and you really understand the circumstances under which families are living, certainly extra payments are welcome.</para>
					<para>But the Howard government has forced Australian families to wait three years for any financial relief. These measures are directed squarely at meeting the government’s political needs, not the needs of millions of Australians under financial pressure. The government’s work and family package was drawn up more than a year ago. They had that more than a year ago, in terms of the sorts of things that could help to alleviate the problems of families under pressure, but it was not released then. They did not decide in the last budget to do anything about it, despite having the money. I think that their argument is flawed. The package was not released because it did not suit the government’s election timetable.</para>
					<para>In that time, families were hit with 1.5 million family payment debts at a cost of $1.6 billion. They were denied out of school hours care and other child-care places during that year, and they had babies without the benefit of any baby care payment or any paid maternity leave, because the government was not interested in helping them; it was interested only in helping them in an election year—and people do not forget that. The Prime Minister gives with one hand and takes with the other. The government has stripped $900 on average from a third of family tax returns each year, and now the Prime Minister is promising to give back $600 in this bill.</para>
					<para>I want to remind the House again of the experiences of one of my constituents, Glenda Aitken of Ballarat, who last year received a notice from Centrelink saying that she owed $1,028 due to an overpayment of her family tax benefit. She received the debt notice and was advised that if she had any problems paying the amount she should of course call the number that Centrelink had given her. She rang Centrelink and advised them that she had actually informed them of changes in her circumstances, changes in her income, but of course they were unable to do anything about that. They did not in fact tell her that she was going to get a debt; they just recorded that and she then got this debt notice.</para>
					<para>She then advised Centrelink debt recovery that she could not pay $1,000 up front—she just did not have it; she was not on a high income—and that she could try and pay $30 a fortnight. But the operator told her that $30 was not enough and that, to Centrelink, $50 a fortnight would be more suitable—bad luck about Mrs Aitken’s family budget—and then she was encouraged to start paying off this debt on her credit card. She was not even asked, ‘How do you want to pay for this?’ She was actually told, ‘You can start making payments directly on your credit card and that would be the easiest way.’ So—bang!— go straight into credit card debt to pay for a family tax benefit system flaw that this government has put in place.</para>
					<para>The lump sum cash family benefit fix that we are debating today fails to address ongoing pressures that families are under. Families will not receive most of the government’s claimed gains, week to week, as they need them. We heard the member for Lilley, in his contribution to this debate, talk about the fundamental flaw in the tables presented by the Treasurer last night. They do not actually represent the true picture of what the gains will be. According to the Treasurer, for a family income of $30,000, the claimed gain for a single income is $34.62, when our estimates are in fact that it is nothing at all. For a family income of $55,000, on the Treasurer’s table—when you look at some of the dodgy figures that he has put out in relation to this—he has claimed that the gain is $32.88. On our estimates it is $6.92. So there is a long way to go in looking, again, at the real detail of this policy—where the real benefits may be within this policy and who the losers are in this policy. Again, we remember, the government has a pretty strong history of putting political spin on its promises, but when you actually go and look at the fine detail, the fine print, you find that you do not get very much at all.</para>
					<para>Then there is the baby bonus flop—and I will call it a flop because it has been an absolutely ridiculous policy in terms of who has benefited and the way in which they have benefited from it. If you look at all of the statements that were around when the government made that announcement, the baby bonus was going to fix everything and we were all going to be out there having babies because we got this terrific baby bonus. The reality for many families is that they did not get very much at all, and the government has finally recognised that by rolling it into its new maternity payment.</para>
					<para>Most of the claimed increases in this bill are delivered in a lump sum at the end of the year and will be quickly clawed back, as I have said, in the family tax benefit debt trap. Some families will not even see the money. Mrs Aitken in fact would have received a bill from the government for $428, had she been in the position that she is in now. Under the current system, one in three families each year has been slugged with debts. In the three years that the scheme has operated, there have been 2.9 million incorrect payments; the percentage of family payment debts remains extremely high and the level of debt has also remained significant; and there has been a significant increase in the number of families underpaid throughout the year.</para>
					<para>So whilst I welcome the increase in family tax payment benefits, unless you fix the fundamental flaws in the system that mean that people get caught in debts, you are actually not helping. The
 government are really not helping by saying, ‘Okay, we’re going to give you $600,’ if, at the end of the financial year, you go to collect your tax cheque when you think you are going to get a rebate and you suddenly find that it has been reduced by $900. That is what has happened in many of the cases that I have seen. Alternatively, if you did not have enough money and you did not get anything back in your tax, and you actually get a bill from Centrelink, I have to say that the $600 begins to look a little bit thin.</para>
					<para>In another case, I had someone contact my office this morning about this because I was talking on local radio about the family tax benefit debt system and what has actually happened for local families. It is a typing error, but I am sure they got a bit of a shock when they got their decision statement from the review office. According to this decision statement, these people have a trillion-dollar debt. I am aware that it is a typing mistake, but I have to say that when they opened this letter this morning to see that they had a debt of $1 trillion it was a little bit scary for them. The actual debt is $1,817.51, but it would have been good had a little more care been taken in this decision statement from the ARO so as to not give them a heart attack when they opened the mail this morning.</para>
					<para>With the $1,817 debt that this family has, immediately the government’s one-off $600 payment is gone and the additional one-off $600 payment after 1 July is gone. They are already gone for this family; there is no benefit at all. This family is not wealthy. We are not talking about families who can afford this. The original estimate of this family’s income—it is a single-income family—was $36,000. Their revised estimate was $42,300. These are not rich people that we are talking about. A debt of $1,800 is a big debt for this family. These families are struggling with their mortgage payments, their rent payments, the extra line rentals from Telstra, trying to get their kids to a doctor, trying to get their kids a decent education. All of these things are things that the government does not seem to understand.</para>
					<para>The latest family payment data shows that the government’s family tax benefit is having a sharp financial impact on the families whose incomes vary during the year. And there are lots of them. With the casualisation of the work force, of course people find it incredibly difficult to estimate their income. If they are lucky enough to get extra overtime, if they are lucky enough to get increases in pay during the course of the year, if they are lucky enough to find part-time work or their spouse finds part-time work, it is inordinately difficult, particularly with the casualisation of the work force, to estimate income on a yearly basis.</para>
					<para>Circumstances change. That is the reality of the lives people live, particularly families where a parent is returning to work after time out of the work force caring for a child. It is very difficult to estimate. Sometimes what happens in my electorate, with the shortage of child care places that we have had, is that people have been on the waiting list for child care for ages. They think they are not going to get anything at all, but they suddenly do manage to get a place and they manage to get some part-time work. They start to increase their family income. They of course report that to Centrelink, which they are required to do, but they then find themselves in this debt trap. The government’s refusal to correct the family payment system, which cannot pay families the right amount when they need it, limits parents’ abilities to balance work and family.</para>
					<para>We have been here before. Last election— I remember it well; I was a candidate then— there was a $1,000 one-off waiver of debts. At the last minute, 20 hours before the election, they said, ‘We’re going to pay you $1,000 to waive your debts.’ A lot of families thought, ‘Great, that’s really good.’ It did not mean that they necessarily voted for the Liberal Party—certainly that was not the case in my district—but they thought, ‘Good, we need that; that is really important to us.’ But then, after the election, I had person after person coming into my office, saying: ‘My tax return’s been stripped. How did this happen? Where’s this money gone? What’s going on?’ They did not even know that they had got a debt, and they then said, ‘What happened to the $1,000 waiver?’ Have a look at the fine print of the announcements the government have made—again in an election budget—and have a look at what their promises are actually going to be.</para>
					<para>I want to turn my attention briefly to the $1,000 one-off carer payment. I welcome the government’s recognition of the problems experienced by carers, and I think the measures that they will introduce in relation to carers allowance are sensible, but I have to say that the one-off payment of $1,000 is an absolute insult; it is an election bribe. I think it shows enormous cynicism towards the plight that carers are facing every day. Carers face a daily struggle year after year—not just in election years; they face it every single day of every single year of their lives. I have a student on placement with me this week. She has three children. One of her children has a fairly severe disability. I asked her this morning what she thinks about the government’s carers payment of $1,000, because she will get it—she is on a pretty low income— and how it would impact on her. This is what she has to say. As a parent who experiences this, she can say it far better than I can. She wants the House to know:</para>
					<quote>
						<para>Whilst I welcome the $1000 one-off carer payment, and will certainly put it to good use, it does not address the ongoing financial commitment of caring for a child with a disability. Not only are parents and carers dealing with being in constant emotional debt through a lifetime of grieving, we are also often in financial debt. There is not the infrastructure in place to support children with disabilities, particularly in the area of after school hours care, and so it is often impossible to obtain employment. When children become adults, the situation is not relieved, because Adult Disability Services operate between the hours of 9.00-3.00, and there are usually 8-10 weeks holiday per year. Not enough respite, not enough support services, not enough long term care facilities, expensive disability aides. It will take more than a one-off payment to compensate for the lack of support services that cause to keep me and my family in financial and emotional poverty.</para>
					</quote>
					<para>I think she says it best of all. A $1,000 oneoff payment is an insult to carers. It is an insult to the daily lives that they are experiencing. It will be welcomed. It will be used well, I am sure. It will certainly help the student that I have on placement to pay off some of the debts that she has, but I think that it really is an insult to not understand that carers need more than that. They need much more than that. They need to be understood much more than they are understood by this government.</para>
					<para>John Howard has squeezed the life out of families for eight years. Now he wants them to be grateful for returning some of what he has taken off them. That is the essence of the bills we are debating here. Essentially, that is the package that the government has put in place in terms of the budget.</para>
					<para>I want to turn briefly to the issue of the maternity payment. When the Leader of the Opposition announced Labor’s baby care package, people started to think again about the whole issue of the working family. We had this dragged out over a year, with the Prime Minister continuously saying, ‘The working family is really important to me. I think it is the most important thing.’ He had a report sitting on his desk for well over a year. He knew that he wanted to maybe do something about it, but he wanted to see what the electorate was doing and where the votes were before making a decision about it. We get out there on the front foot, do the research and talk to people and then announce the baby care package. The baby care package includes over $3,000 for qualifying mothers on the birth of their child, and that comes on the birth of every child. For adoptive parents there is some element in there, but from my point of view that certainly needs some work. The package will increase up to $5,000. It is terrific to see the government, in fact, replicating very clearly the baby care package.</para>
					<para>Somehow, I do not believe the government believes in this stuff. Over the last few years I have watched the way in which John Howard has really put down the whole issue of paid maternity leave. In some of the debates we have had on this issue, he has been pretty cynical about introducing this. I am glad to see that perhaps some of the more understanding people on the other side of the House have been able to hold sway and convince the government and the Prime Minister that, in fact, maternity payments for women—whether they are in the paid work force or contributing to the economy, the community and society by working from home and caring for their children—are a very good thing. I think the package that the government has put together is inferior to Labor’s package. As we go through this election year, we will certainly be welcoming the debates in relation to the maternity payment that we see in this bill here, Labor’s baby care package and also announcements to be made in the budget reply on Thursday.</para>
					<para>Overall, as I said, any attention and any relief that we can provide to families are absolutely most welcome. But, if you do not believe in the system and you do not understand the real pressures that families are under, it is no use just saying that you are going to give people a one-off here and it is no use not fixing the fundamental flaws in the family tax benefit system that encourage debts and allow people to fall into debt. It is absolutely no use doing those things if you are not prepared to change the system that encourages those debts in the first place. The $1,000 one-off carer’s payment is again welcomed and will be welcomed with open arms by those families but, in the words of the student that I have on placement with me at the moment, ‘It’s not enough.’ It is not enough to pay for the enormous financial and emotional poverty that many carers and families who have children with disabilities are currently in. The government does not really understand the daily experiences of those families and the daily needs they have for support services.</para>
					<para>It is all right on the one hand to say, ‘We’re committed to families; we’re committed to increasing payments for families. It is something that we support,’ but if you are not prepared to fix the fundamental flaws in the system that encourage debt and if you are not prepared to understand that in terms of health services, access to general practitioners who bulk-bill, the cost of child care, Telstra line rentals, housing affordability and the lack of access to services for families with disabilities, if you are not prepared to address all of those things on the other side of the ledger, you have got only half of the equation. I think that is what the government has done. It has got only half the picture. The reason it has got only half the picture is that it does not understand the daily lives of families under pressure—families that I see everyday and that many of us have experienced within our own lives. It does not understand those things. In an election year budget, it is happy to put a political fix in place to try to persuade what it identifies, according to its polling, as its new target market, and says, ‘We might do a little bit here,’ but in terms of trying to assist families in this country this package certainly has failed.</para>

						<para>—In the last hour or so in the cognate debate on the <inline ref="R2043">Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (More Help for Families—One-off Payments) Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2044">Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (More Help for Families—Increased Payments) Bill 2004</inline> we have got a sense of what next year will be like. We have had positively vacuous contributions from the Labor Party—vacuous being vacant, expressionless and unintelligent. We have heard a series of slogans and misstatements, as if the Australian parliament is a branch of the Labor Party, where any kind of ridiculous, unsubstantiated and emotive claim can somehow stand for fact and reason. This vacuous Labor Party has shown itself up again today. We have already had two speakers, and there is a shopping list of those who wish to parrot the same vacuous lines that have been given to them by the shadow minister, to parrot some more nonsense about how things would only be better if we did half of what the Labor Party wants and had not done the things that the Howard government had wanted. There is no evidence to back up any of those claims.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>No plan has been put forward by the Labor Party. What they hang on to is a pinched policy. All they can point to in relation to their policy work is some baby care payment, and all they have done is change the name of a payment that the Howard government had been working on. Following a leaked cabinet document they thought: ‘My golly; as the Labor Party we can’t think of anything. We’re vacuous. We’re idealists. We’ve been out of government so long we don’t get fed all the good bits of insight that substitute for policy. We’re going to pinch a cabinet paper.’ Out of the cabinet paper they pinched the work that the Howard government had been pursuing—appropriate work that reflected and reviewed the success of yet another innovative program implemented by this government. They pinched the review document, they changed the title of it from maternity payment to baby care plan, or whatever it is called, and they called that their policy.</para>
					<para>They have the hide to come into this parliament and say, ‘How dare the Howard government pick up our own policy work.’ The Labor Party say, ‘Because we pinched it, that makes it ours.’ Theft does not work in politics. Possession might be nine-tenths of the law on the footy field but it is not in the nation’s parliament. You cannot pinch these ideas and then be critical of the government that implemented the measures, recognised the need, put the programs in place to deliver the benefits, analysed and reflected on the performance of those programs and identified the opportunities for improvement. The government did all the hard work, which was reflected in a cabinet policy paper, and Labor pinched the paper and called it their own. Is that what we are going to be faced with for the next year? I think it is.</para>
					<para>They sit there just hoping that these morsels of insight that are being developed by the Howard government will fall out of the Public Service through a leak or a document off the back of a truck that comes into the hands of the Labor Party. They will just white out the fact that it has come from the current government. They will insert the name ‘Labor Party’ wherever ‘Howard government’ appears and then say, ‘Look, we have a new policy.’ The people of Australia are too sharp for that. I must say that I admire the hide of the Labor Party coming in here and keeping a straight face when they are making a bald-faced misrepresentation of the facts on a pinched policy from a cabinet leak. They claim it as their own and then get critical of the government for actually implementing its own work. That is how the coming year will go, I believe.</para>
					<para>In the face of those vacuous contributions, let me actually talk about what is before the parliament today. The 2004-05 budget delivered last night by the Treasurer—not a selfproclaimed ‘great treasurer’ like Treasurer Keating, but someone proclaimed by others to be an outstanding Treasurer, overseeing the miracle economy that the Economist magazine identified Australia’s as being— was further evidence that good economic management makes things possible. It has made possible more help for families and it is laying a foundation for the future. You can see how careful and forward-looking work on economic management and policy development by a competent and experienced government—that is, the Howard team—in an economy run well delivers benefits for the community. Those benefits can be afforded and they can improve people’s lives without placing at risk their jobs or weighing down subsequent generations with government debt and false hopes that cannot be funded into the future.</para>
					<para>The centrepiece of the budget was the additional cash for kids and improved flexibility for families. These things build on gains already made. Families in the Dunkley electorate have seen support for them increased by the Howard government many times since the election in 1996. Local families know that raising kids is a serious commitment that does involve serious spending demands and also pressures on their families and lives. But we are partnering with families in this budget and responding to those everyday challenges without risking the lowest levels of unemployment, inflation and interest rates in a generation. A strong economy and sound management provide opportunities. The budget last night was about choices on how to employ those opportunities to the advantage of the Australian community. What you see in these bills is how carefully targeted expenditure measures that help Australian families and carers are going to make their lot in life better in a way that can be sustained into the future.</para>
					<para>The Labor Party hope that many people who listen to parliament and watch public affairs do not have very good memories—in fact, they clearly rely on it. They come in here making allegations about lack of support for families, ignoring the fact that these measures that we are debating today will increase total assistance from this government to families by over $6 billion a year from where it was in 1996 when the Howard government was first elected. So there is an extra $6 billion a year being put into the hands of Australian families in ways that Australian families are seeking themselves.</para>
					<para>There has been a criticism from the opposition spokesperson for family and community services, the member for Lilley. It is an interesting criticism. The criticism is that the payment arrangements that we have implemented provide a choice for families to receive those benefits either fortnightly, if that suits them, or at the end of the year. If one is not happy with those choices, one need not exercise them. What is the Labor Party alternative? The Labor Party alternative seems to be to make a lot of noise about it but offer nothing as a substitute. We will hear vacuous speech after vacuous speech about what is wrong with this package, but there is not even a motion before the parliament from the Labor Party to do anything different.</para>
					<para>I presume—and one can only work from a presumption because, again, there is no evidence to suggest what the Labor Party’s position is—they will come in here and bellyache about how bad it is and then vote for it. They will point to all of these flaws but then say that it is good. You have heard the speakers so far say, ‘The extra benefits to families are great, but—’ and then they trot out some extraneous issue. So what you end up with is this perception that something is wrong, but the Labor Party can say, ‘We actually voted for increased family benefits.’ All the while they are hoping that no-one recognises that they have put zero effort into the development of these policies. They have not put their shoulders to the family policy wheel at all, other than by pinching leaked cabinet papers. They bellyache about what we are doing, but they vote for it anyway.</para>
					<para>It is a frustrating position for the Labor Party to be in. They do not know what they believe in anymore. They are clearly just sitting there waiting to see what the media says and whether there are enough commentators around so they can regurgitate—some would say ‘plagiarise’, but I will be kind and say ‘parrot’—criticisms made by others of the government policy because they cannot find any themselves. You have the shadow minister standing up at a doorstop and waving a table around, saying: ‘Because there is a large benefit at the end of the year, we cannot count that. Let’s just work on some other stuff about fortnightly benefits. But we do not like those either.’ You end up wondering what it is they are really on about. They are not on about much.</para>
					<para>The package that is here before us today is actually designed to return the benefits of a strong economy, sound management and experienced government into the hands of the people who need it. It contains much more generous family tax benefits. More than 13,000 Dunkley families will be able to benefit from these more generous family tax benefits. The maternity payment we have spoken about, beginning at $3,000 and moving up to $5,000 in 2008, is a policy that has been in development by the Howard government for some time, reflecting earlier policies that we introduced to assist new parents. We have form on this. We have been working to assist new parents and looking at ways of how to do that best. The Labor Party must have liked our work, because they pinched it. It was so good that they thought: ‘We’ll have that—we’ll just liquid paper it. Because we are in opposition, no-one actually expects us to do anything about it, but we will mouth the words and parrot the work of the government, claim it as our own and say we were there first so it must be our policy. Even recognising that it is stolen property, that is a hot policy.’ It is a good policy, but it is hot—it has been pinched.</para>
					<para>Let us be clear on the payment. The debate on that is so clear: it is a good policy, so much so that the Labor Party wanted to pinch it, even though there are some within their own ranks, I understand, who are unhappy about that and would like the more—I do not know what it is—hydroponic buck choy arrangement! I do not know, but there are problems within the Labor Party about them pinching our policies. They can sort that out themselves. But it is on the record: the maternity payment was developed, devised, implemented, and funded by the Howard government. It will rise from $3,000 to $5,000 and the Labor Party want to pinch it. They have got a little sting in the tail—they want to taper some of those benefits down, so that is an interesting issue.</para>
					<para>In terms of direct assistance to families, the point I was making earlier is that there is a series of cameos that show that there are benefits there for single-income families, 1½-income families, families with children under five and families with dependent children. And what is the criticism made by the vacuous opposition spokesman on family and community services? ‘Some people have got too much already and have incurred a debt, and they will have that debt absorbed within the second instalment of that payment.’ What an interesting argument. Is the Labor Party now saying, given that it has got nothing on the record about its position on these things, that we should just turn the other cheek and look the other way about people who receive more than their fair share of family tax benefits? Or is it saying, ‘Go for it, and you’ll never have to reconcile what you have received with what you are entitled to’? The fair go principle says that people should receive what they are entitled to. If they have received more than that, then one needs to make good that overpayment and bring it in line with what those entitlements are, otherwise the Australian taxpayer will say, ‘Hang on; we’re getting ripped off here; we’re getting taken for a ride.’</para>
					<para>The Labor Party’s criticism of this measure is that some of the extra benefits paid in the next financial year can be used to offset extra money that they were otherwise not entitled to but had received. They are saying there is something wrong with that. Again, most fair-minded and clear-thinking people would see the reconciliation of a debt incurred by receiving more than one is entitled to as an appropriate course of action. In providing additional benefits, the Howard government can see where that episode has occurred and has accommodated it within the normal scheme of events. I would have thought that was a positive thing.</para>
					<para>We are now seeing that the first instalment is an almost immediate payment, and that is why there is some priority being given to this measure: as of last night, a more immediate payment to eligible families of a top-up for their benefits. A one-off payment of $600 per child will go to families, and that will reflect general eligibility for family tax benefit part A for Centrelink instalment customers. For those who are claiming those benefits at the end of the financial year, it will be topped up then, and there is also an opportunity for parents and nominees of people of dependent youth allowance age—16- to 17-year-old children—to also receive that benefit. It illustrates the flexibility that is being enhanced through this project. If you have chosen to receive family tax benefit A on a fortnightly basis, then this will automatically be paid to you. If you have chosen not to receive those benefits on a fortnightly basis and wish to receive them as part of your tax and benefits reconciliation at the end of the financial year, then they will be paid at that point in time.</para>
					<para>The thing that I always marvel at is how the Labor Party can be so critical of benefits of this kind. Let me put the scale of this benefit in context. Most state governments— certainly the one in Victoria—make an education maintenance allowance available, where lower income families are able to receive some cash from the state government to help with education expenses. That sounds a reasonable proposition. In Victoria, those benefits vary depending on the age of the child, and if it is a primary school student the benefits are about $127 for the year. If you think that is good, this benefit—even the one-off payment to be made to all families eligible for family tax benefit part A—is four times that amount. If the state government genuinely believe they are doing something virtuous and worth while by providing an education maintenance allowance—and they are very quick to praise themselves for doing those things—they must be jubilant about the benefit that the Howard government is providing, which is four times that amount.</para>
					<para>But you will still hear people in here trying to say that it is not valuable. You have the opposition spokesman going around and saying that, on his—very contorted— calculations, it might be a handful of dollars a week. Firstly, he is dead wrong in his calculations and he should fess up to the deception that is at the heart of his false calculations. Secondly, he should calibrate his language against benefits that he and the Labor Party think are terrific. This benefit is four times the size of those benefits, and that is just the one instalment to be paid almost immediately, before the end of the financial year, as a one-off payment. It is a targeted return to Australian citizens in need doing important work in raising healthy families. It is a good decision made possible by sound economic management and the capacity to make choices about where to direct those resources. That is a calibration test: the Labor Party is critical of just one part of these benefits, but it is four times as much as the benefit that the state government in Victoria provides for a primary school student. That is pretty good going. In the next financial year you will see an increase in those benefits by a further $600. You are seeing a $1,200 benefit being delivered to families in need—that is for those people who are able to gain the maximum benefit—and that is terrific.</para>
					<para>Another part of the measure is for those people whose income levels mean that their benefit is reduced. The taper rate—that is, the amount of money that you can earn that leads to a discounting of your benefit—is being reduced. If you earn an extra dollar over the eligible amount, under the previous arrangements your entitlement would be reduced by 30c. That is going down to 20c under these measures, and that is another positive sign to families who are prepared to go out there and make good decisions about how best to raise their children and find an appropriate balance between work and family responsibilities. It is a terrific measure.</para>
					<para>I would also like to talk about the carers payment. I have spoken in this House many times about the selfless work of carers. They do a remarkable job, an absolutely extraordinary job. They are remarkable people whose work is recognised year after year by the Howard government. We have developed carers programs that see increased financial assistance through benefits and allowances. They see increased support for carers so they can recharge their own batteries through respite care. They see increased information through programs like Carelink and the like, that let people know where assistance is available. They see the government funding projects such as the Banksia service in Victoria; new innovative models for how to provide in-home and homelike respite care and support for ageing people with dementia. What a tough assignment it is for an ageing person to see their life mate deteriorating through dementia or Alzheimer’s; watching as their life mate loses control of their faculties and increasingly relies on their partner to provide their care.</para>
					<para>In this budget, there is a further instalment of support for carers. There is a one-off payment, which is perhaps a chance for them to buy a new appliance—maybe a new fridge or a washing machine that will allow for a better functioning home environment—or maybe make some changes to their transport mode. It may be to pay some bills or take some time off to enjoy some experiences with their loved ones. Not only is there the one-off payment in here; more importantly— in my view and in the eyes of many carers— there are some guarantees of respite support for people over 70. For ageing carers over 70 who are looking after people, particularly younger people with disabilities, there is a guaranteed four weeks of respite per year to recharge their batteries—another great measure. I hope that in the time available to me I have been able to illustrate that the Howard government has been sincere and genuine in pursuing policy improvement and enhanced benefits for families and carers over time. It is in stark contrast to the vacuous position of the Labor Party. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

							<para>—I will speak about what the member for Dunkley said, because I have a right to do that. He attacked the Victorian government—or praised it—for its work in the area of education for low-income people. He attacked the Labor Party constantly through his speech but, really, he failed to have any understanding of the family assistance measures and the problems they have caused to so many families throughout Australia. His failure to understand those things will be one of the things that comes back to haunt him in the next election, because a lot of people have been affected greatly by this government’s very bad policy.</para>
						</talk.start>
					</continue>
					<para>The <inline ref="R2043">Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (More Help for Families—One-off Payments) Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2044">Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (More Help for Families—Increased Payments) Bill 2004</inline> were announced of course as part of the budget. I will come back and talk about some of the difficulties with them a little later in my speech. They were announced as part of the budget and on the surface they may give some additional payments to a greater number of people than before. The payments include an increase in the maximum and the base rates of the family tax benefit of $600 annually for each family tax benefit child, which is to be paid as a lump sum when people have worked out their income at the end of the 2003-04 income year and, of course, in later years.</para>
					<para>There is also a reduction in the rate at which the family tax benefit reduces from the maximum rate to the base rate, from 30c in the dollar to 20c in the dollar. There is the much talked about $3,000 for mothers, which was pinched out of the Labor Party promises, and which they are moving up to $4,000 in July 2006 and $5,000 in July 2008. This replaces the current maternity allowance and the baby bonus, which has failed— it just has not been taken up. It is another failed policy of this Howard coalition government. It is now supposed to be universal and allows the maternity immunisation allowance to be free of a means test. It will cover all children who meet the current immunisation requirements.</para>
					<para>But there are about six million forgotten Australian families who will not receive a single cent in either tax cuts or increase in family benefits under this process. You sweep away quite a few when you start talking about six million Australians who will not get any benefits under this family allowance, or any tax cuts. The devil is in the detail and, once one understands what is going on, it is not really a family friendly package at all. It appears that the $600 is to cover the family payment debts run up as people have been unable to correctly calculate their income in previous years because of the difficulties in finding work. So it really is like the $1,000 people received when the scheme first came into being.</para>
					<para>It got so bad in Tasmania that people were not even bothering to apply for this payment because of the difficulties they had had in acquitting the repayments of the last payments they had received. I have had hundreds of people come into my office in tears wondering where the money was going to come from to pay back the $2,000 or $3,000 they owed because a year ago they had underestimated what they might have received from work payments. It is a case of the member for Dunkley, an outer Melbourne Liberal, not really understanding the difficulties experienced by people trying to pay back the overpayments they have received of these payments. It is a great theory, but there is no understanding of people, like the people in my electorate, who are seasonal workers and casual workers from country areas. No-one can predict what sort of work they are likely to receive. It often depends on things as unpredictable as the weather.</para>
					<para>City people and people like the member for Dunkley have no idea what sorts of problems these people have to deal with: whether the crop of spuds is coming in or not or whether it has gone rotten; whether the cherries have been taken by burglars, feathered or human; or whether it is going to be one week’s picking or four weeks picking. These are the sorts of tales that I have heard from people who come in to ask for my help in trying to overcome this.</para>
					<para>The pickers of raspberries, the agricultural contractors and the people who get their money out at shearing sheds—the people who do all this work which is now a part of Australia—are the people trying to come to grips with how much money they are going to make in a year and then reconcile that. They are then told, ‘You’ve underestimated so you’ve got too much. You’ve got to pay us back $2,000.’ You can imagine what that does to somebody who is making $25,000 in a year. There is no understanding from the other side of the House of what they have imposed on many low-income people in Australia. They have no idea whatsoever.</para>
					<para>The scheme is wrong. Throwing more money at this will not make it work properly. People on low incomes cannot assess easily what their income is going to be. There are many variables. I do not see that changing; I can only see that becoming even worse. We have people who have many jobs to make their income. They have these variables, and they cannot work out what their income will be.</para>
					<para>The member for Dunkley was saying that these people have to pay back if they get too much of the benefit and trying to put it back onto the individual as being the person who is bad and wrong; making out that there is something bad about them. It is very typical for this government to try and make a scapegoat out of somebody. Many of these people are very ordinary Australians who are really decent people trying to make an income, sometimes in very difficult ways. They are people who have the least capacity to repay debt of any sort, let alone debt to the government. We have banks and credit places allowing people to take out loans without really concerning themselves with the people’s capacity to pay. That is becoming an issue, and here is the government doing the same thing. Really, the government is following along the same lines and doing what those banks and credit lenders do in our society.</para>
					<para>We need a scheme that allows some sort of flexibility between the months to allow income to be earned without the penalty of it being extracted years down the track. You might note that before the last election the federal government offered all families a $1,000 waiver on their family payment debt and then, after the election, they took it back.</para>
					<para>Look at the evidence that the scheme is not working: 2.9 million incorrect payments— 56 per cent of all payments—worth $2.5 billion have been made to families. Whose fault is that? Certainly not those who have sought help. That is bad government policy implemented by a bad minister who has failed to see the changes needed and the changing nature of the workplace and jobs in our society. They have nowhere near caught up to the way that work now operates in Australia. One can see that in the fact that the percentage of family payment debts remains extremely high and the level of debts also remains significant. An average of around $900 for each family with an overpayment shows that this scheme is not working.</para>
					<para>Of the two million families eligible for increased benefits, 600,000 may never see a cent of it. The money will be eaten up by existing family payment debts. The government is compensating families for bad policy and its inability to solve the family debt crisis. It is not really doing anything. The 600,000 will probably never get any of it. It will only repay the debt that they already owe the government.</para>
					<para>The headline in newspapers today is that it is a budget for families. This enormous scheme—this wonderful thing for families— when you get to the detail, is really not that good. The member at the table, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing, can continue to cough all the way to the election as we continue to expose these incredible payments. There are the underpayments that I mentioned. There is an increase in the percentage of families who are being paid throughout the year who are forgoing something like $32.50 per fortnight because people are too scared to claim the correct amount in case they have to pay it back. We are forcing people not to make a claim on this assistance for them and their families. It is so hard and they are so frightened of the scheme that they will not access it.</para>
					<para>This government is really out of touch. After eight years this government has still failed to address the tax and benefit trap that robs families of the reward for hard work. If we look at the changes, it is clear that effective marginal tax rates will actually increase for families moving from welfare to work. Secondary income earners in dual income families who attempt to move off welfare into work will see their effective marginal tax rates increase from 87 per cent to 93 per cent, a six per cent increase. That is due to the stacking of family tax benefit B and partnered parenting payment tapers. Secondary income earners in middle-income families will still not have sufficient reductions. For those with children in child care, the marginal tax rate will only fall to between 100 per cent and 110 per cent from the existing spike of 120 per cent.</para>
					<para>These changes are very complex. The family tax benefit is an example. It will now have two withdrawal rates, 20 per cent and 30 per cent. How can ordinary families follow all this and expect to get the correct answers when asked to account for their earnings and their spending? Even accountants have difficulties with some of these changes. Most of the families seeking additional family payments certainly cannot afford an accountant.</para>

						<para>—I rise
on behalf of those of us who wish to contribute to a fair debate within this parliament and those of us who are elected to speak for our constituents on the very important issue of family assistance. I pointed out in my earlier words the difficulties that so many of my constituents have had through having to repay these payments and the lack of understanding from the other side of the House, from the government, of this very poor policy. I spoke of many people in my electorate who work casually and seasonally to try to make their incomes. People who work on contracts picking up potatoes do not know how long they are going to work in that area. Maybe two weeks later they will be with an onion contractor. Some of the women on the coast work shelling scallops or harvesting shellfish. Others work in different ways, picking cherries or strawberries or working during the shearing season throughout Tasmania. This is how some people are now getting their incomes. To make a judgment that they are going to make $25,000 or $27,000 is near impossible. The member who spoke before me, the member for Dunkley, was blaming people, saying that it is bad and that people have to pay money back. Of course if you get an overpayment you have to pay it back. He was forcing it onto the person to be the bad one. Most of these people are not bad at all; it is the system and the policy that are bad.</para>

As you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker Lindsay, these budget bills were given to the opposition last night. We obviously have not had any opportunity to go through our usual processes, but we accept that the matter is going to be dealt with by the House now.

						<para>—I take the point that is made by the Manager of Opposition Business. Obviously it is not absolutely ideal in terms of parliamentary process for bills to go through without substantial debate. But this is a beneficial bill; this is a bill which is going to give substantial benefits to Australian families. The government is very keen to ensure that these payments start to be made as soon as is humanly possible and, given the processes of the Senate, that is why the government believes that it is very important that this bill goes through the House today. I do appreciate the comments of the Manager of Opposition Business, and I do appreciate the level of cooperation that the government has received.</para>

						<para>—It is ironic that this debate is occurring during government business. As everyone knows, the bills under consideration were in fact initiated by the opposition. So this is something of a notable occasion. After all it is not often, as an opposition parliamentarian, that you get a chance to make the laws. But that is what we are doing here today. In fact, we in the Labor Party have been waiting some eight years to make the laws. The glorious day has now arrived and we will be supporting this legislation through the House.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>This legislation is the direct result of Labor’s policy announcement on 10 February to close down the parliamentary contribution scheme for superannuation and replace it with one that meets a decent community standard. The current parliamentary super scheme is well out of date. It is well above the community standard—offering benefits seven times more generous than those available to the general public. Because it sets a double standard, it has been a major source of public disillusionment and dismay about the political system. It has been one of those things that has undermined trust in our democracy. So Labor are absolutely determined to reform the current parliamentary super scheme and bring it into line with the existing community standard. For this reason, we support these bills. After all, they are our proposition and they were our idea.</para>
					<para>Unfortunately, they do not go far enough. Senior office holders, including the Prime Minister, will still be able to retire with overly generous retirement benefits. To prevent this, Labor will be moving a further set of amendments in the committee stage to place a cap on the retirement benefits. The member for Kingston will be putting forward our amendments to cap the retirement benefits for senior office holders in this parliament. While in my case it will significantly lower my own retirement benefits, it is a sacrifice well worth making to re-establish trust between the Australian people and their government.</para>
					<para>I am proud that the government has decided to support Labor’s decision to close down and replace the parliamentary super scheme. It is interesting, however, to remember the response of members opposite when Labor first announced our policy. We were ridiculed by members of the government, who said that the remuneration rates for politicians were justified. This is what the Prime Minister had to say in February when he was asked about the proposal:</para>
					<quote><para>I have to say that the salaries paid to senior ministers compared with the responsibilities of people in the private sector are way below what is received in the private sector.</para></quote>
					<para>And this is what the Treasurer, Mr Costello, had to say on ABC radio on 11 February 2004, the day after Labor’s policy announcement:</para>
					<quote><para>I think for people that are running the country, overall the package compared to the private sector, is quite restrained …</para>
					<para>In my portfolio, my secretary who works for me … gets paid double what I get paid.</para>
					<para>By changing the super scheme do you think you’ll get better MPs? </para>
					<para>… I think we oughta do things that will get us better MPs in Australia, but I don’t think this—</para></quote>
					<para>closing the parliamentary super scheme—</para>
					<quote><para>is one of the things …</para></quote>
					<para>The Minister for Health and Ageing, Mr Abbott, said on the same day:</para>
					<quote><para>If you look at the standard pay of politicians, if you look at senior ministers for instance, a minister earns half what his departmental secretary earns. A minister will earn a small fraction of what a chief executive or other senior manager in private enterprise will earn. I think you need to look at a politician’s pay as a package. I don’t think what politicians are paid overall is unreasonable.</para></quote>
					<para>I find it disturbing from these comments that the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the minister for health think it is okay to go into politics for the money. If that is the case, then I say to them, ‘Go set up a company; go into business to make money; don’t go into public life.’ Public life should be about public service and, as the Treasurer agonises about his future, working out what he is going to do after Christmas, this is an option open to him. If he believes that the private sector is so attractive and that the level of remuneration makes such a big difference, he can go and set up a business. He should go back to his legal practice. This is, of course, a proposition that we will be advocating well before the end of the year.</para>
					<para>In this debate, Senator Boswell could not resist the temptation to put his own unique stamp on proceedings, saying ‘Labor’s policy reeks of Hansonism—in the worst possible way it is populist.’ I think he then went on to ask what I would do next as Leader of the Opposition: go down to the pub and talk to people about what needs to be done? This just exposes the elitism of The Nationals, implying that you should not go to the pub or the shopping centre and talk to the Australian people about useful things that need to be done for our democracy. As leader of The Nationals in the Senate, Senator Boswell is well out of touch with his constituency— obviously oblivious to the strong public feeling, particularly in the state of Queensland, against the double standard in parliamentary superannuation.</para>
					<para>What we saw from the government after these statements following the 10 February policy announcement was a total about-face. What could be more populist than a government changing its mind overnight—a government that collapsed in the face of public support for Labor’s initiative. One day they believed passionately that MPs were not overpaid and the next they held the opposite view. The English writer George Orwell had a word for this—‘doublethink’: the ability to simultaneously hold two contradictory views on the same subject. Within the space of a couple of days, that is what we saw from the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the minister for health and many other coalition MPs.</para>

							<para>—The member at the back there was remonstrating with me in the parliamentary courtyard about this, saying, 'Mark, you've done a terrible thing: you've busted open the club. If everyone had just stayed silent about this, we wouldn't have our entitlements under threat.' I was under threat as I went to the cafeteria, and now the member for Moncrieff has the hide to interject in the parliament. I think he has lined up to be the next government speaker. It will be interesting to reconcile his views—his doublethink—in the courtyard with his views in the House of Representatives when he is looking to get it down in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record for the electors of Moncrieff. We might just hold you to the proper standard—your courtyard standard rather than the double standard in the House of Representatives.</para>
						</talk.start>
					</continue>
					<para>The Prime Minister has been in the parliament for 30 years without raising concerns about the parliamentary superannuation scheme, and he expects us to believe that he supports this change on principle. The fact is the Prime Minister had no intention of closing down the overgenerous and totally out-of-date parliamentary superannuation scheme until it posed a political risk to his government. So there is nothing principled about these bills as they are moved by the Howard-Costello government; they are the work of a cynical administration that is out of ideas and rapidly running out of time. This is part of an eight-year pattern of behaviour shown by this government whenever there is an election on the horizon. It is willing to ditch any belief or conviction and reverse any policy to stay in power.</para>
					<para>Unlike the coalition, Labor originated these bills on the basis of the principle. From my travels around Australia during my time as a member in the south-west of Sydney over the past decade it has become obvious to me that the Australian people think that the current parliamentary super scheme is totally unfair. I found myself in shopping centres, in pubs and at community gatherings in my electorate unable to defend the double standard. What do you say to low- to middle-income Australians who complain about a parliamentary scheme seven times more generous than their own superannuation arrangements? They see it as a double standard, and that is what we are bringing to an end.</para>
					<para>We cannot expect people to ask us as their elected representatives to make decisions affecting their job and retirement security when we ourselves are insulated from the effects of these decisions. As we reform the Australian economy to cope with the demands of an ageing population, how can we ask the Australian people to invest in their own retirement when we are unwilling to do so ourselves? The Australian people are disillusioned with our political system and we need to adopt higher ethical standards if we are to restore their faith in our democracy. I want the Australian people to be able to look at their democratic system and representatives with pride and goodwill, and this legislation is an important step in that direction. We need to rekindle the high ideals of community service. Those of us elected to public office have been given a great honour and privilege well beyond any material benefit, well beyond any improvement in our living standards—that is, the honour and satisfaction that come from representing people and from helping other citizens.</para>
					<para>I have always believed that the best life is one lived in the service of others. It is the community service that is all-important. This is why, notwithstanding the current cynicism about politics, we should be proud to call ourselves politicians. The task is not to change our vocation but to change the way in which we represent and present our work to the public. A good starting point is austerity in high office—bringing our parliamentary entitlements closer to community standards. In terms of personal finances and lifestyle, I believe that members of parliament should have a clear affinity with the constituencies they represent. Until our superannuation scheme is comparable to that of the majority of Australians, this is very difficult indeed.</para>
					<para>There are, of course, other important reforms we can take to rebuild trust in our democracy, including returning Kirribilli House to public use and giving the Prime Minister just one piece of public housing—the Lodge here in Canberra; establishing an independent auditor of parliamentary allowances and entitlements to investigate breaches of the entitlements guidelines; imposing a 12- month ban on former ministers taking up paid employment and consultancies with companies in areas relevant to their responsibilities as ministers; requiring all government advertising to meet strict Auditor- General guidelines to stop taxpayers' funds being used for blatant political purposes and election advertising; legislating to require the registration of lobbyists so that special interests cannot cut secret deals at the expense of ordinary Australians; holding regular community cabinets around the country—something we will be doing in government after the next election; and giving the Australian people a greater say in whether we become a republic, indeed giving them a much bigger say about all the issues of great national importance and national identity.</para>
					<para>The current parliamentary super scheme was never intended by its creator, Ben Chifley, who never saw a cent of his own superannuation, to be as generous as it has become. It was created in a different era, when members entered parliament at an older age, could expect shorter lives and had fewer prospects of professional employment after they were voted out of the parliament or they retired. Today, parliamentarians enter parliament younger, often with professional qualifications. On leaving parliament, many former members are snapped up by both private industry and the public sector for consultancies. Others easily re-enter their former professions. They are more likely to own assets to help them in their retirement, in any case. Few are left with limited means or work opportunities. You can return to the law at age 50 far more easily than you could return to driving a train at the same age in Chifley’s time. Consequently, the public cynicism about the generosity of the existing scheme is quite understandable.</para>
					<para>A new model for a new scheme already exists. It is the model available to the majority of Australians and the one I proposed on 10 February on behalf of the Labor Party. Under these bills the current scheme will be closed to new members, consistent with existing practice for the rest of the community for defined benefits funds. By avoiding retrospectivity in any way, the Commonwealth will be spared liabilities to substantial financial compensation. New members and senators will instead receive the same nine per cent super guarantee payment as every other Australian employee, to be paid into an accumulation scheme. This brings parliamentary super to the same level as the rest of the community. It has the full support of the Labor Party.</para>
					<para>However, under these bills senior officeholders, including the Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, Treasurer, Senate leader, Leader of the House, Speaker and Senate President will still receive too much. The Prime Minister, for instance, despite his capacity to earn substantial private income out of the parliament after the next election, can expect to retire with an annual payment of up to $200,000. I regard this as an excessive amount—up to $200,000 per annum. Labor is, therefore, moving an amendment to cap the amount of allowances used to calculate the entitlements of officeholders to the level of a cabinet minister. The loading for the Prime Minister will be cut from its present level of 160 per cent to 72.5 per cent. If the Australian people were to elect me as Prime Minister, depending on how long we stay in government and how long I stay alive, this means a superannuation sacrifice on my part of between $500,000 and $1.9 million. It is a big amount of money but I believe this sacrifice is worth it. It must be taken if we are to meet the greater good of re-establishing trust and confidence in our political system, starting at the top. I am absolutely determined to bring the office of the Prime Minister back into line with community expectations in the future. As I mentioned earlier on, the member for Kingston will be moving the relevant amendments in detail at committee stage.</para>
					<para>Mr Deputy Speaker, when I became Labor leader I said that I wanted to be constructive. I said I would not be here exercising opposition for opposition’s sake. So far this approach has had quite a positive effect on the parliament and, in the case of this legislation, a positive impact on the government. Alreadymy proposal to reform the parliamentary super scheme is being made law. I congratulate the government for joining us, even if it has done it to save its own political hide rather than on the principle of improving our democracy. I urge the government to go even further and support our amendment to cap the retirement benefits of the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and others. But I also say that, if it is good enough for the government to adopt Labor policy on parliamentary super— and we noted that in the budget they have adopted our policy for the baby care payment— it is good enough to support other Labor policy in other areas.</para>
					<para>Therefore, I conclude with the challenge to the Prime Minister and his government to introduce legislation to create 20,000 extra university places and 20,000 extra TAFE places without increasing student fees and debt; to introduce legislation to save bulkbilling and Medicare; to introduce legislation for a national dental scheme, so overdue and desperately needed by senior citizens around this country. I challenge them to introduce legislation and funding for a reading program for our infant children and needs based funding for their schools; to introduce legislation and funding to provide mentoring for our young people; to introduce provisions to cut the superannuation contributions tax and provisions to establish a River Bank to save the Murray-Darling and to sign the Kyoto protocol. The government may be out of ideas, but Labor is not. The government may be out of time, but Labor's time is just beginning and this legislation is proof positive of this exciting proposition.</para>

							<para>—The reality is that they were a fabrication and, subsequent to this debate, I will be asking for a personal explanation with regard to them. I will not withdraw the statement that they are a fabrication because they are a fabrication. That is a statement of fact. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline> I am grateful that the Labor Party has given more members the opportunity to come into the House to learn about the absolute hypocrisy of their policy in this regard. I am also pleased that the galleries are full, because we heard the Leader of the Opposition in this chamber speak about the way in which he was so pleased to be able to offer a $1.5 million benefit back to the Australian taxpayers if only we would agree to the Labor Party’s amendments to this bill. But what is the reality? We hear the Leader of the Opposition say: 'Why won’t they please put more money into HECS? Why won’t they please put more money into the national dental scheme?' With his bleeding heart, the Leader of the Opposition spoke about the need to save Medicare, introduce a reading program and establish a riverbank—all these grand claims from the Leader of the Opposition about his $1.5 million policy.</para>
						</talk.start>
					</continue>					
					<para>But what is the reality? The reality is that the Labor Party is siphoning off $27 million a year from Australian taxpayers through Centenary House. This is from the Leader of the Opposition, who comes in to this House and acts as if he has principles. This is from the Australian Labor Party, which claims to be standing up for the bona fides of public life. This is from the Leader of the Opposition, who stands in this chamber and preaches from on high that he is about principles and that the Australian Labor Party has a vision for the future. I know that no people in the electorate that I represent on the Gold Coast and no ordinary, decent, hardworking Australian who pay their taxes want any part of the Labor Party vision for the future of Australia. Its $27 million rent rort at Centenary's House completely exposes the hypocrisy that the Australian Labor Party brings into this House when the Leader of the Opposition attempts to portray himself as some new-found leader; a new person who has new ideas for Australia in the 21st century.</para>
					<para>The facts are that the Leader of the Opposition, in the conversation to which he referred in the courtyard, did not get a response from me about him 'blowing open the club' or my being concerned about entitlement or anything like that. That was a total and complete fabrication, as I have said before. The reality is that, as in the case of Centenary House, the Leader of the Opposition is not motivated by what is good for the Australian people. The Leader of the Opposition is concerned with one thing and one thing alone: by making amendments to this bill and getting them passed he believes there are a couple of votes in it for the Australian Labor Party. That is the reality behind the Leader of the Opposition's position with regard to this bill. That is the reality behind the Labor Party coming here with their two faces on this issue, pretending that they have concerns about principles and public life, and talking about honour and expectation. The reality is that the Australian Labor Party is morally bankrupt when it comes to these types of issues. The Australian Labor Party is not providing a path for the future. Rather, it is simply trying to create smoke and enough of a diversion about the real reason why the Leader of the Opposition would like his amendments passed.</para>
					<para>I put this challenge to the Leader of the Opposition: if you are serious about making a principled stand in public life, then end the rent rort in Centenary House now. Give that $27 million of hard-earned taxpayers' money back to the Australian public. We will make it even easier: I ask the Leader of the Opposition to reject the opportunity to increase the rental costs of Centenary House. Just that small start—</para>

						<para>—My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Why does the budget fail to provide tax relief for the four out of five Australian taxpayers earning less than $52,000 a year—the sales reps, the shop assistants, the technicians, the childcare workers, the teachers, the office workers; the backbone of the Australian economy? Prime Minister, aren't these the forgotten people? There are 8.5 million families and singles who miss out on tax relief. Why shouldn't these hardworking Australians have greater incentive and encouragement to work overtime, to help themselves and to grow the Australian economy?</para>

						<para>—The priorities of this budget were to help families and encourage people to work harder and better themselves. They are priorities that this government unapologetically asserts. The Leader of the Opposition cannot even get his facts right. The family benefits in this budget are the greatest family benefits delivered by any budget since World War II. The Leader of the Opposition gets up and says that hardworking families have missed out. Hardworking families with two children and who are entitled to family tax benefit A—and that is four out of five families—will be eligible within the next three months for $1,200 in additional family payments. They will be eligible for additional payments in relation to each child. We have deliberately decided to reward people who deserve to get some return if they work a bit harder.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>Does the Leader of the Opposition understand that in his own electorate of Werriwa there would be tens of thousands of male full-time earners, and 37 per cent of all male full-time earners in Australia now earn more than $52,000 a year? We regard it as unacceptable that those people should be bumped into a higher taxation bracket. I have quoted the example of the police sergeant who works a bit of overtime. According to some figures I have been given, it is not only the police sergeant; in fact, a senior constable in the New South Wales Police Force has an annual loaded salary of $54,033. According to the philosophy of the Labor Party, he is rich. That is according to the philosophy of the man who is meant to do something and who is meant to believe in encouraging people. We had a scale of priorities. The first priority was to fund necessary expenditure; the second priority was to provide family benefits; and the third priority was to give taxation relief that would encourage incentive and hard work. That is the basis of the decision that we have taken.</para>
					<para>The Leader of the Opposition, in his question about other taxpayers, completely ignores the fact that under the changes to the tax system introduced as part of taxation reform a person on $20,000 is now paying $12 a week less than they did prior to tax reform. Somebody on $30,000 is paying $20 a week less than they did before tax reform. Somebody on $45,000 is paying $44 a week less than they did before tax reform. That was a tax reform that the Leader of the Opposition—may I remind you, Mr Speaker—opposed. When we tried to bring in these taxation changes, the Leader of the Opposition voted against them. Now he comes into this place pleading the cause of a group of people that he tried to stop getting very, very generous tax cuts.</para>
					<para>I simply say to the Leader of the Opposition: yes, we chose to give relief to families. We are proud of that. This is the most family friendly budget Australia has ever seen. This is a budget that is seen to recognise the modern day realities of the Australian family. But it is also a budget that says to the people who want to better themselves, who are prepared to work harder, to do a bit of overtime, to strive to improve themselves: 'We're no longer going to clobber you with a tax rate of 42c in the dollar when you hit $52,000. What we are going to try to do in the good Australian way is to reward incentive, reward effort and give you a pat on the back for trying harder.'</para>

							<para>—Let it go on the record that the Australian Labor Party is opposed to the $600 per family being paid before 30 June. We do not think it is a bribe; we think it is justice for Australian families. These are the people who are raising children, paying for food and paying for shelter. These are the people who are paying for child care and education. This government believe that those people deserve assistance. Under the announcement that we made last night they will be eligible to receive a $600 per child benefit before 30 June. If it is a one-child family the benefit is $600; if it is a two-child family it is $1,200; and if it is a three-child family it is $1,800. This is per child. In addition to that there will be changes so that the ongoing increase of $600 in the family tax benefit part A will be on an annual basis. So, in relation to the 2003-04 year, upon their reconciliation they will be eligible for another $600, which would mean that within the first 12 months there is an eligibility for $1,200 per child.</para>
						</talk.start>

					<para>Before I finish talking about the benefits that families will receive—and there are 2.2 million families—I just want to pick up on one thing. The Leader of the Opposition repeated just now what the Labor Party has been saying all day. He said that there were 8.5 million families who did not receive anything. That is what he said and that is what Labor’s press release said last night:</para>
					<quote><para>There are 8.5 million forgotten Australian families who don’t receive a single cent …</para></quote>
					<para>I thought that was a funny figure, so I went to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Labor says 8.5 million families miss out. I tender the Census of Population and Housing for 2001, which found that in Australia there are only 4.9 million families.</para>

					<para>What the Leader of the Opposition I know finds very difficult to understand is that we have been able to deliver a magnificent budget because we have run the economy well. One of the proudest things that I know the Treasurer feels about this budget and I certainly feel about this budget is that, in very large measure, many of the significant benefits for families have been funded and made possible by the fact that corporate tax collections have soared. Those tax collections have not soared because we have increased the rate of corporate tax. In fact, we have reduced it. We cut Labor’s corporate tax rate from 36c in the dollar to 30c in the dollar. Because we have run a strong economy and because we laid the foundations of sound economic management in our 1996 budget, we have seen strong and steady growth. We have seen a confident corporate sector employing millions of Australians.</para>
					<para>We did not forget or overlook the 1.3 million Australians who have gained jobs since we have been in office. We have not neglected any Australian in delivering economic policies that have given us the lowest unemployment rate in a generation. For the first time since 1968, we now have the double of an inflation rate below three per cent and an unemployment rate below six per cent. It is no accident that we have paid off $70 billion of Labor's debt. And, by paying that off, we have $6 billion to $7 billion more a year that we can spend on defence, health, schools and family benefits. That is the human dividend of good economic management, and the Leader of the Opposition has got the gall to imply that we have forgotten middle Australia.</para>

						<para>—I thank the honourable member for Dobell for his question. I can inform the House that Australia in the next year will grow at 3½ per cent—a growth rate which is very solid and, more importantly, a growth rate which will be done on an inflation rate which is around two per cent. This is strong growth with low inflation, and the evidence is in the labour market. When the government was elected, unemployment was about 8.2 per cent and today it is 5.6 per cent—and 1,300 million new jobs have been created in Australia since this government was elected. If you have strong economic management, if you have growth and low inflation, if you balance your budgets, if you repay debt, if more people go into the work force and if companies are profitable, they will deliver to you revenues which can be used to help decent, ordinary, working Australian families. That is what this government was able to do in this budget.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>This was the seventh surplus budget of this government, and we have now reduced Labor’s debt from $96 billion in net terms to $26 billion. Economic management is not an accident. It is not a fluke. It is not something that you look up on the Google search engine and try and figure out on a daily basis. It requires continued, strategic, stable management. These kinds of budget outcomes start with stable economic management. A medium- term monetary policy, a medium-term fiscal policy, the broadening of the indirect tax base, the cutting of the company tax rate, the halving of the capital gains tax, the abolition of the taxes on our exports, the reforming of the labour market are the reforms that have been building economic management in Australia. Alas, these are the reforms that were opposed, hook, line and sinker, by the Australian Labor Party. The Australian Labor Party would have you believe it likes the outcome, but it opposes the work that gets you there. Mr Speaker, you do not have economic management by accident; it is sustained. It has to be kept up over the years. It has been kept up over the years by this government— and it will continue into the future.</para>

							<para>—I want to make two further points. The first is that over the course of this government's tax reform process we have cut taxes substantially for lower- and middle-income earners. When we came to office, people on middle incomes were paying 34c and 43c, and we cut that to 30c. People on lower incomes of $20,000 were paying 20c, and we cut that to 17c. But that part of our tax reform structural adjustment package, which applied to middle-income earners, never cleared the Senate, because it was opposed by the Australian Labor Party. That was the part that we went to the election and promised the Australian people about and were never able to deliver. Now we return to that part, and we deliver it to the middle- income earners of Australia. Let me refer to page 7 of the book, <inline font-style="italic">More Help for Families</inline>.</para>

							<para>—I will come to that in a moment too. What is the overall effect of these tax changes? It is this: that taxpayers earning $20,000 have had a 23 per cent tax reduction; taxpayers earning $50,000 have had a 21 per cent reduction; and taxpayers on $90,000 have had an 18 per cent tax reduction. So we are actually delivering more to the lower income end than we are to the upper end.</para>
						</talk.start>
					</continue>
					<para>I do want to come back to the last part of the question, because the honourable member for Hotham, I think, said that it was unfair that somebody like me would get a tax cut. I think that is what he said in his question. I do actually want to refer to a transcript from the Howard Sattler program of an interview with the Leader of the Opposition today. Sattler asked: 'Have you worked out with Mrs Latham over the phone at least how much more money Peter Costello is going to give you?' Latham replied: 'I don't think we get anything.' Sattler said: 'There must be something.' The transcript then says, 'We’re part of the 60 per cent of the country that has been forgotten in this budget.'</para>
					<para>I do not know what a Leader of the Opposition is paid, but a Leader of the Opposition, the last time I looked, was paid more than $52,000. So let us just round the circle here: the member for Hotham, the great opportunist, wants to complain that members of parliament are getting tax cuts; his leader is complaining that members of parliament are not getting tax cuts—out there on the Sattler program. It was not entirely an accurate answer— nor was it entirely accurate, as he said earlier, to say that 8.5 million Australian families missed out, when there are only 4.9 million families in Australia. It is a consistent pattern in relation to the way in which policy is being conducted, and I have said before that, even if the Australian Labor Party does not know what their policy is, I do. I read it and I take a great deal of interest in it. Mr Speaker, I table the transcript of the interview with Mark Latham on Perth radio 6PR, Wednesday, 12 May 2004.</para>

						<para>—As I said earlier, from 2000 on, when this government put forward a tax plan to reform income tax assistance, we were able to deliver a cut to low-income earners of their marginal rate, from 20c to 17c. For middle-income earners, who were then on 30c and 43c brackets, we were able to deliver a reduction in their tax rates—to 30 per cent. The third leg of what we put forward in 2000 was for those who were above that rate to have a pushed-out threshold so that average earners were not kicked into the top marginal tax rate.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>That was the leg that never cleared the Senate, because the Australian Labor Party voted against it; that was the unfinished business in relation to the structural reform of the Australian taxation system; and that is the business that we have delivered on in this budget—and we have done it in conjunction with delivering to families, many of whom pay no tax at all and therefore would receive no benefit from an income tax cut. And after these changes have been put in place the effect of those income tax cuts will be that those who are lower income earners will still have received the greatest proportion of income tax reduction since 2000.</para>
				</answer>				
				<para>Why do we do this? The first reason we do it is that people who are on average earnings should not face a marginal tax rate of 47c in the dollar. If you want your senior constable or your fire officer to work harder—to go for a promotion or to do some overtime—you cannot expect those people to be paying 47c in the dollar on each additional dollar that they earn. They are not the high-income earners in our society, and so, as a matter of incentive and justice, we want to move that threshold. The second reason is that Australia has to stay internationally competitive. We look around the world at other countries. They are not bringing their top tax rates in at a level like $62,500. Some of them do not bring them in until well over $100,000. That is why we have to move those rates, to stay internationally competitive. The third reason is that this is the unfinished business, this is the part of the income tax restructure that never went through in the year 2000—and for many of the people who are now getting justice it is the part that they have been denied for the last four years, since the other income tax reductions were introduced. So we say to the Australian Labor Party and to the Senate: 'Let's get on with this business. We're introducing these tax bills tomorrow. Let's pass them. Let's make sure that that incentive returns to the Australian taxation system from 1 July of this year.'</para>

						<para>—A hardworking teacher on $48,000 who is part of a family will be delivered $600 per child. They will be delivered $1,200 for two children. If that hardworking teacher’s household has a second income earner working part-time, there will be an additional benefit under the family tax payment part B which will deliver a hardworking teacher on $48,000 with two children around $50 a week in additional family assistance. In addition to that, every Australian—including that hardworking teacher—is entitled to a bonus of 150 per cent of any money which they set aside for retirement savings. That hardworking teacher, under the Australian Labor Party, if they made a contribution into superannuation of $100, would get nothing. That is the Australian Labor Party policy. But under the measures which I announced last night that hardworking teacher earning $48,000 who wanted to put $100 into their superannuation would get from the government as a cocontribution $150. That is $250 into their superannuation as a benefit for increasing retirement savings.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>There are many hardworking teachers who will get the advantage of what the government introduced with the new safety net in relation to their medical bills, when their children get bulk-billing because they are under 16 or when their non-hospital costs go above $300 and they get an 80 per cent rebate. Many of those hardworking teachers have parents—parents who are looking for aged care. A $2.2 billion injection into aged care will be a big part of it. But the Minister for Education, Science and Training would not let me go without saying this: that hardworking teacher will also see as a consequence of this budget another $8 billion delivered into the education system of this country. That is what they will also see: an investment which will see the Commonwealth increase its commitment to education.</para>
					<para>The last point I want to make—because we feel rather strongly about it on this side of the House—is this: that hard-working teacher will have their wages in the government system paid by a state government, and those wages will be funded entirely by the GST because the GST funds the salary of every teacher in every school in every classroom in Australia. The eight Labor governments which are now sharing the benefit of that are all in a bonus position.</para>

						<para>—First, I thank the honourable member for her question and for the interest she shows in regional security. One of the themes of the budget last night was the importance of reinforcing the security of our country at a time when we are subjected to the threat of international terrorism and broader international instability. This is a budget that protects Australians and protects Australia’s interests.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>One of the keys to our success in the war against terrorism is our intelligence community. I would like to take the opportunity, in answer to the question, of saying to the House that this is a government that takes great pride in the performance of our intelligence agencies. We think our intelligence agencies do an excellent job. I regret that the Labor Party frequently attacks them, because these are agencies made up of good and honourable people.</para>
					<para>In this budget we provide an additional $50 million over a four-year period for the Australian Secret Intelligence Service to enhance ASIS’s counter-terrorism capabilities. As a result of this spending there will have been a 138 per cent increase in funding for ASIS since this government came to office. The previous government thought they could take a peace dividend at the end of the Cold War—a Cold War won, by the way, by the United States—and they ran down our intelligence agencies, including ASIS. We have been rebuilding those intelligence agencies, and in this budget the funding for ASIS increases very substantially.</para>
					<para>Equally, with the Pacific, this budget focuses very strongly on increasing Australia's support for our near neighbours in the South Pacific. Overall, this budget provides for a doubling of funding for Pacific island countries. Obviously, there is a very substantial emphasis on increasing support for Papua New Guinea as a result of the enhanced cooperation program agreed between Australia and Papua New Guinea in December of last year and, equally, a very strong commitment to the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands. Obviously, first and foremost this support for the Pacific is important for the peoples of the Pacific themselves, but it is important to Australia because, in terms of our own interests, stable neighbours are important to our own security and the security of our people.</para>
					<para>This enormous commitment to the Pacific is the greatest commitment by any Australian government to the Pacific since 1975—since Papua New Guinea's independence. I hear that, if the Labor Party wins the next election and the member for Hotham becomes the Treasurer, the Labor government will appoint a deputy minister for foreign affairs responsible for the Pacific. They will downgrade responsibility for the Pacific to a junior minister and take it away from the foreign minister. This government is doubling support in our budget for the Pacific, reinforcing our commitment to that region, to our friends and neighbours in the South Pacific, to enhance the stability and the strength of those countries.</para>

						<para>—My question without notice is directed to the Prime Minister, and it relates to the tables presented in last night's budget. Prime Minister, is it the case that these tables do not show the actual gain in weekly disposable income that families will experience after 1 July this year? Is it the case that, for a dual income family with two children—one under five—on $65,000 a year, the claimed weekly gain of $36.97 per week will translate into an actual zero increase in their weekly family income each week from 1 July? Isn't the Prime Minister just up to his old tricks again?</para>

						<para>—I thank the honourable member for his question. I can say at the outset that the people of regional Australia under this government are not the forgotten people. I point in the first instance to the fact that country people like stability, certainty and decent economic management. They do not want wild enthusiasm and wild experiments from the son of Whitlam and his team over there. I would also note that the Treasurer is interested that country people by and large like large families. So they welcome the family package aspects of it as well.</para>

					<para>Each year we publish what we call our little blue book. This year it is available again: <inline font-style="italic">Regional partnerships for growth and security</inline>, a statement by me, Senator Ian Campbell and De-Anne Kelly, my parliamentary secretary. This book runs to some 93 pages and contains initiative after initiative, both ongoing and new. Indeed, if you simply turn to the overview, you see a pretty impressive list. There is the sugar package that the Prime Minister referred to yesterday. There is AusLink, which, when you add in the money that has been pre-announced for the Australian Rail Track Corporation for rail reconstruction—some $872 million—means that over the next five years we will be oversighting of the order of $12.3 billion for roads and rail in Australia, which is around a 35 per cent increase over recent years on an annualised basis.</para>
					<para>Our Regional Partnerships Program will see a boost in funding of around $80 million, which will take it to over $300 million. The Sustainable Regions Program and regional plans will continue. The CAP—Country Areas Program—which is extraordinarily important particularly in remote parts of the country, will receive $26 million for schools: $22 million for state schools and $4 million for Catholic and independent schools. There will be extra funding for regional universities— that is very important indeed.</para>
					<para>There is further money for aviation security and airport security in regional Australia. Substantial resources will go to immigration and migrant programs designed to help migrants settle in rural areas. There is $830 million to continue the rural health strategy, putting back doctors and allied health care people we could not get in regional Australia because the Labor Party did not train any for 13 years. For the Higher Bandwidth Incentive Scheme, $107.8 million is now starting to flow. Just last week, in north-west New South Wales, we launched CDMA 1X. CDMA was the replacement mobile phone service we put in. There is more funding in this budget to roll out even more CDMA, but now that technology will give broadband to anyone who has access to it. You can sit out in the middle of a paddock or a highway in the middle of nowhere and, if you have CDMA coverage, you can get broadband.</para>
					<para>Over and above that, there are some extras. There is $54 million extra for the ABC to continue its regional and local programming. The WET reforms, which are very welcome—around $350 million—mean that 90 per cent of Australia's wine producers will, effectively, not pay any wine equalisation tax, and that has been very widely welcomed. There is no doubt about it, we can say with total confidence that regional Australia know that they are in no sense of the word the forgotten people under this coalition.</para>

Does the Prime Minister recall telling Laurie Oakes on the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday</inline> program on 1 July 2001 that the $1,000 family benefit debt offset was: 'Just for a transitional year.

Whilst I will go away and check the record, as I always do not only with the member for Lilley but with many others on the frontbench, my recollection is that what we did in 2001 was not to provide a tax offset in relation to the debts but, in fact, to write the debts off, which is an entirely different thing.</para>

						<para>—I thank the member for Makin for her question, and I also thank her for her total commitment to Australia's Medicare system. I can assure her that last night's budget demonstrates that Medicare is safe with the Howard government. The figures tell the story. The figures prove that this government is the best friend that Medicare has ever had. Federal health spending since 1996 has doubled. Since 1996 health spending has increased from 14 per cent to 20 per cent of the federal budget. Since 1996 federal health spending has increased from 3.7 per cent to 4.3 per cent of Australia's GDP, and we can afford to spend money on health because of the good economic management of the Treasurer and the Prime Minister.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>Last night's budget builds on the MedicarePlus package that was announced last November and strengthened in March. MedicarePlus was a $2.9 billion investment in Medicare. It was a $2.9 billion investment in structural improvements to the Medicare system, including a brand new safety net to ensure that 500,000 Australians have protections that they have never had before. For the first time, allied health professionals such as physiotherapists and psychologists are included in the Medicare system.</para>
					<para>Last night's budget was a further investment in health security—health security for our nation and health security for some of the most vulnerable people in our society. There is $114 million to build up the antiviral stockpile in the event of a new influenza pandemic and $40 million to enhance Australia's medical preparedness to meet any emergency or contingency. There is more money for profoundly deaf children and more money for a range of insulin-dependent diabetics. There is money for the first time for people who suffer from Fabry's disease and $40 million more to enhance the health of Indigenous people on top of the 100 per cent real increase in Indigenous-specific health funding since 1996. This government is totally committed to Medicare. Medicare is an article of faith with this government. We cannot make our health system perfect because nothing is perfect this side of eternity. But what we can do is continue to ensure that our system is the best health system in the world.</para>

						<para>—My question without notice is directed to the Prime Minister. It relates to the new $600 end-of-year debt offset in last night's budget. Prime Minister, is it the case that this payment has been designed to be delivered at the end of the year rather than fortnightly because it will be used to offset family benefit debts? Is it the case that one in three families may never see the $600 payment because it will be directly clawed back by the $900 average family benefit debt?

						<para>—I would like to thank the member for Lilley and let every member in this House know what the member for Lilley is saying to all families that get family tax benefit A. When you take into account the one-off payment before 30 June for each child, the additional entitlement is $1,200 a child. The member for Lilley is calling this a bandaid bribe! I thank the member for Lilley for providing us with some information to go in those letters that, from time to time, we write to our constituents. The member for Lilley is so out of touch with the aspirations and needs of Australian families that he contemptuously refers to this as a bandaid bribe. It is a measure of his concern about the relevance of this assistance that he should lapse into such absurd descriptions.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>The reality is that there will be a $600 one-off payment completely unrelated to any overpayments—the net $600, which will occur annually. I happen to believe and the government believes that it is a good idea to add to the family tax benefit A system, which is now available fortnightly if people want it. The idea of having a lump sum will be welcomed by Australian families. Many Australian families welcome that as a means, in a sense, of compulsory saving. But through the year they have this very generous fortnightly payment which meets the recurrent expenses and at the end of the year that additional $600 is available—obviously, as the Treasurer said last night, subject to any reconciliation— for additional items. It is a generous addition, it is far ahead of anything the Australian Labor Party expected us to offer and that is why the member for Lilley is indulging in such absurd rhetoric.</para>

						<para>—I thank the honourable member for Patterson for his question, because I know of his personal and ongoing interest in the domestic security of the Australian people. He recognises, as most members of the parliament either understand clearly or should recognise, that the most fundamental right that any citizen enjoys is the right to live in safety and security. The threat that is posed by international terrorism is of a substantial character and one which any government has to give an absolute priority to addressing.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>Our response to the changed circumstances has meant that we have significantly better laws to deal with terrorists and to catch them before they have a chance to commit crime in Australia. We have stronger terrorism-fighting agencies, with the tools and support that they need, to deal with this threat to our community. We have very close international cooperation, because the war on terrorism is not a battle which any one country can fight alone. Since September 11, 2001, the date of the tragic attacks on the United States, this government has committed over $2.3 billion over five years to enhance over 100 different measures to better secure Australia. Last night, we again delivered in relation to that, committing an extra $754.5 million to fund additional national security measures over the period of the forward estimates.</para>
					<para>Australia's intelligence agencies stand at the front line of our security effort to protect the Australian community. The government has allocated to ASIO in particular over that four-year period an additional $131.4 million. This will enhance its operational, analytical and technical capacities as well as strengthening border control measures and regional capacity building. ASIO's current staff numbers around 785 people and has reached the levels that we last saw at the time of the Cold War. Over the next three years, it is estimated that those staff levels will increase by a further 200 officers, representing a total increase in staffing of 79 per cent since September 11, 2001.</para>
					<para>With this increased staffing that we have implemented over time, we now have the National Threat Assessment Centre, operational 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The Prime Minister opened it two weeks ago. It is a very important initiative of this government. We have also allocated $50.2 million over four years to nine agencies to enhance critical infrastructure participation and protection. My department is the lead agency in relation to those matters. The government does take a leadership role in these matters, working with the private sector, the states and the territories to improve protection of critical infrastructure.</para>
					<para>Our approach is very different to what I have seen elsewhere. I notice that the Australian Labor Party wants to trash the very effective arrangements that we have in place. It talks about introducing a coastguard and establishing a department of homeland security— arrangements that might suit the United States but which have no justification in the Australian context. The only argument you might have in relation to a department of homeland security would be if our agencies were operating in silos, as has been seen elsewhere. That has never been the case, and if you look at the advice that was given by the Director-General of ASIO, Dennis Richardson, to the Senate in February, he said:</para>
					<quote><para>The connectivity between Australian border agencies is probably the best in the world. It is quite unusual for counterpart organisations globally to be able to check that directly from their desktop, and we can.</para></quote>
					<para>That interoperability is part of our first line of defence. It is one which Labor would want to weaken by simply changing the signs, rebadging, reorganising and distracting people from the important task of dealing with the terrorist risk that we face. This government is about getting on with the job of protecting the Australian community.</para>

Can the Treasurer confirm that he said earlier that a teacher on $48,000 would get a 150 per cent co-contribution on voluntary superannuation contributions? Isn't this wrong because, under the budget initiative that you brought down, the benefit begins to phase out at $28,000 and the teacher, rather than getting a 150 per cent co-contribution, only gets a 50 per cent contribution?

The maximum that they can contribute phases out but, whatever their contribution, they get 150 per cent. So, as I said, if you put in $100 you get $150, if you put in $500 you get $750 and if you are eligible to put in $1,000 you get $1,500. So it was right what I said, and I can confirm it.

The table shows that every state is in a net benefit position, including New South Wales, which will be in a net benefit position of $113.7 million in 2004-05.</para>

						<para>—I thank the member for Robertson for his question. I know that older Australians and their families in his electorate—and, indeed, older Australians and their families across Australia— will welcome the fact that, through the economic management of this government and its successive surplus budgets, this government is able to invest a further $2.2 billion into the aged care needs of older Australians. On top of the record levels of funding and record allocations of aged care places, we have ensured that through this budget older Australians will continue to receive highquality, accessible and affordable care that meets their individual needs. Specifically, we have allocated more places in community and residential care. Some 27,900 new places will be allocated over the next three years. The member for Robertson will be interested to know that 8,575 places in New South Wales alone will be allocated over the next three years—in fact, some 4,125 in New South Wales in this 2004 year—making a total of 13,030 new places for older Australians across our nation.</para>

This means that the current average subsidy of $30,500 per resident will increase to some $35,380 within the next four years. We have also ensured that nearly $1 billion of increased capital funding will be made available to the sector to ensure that they can refurbish, upgrade and meet the capital requirements of the sector. This will include $513.3 million to be paid to the aged care sector by 30 June this year; that is $3,500 per resident—funding that will go towards better accommodation and meeting the accommodation needs of our older Australians. We have also concentrated on the work force to ensure that there is an opportunity for training and career paths in aged care—a $101.4 million package for aged care nursing in addition to the training places and scholarships that are already available— to ensure that we not only attract but retain quality aged care staff.</para>
					<para>There are a range of initiatives in the aged care budget that support this $2.2 billion investment on top of the funding of $6 billion that this government has currently made. It means that from today until 2008 this government will invest $30 billion into the aged care needs of older Australians.</para>
					<para>I am asked about an alternative policy. I am afraid I can confirm that there is none. The opposition have no policies, no plans and no vision for the care needs of older Australia. I am proud that this government is ensuring that older Australians receive the right care at the right time and in the right place—for this government cares about older Australians.</para>

						<para>—I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question. In relation to the pneumococcal vaccine, the government continues to subsidise it for people at high risk. That is, all Indigenous children and children with medical risk factors can access free vaccine under the National Immunisation Program, and adults aged 65 years and over and those with high medical risk can access the adult vaccine on prescription by their GP, subsidised by the government through the MBS and the PBS—and we continue to review the remaining recommendations made by the Australian Technical Group.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>But could I just point out to the House that it is very interesting that the Leader of the Opposition is raising questions about immunisation. Could I remind him that immunisation rates were as low as 53 per cent in 1989-90—and I do not think we were in government in 1989-90—for children at 12 months of age. In 1989-90 immunisation rates in this country were as low as 53 per cent for children at 12 months of age. That was a national disgrace.</para>
					<para>Under Labor, the immunisation rates of this country had fallen to Third World levels, and it took the work of former health minister Michael Wooldridge, as a member of the Howard government, to bring those levels back to acceptable standards for a modern society. Since the introduction of the Howard government's Immunise Australia Program, childhood immunisation coverage rates have increased to an all-time high, with over 90 per cent of children at 12 months of age being fully immunised. We have gone from 53 per cent under Labor to 90 per cent now. We are not talking here about adults; we are talking about children at 12 months of age. That is our record on immunisation. The Labor Party ought to be permanently ashamed of how it neglected the immunisation of children when it was last in government.</para>

						<para>—I thank the member for Blair. I know his family is making its own contribution to Australian children. Last night was a terrific night for families and particularly for young children. Indeed, with the announcements we made, an additional $251 million went to child care. That builds on the $8 billion that we have now committed over the next four years and specifically targets outside school hours care and family day care. Indeed, $97.1 million goes to 30,000 new outside school hours care places. Of course, we also made an announcement at the end of last year of 10,000 places. So that is 40,000 places, and I have been advised that that will eliminate all the unmet demand that we have for outside school hours care across Australia.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>Last night we also announced 1,500 more places for family day care, which was in addition to the 2,500 places that we announced at the end of last year. I have also been advised by my department that that will effectively remove all the unmet demand in family day care. There is also the commitment, for those parents who perhaps want to stay at home, of thousands of places in playgroups. The other area where we are putting more money into child care is called the Child Care Support program. It is very important, and it underpins a lot of the accessibility to child care and the maintaining of quality. Part of that is the long day care incentive scheme, where we want to try and encourage long day private care or child care in outer metropolitan and rural areas where there is unmet demand.</para>
					<para>When you look at the child-care benefit, the average payment is $2,000 per family. When you look at the family tax benefits that will be coming through, average families with two children will receive $1,200 before the end of the year and another $1,200 when they reconcile. There is no doubt that this is a wonderful budget. I would like to quote the peak children’s services organisation Early Childhood Australia, whose spokesperson said:</para>
					<quote>
						<para>Taken together, the maternity payment, the changes to other family payments and the gains in child care places make this budget the best one for children and families in many, many years …</para>
					</quote>
					<para>The fact is that this government is absolutely committed to looking after children and parents. If you really want to help children you have to help parents, and if you help parents you help families, and if you help families you build stronger communities—and that is what this budget and government are all about.</para>

Regional Australia would include the 90 per cent of Australia's winegrowers that are exempted from the wine equalisation tax. Regional and remote Australia would include those rural and remote councils that have received funding under the Roads to Recovery package to build their local roads and fix their black spots—and there is also their drought relief. If anyone else wants to add any measures, I am open to offers.</para>

						<para>—I would like to acknowledge the great work that the member for Dunkley does in contributing to the government's environment programs. Last night's budget confirmed two things. One is that good economic management leading to wealth creation puts Australia in a position where it can increase funding for national environment programs. The second thing that the budget confirmed last night is that this government is doing more to protect and repair the environment in Australia than any previous government in Australia’s history has done. In this coming year, the Howard government's spending on the environment will rise by some 20 per cent to $2.4 billion a year, which is by far the largest commitment that any Australian government has ever made to the protection and conservation of our environment.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>The great success of this government in repairing the environment has been the partnerships that the government has established with local communities in the task of environmental repair. Since 1996 some 420,000 Australians from all walks of life have been involved in environmental repair funded under the Natural Heritage Trust. This budget commits another $300 million to the Natural Heritage Trust, which will fuel the biggest environmental effort in our history. It will allow regional communities to plan ahead and to have confidence that they will continue to be funded in the main priorities of environmental repair. On top of this, the budget has provided another $80 million to Landcare, which is one of the key programs for mobilising volunteers in environmental repair and resource management in regional and rural Australia. In fact, in the coming year, the expenditure under the NHT and the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality will be almost $100 million more than it was last year.</para>
					<para>It is quite clear that the Labor Party does not like the Natural Heritage Trust. In a press release on Monday, the shadow minister attacked the Natural Heritage Trust as ineffective. He said there should be no more money for the Natural Heritage Trust. It is now quite clear that if the Labor Party ever came to government it would abolish—wind up—the Natural Heritage Trust. It would put an end to the community based environmental repair programs that this government has funded, and replace them with centralised bureaucratic programs of the kind that Labor put in place in the past.</para>
					<para>On 1 July, the historic enhancement of the protection of the Great Barrier Reef comes into effect. The budget provides $174.6 million over the next four years for the protection of Australia's greatest natural icon—an increase of $20 million. The budget also records the fact that this government takes climate change very seriously. The budget provides an additional $70 million for climate change programs to abate greenhouse gases in this country. This government has now committed over $1 billion to greenhouse gas abatement and has made Australia a world leader in this area. In short, for the environment, this is the best budget that any Australian government has brought down, and it is the dividend of the outstanding economic management of the Howard government.</para>

						<para>—Yesterday the member for Chifley asked me a question regarding the development of a park and sporting complex at the former ADI site in St Marys. I have sought advice on this matter. The government gave detailed consideration to the land use issues, including the development of a recreation park at the St Marys site, in the context of the ComLand scoping study, which was announced in the 2002-03 budget and completed in March 2003. As a consequence, Lend Lease, which is the developer, has undertaken to develop a 100-hectare park and sporting precinct at St Marys, under the ComLand share sale agreement executed on 22 January 2004. While the terms of the sale agreement contain information that is commercially sensitive, I can confirm that the facility will be funded and provided by Lend Lease.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>Subject to planning approval of the specific facilities to be included in the recreation park, it is intended that the park will include outdoor playing fields; a synthetic allweather field; tennis, netball and basketball courts; cycleways; walking trails; and picnic and barbecue areas. I point out to the House that this is entirely consistent with the announcement I made in the presence of the member for Lindsay on 20 February 2004. I have written to the honourable member for Chifley, and I have copied my response to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister—the member for Lindsay—and to the Minister for Finance and Administration.</para>

						<para>—This is a budget of wasted opportunity and of dashed expectations. We went into this budget knowing that this government—a government awash with tax—had accumulated huge surpluses. As a consequence of that there were enormously high expectations that there would be a return to all Australians in the budget. But the fact of the matter is that 8.5 million families and singles did not get a cent by way of tax cut from this budget. Understand the context of this: this is a budget that hands out $15 billion in tax cuts alone, yet four in five people in Australia miss out—a $52 billion budget spend over the next four years and the government could not find a cent by way of tax cuts for families earning below $52,000. This makes the milkshake and sandwich tax cut of last year look like a veritable feast. That is what the government have done.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>This government, the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, every cabinet minister—every member of parliament, for that matter—will get $42 a week by way of a tax cut, but those 8½ million families and singles will get zero. That is just not fair, and in the circumstances— a budget awash with money from a record taxing government—they deserved more. They should have got more but they did not get more, and that is why there are many families who are so disappointed in this country today. True, there are aspects of the budget that will provide benefits, but with $52 billion you would have to be able to do something right. The trouble is that the government did not do enough that was right.</para>
					<para>Let us understand it, because the Treasurer was trying to make some play before about what the Australian Bureau of Statistics says constitutes families. What we are talking about here is the breakdown of 10.7 million families and singles in the country. That is what the Bureau of Statistics talks about—10.7 million families and singles. Under this budget, 8.5 million of them get no tax cuts whatsoever, and six million of them not only do not get a tax cut but also do not get anything by way of benefit under the family benefits it contains.</para>
					<para>True, there are benefits for the difference, for two million families, but even within those two million families 600,000 of them may never see a cent. Why is that? It is because these are the families that have been caught in a debt trap of the Prime Minister’s and the Treasurer's making—a debt trap created more than three years ago which they have still not remedied; a debt trap which, going into the last election, they were required to buy their way out of with a $1,000 waiver. We were told by the Prime Minister we would never have to do it again, because they had fixed the problem. They have not fixed the problem. That is why in last night's budget they had to compensate again, with two lots of $600—one before 30 June and the other some months later. That is $1,200—for what? It is compensation for not fixing the problem but there is no provision for a lasting solution. So what have we got? Another fix. When? Just before an election, to buy their way out of trouble, but with nothing committed to fix the problem.</para>
					<para>So here we have a government that promised to govern for all of us, and they have left four out of five people with nothing in the way of a tax cut and three out of five with nothing whatsoever. That is not governing for all of us; that is leaving many of us well behind, leaving many of us with nothing at all—not the people who sit in this place, who will get their $42 a week tax cut, but the people that this government claim to represent and to whom they have given nothing. That is why this budget is so unfair.</para>
					<para>I said before that there are some good aspects of the budget. This $52 billion spend—the biggest spend by any government in any budget ever, and just before an election— eclipses the $25 billion the government spent before the last election. It almost doubles it. You would think that with $52 billion you would be able to get some things right. They did. What they did get right was to copy Labor and introduce a baby care payment. That is what they did, and we congratulate them on it. It is a good policy. Labor set the agenda, and the government have followed, so we congratulate them on it.</para>
					<para>We also congratulate them for belatedly recognising that something has to be done for the aged care system. It is a system that under this government has been allowed to fall into rack and ruin. It is a system where Labor has consistently set the agenda and argued that reform needs to occur. The government need to be prepared to invest in the care and attention of our older people. We welcome what occurred last night but, again, it is no coincidence that it has happened. It did not happen over the seven years that we have been complaining about the problems but it happened just before the next election. Whilst we welcome what they have done, beware the nasties still to come, because they have not signed off their response to Hogan on nursing home bonds, for example. I guess we will not hear anything about that until well after the next election, were they to be elected. That is the trickiness of this government. They are trying to buy their way out of trouble just before an election, but you can never believe that these benefits are going to remain.</para>
					<para>We also welcome what they did in relation to those suffering from diabetes and the additional payments for carers. But the additional payment for carers, the $1,000, is a one-off payment. Again, miraculously, it is a one-off payment just before the next election. It is a payment that does not last. It is a one-off payment which the government are seeking to just add cynically in the exercise of looking like they are attending to the problem, but they are not doing it in a lasting way.</para>
					<para>There were high expectations of this budget. Particularly now that we know that the government had $52 billion to spend, we would have expected restoration of services, tax cuts and family benefits for all Australians, and some real reforms so that people who do hard work are rewarded for that effort. All of this could have been done in this budget. I made the point before that budgets are about choices, but the government continue to make the wrong choices. It could have been done in this budget. Why? Because it is true that we have had strong economic growth, not just while they have been in government but for 13 years. The combination of 13 years of strong economic growth and the consistently high participation rate, one which is about to peak, has given us an enormous opportunity to do something of a lasting nature to really address the intergenerational challenges of an ageing population—ensuring that they can live with dignity and ensuring that we as a nation invest in our education, our skills and our research and development. But what did we have? We had a government that responded in a cynical way and rolled in the money from the tax take that they reefed off the Australian public.</para>
					<para>It is interesting that, even with the tax cuts in this budget, the budget papers still confirm that the Howard government are the highest taxing government in Australian history. Even with the tax cuts they are the highest taxing government in Australian history. The income tax cuts that the government have given do not give back bracket creep. In none of the four years in question is bracket creep given back.</para>

							<para>—it is true, Mr Treasurer— than when the Howard government came to office. By the end of the forward estimates Australians will be paying $12,000 more. Rolling in the money. But what have the government done? They have run down the services as well as taking the tax out of people’s pockets. The other night they were telling us that everyone was going to get tax cuts. This is the old argument: give with one hand, take with the other. Just think about it. The people who actually get something out of this budget are finding that under this government they are an extra $14 out of pocket every time they go and see a doctor. For the purposes of getting their kids through university, in the future they will have to find another 25 per cent due to a hike in fees. They now find that private health insurance premiums are going up by seven to eight per cent yearly. That is more money going out of their pockets. To add more to this, Telstra line charges went up the other day because this government will not look after the interests of consumers, who are the major shareholder. So those charges are going up too.</para>
						</talk.start>
					</continue>
					<para>We could have made the point before this budget that the government were giving with one hand and taking with the other. We cannot say that anymore because four out of five Australian families and singles were not given anything—not a thing—but they are still losing money out of their pockets. So whilst the government are rolling in the taxes, you have households drowning in record debt. That is why they have been under financial pressure; that is why we have argued that they need to be given relief. But did the government address that in the budget? Did they get the balance right or did they go for the cynical bribe? You guessed it—they went for the bribe.</para>
					<para>What they came up with last night was not a plan for Australia's future—not a plan for intergenerational challenges. All they came up with last night was a plan to get themselves elected. I think the Australian people will see through it. Just think about it: almost $6 billion will be spent in the next six weeks. They are giving $600 in June for people with families who qualify for family tax benefit part A, and another $600 two months later. Is there any coincidence in that? It gives them two options as to when they can call the next election—soon after the first $600 or soon after the second one. I do not think there could be anything more cynical than that. But this is a budget dripping in cynicism.</para>
					<para>Remember that three years ago—and the member for Lilley drew attention to this in question time today—the Prime Minister said in relation to a similar attempt to fix up the tax debt trap that a $1,000 waiver that would be given to families would never have to be repeated because the government were going to fix the policy. They have not fixed the policy and here we are at it again. It is not $1,000 this time but $1,200. It shows that they have not fixed the problem but they know that they have a problem and they think they can fix it simply by buying their way out of it each time an election comes around.</para>
					<para>We have indicated that we will pass this budget, but we will be presenting our alternative to it. For $52 billion you would think you would be able to get benefit to more Australians than this government has succeeded in doing. You would think you would be able to get it right, but you only get it right if you genuinely are governing for all Australians. This government has given up on them. It is only interested in supporting those at the top end of town. It failed the test last night with the budget. We will present our alternative and we will campaign on it. Australians will have a clear choice not just between the contribution and balance of taxes and services—which we have outstripped you on so many times by saving bulk-billing; we will do it through the tax and family package as well— <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para>

						<para>—I will go through in a moment the number of false claims that were made as part of the member for Hotham’s speech, but I will just summarise where he finished. After a long complaint that Australians were paying too much tax, he finished by promising that Labor would increase spending on services—he finished with a claim that Labor wanted more spent on services. If you want to keep your tax take—or even lower it—but spend more, the only way you can actually do that is to drive the budget into deficit. If he were honest and said, 'We will drive the budget into deficit to do that,' we could argue that proposition. But, just in case you thought that was his policy too, he has also pledged to keep the budget in surplus— indeed, a bigger surplus. So the Australian Labor Party position on this budget is as follows: you should take less tax, spend more and have more left over at the end of it. You should take less tax, you should spend more and, after you have spent more with less, you should have more left over. It only needs to be stated to realise that this is an immature response to the budget in economic terms from an opposition that has not engaged in any serious economic thought and an opposition that does not have a coherent position.</para>

							<para>—but the member for Hotham said that the Labor Party's position is that they will pass the budget and vote for it, but they have an alternative. If they are serious about this proposition, what they are in fact saying is that this will be enacted but they will then go to the election with a proposal to undo it if they are elected. In other words, Australians will be told that their tax cuts will be undone if the Australian Labor Party are elected at the next election. If the Australian Labor Party seriously want to go to the next election and say to the public, 'Those tax cuts have been implemented, but vote for us and we'll take them away,' please do. If you were elected on a policy of taking away the tax cuts, you would be perfectly entitled to do it.</para>
						</talk.start>
					</continue>
					<para>But we all know what will happen: we will have a big kerfuffle now about how 'we would have had an alternative' and then when we get to the election the alternative will disappear. Why do I say that? I say that because for three years I watched the modus operandi of the member for Hotham when we were reforming the tax system. He would stand up and ask his questions about how bad the GST was, and day after day he would promise that the Labor Party would roll back the GST. So we waited and waited with bated breath. We wanted to know what this wonderful new alternative was. Then, what we had expected arrived on a critical day. The GST roll-back—which, as I said, he had laboured to give birth to for three years— brought forth a peanut. It was so small as to barely exist. Do you hear Labor talking today about the roll-back of GST? No, because they knew what was right for the country; they just did not want to do it. They wanted to extract every ounce of political populism along the way.</para>
					<para>They are going to try to do the same thing in relation to this budget. They know what is right for the country, and the budget will pass if they vote for it in the Senate. They will pretend that they are for an alternative, but by the time we get to the next election that too will have disappeared. If I am wrong about that, please do go to the next election promising to take away the tax cuts. If I am wrong about that, please do tell the Australian public that that is your policy. But we know that the Australian Labor Party will not do that. In this MPI the Australian Labor Party accuse the government of cynicism. What could be more cynical than passing the budget, saying that you are not actually in favour of it but, when the opportunity comes to unravel it, disappearing in the policy sense? This is not serious economic thought. It is not serious economic policy. I have said before that until the Australian Labor Party can find somebody who is prepared to do serious economic work they will always founder in relation to economic management.</para>
					<para>Let me correct a few of the other things that the member for Hotham said before I get on to the benefits of this budget. The next thing he said was something you will hear quite often from Labor Party speakers. He said, 'Yes, the economy is strong but that's all the good work of the Labor Party.'</para>

							<para>—'It is true,' the member for Rankin says. The reason the economy is doing well is because of what the Labor Party did eight years ago! It has got nothing to do with what has happened in the last eight years! This recitation of history always leaves out one incidental fact: the 1991 recession—the one we had to have. It is always about how Labor were so great at managing the economy that it is booming eight years after the event, but they were not able to keep the economy out of recession when they were actually in control. There is a former Prime Minister of Australia who always extols the virtues of his economic record. He just leaves out one fact—namely, the fact that the economy went into the worst recession in 60 years and that unemployment went to 11.3 per cent and home mortgage interest rates went to 17 per cent. It was really a fantastic economy—if you leave out the interest rates, the unemployment and the recession.</para>
						</talk.start>
					</continue>
					<para>The thing that has always amazed me about this recitation of history is that, when Australia went into recession in 1990-91, it was not during an Asian financial crisis; it was during an Asian boom. If you could manage to get the Australian economy into recession during an Asian boom, where would you have been during an Asian bust? The second thing that I will point out about this recitation of history which we have just had from the member for Hotham is that, apparently, we had a booming economy after the recession because Labor were great economic managers. If the economy was booming, I ask this: why during those five boom years did we have five budget deficits and accumulate $80 billion worth of debt? That makes it worse, doesn’t it? You are not seriously saying to me that the Labor Party was running budget deficits of three per cent during a boom! If that is going to be the account of history, it is even more profligate than it in fact was. We were running up $80 billion worth of debt during that period of boom.</para>
					<para>The reality is that the Labor Party did some good things in the late eighties. They reduced tariffs. We wish the Labor Party would return to that position today, but they will not. The Labor Party did some other good things in the mid-eighties. They supported a broad based consumption tax but, when the time came to actually implement it, they opposed it. The Labor Party in the 1980s were interested in reducing marginal income tax rates. We put up a similar proposal in 2000 and, again, we are attacked for it. But it was this government that balanced the budget. We have had seven surpluses, repaid $70 billion of Labor debt, brought in the broad based indirect tax, continued with tariff reductions and put in place a statement of monetary policy. It is this government that cut the company tax rate, halved the capital gains tax rate and abolished the bank account debits tax, the stamp duty on shares and the bed tax. It is this government that reformed Commonwealth-state financial relations, which will deliver the abolition of the bank account debits tax on 1 July next year. It has already delivered the abolition of the financial institutions duty. As the budget papers show, the Commonwealth tax to GDP is not rising; it is falling. The budget papers show that in the historical tables. And it is falling across the forward estimates.</para>

							<para>—We will go through this argument. Labor say, 'We will count GST as a Commonwealth tax, but count the taxes that it abolishes as state taxes.' Mr Deputy Speaker, the way in which you do this arithmetic is by saying that, when the GST abolishes $1 billion of financial institutions duty and when the states have not actually lost a dollar, the outcome is that Commonwealth tax to GDP has risen and state tax to state GSP has fallen. There has been a unilateral tax reduction from the states, even though they are not receiving one dollar less. On 1 July next year, when the bank account debits tax is abolished because the GST will fund it, the Labor Party will say, 'Count the GST, which funds that tax reduction as a Commonwealth tax, and count the abolition of the bank account debits tax as the abolition of a state tax.' So even though the states will be receiving more revenue on 1 July of next year, they are engaged in unilateral tax reduction.</para>
						</talk.start>
					</continue>
					<para>Let us look at it another way. As we show in this budget, the states move ahead of their financial assistance grants, because of the GST bonus, by a package of $1.1 billion, I think. I have it in one of these diagrams here. The Labor Party say that the states are in fact receiving no money, because that is Commonwealth revenue. That is what they are saying. The GST goes up and the entire bonus is received by the states, but it is the Commonwealth that has more revenue. You can see why you would be putting that argument, because the one thing they want to cover up is the boom to state revenues that is occurring from the fact that the GST system has been implemented and is probably going a long way to keeping Labor governments in power. So because the Australian Labor Party do not like the facts and because the budget papers show unequivocally that the tax to GDP ratio is reducing, they try to move state revenues back onto the Commonwealth balance sheet and count the taxes that are abolished on the state account. Of course, the GST funded not only the abolition of bed tax, stamp duty on shares and a reduction in gaming tax but also the abolition of the 7c petroleum franchise fee which the Commonwealth used to collect on behalf of the states and was always shown as a state tax. When we move from collecting it on their behalf through the petrol system to collecting it on their behalf through the broad based indirect tax system, somehow it moved from one account to the other. That can be abolished too.</para>
					<para>So where did we get at the end of the day? We got to this proposition from the member for Hotham: that the government was going to give a huge bribe to the public and, what is more, the public would not get any benefit. The one thing that does happen when a bribe occurs is that the money passes. You can either have it the way the member for Lilley says, where it never passes—he says you never get a benefit—or you can have it the way the member for Hotham says—that is, you are getting the money—but you cannot have it both ways.</para>
					<para>Mr Deputy Speaker, the opposition's budget response started off with the proposition— and you heard it in the first question and you saw it in their press release last night—that '8.5 million forgotten Australian families don’t receive a single cent.' There it is, as said by Simon Crean. There is one problem: there are only 4.9 million families in Australia. This is the way in which the modus operandi of the Australian Labor Party has developed. Because there is no economic understanding, somebody gets a phrase, which is mindlessly repeated until they start believing it themselves. What I say to the Australian Labor Party is this: you need someone who can do analysis. You need to deal with facts. You need to find out that, if there are only 4.9 million families, 8.5 million families cannot be worse off in Australia. You need to come to grips with policy. The member for Hotham would not be the spokesman that would help manage an economy if the Labor Party were ever elected. This requires detailed understanding and constant management, and that is what this budget is all about. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para>

						<para>—John Howard's battlers have become the people who John Howard forgot. When the Prime Minister designed his tax cuts, he forgot Australia's nurses, police constables, cleaners, child-care workers, shop assistants, taxi drivers, receptionists, call centre operators, waiters, waitresses and factory workers. The fact is that four out of five Australian families and single people get no tax cut under this government. Yet their plight was dismissed by the Treasurer in his statements last night on the <inline font-style="italic">7.30 Report</inline> when he said:</para>
					</talk.start>
					<quote>
						<para>You asked me about low income earners.</para>
						<para>Last year we did it across the board.</para>
						<para>Low income earners pay less tax.</para>
					</quote>
					<para>So he is saying that they got their milkshake and sandwich tax cut last year and that is all they deserve. He is saying, 'Let them eat cake'—or, more particularly, 'Let them eat their sandwich and have their milkshake,' because that is all they are getting out of this government: a miserable milkshake and sandwich tax cut from last year.</para>
					<para>So why is there no reward for effort, Treasurer? Why is there no reward for effort for child-care workers, cleaners, shop assistants, taxi drivers and receptionists? Why is there only reward for effort for those who are on incomes above $52,000? Even then, the tax cuts are clawed back through bracket creep. It is a government that gives with one hand and takes with the other. The fact is that after three years the average household will be paying $12,000 more in income tax than when the Howard government came to office—and that is after the tax cuts. That shows the extent to which this government is failing to give back bracket creep. Even after the tax cuts, and no matter what the Treasurer said, the government maintains its record as the highest taxing government in Australia’s history.</para>
					<para>The government tries to pretend that people on incomes below $52,000 will still get relief from the budget, but only two million families are eligible for the increased family payment—only two million families out of 10½ million families and single people. Of those two million families, fully 600,000 of them are caught in the debt trap. So they may not get any relief. In fact, they may end up owing money after they get their two lots of $600, depending on the size of the debt. What does that all mean? It means that one in five Australian families and single people will get a tax cut and one in five Australian families and single people will get an increase in family payment, leaving three out of five Australian families and single people who get nothing—not one red cent. So 60 per cent of Australian families and single people will get not one red cent under this government.</para>
					<para>In 1942 the Prime Minister's hero, Bob Menzies, gave a radio interview called 'The forgotten people', in which he said the forgotten people 'represent the backbone of this country'. I say that the police constables, nurses, cleaners and child-care workers represent the backbone of this country. I say that the shop assistants, taxi drivers and receptionists represent the backbone of this country. But they are the forgotten people. They are forgotten in this budget. In the 2004 budget, the Prime Minister has created a new class of forgotten people—six million Australian families and single people.</para>
					<para>Australia wide, 60 per cent get nothing, but in my state of Queensland it is much worse, because incomes generally are lower in Queensland, which means that there are more Queenslanders below that $52,000 cutoff point. The calculations I have done—and I have been very generous to the government in the assumptions I have made in those calculations—show that 67 per cent of Queensland households and individuals get nothing from this budget, because of those lower incomes. That means two-thirds of Queenslanders get no tax cut and no increased family payment. This budget discriminates against Queensland. It discriminates against the forgotten people of Caboolture, Bundaberg, Gladstone, Townsville, Logan City in my electorate, Redcliffe, Wynnum, Algester, Coopers Plains, Salisbury, Pine Rivers and Ipswich, to name just a few.</para>
					<para>But the forgotten people are not only in Queensland. The forgotten people are all around Australia. They are the lower-income people, earning below $52,000, without children. They are the forgotten people of the Latrobe Valley, Geelong, Bendigo, Ballarat, Burnie, Devonport, Launceston, Queenstown, the north-west coast of Tasmania, Elizabeth in South Australia, Katherine, Darwin, Alice Springs, Cooma, Queanbeyan, Wyong, Gosford, Murwillumbah, Ballina, Broadmeadows and, of course, Kalgoorlie.</para>
					<para>We heard the member for Kalgoorlie admit that this budget leaves his people in the category of the forgotten people. He said that it is enough to make him spit. The people of Kalgoorlie have been forgotten in this budget. To make matters worse, there is no boost in services. You would think that the government would have said, 'We won't give the sort of tax cuts that the Australian people deserve and should get as reward for their effort; we’ll boost services.' Have they done that? Have they done that with training? No, not a red cent for training. This government is absolutely committed to taking Australians down the low road to low skills and low wages. Therefore, it has not applied one cent of government spending to training in this budget. Of course, in Medicare, where bulkbilling continues to decline, and in health generally, there is almost nothing. There is almost nothing new in the health budget.</para>
					<para>I turn now to the most disgraceful decision that this government made in this budget—that is, the decision not to fund the pneumococcal vaccine. The government is spending $52 billion to get re-elected—as the shadow Treasurer said—and this government, disgracefully, has refused to fund the pneumococcal vaccine. The Prime Minister is quoted in the media as having described the funding of the pneumococcal vaccine as 'middle-class welfare'. I say that all Australian children should be protected from this deadly disease that takes so many lives and causes so much harm in this country. On that matter, the president of the AMA agrees. When he realised that the government was not going to fund it, he called on the government to urgently reconsider its decision. Dr Michael Rice from the AMA’s child and youth health committee said a healthy budget surplus could pay for the vaccines. He said: 'It's not only a poor decision, it's a stupid decision.' I say it is a stupid and a callous decision and the Treasurer and the Prime Minister should be ashamed for not funding the pneumococcal vaccine.</para>
					<para>The fact is that this budget is not a plan for the future; it is a plan for an election. It is a plan for an election—to get re-elected—but even then it is a flawed election plan, where 60 per cent of Australian families and single people get nothing. In my state of Queensland, two out of three Queensland families and single people get not one red cent out of this budget. It is an unfair budget. It is a typical Liberal budget. Can anyone remember a more typical Liberal budget than this one, where they are only funding tax cuts for high-income earners and where they are depriving the forgotten people of Australia of any benefit at all? This election will determine the very character of our nation. It will determine whether we revive that great Aussie notion of a fair go for all or whether we descend into a dog-eat-dog mentality where there is no such thing as society and no such thing as community. This election will determine whether access to decent health care depends on how much money you have to buy health care or whether we return to a universal health care system where Medicare is available for all Australians. Labor built Medicare and only Labor will save Medicare.</para>
					<para>This election will determine whether the sons and daughters of the working men and women of Australia are able to go on to university and develop their talents or whether we return to the pre-Whitlam era where the entry card into university was marked 'privilege', not 'talent'. In 1996, the government pledged to govern for all of us, but it has forgotten six out of 10 Australians and almost seven out of 10 Queenslanders. This is a callous government. When Ben Chifley observed the light on the hill, he said, 'These things are worth fighting for.' Labor will fight this election for all Australians. We will fight this election for those six out of 10 forgotten Australians, and we will fight it for all Australians. The Australian people deserve a better government than this mean, cynical Howard government that has no plan for them, just a plan for an election. We will replace this government, this mean, cynical government, with a Latham Labor government. It will be a creative, compassionate Labor government that will fashion for the Australian people a prosperous, fair, tolerant and compassionate Australia.</para>

						<para>—We have had occasion now to get the first real insight into the opposition's critique of this budget, and it has led off with three largely self-inflicted wounds. The opening salvo from the Australian Labor Party tells us that there are over eight million families in this country. After their detailed study, it has taken them this period of time to do the research to discover over eight million families in Australia who have been left out and forgotten. I want to spend a few moments on that statement, because when I heard it being made I was, frankly, somewhat stunned. I did the basic maths in my mind. There are roughly 20 million people in Australia, and I figured it was a pretty bold effort— to manage to leave eight million families out, if there are only roughly 20 million people in the whole population. So I thought to myself, initially, 'This must be a breathtaking error—just a sort of subediting failure, just a complete lack of quality control.' I thought it must have been a misstatement.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>Then I thought that I really ought to check and see how it was possible that, at the level of the office of the Leader of the Opposition, a statement could go out in response to one of the more significant moments in the Australian political calendar. How could one of the most senior opposition ministers get a fundamental piece of data like that so wrong? I thought that perhaps the figure was lifted out of an American speech somewhere which had been referring to some other nation’s collection of families. I thought maybe it was lifted out of a Clinton speech, but I thought, 'Arkansas could not have over eight million families'—and probably the United States would have well over eight million families—'so maybe there is some other source. Maybe it came from Bangladesh, which has about 50 million people in its population.' Maybe that was it. I did not know. I was trying to work it out. But, as it turns out, right at the very bottom of page 2 of the first press release that went out there is a little footnote, which one could easily miss reading through page 1. The footnote says that the statement relies on the NATSEM definition of families, which includes single adults. It includes married couples—married couples with children and married couples without children—and it includes single adults.</para>
					<para>You would have to scour every lexicon, every dictionary and every think tank around the globe to come up with a definition of families that included single adults. But the shadow Treasurer has discovered this definition. Initially I thought this reflected a breathtaking error of fact and failure of quality control, but now I think it reflects a deliberate attempt to misrepresent the situation. I think that was largely confirmed by the second press release—that was the one that I understood was released in a corrected form, the earlier one having been airbrushed.</para>
					<para>Then, of course, we go to the shadow Treasurer's mastery of the detail of the budget: he leapt to his feet mid-question time, following a question about a teacher from Queensland on $48,000, to demonstrate to the world that he had not yet comprehended the most basic mechanics of the operation of the government's superannuation co-contribution scheme. The Treasurer was kind and patient enough to correct and educate him on that occasion. The simple fact is that the government's co-contribution operates at 150 per cent of the voluntary contribution of the individual concerned—on $48,000 or whatever the figure may be—but with a tapered rate applying to the amount of contribution that can be made under the scheme at each level of income.</para>
					<para>These are fairly basic mechanics of a public policy instrument. They are the sort of thing that any junior Treasury official will have mastered in economics 101. The Treasurer has demonstrated that this is an issue of financial literacy. The government under this budget is making significant allocations for financial literacy, and we will be delighted if the opposition cares to make use of that, because we want to have an informed public debate in this country. We accept that there are matters of principle at stake here, but we would like to be arguing over the facts, rather than over whatever bit of text was lifted out of some other leader's remarks or over a fundamental misunderstanding of the basic mechanics of the way in which the budget operates.</para>
					<para>We move then to the final element of the opposition's response to this budget, which is the rather extraordinary statement by the Leader of the Opposition on Howard Sattler's program this morning. I do not know exactly what Howard Sattler's audience is, but one assumes it must be in the tens of thousands. When, on the morning after the budget, the Leader of the Opposition is being questioned as to his response to the budget, one would assume that he would bring to bear the same level of care that we expect of members in this place, who bear an obligation to immediately correct the record where they have made an error of fact. Errors of fact happen from time to time. We are all human. We can make allowances for them. On this occasion I do not believe there has been any correction of this bit of text, which I will record for the benefit of the House:</para>
					<quote>
						<para>Sattler: Have you worked out with Mrs Latham over the phone at least how much more money Peter Costello is going to give you?</para>
						<para>LATHAM: I don’t think we get anything.</para>
						<para>Sattler: Must be something?</para>
						<para>LATHAM: We’re part of the 60 per cent of the country that’s been forgotten in the budget. There’s over six million Australian families and singles—</para>
					</quote>
					<para>so we have gone from eight million under the shadow Treasurer to six million under the Leader of the Opposition; the ABS is saying 'four point something,' and I see the shadow spokesman for transport at the table, so perhaps he wants to add a fourth or fifth figure—</para>
					<quote>
						<para>who do not get a single cent in tax cuts or increased family benefits.</para>
					</quote>
					<para>So the Leader of the Opposition said to Howard Sattler and the tens of thousands in his radio audience that he will not receive a single cent in tax cuts.</para>
					<para>Every now and again as a member of parliament you have the experience of getting a 6 a.m. phone call from a particularly industrious journo who wants to run something on a morning drive program. You are sort of bleary eyed, you are just waking up and you have not quite got your stuff together. But when the Leader of the Opposition, responding to Howard Sattler the morning after the budget—when it is incumbent upon him to bring together the opposition's critique of the most significant act of any government in any calendar year—says, on an income of over $100,000, 'I won’t get a single cent in tax cuts,' and then fails to correct the record, what you have is a degree of policy on the run; a degree of having a guess; a degree of making it up as you go along; a degree of sticking your jaw out and hoping for the best.</para>

It is a clear factual error on a fundamental issue. So many of those tens of thousands of listeners to Howard Sattler’s program will assume, 'If Mr Latham is not getting a tax cut, I must not be getting a tax cut. Who is getting the tax cut, if Mr Latham is not getting the tax cut on an income more than double the point at which the benefits kick in?'</para>

					<para>I want to conclude by making a couple of points. We believe that a person is entitled to the fruits of their labour. That is our starting assumption. Where there is an overwhelming community need, we ask Australians to make a contribution in this egalitarian society to look out for health and education costs, the needs of pensioners and the needs of those— for example, the profoundly deaf needing a cochlear implant—provided for in this budget. The Jews have an expression: 'Don’t muzzle the ox that pulls the plough.' The productivity of this economy relies on incentive; it relies on reward for effort; it relies on giving encouragement to those prepared to take a risk. That is what this budget does, and I commend it to the House. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para>

							<para>That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Mid-life upgrade of existing Chancery building for the Australian High Commission, Wellington, New Zealand.</para>
						</motion>
						<para>The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade proposes a midlife upgrade and refurbishment of the existing chancery for the Australian High Commission in Wellington, New Zealand. The Commonwealth leased the site for the chancery for a period of 99 years in August 1974, and the building was completed and first occupied in 1978. Other than previous works completed in 2000 addressing facade issues, including the rectification of glazing and roof leaks, there has been no major architectural or services refurbishment undertaken on the building.</para>
						<para>Several of the Commonwealth departments and agencies that originally occupied areas in the building have relocated their operations to Auckland. This reduction in occupation has not been compensated by growth in other areas, thereby leaving the building considerably underutilised at present. Nevertheless, the building continues to serve Australia's representational and other interests in New Zealand very well. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Defence currently occupy the building and have existing long-term lease arrangements. The majority of existing building services are in excess of 25 years old and have reached the end of their useful and economic life. Replacement of these elements is required to ensure that major plant breakdowns do not occur, with subsequent negative impacts on the operation of the facility.</para>
						<para>This proposal is to undertake a comprehensive midlife upgrade of the existing chancery to modernise the facility and to ensure compliance with the current building codes of Australia and New Zealand. A key objective of the refurbishment is the consolidation of the accommodation arrangements of the High Commission, mainly on the second floor. The first floor will then be made available for future Australian government use. The ground floor will include a multiuse facility capable of providing official receptions, exhibitions, trade displays, meetings, lectures and business missions. It will also accommodate the consular services section of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The project also includes, within a fenced compound, full support services, emergency power, potable water, firefighting, a staff recreation area, a controlled access car parking area and fully landscaped grounds.</para>
						<para>Subject to parliamentary approval, refurbishment of the chancery is expected to begin in March next year, with practical completion and occupation in the first half of 2006. The estimated cost of the works is $9.309 million, including $2.809 million for a new tenant fit out. I commend the motion to the House.</para>

						<para>—In continuation on the <inline ref="R2028">Parliamentary Superannuation Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2027">Parliamentary Superannuation and Other Entitlements Legislation Amendment Bill 2004</inline> debate, I am pleased to make some observations on the mechanics of this legislation. On 12 February 2004, the Prime Minister announced that the government would seek to close the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Scheme to new MPs joining parliament from the next election and replace it with an accumulation scheme that attracts a government contribution at the community standard rate of nine per cent. The reality is that this legislation delivers on the commitment by the Prime Minister and the Howard government and will bring superannuation arrangements for our parliamentarians and opposition parliamentarians into line with current community standards. This is certainly something that I know MPs applaud.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>The introduction of this legislation comes on top of substantial government changes that were made to the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Scheme in 2001 to more closely align MPs' superannuation with the superannuation arrangements for the majority of Australians. The 2001 changes that were introduced required that MPs entering parliament after the November 2001 election would have their pensions deferred between leaving parliament and the age of 55, which placed a higher standard of preservation on MPs than applies to other Australians who receive pensions. Nonetheless, it was community expectation and a move in the right direction that received broad support.</para>
					<para>The 2001 changes to the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Scheme, as well as those that are incorporated into this bill, are not retrospective. There are a variety of reasons for that. Principally, of course, there is the fact that, if we allowed MPs to change into the new scheme, you could have a situation where existing MPs who are still contributing 13 per cent of their gross salary in after-tax earnings into their superannuation yet not receiving an enhanced benefit would then be able to swap across to the new nine per cent accumulation scheme and in fact be better off than currently—staying in the defined benefit fund which exists at present.</para>
					<para>Overall, the bills before the House today constitute a package to close the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Scheme and make new accumulation arrangements for persons who first become members of the federal parliament or return to the parliament after a previous period in parliament, from the next general election. The new arrangements will involve a nine per cent government contribution payable into a superannuation fund that is chosen by the senator or member.</para>
					<para>The Parliamentary Superannuation Bill 2004 provides the framework for the new accumulation arrangements. The new arrangements will apply only to MPs joining the parliament who are not currently sitting MPs, including MPs who return to the parliament after a break. Existing MPs will not be able to transfer, as I mentioned. New MPs will be able to choose the complying superannuation fund or retirement savings account to receive their government contributions. However, that fund must not be a selfmanaged superannuation fund. A default fund will be nominated by the Minister for Finance and Administration to receive the contributions in the event that an MP does not make a choice. The government contribution of nine per cent will be calculated on total parliamentary salary.</para>
					<para>In the final few minutes I have available with respect to these two bills, I seek to make a couple of comments about some of the debate that we have heard in this chamber regarding them. I seek to draw people's attention to one fundamental fact. I sat in this chamber and heard the Leader of the Opposition, who expounds that he is, and holds himself up to be, someone who is in some way in the pursuit of higher principles, someone who in public life is willing to stand for principles and someone who believes himself to be—and certainly likes to characterise himself as—someone who is willing to fight for what they believe to be the right thing. The Leader of the Opposition likes to allege that he is in fact concerned with what is in the best interests of Australian taxpayers.</para>
					<para>However, with respect to these bills, I would make one key comment. That is, every time a leader of the opposition or a member of the opposition speaks about these bills and holds out that they are doing this because they believe in principles or because they believe in better public interest, or if they hold themselves up as doing so because they believe that it is in the best interests of Australian taxpayers, and every time that one of the opposition members says, 'Why doesn't the government endorse and agree with the opposition's proposed amendments so that we can put more taxpayers' funds into a dental scheme, Medicare or schools?'— any of these kinds of things—I would highlight one point: every time you hear that claim from the Labor Party, consider Centenary House.</para>
					<para>Every time that you hear the Labor Party talk about how they are the people upholding common decency, how they are the people concerned with principles, consider Centenary House. The reality is that, until the Labor Party deals with the $27 million rort that is Centenary House, they will never, ever appropriately meet the threshold that they imply they are concerned with holding themselves up to meet. Until the Labor Party agrees not to increase and ratchet up the rent from Centenary House, which siphons money directly from Australian taxpayers, they will never meet the threshold that they claim they are concerned with. That is the reality.</para>

							<para>—that the Labor Party does not stand for principle and that the Leader of the Opposition does not stand up for what he believes in. He does it because he believes there are a few votes in it. That is the reason for the Labor Party's stand. If it was not the reason for the Labor Party's stand, if the Labor Party were generally concerned about what is decent, proper and principled, the Labor Party would end the $27 million ripoff each year of Australian taxpayers. That is the point I make. Let all Australians, every time they hear the words 'principle' or 'decency' or hear how the Labor Party stands up for these things, every time they hear that, let them think of two words: Centenary House. As long as that anchor is around its neck, it will never amount to anything more than being a party of opportunistic hacks who are attempting to win a couple of votes out of this issue.</para>
						</talk.start>
					</continue>
					<para>The reality is that all of us can unite in the belief that it is good to bring parliamentary superannuation into line with community standards, and we do. All parliamentarians recognise the benefits that flow from bringing parliamentarians' superannuation into line with community standards. It is a principle that we all support. But the difference is that the Howard government made the decision because we knew it was what the community wanted, and we did it because we believed it was the right thing to do. We do not stand here, though, with the double standard that the ALP stands with. Unlike the ALP, we do not stand in this chamber and hold ourselves out as being concerned with principle but say, 'Don't look too closely behind us,' because of a $27 million ugly stain that exists. That is the key and fundamental difference between the Liberal- National Party and those who sit opposite us, the Australian Labor Party.</para>

						<para>—The <inline ref="R2028">Parliamentary Superannuation Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2027">Parliamentary Superannuation and Other Entitlements Legislation Amendment Bill 2004</inline> to change parliamentary superannuation entitlements are long overdue. It has been the case for many years that the parliamentary super scheme has been held in contempt by the Australian public because of its generosity. The reason that the Labor Party proposed that the current parliamentary super scheme be closed was for good policy reasons and its relativity with other superannuation schemes available to the rest of the community.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>The Labor Party has had a magnificent record of improving superannuation arrangements for our country. It is a process which started in the early 1980s, when Labor was last in opposition. I can remember attending, as a staffer, lengthy discussions at caucus committee meetings considering proposals for a national superannuation scheme. It was a long time before we had compulsory superannuation in this country for most people. Prior to that, superannuation was something that was generally enjoyed by management, professionals, people who had jobs in government, whether local, state or federal, and employees of organisations like universities. They were treated very generously. In that environment, the parliamentary super scheme, which has only been in existence in its present form since the 1940s, came to take on the characteristics of those rather more elitist superannuation arrangements. The cynicism that people have had about it has grown, as they have seen a number of anomalies in relation to it. Some of those anomalies have come and gone over the years, and some of them have come and gone and have come again.</para>
					<para>When somebody retires, or it is speculated that somebody will retire or lose their seat at an election, how much of a benefit they will subsequently receive from the scheme has always been something of a cause celebre. For years I worked for a minister for finance who had policy responsibility for this area. For privacy reasons, when those sorts of issues came up, you were required not to tell the press what the superannuation entitlements of a particular individual might be. I used to have a large red folder on my desk that had all the components of the scheme, and I was quite adept at going through those components to explain, usually to journalists and occasionally to members of the public who were interested, precisely how parliamentary superannuation entitlements were built up. If they had a hypothetical case and knew how long that person had been in the parliament and knew what higher offices they had held—all of which are matters on the public record and in the <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Handbook</inline>—they would be able to come to a very accurate assessment of what that person’s entitlements were.</para>
					<para>One of the things that really surprised me was that they never seemed to be able to do that, no matter how clearly it was spelt out for them. In fact, I really came to doubt my powers of explanation, because I usually found that people's entitlements were exaggerated by a factor of three. I often felt that it probably would have been better to just give them the information, then at least the person who was retiring would have their entitlements accurately recorded in the newspaper or broadcast on the TV or the radio. I think that was almost never the case. In fact, I cannot remember a case when somebody's entitlements were accurately reported. That is one of the things that has helped to bring the scheme into disrepute.</para>
					<para>One of the deficiencies of the current parliamentary scheme—which is very generous in terms of the equivalent of salary contribution that goes into it on average for each parliamentarian—is, of course, that those benefits are not equally distributed amongst the beneficiaries. In fact, many people who serve in this place do not become entitled to a parliamentary pension because they do not serve long enough. I think that, when I came to this place, the average length of service was about eight years. There would have been a number of people who had served one or perhaps two terms who did not qualify. They got their contributions back with a small factor and were not significant beneficiaries of the scheme.</para>
					<para>The scheme was in fact most beneficial for people who had been in parliament for a very long time and who had served in a number of higher offices. I have to reflect that I have noted on occasion that, over the years, people have retired from this place on the day that their parliamentary pension was maximised. They can do that in the Senate without causing a by-election. It is a reflection on what some people’s goals might have been. It is also in the lore of this place that having those generous parliamentary entitlements available to people is one of the things that ultimately causes them to leave if they are in a relatively safe seat and have a comfortable degree of tenure. If they have been in a high public office it is entirely possible, when their pension has maximised and they are no longer required to make a full contribution—and, of course, I would be careful to make the point that parliamentarians do contribute to their superannuation the amount of 11 per cent of salary—once they have ceased to hold a higher public office, and have been here for a long time, that their parliamentary superannuation entitlement might exceed the salary that they would otherwise have received by remaining in this place. That might be another encouragement for people to leave when they have perhaps been here long enough. But those cases have been very few.</para>
					<para>It always struck me throughout the 1980s, when I was required to give advice on these matters after we had set up the current system of superannuation for the community, that it would have been much more beneficial for politicians to have been given the option of joining any scheme of their choosing—which is one of the components of the bill that we are now debating today—having the Commonwealth contribution to their superannuation paid into that scheme; having their own contributions, whether compulsory or voluntary, also paid into that scheme; and then being subject to the same rules and market risks as everybody else in our community. That always struck me as being a very reasonable thing. For people who were here for only a relatively short amount of time, it would be a more beneficial situation than the one that prevailed with the existing scheme, where, if you lost your seat without achieving an entitlement to a pension, you received very little benefit for having contributed your super and a maximum amount of disruption to possibly an otherwise successful career elsewhere.</para>
					<para>I would characterise putting this scheme on a level footing with other community schemes as part of a process which the previous Labor government was involved in in the early 1990s, when it changed the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme for public servants and the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme for military personnel. The reason that those schemes were changed was that they had some of the characteristics that I have just been critical of in the parliamentary scheme in that they benefited people who served for very long periods enormously and they did not benefit adequately the bulk of people who served for more normal lengths of time. So the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme—the old CSS—was closed off and replaced by the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme and the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme was closed off and replaced by the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme. People who served for relatively short amounts of time were therefore able to obtain superannuation benefits that were commensurate with their service and they could keep them for their ultimate retirement.</para>
					<para>The changes that we are debating today effectively provide that situation for future members of parliament. There will be some scepticism from the public about why these things are prospective. I understand that the reason for that is a constitutional one—the Commonwealth is not able to expropriate people's property or rights without just compensation, and that is the reason this bill and the new arrangements are prospective. As a matter of practicality, we have to accept that, and I think people do in this place.</para>
					<para>I am enormously pleased that this bill is finally being dealt with. It was a fine judgment by the Leader of the Opposition—the member for Werriwa—when he announced that the Labor Party in government would pursue this course of action. There is no doubt that the Prime Minister, on seeing the community reaction to that, realised that he had no other course but to respond. In the committee stage I will be moving an amendment which has been foreshadowed by the Leader of the Opposition. That amendment places a cap on the benefits that people can get out of the existing scheme. This only applies to people who are in an office which receives remuneration which is higher than that of a minister in the cabinet. It therefore applies to the Prime Minister and his deputy, the leaders in the other place, the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives. Their entitlements to benefits in relation to their higher office will all be limited under this amendment to those of a minister in cabinet. That at least will put some kind of a cap on the rather extreme benefits that can be enjoyed by somebody who serves in very high office for a significant length of time. That is appropriate and starts to deal with some community concern about the existing scheme. I commend the bill to the House and I look forward to moving the amendment.</para>

						<para>—I would have liked to have congratulated the government and opposition for these two bills, the <inline ref="R2028">Parliamentary Superannuation Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2027">Parliamentary Superannuation and Other Entitlements Legislation Amendment Bill 2004</inline>, ending the taxpayer funded rort that is the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Scheme—the PCSS—but I cannot, because they do not. I must, however, commend the member for Kingston on the frankness of his remarks a moment ago and his recognition of the generosity of this scheme, which is quite remarkably outside anything that applies to anything that we expect and devise for our constituents.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>The PCSS continues because new retirement arrangements contained in the bills apply only to new members and senators who come to this place after the next election and former members and senators who return to parliament after retiring or having lost their seat. The outrageously overgenerous and fully protected PCSS remains for currently sitting MPs and senators. So, despite the fact we have these bills recognising how out of touch the retiring benefits of elected representatives are when compared with those of the rest of the Australian community, most members and senators on both sides have made it perfectly clear that applying the new retirement arrangements to themselves is well and truly off the agenda. The great disconnect between the people and their parliamentarians will therefore continue while the existing benefits are still applicable.</para>
					<para>I hope to restore some confidence amongst the electorate that some politicians do not seek to place themselves outside and above the laws they make for the rest of the community by moving amendments in the consideration in detail stage allowing all MPs the opportunity to opt in to the new superannuation arrangements under the nine per cent super guarantee. I invite members on both sides to support my amendments. I will expand on these later in these remarks, but first I will look at the new arrangements contained within these bills.</para>
					<para>Prior to that, I will make a few comments on the speech of the Leader of the Opposition. It is true it took his initiative to bring us to the point we are at today, debating this legislation, and for that he must be praised. It is something none of his predecessors—along with leaders of government on both sides of politics over many years—had the fortitude to touch. It is true that it would take such a move from a government or opposition leader before any substantial political imperative was established to force these changes.</para>
					<para>The Leader of the Opposition says this legislation is a result of Labor’s policy announcement. But, before anyone tries to climb to the high moral ground on this issue, let me remind the House of the words of a man who could really be said to be the architect of this long-belated reform. Ted Mack, the Independent member for North Sydney from 1990 to 1996, was a man who twice retired from parliaments—first the NSW parliament and then this one—to avoid accessing the parliamentary superannuation scheme.</para>
					<para>Let me quote from the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of this House from 9 June 1994, when the member for North Sydney stood a few seats behind where I stand now in this chamber and spoke in the second reading debate of the Superannuation Laws Amendment Bill, which was ironically a bill to give members and exmembers of parliament the option to take improved superannuation benefits. By such improved benefits the parliamentary superannuation scheme has over the years been transformed from a scheme for which its maker, Ben Chifley, had honourable intentions, a scheme honestly designed to attract and secure a wide range of parliamentarians from career paths into the uncertainty of politics. The scheme today bears no resemblance to the scheme Chifley introduced, yet MPs have themselves improved a scheme over the years that completely cocoons eligible recipients from the realities of the real world, a world that today has job uncertainty as a fact of life.</para>
					<para>They are my words, but the words of Ted Mack, when he was one of only three speakers—it was not unlike this debate—on that June day 10 years ago were these:</para>
					<quote>
						<para>If there is one thing that brings parliamentarians and the institution of parliament into disrepute it is the enormously generous unfunded parliamentary superannuation schemes that exist for federal parliament and also for the state parliaments. It is interesting that the Superannuation Laws Amendment Bill is getting very minimal attention, because I think most people in here are really aware of the situation.</para>
					</quote>
					<para>Mr Mack went on:</para>
					<quote>
						<para>Further expanding the benefits for members and ex-members on top of the recent salary and benefit rises is quite unjustified and is guaranteed to bring this institution and all of us in here into contempt.</para>
					</quote>
					<para>Speaking of his constituents later in that speech, Mr Mack said:</para>
					<quote>
						<para>Most of them have to pay—</para>
					</quote>
					<para>into superannuation, that is—</para>
					<quote>
						<para>… for around 40 years and get far less in benefits than we can get after eight years.</para>
					</quote>
					<para>How relevant those words still are today.</para>
					<para>It was Ted Mack's long campaign from the mid-1980s that brought us to this point, not necessarily the recent moves by the Leader of the Opposition and the government. My two private member's bills, in the previous parliament and last year, were designed to obtain the outcome built into the amendments I will move in the consideration in detail stage. My argument was and remains simple. We should have superannuation arrangements with employers' contributions no more generous than we legislate for the rest of the community—our constituents.</para>
					<para>I have consistently argued that parliamentary salaries should be a separate debate and subject to proper independent inquiry. We have allowed superannuation entitlements and other overgenerous allowances to grow as a de facto salary compensation for parliamentarians too afraid to debate payment but quite happy to self-manage a host of arrangements, including super, whose benefits, until exposed by non party members, have been a mystery to most people. Indeed, it was not until I included the Government Actuary's assessment of the nominal employer—that is, the taxpayer—contribution to the parliamentary scheme at 69 per cent in the explanatory memorandum to my 2001 bill that the public knew just how outrageously generous this scheme is.</para>
					<para>Those private member's bills also served to focus public attention on this issue in such a way that almost 3,000 public submissions were lodged with the Senate inquiry into my 2001 private member's bill and there was widespread media coverage and interest taken by programs, especially A Current Affair. The public hostility generated by decades of inaction by the major parties was the message the Leader of the Opposition heard before he made his policy announcement in February, and which was recognised by the announcement by the Prime Minister at a later date. Had there not been that exposure and those committed efforts over almost 20 years by non major party members of parliament, particularly Ted Mack, we would not be here today—it is as simple as that. It has been an absolute no-go zone for the Labor and coalition parties until the opposition leader quite correctly read the extent of the public hostility.</para>
					<para>I will move on to this legislation. The Parliamentary Superannuation Bill 2004 establishes the new superannuation arrangements for members and senators elected at the next federal election, which could be sooner than we think, given last night's budget. New members and senators will receive employer contributions of nine per cent of salary, in line with the superannuation guarantee, paid into a complying fund of their choice. In the absence of the member nominating a fund, the nine per cent will be paid into a default fund determined by the Minister for Finance and Administration. However, there is little detail available as to the process by which the default fund is to be selected and I would be grateful if the minister could provide any information in this regard in the summing up of this somewhat minuscule debate.</para>
					<para>The accompanying bill, the Parliamentary Superannuation and Other Entitlements Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 provides for the closing of the PCSS to new members after the next election and suspends pensions being paid to former members and senators who re-enter parliament at the next federal election. These former parliamentarians will be subject to the new superannuation arrangements for their service from that election onwards. This bill also provides the means for new members and senators to salary sacrifice up to 50 per cent of their parliamentary salaries to their superannuation, which could deliver an advantage of bringing them in under the marginal tax rate of 30 per cent. Of course I welcome this legislation, but it needs further amendment and I will be listening carefully to the arguments in support of the amendments to be moved by the opposition and the member for Cunningham.</para>
					<para>I am persuaded, after a lot of advice, of the difficulty of drafting, let alone moving, amendments that would wind up the scheme for existing members, and of the political impossibility of seeing this place pass such amendments. Yet we are putting in place a two-tier system, which in some respects is a beautiful irony because the very parliamentary super scheme we are debating here has been a two-tier system for many years with MPs, federal and state, enjoying benefits far in excess of those enjoyed by their constituents who are lucky enough to have superannuation arrangements.</para>
					<para>While I am mentioning the states, it is interesting to see how quickly they fell into line like a pack of cards the moment this issue was brought into the open by the Leader of the Opposition. I acknowledge he kicked open the door to expose this issue, or not to expose it—that had already been well done by non party members over many years—but to acknowledge and reinforce the strength of the message that he was hearing from the electorate. It has not only happened since he has been opposition leader. I must acknowledge that he has mentioned it at various stages during his backbench career and, indeed, his opposition frontbench career. He has been consistent on this matter and I commend him for that, but we must go further. There are amendments on the table and I will listen to the arguments carefully.</para>
					<para>We are weaving a tangled mess in setting up a two-tier system—a mess of the political system’s own making. It could have been sorted out years ago by having an honest and proper debate—an independent inquiry on parliamentary salaries that are attached to a superannuation scheme that is properly funded. Preferably it would be a marketplace scheme at arms-length from the interference of members as trust members and the influence of the government of the day—a scheme matching that available to our constituents.</para>
					<para>All along we should have suffered the rises and falls of the marketplace and the battering that superannuation has suffered over recent years, as any of us who happen to have small superannuation savings and our constituents in the marketplace have recognised. There has been an absolute gutting of some people's savings in recent years because of the vagaries of the marketplace. If we are such disciples of the free market then why haven't we all along—in those 20-odd years of ecorationalism, where we have argued so strongly for the virtues of the marketplace in this post-Thatcher era—placed our own entitlements at the mercy of that very market that we go to the altar and pray to so regularly in this modern economic era? We could have done it but we did not.</para>
					<para>That debate about parliamentary salaries needs to be held soon, with all current entitlements on the table. With all the privileges, and I deliberately say 'privileges' and not 'entitlements' of office, put on the table—including travel, car, phone, phonecard, cab card and study tours, and for ministers and prime ministers there is even more, including housing—let us have a proper debate about salary. That is the debate we always should have had, out of which, and only out of which, comes the super guarantee of the day. If we do not think that that is good enough to guarantee long-term retirement benefits then we are in there with the rest of our constituents—we can adjust it, we can argue for it, we can suffer the pain and consequences of whatever legislation we put in place, and we are therefore party to the same standards that we apply to our constituents.</para>
					<para>Many—including some commentators and business leaders—disagree that we should make the changes, saying that the existing scheme provides fair compensation. Let us have the debate, once and for all, about what we are worth. Let us have an honest debate about what we are worth. It may be that our Prime Minister, according to an independent assessment, is worth a million dollars or half a million dollars—whatever the figure might be. Let us not have this argument being used to justify hidden entitlements and accoutrements—entitlements that should be called privileges—that top up what are argued to be inadequate salaries. Let us have the proper debate. Maybe we could look at the Singapore example or some other constituencies around the world. Let us look at their schemes and their payments. Let us come up with a proper figure. Let us separate the debates and, once and for all, bring this largesse to an end, because it is the great disconnect between us and those we represent.</para>

I welcome these bills because they cover a subject which the Greens have long held concerns about and which the wider community is deeply critical of—namely, the present federal parliamentary superannuation scheme.</para>

					<para>As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration so boldly declared in his second reading speech:</para>
					<quote>
						<para>The package of bills delivers on the Prime Minister's commitment to bring superannuation arrangements for parliamentarians in line with current community standards.</para>
					</quote>
					<para>That is right: 'in line with current community standards.' If only! In the very next sentence the parliamentary secretary goes on to tell us:</para>
					<quote>
						<para>The new arrangements will have no impact on the existing superannuation arrangements for sitting senators and members</para>
					</quote>
					<para>So once again we have the government saying one thing and doing another: spin doctoring, mistruths—whatever you want to call them. It is no wonder the public is cynical about politicians.</para>
					<para>I will address this glowing anomaly between what the government says and what the government does later in my speech. However, before talking about the merits or otherwise of these bills, let us just consider some of the historical context. The starting point here, of course, is section 48 of the Australian Constitution. Section 48 states:</para>
					<quote>
						<para>Until the Parliament otherwise provides, each senator and each member of the House of Representatives shall receive an allowance of four hundred pounds a year, to be reckoned from the day on which he takes his seat.</para>
					</quote>
					<para>Since the time of the writing of that constitutional decree—which looks decidedly frugal and sexist in today's terms—the parliament has seen the introduction of a seemingly never-ending set of bills, acts, regulations and Remuneration Tribunal determinations which have increased the allowances that federal politicians have received and impacted on state parliamentary schemes as well. These include the Parliamentary Retiring Allowances Act 1948, introduced by none other than Ben Chifley; the parliamentary retiring allowances acts of 1952, 1955 and 1959, all of which increased the allowances that politicians received; and the Parliamentary Retiring Allowances Act 1964, part of which was deemed to come into effect in 1948—a whole 16 years before its enactment. On top of that, there were changes to the parliamentary superannuation regime in 1965, 1966, 1968, 1973, 1978, 1979, 1981, 1982, 1992, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997 and 2001.</para>
					<para>It is fair to say that parliamentary superannuation is an issue close to politicians' hearts—so close in fact that the parliament continuously legislates about it. As a result, current members of parliament receive what many in the community consider to be massive taxpayer funded superannuation entitlements. There is no doubt about that. These entitlements are clearly out of step with community standards and have been for a long time now. For instance, who could forget the furore surrounding the former Queensland senator Bill O'Chee, who received a $45,000 per year pension, indexed for life, at the ripe old age of 33? This was when most other Australians could not get access to their super until at least the age of 55 or, more normally, 60 or 65. Michael Wooldridge, Peter Reith and Gareth Evans, to name a few, were all major beneficiaries of the current overly generous parliamentary superannuation scheme and are all now leading successful corporate lives with a nice little leg-up from the Australian taxpayer.</para>
					<para>The nice little earner is the 69 per cent of a $100,000-plus per year salary—a taxpayer funded superannuation contribution scheme—which politicians receive for every year they hold office. That contribution towers alongside the nine per cent superannuation contributions that the vast bulk of Australian workers receive. That is right: a 69 per cent contribution as opposed to nine per cent for ordinary Australians. On top of the superannuation tower, politicians receive other benefits, like the gold travel pass—a rort which I moved to abolish last year with the help of the member for Calare, and which has since been dutifully ignored by the government and the opposition.</para>
					<para>From all that, it is clear that the two bills before us today should be treated with a healthy dose of scepticism—even more than is typically warranted when we receive legislative proposals from this government. I hope the media pays as much attention to these bills and the issues dealt with here as the Australian Greens and the member for Calare and others have. In fact, there is a great story in these bills—a story that is repeated throughout history when people are allowed to make up rules for themselves. It is a classic case of 'feathering the nest' and 'an applied conflict of interest' rolled into one. The result is that parliamentary superannuation in Australia delivers millions into the pockets of retired politicians for our particular, special and exclusive brand of public service. In fact, the Department of Finance and Administration's 2002-03 annual report points out that parliamentary superannuation was provided for by the taxpayer to the extent of over $504 million during that year. That is a lot of university places, medical services, books and resources for our schools, and poverty alleviation, in anyone’s language.</para>
					<para>It is no wonder, then, that any discussion that concerns the size of politicians' superannuation is a sensitive one to politicians and that it hits a raw nerve out there in the wider community. In fact, it is largely taboo amongst politicians, with few, but notable, exceptions. These include Ted Mack, the former member for North Sydney, who, I understand, resigned from the parliament so that he would not be entitled to the parliamentary pension, which he strongly disagreed with. Likewise, the member for Calare and Greens Senator Bob Brown have been staunch advocates for change over recent years.</para>
					<para>The attitudes which gave rise to the present system stand in stark contrast to the views of the community, who often see politicians in a bad light as a result in part of just such so-called 'lurks and perks'. I will not express some of those public opinions here, but there is no doubt that many Australians perceive politicians as being in it for themselves and as pale silhouettes of civic duty, enjoying excessive superannuation payments. I have been a participant in this chamber for over 18 months now, and I believe that the vast majority of politicians in this place are hardworking, if not extremely hardworking. Whether we all agree with the actual work that various politicians do, right or wrong, it has nevertheless been argued over time that this kind of hard work deserves extra recognition in the form of extraordinary superannuation benefits.</para>
					<para>But whether it is hard work, right work or wrong work, the Australian Greens believe it does not require a 69 per cent publicly funded superannuation contribution in order for the fund to be fair and reasonable. As such, I will be seeking to amend these bills in the consideration in detail stage because I believe they do not go far enough in bringing federal parliamentary superannuation in line with community standards. Simply put, the view of the Australian Greens is that all politicians should get nine per cent funded superannuation—just the same as the rest of the Australian community. These bills do not achieve this.</para>
					<para>The particular policy genesis of these bills has been hinted at by previous speakers, and it came about on 12 February this year, just two days after the Leader of the Opposition announced he would move to cut superannuation for politicians, the Governor-General and federal judges, should he win government. The Leader of the Opposition has been in here today, claiming credit for this legislation. Reacting to the member for Werriwa's announcements and following publicity surrounding my own bill to abolish the gold travel pass—and following the work of the member for Calare and others over previous years—the Prime Minister finally responded with what can only be described as lukewarm fury. He announced his own parliamentary superannuation legislation in an attempt to suffocate the gasps of relief permeating throughout the Australian community that perhaps at last this issue was going to be put to bed.</para>
					<para>What a surprising turnaround! The community has been crying out for this kind of reform for decades. In fact, as he has previously indicated, the member for Calare first raised this issue in 1998 in the House and introduced his own private member’s bill in 2001 and again in 2003. None of this received a peep of support from the government or the opposition—until now. If we fast-forward to 12 February 2004 we see that, when the Leader of the Opposition mentions it, two days later the PM does it. Is this the Prime Minister's new approach to governing in 2004 perhaps? Is it government by addressing community concerns or, rather, does the Prime Minister now take his orders from the opposition leader?</para>
					<para>These bills were obviously created to counter the support the opposition was receiving in the community for its belated, and I do mean belated, embrace of a more egalitarian parliamentary superannuation scheme—and all smack-bang in the context of an election year. That is why the government is proposing this legislation now. There is really no other reason, particularly when the government has had ample time to do so since 1996. In turn, it seems that both bills were cobbled together just in time to be buried amongst the 2004 federal budget circus. How convenient that is. Is the government hoping to minimise the analysis of the rort that is our current parliamentary superannuation scheme? As the member for Calare has pointed out, there needs to be more detailed investigation into the whole issue of remuneration for parliamentarians.</para>
					<para>'Let's get on with the show,' says the government. But a rort is a rort is a rort. That is why the Australian parliament should close down excessive parliamentary superannuation for all parliamentarians. Instead, though, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration in his second reading speech reminds us:</para>
					<quote>
						<para>The new arrangements will have no impact on the existing superannuation arrangements for sitting senators and members.</para>
					</quote>
					<para>That is not good enough. These bills are a mirage and, if they are enacted in their current form, members of the parliament will continue to be labelled as rorters. No-one should be fooled by this. Once again, greed and self-interest come into play. If these bills are passed, there will be three different schemes of superannuation applying to members of the federal parliament, based on when the member was elected. If that is not policy on the run, it is certainly discriminatory.</para>
					<para>Firstly, there will be arrangements for politicians elected prior to 2001, who will also be able to obtain their pensions prior to the age of 55. Secondly, there will be arrangements for politicians elected after 2001, who will not be able to receive superannuation until after they turn 55 but will stay on the higher 69 per cent rate. Finally, the new stream of politicians elected at the next election and subsequent elections will receive nine per cent funded superannuation. Frankly, it is a policy mess, and it is a clear demonstration of what happens when politicians protect their own.</para>
					<para>This is not a new theme. In fact, debates surrounding the introduction of the first statutory parliamentary superannuation scheme encompassed in the Parliamentary Retiring Allowances Act 1948 reveal that history is once again repeating itself. The Hansard of 9 December 1948 reveals that one member of the House was concerned that the effect of one provision of the bill, as it then was, would be to:</para>
					<quote>
						<para>… extend to present members who are defeated at the next general election a degree of favouritism which will not be extended to others in the Parliament in the future.</para>
					</quote>
					<para>And who was that member, who was so right to champion the injustice for future members of parliament? It was none other than the then member for Wentworth and acting opposition leader, Liberal Mr Eric Harrison.</para>
					<para>That is exactly what is happening with these bills. Current members are untouched by these bills and, frankly, it is just not good enough. Politicians should be treated in the same way as the rest of the community—period. That means closing down the 69 per cent taxpayer funded contribution scheme now. Accordingly, in the consideration in detail stage I will be moving the amendments circulated in my name, which seek to bring all politicians' superannuation entitlements in line with community standards. As the parliamentary secretary so proudly declared:</para>
					<quote>
						<para>Having three different remuneration systems running at the same time is simply ludicrous.</para>
					</quote>
					<para>Parliamentary superannuation can only be judged by what it achieves. Therefore, until it is reduced across the board, it is bound to be seen as a rort by the community—and this needs to be rectified.</para>

						<para>—I rise to speak in support of the <inline ref="R2028">Parliamentary Superannuation Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2027">Parliamentary Superannuation and Other Entitlements Legislation Amendment Bill 2004</inline>. Together, these bills close down the comparatively overgenerous parliamentary contributory superannuation scheme and open a new superannuation scheme for all new federal members elected at or after the next general election. Judging by the number of electoral bribes dished out last night in what I predict will be the Treasurer's final budget speech one way or another, the election might be closer than many previously thought. I first must congratulate the government for adopting a comparatively fairer and more just policy on politicians' super. But let me point out that everyone is well aware that it was not a move of principle but a move of fear—fear of a loss of credibility with the electorate. And, I point out, it was fear which underpinned last night's highspending, short-term budget.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>It took the Howard government only two days back in February to execute one of the most monumental backflips in Australian politics, described aptly by one notable political commentator as a backflip of the order that would do the Howard family's bedtime story character, Mr Flip-Flop, proud. This backflip came only after one of the most vitriolic internal conflicts faced by this government— a conflict that almost turned into a coalition party room revolt. Even a noncynic like me could see that this policy backflip occurred because the Leader of the Opposition, in the rise and rise of Mark Latham, had the leadership bottle to tackle what had become in the public's mind an unacceptable practice in comparison with the superannuation entitlements and schemes affecting so many other Australians. Quite simply, the motivating factor for the Leader of the Opposition was that it was well and truly time to change the system. For the Prime Minister, however, it became time to change the system because the Leader of the Opposition moved to change it.</para> 					<para>The Leader of the Opposition has already reflected on some of the comments of the Prime Minister and his colleagues who rushed to defend the existing scheme, so I will not repeat them here. Let us face it: Prime Minister Howard in all his long 30 years in parliament—a very long 30 years, I must add—has never shown any intention of closing the parliamentary superannuation scheme, with its comparatively extravagant benefits. In fact, soon after being elected to this parliament in 1998—and, like all new members, I had little knowledge of what was involved in the parliamentary superannuation scheme—I remember the Prime Minister being highly irritated by a question from a member, who is currently in the House, on this issue. It was the first time I laid eyes on the good-looking member for Calare.</para>

							<para>No interest, no need, no go—that was the Prime Minister's reply to your very irritating question about this contribution scheme. Whilst remembering this occasion, as one does when procedures and environments are novel and strange, I recalled that when the member for Calare asked his question not only was the Prime Minister irritated but so too were many members—indeed, even my colleagues. You could hear a pin drop as the Prime Minister rose to respond to this irritating question.</para>
						</talk.start>
					</continue>
					<para>Immediately prior to the question being asked, there was the general low-level talking that sometimes occurs in question time, but it certainly stopped soon after the question. Needless to say, the Prime Minister's negative reply to the honourable member's request to change the superannuation scheme soon saw the general hubbub return—I suggest probably more in relief than through habit in this case. As I have noted before and as many observers were quick to point out, John Howard's decision to close the scheme was nothing more than knee-jerk politics—not a reasoned decision. It was a decision taken in the hope that jumping on the bandwagon would somehow help an arrogant but tired and fading government regain lost political ground in the light of the rise and rise of Mark Latham.</para>
					<para>But let me return to the legislation in hand. The existing parliamentary superannuation scheme was set up in 1948, as some other members have mentioned, by, of course, the Labor government—who else would create revolutionary innovative policy?—led by Ben Chifley. The reasons given for the establishment of a scheme for parliamentarians were an acknowledgment that at that time entering parliamentary service often had the effect of reducing a parliamentarian's opportunity to re-establish a career. Often existing superannuation rights from previous employment were lost when the parliamentarian left an employer prior to retirement age, and it was felt that some sort of compensation was needed to encourage people of high calibre to enter parliament. As Ben Chifley stated in his second reading speech to the bill in 1948:</para>
					<quote>
						<para>In its general purpose the scheme aims to meet the situation, long recognised by members of all parties, that men or women who serve in parliament often sacrifice opportunities to provide against the day when their parliamentary careers come to an end.</para>
					</quote>
					<para>Chifley pointed out that most of those who were likely to benefit from the introduction of retiring allowances were 'not drawn from the wealthy classes' and had 'no substantial private means'.</para>
					<para>Let us recall the situation of the day when this issue was being debated in Chifley's parliament. Members were generally older when they entered parliament and, on losing their seats, age would often prevent them obtaining further employment. Many were in occupations that would be very difficult to return to if they lost their seats. Unlike today, when professionals dominate our parliamentary ranks, many parliamentarians of Chifley’s day were tradesmen or semiskilled workers who could only with great difficulty return to their original occupation and were unlikely to have accrued assets that could support them and their families in their post parliamentary lives.</para>
					<para>The scheme was generous for its time— although it was, I would like to point out, much less generous than it probably is today. It recognised that the nature of parliamentary service—service that could be ended by a vote—was somewhat different to employment in the wider community, which was at that time largely permanent in nature. As the then Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Queensland Liberal Senator the Hon. Neil O’Sullivan, stated during the debate:</para>
					<quote>
						<para>People in private industry, occupying positions carrying salaries equal to the allowances of honourable senators, cannot be sacked overnight without due compensation.</para>
					</quote>
					<para>But Australia has come a long way since 1948 and much has changed in both the workplace and superannuation. Superannuation is now universal, as a consequence of Labor's visionary move to introduce the compulsory superannuation guarantee, starting with an initial three per cent contribution level in 1987 and rising to the present nine per cent in 2002-03—a move, I would remind this House, that the Liberal Party vehemently opposed from opposition. Until 15 years ago, only relatively privileged and mainly male employees—those working for government or some more generous large employers—had access to superannuation. Today 88 per cent of employees have superannuation, thanks to Labor.</para>
					<para>Today, parliamentarians enter parliament at a relatively younger age and more than often have professional qualifications. On leaving parliament, many former members are employed by both private industry and the Public Service for consultancies. Others— for instance, lawyers—can more easily re-enter their former professions. The general work force is now more transient. Suddenly departing the parliament at an election is no longer so different to being made redundant with little or no notice—which is, unfortunately, the fate of many Australians. Superannuation is not lost if a person leaves one employer for another or, more specifically, to enter parliament, and parliamentarians are far more likely to own assets than their predecessors in Chifley's day. Consequently, the public cynicism about the generosity of the existing scheme is understandable, although it is probably accurate to say it is not guided by the history of the initial circumstances surrounding the introduction of the parliamentary superannuation scheme in 1948.</para>
					<para>The community standard today for superannuation is Labor's nine per cent superannuation guarantee in an accumulation fund. Comparatively speaking, parliamentarians’ superannuation benefits are some seven times the level of benefit of most Australians. In addition, it is a fund with benefits that are provided largely from public moneys. Labor decided that it was only right to change this situation. The time has come, and the Labor leader and our caucus adopted our policy to do just this. This was a Labor decision, not a Howard government policy. So today, although these are government bills, in reality it is Labor making law from opposition with, might I say, the support of the Independents in this House. One Independent in particular has put this case before this parliament for several years now, and I do recognise the work of the member for Calare. But so be it.</para>
					<para>Labor does not believe the government's bills go far enough. There has been, and no doubt will be, argument as to whether the scheme should be closed down completely. Indeed, we have heard arguments previously for this case. The existing scheme is a defined benefit scheme—that is, it provides a guaranteed outcome, regardless of the fund’s earnings, rates and fees. This does differ dramatically from the accumulation fund which gives no guarantee of a final savings figure. Defined benefit funds were not just confined to politicians. In the past, they were widespread in the public sector and at management levels in the private sector. However, they have been declining rapidly in recent years, for various reasons—not least because they are costly to fund. Nevertheless, the trend has been to close the funds to new members. Whether or not this was in the public service, it has resulted in state parliaments throughout Australia closing funds—but they have not done that retrospectively. The reason for this is that the closure of the schemes would generate rights to substantial compensation by the members, because of the impact retrospective closure would bring in these circumstances.</para>
					<para>Allowing the existing scheme to remain for current members and former members, Labor recognises that the scheme is, in general, comparatively generous to all beneficiaries, but even more generous to ministers and other office holders. Consequently, Labor is moving an amendment to cap the amount of a minister’s or office holder’s allowances that can be included in the calculation of retirement benefits under the existing scheme. Ministers and other office holders are paid substantial allowances in recognition of the additional workload they must carry. The Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Scheme, using these allowances in a complex formula to calculate retirement benefits, results in retiring ministers and office holders being rewarded even more generously than other retiring parliamentarians. The differences are indeed substantial. Labor does not say that the role of ministers and other office holders should be completely ignored, but it does believe that some of the more senior office holders are comparatively over-compensated in relation to superannuation benefits.</para>
					<para>Therefore, Labor proposes to cap the level of allowance that can be used in calculating the superannuation benefits of all office holders appointed after the next election—to the level of a cabinet minister. Once again, I commend the government for adopting Labor's policy on politicians' superannuation, even though the reasons for its doing so are thoroughly dishonest—much like the motives for the government’s pork-barrelling in the 2004-05 budget announced last night.</para>

						<para>—I rise in my place, as the member for Chifley, to support the <inline ref="R2028">Parliamentary Superannuation Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2027">Parliamentary Superannuation and Other Entitlements Legislation Amendment Bill 2004</inline>. I am particularly pleased that a number of speakers have referred to the former Prime Minister, Ben Chifley, as the instigator of a parliamentary scheme. Chifley, of course, had very strong views on the role of members of parliament and he had views about their remuneration. I think it is fair to say that at the time that Chifley rose in the House to institute a parliamentary scheme, members of parliament were held in far higher and greater esteem than perhaps they are currently. That is something, I think, that both sides of the House need to address. This bill, as others have explained, is closing off the current scheme to any new entrant, subsequent to the next election. We are proposing a scheme whereby nine per cent of salary will be paid into an accumulation fund rather than a defined benefit scheme.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>The member for Braddon mentioned the universal superannuation that was introduced in the Hawke-Keating years. I am often asked, 'What do you think was the best thing that occurred in those 13 years of government?' It is true that there were a lot of good things, but extending superannuation to everyone—stopping it being just the preserve of public servants and senior executives in private enterprise and extending it to all working men and women—was, I think, a great achievement.</para>
					<para>What was our vision? As the honourable member for Braddon has said, currently the superannuation contribution rate stands at nine per cent. But we did not want it to be just nine per cent. We have been mocked so many times in this House for the fact that we wanted the government to contribute another three per cent into people's superannuation—to lift the rate to 12 per cent. It was a decision this Treasurer, Peter Costello, took to not honour that commitment. He scrapped it. We could go into a lot of what-ifs and whatmight-have-beens but, clearly, Labor losing the 1996 election made a huge difference to the people of Australia in terms of their superannuation entitlements—and we were looking, again, for a further contribution of three per cent from individuals, because we always believed our universal scheme should have been set at 15 per cent. As a member of the party in this place in those times, I have never lost that vision, and I hope, as a member of parliament, that I will see all Australians being entitled to 15 per cent.</para>	
					<para>For new members of parliament, the rate is going to be nine per cent and under this legislation they are going to be allowed to salary sacrifice up to 15 per cent. Quite honestly, I have some reservations about this. This is not a principle that the Labor Party normally embraces, because we have found in these matters that there often needs to be a compulsory contribution, not a voluntary contribution.</para>
					<para>To my mind, this legislation has a flaw, and that is the fact that there is no compulsory contribution. I do not want to argue about whether that contribution should be set at five per cent or 10 per cent, but I have the feeling that there should be a compulsory additional element to it of some percentage. The Liberal Party always say, 'Leave it up to the individual. They will make the right decisions.' We have always said, 'There are always good reasons for families to spend money. Unless we make it compulsory, it won’t be saved.'</para>
					<para>Let me further reinforce this view. There is a lot of mythology about parliamentary superannuation. Myth No. 1 is that all members of parliament get a pension. That is wrong—they do not. In fact, in this place the average service is seven years. The average service for a member of the House of Representatives is seven years. They do not qualify for a pension; they have never qualified for a pension. What would happen to them is that they would get their contributions back, plus interest—and not a lot, I have to say. The current scheme was biased towards those who served sufficiently long to get a pension. All members pay 11½ per cent compulsorily into the current superannuation scheme. The government is going to put nine per cent in and a new member after the next election can put zero salary sacrifice in, or up to 50 per cent salary sacrifice in. I do not particularly like that principle.</para>
					<para>I do not often take issue with the honourable member for Calare, but his remarks were perhaps ungenerous when it came to the setting of salaries for members of parliament. I think we ought to pay tribute to Gough Whitlam. Even though he was unsuccessful, he wanted to change the system whereby members of parliament—or, more correctly, I guess, the government of the day—would rush a bill into the parliament that meant a salary increase for members of parliament. It would be voted on and passed, and thereby members would get a salary increase. The member for Calare was accurate when he said that historically some of those allowances we receive, like electoral allowances, have been made by a remuneration tribunal, which Gough set up. Gough said it was wrong in public policy for members of parliament to be passing bills to determine their own salary and that having an independent remuneration tribunal was going to stop the public angst about our salaries.</para>
					<para>I think the tribunals have been independent. I would not wish to cast any aspersion on members of the tribunal, whether they have been appointed under coalition governments or Labor governments. I think the individuals on those tribunals have honestly tried to serve the public interest in their deliberation. I do not believe that they have improperly recommended anything or done anything other than uphold the best traditions of public service. We tried to have this independent salary setting mechanism. Frankly, it did not work. It did not lessen the public angst about salaries being set or members of parliament being given an increase.</para>
					<para>Later under Labor we attempted again to find a new mechanism to try and avoid this public criticism, by tying the salary of members of parliament to the level of a principal executive officer in the Public Service. The state governments, I might say, have all very cleverly set their own salaries at $500 below that of a federal member, so there is an automatic mechanism built in for them, and they can point the finger at the federal mechanism as the reason for increases in salaries.</para>
					<para>But I want to go back to Ben Chifley, because when he started to appoint new arbitration conciliators he valued their role and the contributions that they would make as conciliation commissioners so much that he said their salary should be set at the salary of a member of parliament. I have not recently looked at what that group of people get, but I think it is in the order of $50,000 or $60,000 more than members of parliament get.</para>
					<para>Where is all this leading? I think that we do need to have open processes about determining parliamentary salaries. Notwithstanding the fact that the public still continue to criticise us, I think we do need institutions like the remuneration tribunal that is at arm's length. It is independent. It can make its own decisions and recommendations to the government of the day and it can make its own determinations</para>
					<para>I will say something about the press, who often fire away bullets about what members of parliament receive and do not receive. I do not particularly have a problem with that at all; I just wish that they would be more accurate in their comments or in what they allege is the factual situation. But that is what we have a free press for. However, I think the great irony is that, when you introduce a private member's motion here that members of the press gallery should have the same disclosure obligations as members of parliament to ensure transparency in the process, there is terrible outrage about them being subjected to the same thing. That is somewhat of a double standard.</para>
					<para>In finalising my contribution, I want to reiterate that this was a proposal announced by our leader, Mark Latham, the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Werriwa. I am supporting this legislation. As a Labor member I have honestly expressed my angst that, whilst salary sacrifices can be made by incoming members at the next election, there is not a compulsory component to it. In terms of community standards for those people, for example, who served in this place for seven years or less and did not get a pension, they certainly did not get a redundancy package—and you are entitled to one, and it is demanded by law, quite rightly. They did not get a severance package. And I would have to say that, if I now tried to go back to my former area of employment in Telstra, the technology has changed so much—</para>

							<para>Yes, I would not be let loose on the public. I know Telstra has its problems, but it would not want to magnify them any more. Notwithstanding the fact that we are facing what I call a shareholders meeting of the people of Australia, I have not yet contemplated what I might do if I were not reelected or if I should resign at some future point. But I would like to think that I would have some options other than having to lobby. There are some members of parliament who actually think, 'Yes, we've done a good job for our electorate. We've really fought hard—won some and lost some.' But should becoming paid lobbyists be the only thing that members of parliament can look to and aspire to when they leave this place?</para>

					<para>I will finish on this point: in terms of members on this side or that side of the House, I am impressed, by and large, with the quality of new members coming in—you included, Mr Deputy Speaker Wilkie. Notwithstanding that we do a public service and that we value the public service that we try to do on behalf of our constituents, I think sometimes we ought to bear in mind the impact that we have on our families. We are not in a unique profession in terms of negative impacts on families, but this is a high-impact job as far as families are concerned.</para>

						<para>—I would like to speak briefly about the <inline ref="R2028">Parliamentary Superannuation Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2027">Parliamentary Superannuation and Other Entitlements Legislation Amendment Bill 2004</inline>. Rather than go through the issues that have been raised by other members, I would like to make a couple of comments about some of the things that the member for Calare raised and to introduce a couple of other arguments into the debate.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>Obviously, as most members would know, I am one of those members who have served in another parliament—I was in the state parliament of New South Wales for 10 years—and to that extent I have qualified for superannuation under the New South Wales parliamentary remuneration arrangements. That is not to say that I am receiving any benefits from that, because serving as a federal member precludes you from receiving the benefits of superannuation at the state level. But there are a number of others in this parliament who have served in other parliaments as well. One issue that is raised from time to time is the issue of members of parliament perhaps receiving superannuation remuneration from two parliaments. As I understand the federal regulations, you have to be here for something like 12 years to qualify. To my friends in The Nationals I would probably suggest that I probably will not be here in 12 years time, if that is of any significance to them.</para>
					<para>The issues that I would like to raise are serious, and they follow on from the previous speaker's remarks to a certain extent. In terms of the value that our communities put on members of parliament and the costs, not only in a financial sense but the family related costs and other costs in being a representative, no-one makes us be a representative, and there are plenty of others who are quite happy to be representatives if we move out of the way. But I do think that one of the reasons that the superannuation issue has been raised over the years and does—as the member for Calare said—set us apart from those whom we represent is the fact that parliamentarians have tended in some ways to sell themselves short. They do not like to go to the people and say that they are actually worth more money.</para>
					<para>One of the things on which I agree with the member for Calare is that we do need some sort of independent inquiry into parliamentary entitlements and salaries that actually looks at what value the community puts on members of parliament. I think that once this legislation is passed the salary levels are going to have to be reviewed. Irrespective of which area they represent, most members of parliament that I know at both a state and a federal level work extremely hard. It is not only ministers and prime ministers who work extremely hard; backbenchers work extremely hard as well. If we looked at an hourly rate for the hours that members of parliament put in, ours would have to be one of the lower paid jobs in those terms.</para>
					<para>Having said that, we do it because we love it and we feel as though we are making a contribution to the community and the national good. Most of us believe in that, and most people do a good job in representing their constituents at a whole range of levels, not only in the parliament but obviously by way of other communications as well. But I do think it is time that we had a look at the salary issue, the entitlement issue, and—if at all possible—made it much more transparent than it has been in the past. I do not think there is anything to be ashamed of in being a member of parliament, and I do not think it is anything to be ashamed of to say, if you are the Prime Minister or Treasurer of this country, that you deserve a financial package that compensates you for the job that you have done. If we look at the remuneration packages that some of our senior executives in business get, that of the Prime Minister, for instance, really pales into insignificance.</para>
					<para>The other thing that I agree with the member for Calare about—and I will be supporting his amendment—is giving people the option to make their own decisions in relation to their superannuation arrangements. I think there should be a process where, if a person feels that they do not want to accept the arranged superannuation entitlements, or for that matter other entitlements—and this might be because of a person's own financial position or it might be for other reasons they have—there should be a process where they can opt out of those arrangements. I do not see any problem in doing that. I do not think it applies any undue pressure to those who decide to opt in. But I think it gives a choice to those people who, for their own reasons, may want to decide to opt out of a particular package. Obviously they could possibly do it in other ways by making donations to various charities and other organisations as well.</para>
					<para>I just wanted to make my view plain. I will be supporting the amendment put forward by the member for Calare. I will not be supporting the amendment put forward by the member for Cunningham. I will listen with interest in a moment to the debate being put by the Labor Party in relation to remuneration of the Prime Minister and others, to see what that actually means in terms of precedent and recognition of the scale and the magnitude of the jobs that they actually do.</para>

						<para>—At the outset, the government would like to thank all those honourable members who participated in the debate—particularly the honourable member for Moncrieff, who made a very thoughtprovoking and worthwhile contribution. It will not come as a surprise to honourable members opposite that the government does not intend to accept the amendment moved by my friend the member for Kingston or indeed the other amendments proposed by the Independents.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>The legislation currently before the chamber is the <inline ref="R2028">Parliamentary Superannuation Bill 2004</inline> and also the <inline ref="R2027">Parliamentary Superannuation and Other Entitlements Legislation Amendment Bill 2004</inline>. The first bill is part of a package which will put in place new superannuation arrangements for members who join the federal parliament at or after the next general election. This will involve a government contribution of nine per cent of the parliamentary salary of a member or senator paid to a complying superannuation fund or retirement savings account chosen by the senator or member or, where no choice is made, to a default fund. Honourable members would be aware that the government has brought this legislation into the chamber very quickly to deliver on the Prime Minister’s commitment to align parliamentary superannuation with superannuation for the general community. The member for New England in his speech outlined some of the rather complicated issues in relation to parliamentary superannuation.</para>
					<para>These changes build on the substantial changes that the Howard government made to parliamentary superannuation in 2001, which defer the payment of pensions in the existing parliamentary scheme until age 55 for new members and senators elected at or after the November 2001 election. That change imposed a higher standard of preservation on parliamentarians than applies to other Australians who receive pensions. These changes will not affect the superannuation arrangements for sitting members and senators, who will not be able to transfer to the new arrangements.</para>
					<para>The government does not support retrospective changes to accrued superannuation. Of course, retrospectivity in most circumstances is a most undesirable thing. Such changes would not be in line with the superannuation arrangements applying generally in the community, which protect accrued superannuation entitlements. Existing senators and members will have made financial arrangements and commitments based on the expectation of continued membership of the current scheme. It would be unfair and inequitable to reduce their entitlements retrospectively.</para>
					<para>The accompanying bill—that is, the Parliamentary Superannuation and Other Entitlements Legislation Amendment Bill 2004—is also part of the package that delivers on the Prime Minister's commitment to bring parliamentary superannuation in line with current community standards. This bill amends the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act 1948 to close the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Scheme to new members from the next election. The bill also provides for the suspension of a pension being paid to a former member or senator who rejoins the parliament from the next general election. The senator or member will receive superannuation for his or her new term of parliamentary service under the new arrangements to be provided for in the parliamentary superannuation act. The suspension of the pension will be lifted after the completion of that new parliamentary term.</para>
					<para>The bill also amends the Remuneration and Allowances Act 1990 to provide a salary sacrifice facility to members and senators covered by the new arrangements. This will enable them to supplement their superannuation through salary sacrifice. I listened with interest to the comments made by the honourable member for Chifley in relation to the valuable role carried out by the Remuneration Tribunal.</para>
					<para>The government, as I said before, does not support the amendments moved by the opposition to retrospectively reduce the accrued entitlements under the PCSS of any existing MP or senator. The government does not support retrospective changes to accrued superannuation, and such changes, as I indicated before, would not be in line with the superannuation arrangements applying generally in the community which protect accrued superannuation entitlements. Also, existing senior ministers and office holders who would be affected by the opposition’s proposed amendments to the bill have contributed a significant portion of their ministerial or office holder salary towards their accrued entitlements. I think most Australians would agree that it would be completely unfair and inequitable to retrospectively reduce their entitlements.</para>
					<para>In the time available to me, I would like to turn to some of the individual remarks made by various honourable members, including the Leader of the Opposition, in this debate. The Leader of the Opposition claims that the government adopted Labor's policy on reducing an overgenerous parliamentary superannuation scheme. He referred in his speech to Labor's proposal to cap the benefits of the Prime Minister, senior ministers and senior office holders to the level of benefits payable to cabinet ministers. The member for Werriwa actually suggested that his own benefits would be reduced by something between half a million dollars and $1.9 million.</para>
					<para>Let us look at the facts. The member for Werriwa's proposal was to close the parliamentary superannuation scheme and refer the matter of a new scheme to the Remuneration Tribunal. The Prime Minister in his announcement indicated that the government was going much further than this and has committed itself to bringing parliamentary superannuation into line with community standards by introducing legislation for a nine per cent accumulation scheme. Also under the proposal outlined by the Leader of the Opposition, any change would not occur until the election after next—that is, in 2007—whereas the amendments being proposed in these bills will take effect from the time of the next election. And you do not have to be a mental genius to be aware that it is highly likely that the next election will be held sometime during calendar year 2004.</para>
					<para>The government has been particularly mindful of the concern expressed in the community and has acted immediately to bring about change to the current arrangements before the next election. As the Prime Minister has said, the government is always prepared to listen to a good idea, and I would like to thank the Leader of the Opposition for his support in facilitating the passage of these bills through the parliament in a timely way. However, in relation to his proposal to amend the current superannuation scheme to reduce the benefit entitlements of the Prime Minister, other senior ministers and office holders, the government does not support these amendments. The arrangements proposed by the government would ensure that all members of parliament, both existing and new, in future parliaments have their superannuation benefits based on their total parliamentary salaries, regardless of the amount of those salaries. When the Prime Minister announced that the government would close the PCSS and establish the new arrangements, he made it clear they would not be retrospective. This is why the bills are as they are: to implement the Prime Minister’s commitments. Consequently, all existing MPs will remain under the existing arrangements.</para>
					<para>The member for Kingston would be well aware that this is consistent with past practice. When an Australian government closes an existing superannuation scheme for its employees and establishes a new scheme, such as occurred when the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme was closed to new members in 1990, the accrued entitlements of the remaining members of the closed scheme are not reduced retrospectively. Of course, the CSS was closed during the time of a Labor government, when the member for Kingston may well have been an adviser to a senior minister in that government.</para>
					<para>The Prime Minister, senior ministers and senior office holders entered parliament on a particular remuneration basis, and they have contributed their entitlements on that basis. Thus, it is not fair that people, just because they have obtained a very high level of office, should be prejudiced in the way that the member for Kingston and his leader would like to see them prejudiced. It would be unfair and inequitable to retrospectively reduce their entitlements when some senior parliamentarians have organised their financial affairs on the basis of their accrued entitlements, which is not an unreasonable thing for anyone to do. Because of the superannuation industry supervision rules that protect the accrued benefits of members of superannuation schemes, this form of reduction would be prohibited in most other superannuation schemes.</para>
					<para>It also raises the question as to whether past excess contributions based on those higher salaries should be refunded and whether ongoing contributions should be reduced. I think most people listening to this debate would agree that the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition is nothing more than a cheap stunt on the part of the opposition. It is just playing politics. Surely, if the opposition believes that it is appropriate that the Prime Minister should be paid a higher salary than a minister, it is entirely appropriate that the salary for superannuation purposes of that member should also reflect that differential. It is an absolute nonsense to say otherwise. The argument of the opposition is further weakened by the fact that it is only intending to apply the principle retrospectively. By not applying the same principle to the new scheme, the opposition is acknowledging that it is appropriate for the superannuation contributions of members to reflect their total parliamentary salary.</para>
					<para>Any future Prime Minister, senior minister or senior office holder who joins the new arrangements will be treated exactly like any other new or returning MP. His or her nine per cent government contributions will be calculated on the basis of their total parliamentary salaries. Not to allow the Prime Minister, senior ministers and senior office holders to continue to contribute to superannuation and to receive superannuation benefits based on their total parliamentary salaries would therefore be inequitable. It would also be inequitable not to allow existing MPs who in the future may become the Prime Minister, a senior minister or a senior office holder to contribute to superannuation and receive benefits based on their total parliamentary salaries under the PCSS.</para>
					<para>In relation to the comment made by the Leader of the Opposition about sacrificing his own superannuation, it is just farcical to suggest that the Leader of the Opposition would in some way, shape or form save the Australian taxpayer $1.9 million. A simple calculation of the facts indicates that, for the Leader of the Opposition to save the Australian taxpayer $1.9 million—in other words, for his own benefits to be cut by that amount—he would have to be Prime Minister for a very long time. It is not certain at all that he will ever be Prime Minister, and it would be a very unfortunate state of affairs if at the election later this year the people of Australia were to elect the Leader of the Opposition to the most important office in the land, which has been very well carried out by the current Prime Minister.</para>
					<para>I always listen very carefully to the thoughtful contributions of the member for Chifley, who has been here for a long time. He brings to this place a reflection on life’s experience. We all are, of course, the collection of our life's experiences. I was interested to hear that the member for Chifley said that the bills should require a compulsory superannuation contribution from MPs covered by the new nine per cent arrangements. The new arrangements are the same as those applying generally in the community, which do not require compulsory member superannuation contributions.</para>
					<para>The member for Calare, who disagrees with the government—although he did give the government credit for the extent that the bills currently traverse—welcomed the bills but said they did not go far enough and referred to his claim that existing members should be able to opt in to the new superannuation arrangements. He will be disappointed to know that the government is not going to support that particular amendment.</para>

						<para>—When you speak to it, I will certainly be giving you the government's response. The member for Cunningham also welcomed the bills but claimed that they did no go far enough. He had a point of view that no-one else in the parliament would share, and I suspect that no-one in the community would share, namely that the current scheme is a rort and should be closed down. What we have at the moment is a reform of superannuation arrangements in accordance with community expectations. I think it would be entirely inappropriate to suggest that this bill in some way is a rort. When the Prime Minister announced that the government would close the existing scheme and establish the new arrangements, he made it clear they would not be retrospective, and I think most people would accept that that is a pretty fair point of view.</para>
					</continue>
					<para>There has been a good debate in relation to these bills. There has been some politicking and misinformation, particularly on the part of the Leader of the Opposition, but I am pleased that there appears to be sufficient consensus to ensure a speedy passage of these bills through the House after the opposition and Independent amendments are disposed of. I would like to commend to the chamber, on that basis, both of these two important pieces of legislation which deliver on the Prime Minister's commitment.</para>

					<para>The amendments change clause 5 of the <inline ref="R2028">Parliamentary Superannuation Bill 2004</inline> to ensure that all federal politicians gain access to a community standard nine per cent funded parliamentary superannuation scheme and that the present 69 per cent contribution scheme is shut down. The aim of these amendments is clear: to bring the scheme into line with community standards. This is about the equity of the current system so that the perceptions out there among the community are that it is an equitable system for politicians and it is in line with community standards.</para>
					<para>As I mentioned in my previous speech, if these bills are passed as they stand we will have a very complicated superannuation scheme in existence. There will be arrangements for politicians who were elected prior to 2001 and arrangements for politicians elected after 2001 who will continue on the 69 per cent funded scheme. We could see, for another 25 or 30 years or more, politicians in this place being eligible for the 69 per cent funded scheme. With it will come concern in the community about this whole issue. Despite what the parliamentary secretary has just said, I have had people in the community say to me that this current system is a rort and should be closed down. I am not alone in this. I think there is real cause for concern out there about so-called rorts. The adoption of these amendments will clearly bring this place into line with community standards. Therefore I commend the amendments to the House.</para>

						<para>—I have just a few words in support of the member for Cunningham. Although, as I said in my speech in the second reading debate, I have had substantial advice on the problems connected with the amendments that the member for Cunningham has moved, I did say that we are creating a double, two-tiered system here and I sense, given the lack of speakers on the government side, that there is intense discomfort around this legislation and the fact that we are here debating the issue at all.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>We have an opportunity to seriously look at the just compensation issue. The issue has been forced onto the agenda in recent months by the somewhat precipitate action, I would say, of the Leader of the Opposition. The Prime Minister, I would suggest with very much a lack of will, has had to follow suit in the lead-up to the election. The conundrum and the problems have been created by the political imperative in this debate. That is why the amendments that the member for Cunningham has moved are as reasonable as the lack of proper debate of this whole issue has been quite unreasonable. I will be supporting these amendments notwithstanding the difficulties that need to be sorted out to bring them into effect.</para>

						<para>—As I indicated in my summing-up speech, the government does accept that it is necessary to bring about changes to the way in which superannuation arrangements for members of parliament exist but, for the reasons I outlined earlier, we do not support retrospectivity. We believe that the rule that applies when superannuation arrangements are changed in other spheres of human activity should also apply to parliamentary superannuation and that the accrued benefits and the arrangements under which people entered into parliament at the time they did ought to remain. That is why we accept that there have to be changes to parliamentary superannuation. I do respect the point of view of the members for Cunningham and Calare, but we believe that it is inappropriate to, in effect, retrospectively change the basis on which existing members are paid.</para>

					</motion>
					<para>My amendment is to the <inline ref="R2028">Parliamentary Superannuation Bill 2004</inline>. In moving my first amendment, which provides for any sitting member, if re-elected, to opt into the new arrangements, I would like to put on the record that much has been made of the idea of re-establishing trust and confidence in the electorate, yet neither major party is prepared to apply these new super arrangements to themselves. This hardly re-establishes the trust that we want to achieve. In fact, it reinforces the opinion of many that there is no will to bring parliamentary entitlements into line with normal community standards.</para>
					<para>There have been backbench revolts on both sides, as I understand it, making the application of the new arrangement to all MPs politically impossible—as we have seen in the most recent division. They are supported by plenty of technical arguments, as I said earlier, and the advice I have had is that, with just compensation and such, it may be impossible. But again, as I said, this imbroglio is being created by the precipitate way in which this whole thing has been brought on in recent months. I propose to amend this legislation to allow sitting members and senators the choice to opt in to the new scheme, consistent with my two private member’s bills on MPs’ superannuation. A voluntary ‘opt in’ clause will negate the need for just compensation and the natural justice argument that members cannot be forced to accept a retirement scheme that is less than the one they currently have.</para>
					<para>It also has a strong precedent in the Western Australian parliamentary superannuation scheme, which successfully incorporated a clause—I think it was the Carpenter clause—to allow Western Australian state members to transfer from their outdated pension scheme into a new one, which also applies only to new members of that parliament. I understand the opposition is of a mind not to support my amendment, and yet they are seeking support for their own amendments to cap the entitlements of senior office holders in this place. I suggest that, if they really want to achieve any sort of acceptance in the general community around the issue that they are arguing, they should look at their own colleagues in Western Australia and the precedent set there in that parliament by members of their own party to provide for members who wish to to opt in to the new arrangements or, as the tenor of my private member’s bills suggested, enable any member to make a choice of superannuation in accordance with the sorts of policies that we are attempting to put into the general legislative framework for the community.</para>
					<para>It is possible to include my amendment with no impediment to the intended function of the new federal parliamentary superannuation scheme. As I said, I anticipate this will not receive any support by members who wish to avoid this opt in, because I understand it may be regarded as more of a 'shame in'. It has not achieved that in Western Australia; it has been accepted as part and parcel of the human rights of any member, any individual, to make their own arrangements according to their own savings.</para>

					<para>I wrote to the Prime Minister in November last year, before both sides of politics rushed to join in our efforts to reform parliamentary superannuation, asking him about the likelihood of my private member's bill being debated in this place. I received my answer, with apologies, from the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in April this year. The Prime Minister had by this time announced his new plans for MPs' super, following of course the lead taken by the Leader for the Opposition, who in turn, as I said, took the lead from several decades of effort, particularly by the honourable Ted Mack. But his answer made clear that there would be no retrospective alteration. There is no explanation as to the reasons. I will listen with interest to the parliamentary secretary. I say that there are no acceptable reasons for the government's, and indeed the opposition's, stand against an 'opt in' clause. I urge both sides to accept my amendment allowing members who disagree with the MPs' super scheme the choice to remove themselves from it. I commend the amendment to the House.</para>

						<para>—The member for Calare has essentially answered the matter raised in his amendment in his own speech. The government is not prepared to accept any level of retrospectivity with respect to this matter. The Prime Minister, when he made his announcement, said there would be no retrospectivity and that all existing members and senators would remain under the existing scheme, and that is what I said in my initial contribution. It is in keeping with general practice. When superannuation schemes have been altered in the past, existing members have been grandfathered. I think there is a longstanding principle that entitlements ought not to be fiddled with in a retrospective way, and these bills are all about the future. There was an acceptance that there needed to be some change in the way parliamentarians are superannuated following their retirement; however, the feeling was that what is usual practice should be usual practice in this case. The whole idea of course is to bring parliamentary superannuation more in line with community norms, and the way that there is no retrospectivity is in keeping with community norms. In the way that schemes have been altered in the past, existing members have simply not been affected.</para>

This is not about retrospectivity, in the sense that it is an arrangement that has been made in an Australian parliament. As I understand it, without any challenge, there is no just compensation involved in the process and there are no legal ramifications. There is an acceptance under the procedures I have set out in my second amendment—which I will be moving in a moment—that quite clearly establishes the procedure to enable a member to opt in to new arrangements or indeed opt in to a super scheme of his or her own choice. For the parliamentary secretary to argue that there are problems with retrospectivity and, by inference, with just compensation is a nonsense.</para>

The fact is that, when this announcement was made, it was intended to be prospective; thus all existing members will remain under the arrangements made at the time they commenced their parliamentary service.

					</motion>
					<para>The purpose of these amendments is to cap the benefits received by office holders in the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Scheme to those of a minister in the cabinet. The purpose of this is to bring benefits closer to a community standard than would otherwise be the case for higher office holders. Higher office holders are, of course, the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister, the Leader of the Government in the Senate and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives. This is a significant move because the additional benefits enjoyed by higher office holders are quite extraordinary by community standards. It is incumbent on us to demonstrate some restraint in relation to the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Scheme. I commend the amendments to the House.</para>

						<para>—I thank the Chief Opposition Whip for her encouragement and support. I actually outlined in my earlier speech why the government do not accept the amendments moved by the member for Kingston. Briefly, we reject the attempt to amend the current superannuation scheme to reduce retrospectively the benefit entitlements for the Prime Minister, other senior ministers and office holders, and thus the government do not support the amendments. The new arrangements proposed by the government will ensure—and I do want to assure all honourable members of this—that all MPs, both existing and new, in future parliaments will have their superannuation benefits based on their total parliamentary salaries, regardless of the amount of those salaries. We do not support the opposition amendments. We do not think this is fair. It is a stunt. What the government are suggesting is fair and reasonable. I ask the House to reject the amendments moved by the member for Kingston.</para>

					</talk.start>
					<motion>
						<para>Schedule 1, page 12 after item 18 (after line 21) add:</para>
						<para><inline font-weight="bold">19 Assessment of benefit payable in respect of Member who has elected to leave the scheme</inline></para>
						<para>(1) This clause applies in respect of a person who has made an election under subparagraph 5 (1) (c) (ii) of the Parliamentary Superannuation Act 2004 to cease to make contributions to the scheme established by this Act and to become instead subject to the scheme established by the Parliamentary Superannuation Act 2004.</para>
						<para>(2) As soon as practicable after the Parliamentary Superannuation and Other Entitlements Legislation Amendment Act 2004 receives the Royal Assent the Remuneration Tribunal shall inquire into and report on:</para>
						<para>(a) a formula for calculating any benefits payable with regard to contributions made under this act to or in respect of a person who has made an election under subparagraph 5 (1) (c) (ii) of the Parliamentary Superannuation Act 2004 (<inline font-weight="bold">termination benefits</inline>)</para>
						<para>(b) when and in what circumstances termination benefits shall be paid;</para>
						<para>(c) to whom termination benefits may be paid;</para>
						<para>(d) the portability of termination benefits;</para>
						<para>(e) the legislative amendments necessary to give effect to, and authorise payments in respect of, termination benefits, and</para>
						<para>(f) any other matter relevant to the calculation or payment of termination benefits that the Tribunal thinks fit.</para>
					</motion>
					<para>This amendment is necessary to provide the legislative mechanism for the earlier amendment that I moved. It provides for the mechanisms by which members and senators who elect to opt into the new parliamentary scheme would have an equivalent termination benefit determined and transferred to a fund of their choice. The tribunal will be directed to inquire into and report on a formula to calculate those benefits. As I said earlier, the Western Australian parliamentary superannuation scheme provides the strongest of precedents in support of my amendment for an opt-in clause to be included in the legislation.</para>
					<para>Under the WA scheme, the state Salaries and Allowances Tribunal was empowered to determine the conditions under which members could elect to remove themselves from the Western Australian parliamentary pension scheme and it has done so successfully, despite what the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration might argue in negating and opposing this particular process. The inclusion of this optin clause for the federal scheme is not only possible but workable.</para>
					<para>For the record, my option would allow an amount to be determined by the Remuneration Tribunal to be transferred to the scheme of new members should I be re-elected. Should I not be re-elected, I have made arrangements for at least the lump sum component of any pension benefit I receive to be used for public benefit. I urge the government and opposition to support the inclusion of this amendment in the bill.</para>

						<para>—The <inline ref="R2032">Anti-terrorism Bill 2004</inline> makes changes to four pieces of legislation: the Crimes Act 1914; the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act 1978; the Criminal Code Act 1995; and the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. In my contribution, I will discuss the relevant amendments. Significantly, when the bill was introduced it was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee by the Attorney-General, who consulted me in that respect. I thank the Attorney-General for his call at that time and for being in the House today. I welcome the bipartisan report of Liberal and Labor members of the committee, which was tabled in the Senate yesterday.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>I can inform the House that I have written to the Attorney-General today—he may not have seen the letter yet—indicating that Labor accepts those bipartisan recommendations of the committee and will support amendments to the bill in the Senate to implement them. We will support the second reading of this bill, but we indicate our intention to move amendments along the lines of the Senate committee report, in the event that the government is not minded to do so. However, we encourage the government, obviously, to have regard to those bipartisan recommendations. We believe the committee is to be congratulated on its bipartisan approach to the legislation, which instinctively involves issues of some controversy. I strongly urge, as I have indicated, the government to support those recommendations.</para>
					<para>I will first address the amendments to the Crimes Act that deal with police detention. In Labor’s view, they are the most significant and controversial provisions of the bill. After the High Court case of Williams and the Queen, part IC was inserted into the Crimes Act in 1991. It enables police to arrest and detain without charge for up to four hours a person suspected of committing a Commonwealth offence, including a terrorist offence, for the purpose of investigating whether they have committed an offence. This is referred to as the investigation period. Part IC then enables the police to apply to a magistrate or justice for an extension to the investigation period of up to eight hours. For the purpose of determining how much of the investigation period has passed, part IC currently specifies times that are to be disregarded. They are known colloquially as ‘dead time’. These include times during questioning when there are delays or a suspension of the questioning— while, for example, the person communicates with a lawyer, interpreter, relative or friend, while the person is allowed to rest or recuperate, or while a forensic procedure, such as fingerprinting or DNA sampling, is undertaken.</para>
					<para>The bill would make two additional changes to part IC where a person is arrested and questioned for terrorism offences. Firstly, it would enable a magistrate or a justice to extend the investigation period by 20 hours instead of eight hours, increasing the total maximum investigation period to 24 hours instead of 12 hours. The extension would not necessarily be for the total 20 hours; it would depend upon the request obviously and the decision of the magistrate or justice. Secondly, it would add to the list of times to be disregarded when determining how much of the investigation period has passed, to include:</para>
					<quote>… any reasonable period during which the questioning of the person is reasonably suspended or delayed in order to allow the investigating official to obtain information relevant to the investigation from a place outside Australia that is in a different time zone, being a period that does not exceed the amount of the time zone difference.</quote>
					<para>So the extent of the actual time zone is an absolute limit to that particular provision of dead time, and again it is not necessarily the absolute period, if the information sought is obtained in a shorter period.</para>
					<para>I should note that the proposals to amend part IC to deal with terrorism are not new. For example, on 16 October 2002, following the Bali bombings, constitutional law expert Professor George Williams suggested at a vitals issues seminar hosted by the Parliamentary Library that a reform along those lines might be considered. Professor Williams raised the issue more by way of a question than necessarily as a submission, but he said:</para>
					<quote>The only element that arguably might be missing, I think, from that regime which might merit attention from the Prime Minister’s review is that there is no longer detention period for terrorist suspects.</quote>
					<para>Later he said:</para>
					<quote>My own view is that a longer period of detention for terrorist suspects may well be appropriate in the climate after the Bali attack.</quote>
					<para>Professor Williams had regard, of course, to steps that had been taken in both Canada and the United Kingdom.</para>
					<para>The proposal in this bill followed the issuing of a communique by Commonwealth, state and territory police commissioners on 18 March this year, which stated:</para>
					<quote>Discussion included the need to ensure that the Commonwealth Crimes Act allows for appropriate investigative processes and interviewing of persons suspected of terrorist-related offences.</quote>
					<para>The conference was of the view that the current Commonwealth legislation may undermine a successful prosecution of offenders engaged in significant terrorist activity. In fact, AFP Commissioner Mick Keelty indicated to the Senate committee considering this bill that the need for this reform was brought home to the AFP by the complexities it encountered during its investigation of the Bali bombings. The Leader of the Opposition is in fact on record as saying that we must respect suggestions advanced by our first response agencies—our state and federal police agencies. Indeed, Labor has carefully considered this proposal and balanced a number of considerations.</para>
					<para>Prolonged detention of citizens without charge is certainly an extraordinary measure, which should only be sanctioned in exceptional circumstances where it is necessary to counter a demonstrated and urgent threat to the safety of the community. Labor has considered the cases put by the police commissioners— particularly AFP Commissioner Keelty in light of the AFP's actual experience of investigating the Bali terrorist bombings. We believe those submissions have made a case for these amendments—to deal with the unique challenges of international terrorism investigations, which, of course, may involve receiving information not only from jurisdictions within Australia but also from those overseas. In saying that, I should indicate and emphasise that we do not see this as establishing a precedent for their future extension to other areas of criminal law enforcement.</para>
					<para>We note that the bill preserves the comprehensive regime of safeguards contained in part IC of the legislation, including, most significantly, supervision of the extension of time by a magistrate or justice, who must not extend the investigation period unless they are satisfied, firstly, that further detention is necessary to preserve or obtain evidence or to complete the investigation, secondly, that the investigation is being conducted properly and without delay and, thirdly, that the detained person or their representative has been given the opportunity to make representations about the extension application. So the presumption is against extension. Those criteria are all cumulative—they are not in the alternative—and they do constrain the discretion that the magistrate or justice is required to exercise and the factors they are required to consider before granting an extension in their role in supervising the operation of the act. There are also additional safeguards for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, which are not changed by the bill. Similarly, there are safeguards in respect of the detention of young people.</para>
					<para>It is worth pointing out that this proposal is separate from new powers granted by the parliament to ASIO last year, which of course in themselves were controversial, in that they involved a power to detain and question persons who have information—or who are reasonably believed to have information— about terrorism offences. Fundamentally, the powers given to ASIO and the powers given to the AFP in this case are for different purposes. ASIO's powers are for the purpose of gathering intelligence that may prevent a terrorist attack, while the police's powers are for the purpose of gathering evidence that would assist in a prosecution. Indeed, on the one hand the information obtained in the ASIO process would not be for the purpose of admission into court, whereas that is very much the purpose of the questioning regime we are considering in this bill.</para>
					<para>Liberal and Labor members of the Senate committee have recommended that the use of the new dead time provision relating to overseas inquiries also be subject to judicial oversight and only available upon successful application to a judicial officer. In my letter to the Attorney-General, I indicated that Labor believes that this is also a reasonable requirement which would not be unworkable and which would provide appropriate supervision of suspensions in questioning under the new provisions. That is not to say we believe the Australian Federal Police would request dead time lightly, but we believe from the point of view of the efficacy of the operation of the system that the continuation of judicial oversight is desirable all round.</para>
					<para>Labor also believes it would be desirable to hold an independent review of the operation of these amendments after a period of three years. Labor is certainly committed to carrying out such a review. Again, we believe that if a review is undertaken on the basis of actual cases it can do a lot to improve the operation of the provisions—and indeed in some cases it can do a lot to remove concern or controversy within the community, when people are able to be satisfied that the provisions are operating effectively on the one hand and fairly on the other. Labor is certainly committed, as I say, to carrying out such a review, and we would urge the government to similarly commit themselves to it.</para>
					<para>The second element of the bill that I will now discuss relates to amendments to the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act 1978. The bill would make four main changes to the provisions of that legislation. Firstly, it would increase the maximum penalty for the relevant offence of engaging in hostile activity in a foreign state— increasing it from 14 years to 20 years imprisonment. Secondly, it would apply to persons who were present in Australia at any time before the relevant conduct—not just in the preceding year, as is currently provided in the legislation. Thirdly, it would remove the defence currently available to persons serving with foreign government armed forces, where the accused was engaged in the relevant conduct while in or with an organisation that was either, on the one hand, a terrorist organisation listed under the Criminal Code Act 1995—they are known generally as proscribed organisations, of which there are now a number—or, on the other hand, an organisation proscribed by regulations made under a new power in the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act, a power which would be given to the Attorney- General.</para>
					<para>Finally, it would enable a minister to issue a certificate stating that an organisation was not part of the armed forces of the government of a foreign state, which constitutes prima facie proof of that fact. This adds to the three certificates the minister can currently issue to facilitate proof of difficult facts which may have implications for Australia’s international relations. The basic purpose behind these amendments is to update the 1978 act to reflect the current reality of state-sponsored terrorism where there is a relationship between a government and a terrorist organisation, such as has been the case with al-Qaeda in Afghanistan—and, indeed, in the Sudan.</para>
					<para>One flaw in the drafting of the bill, identified by Liberal and Labor members of the Senate committee, is the absence of criteria for the exercise of the proposed new power to make regulations proscribing organisations. We acknowledge those regulations are disallowable by the parliament and in that sense parliamentary oversight is retained. However, in the absence of any legislative criteria, there is little guide either to the Attorney or the parliament as to the proper exercise of the power. In my letter to the Attorney- General, I indicated that Labor would support amendments to include criteria that would clarify the purpose of the power. We understand that, in addition to the armed forces purportedly of a state, that would include instances where they are themselves effectively part of a terrorist network. In another instance indicated by the government, they could be used to list foreign armed forces which have engaged in gross violations of human rights or the laws of war. Again, those sorts of criteria would be appropriate, and Labor would certainly support criteria along those lines.</para>
					<para>I also sought clarification from the Attorney- General of the government's understanding of the legal position of persons who make all reasonable attempts to withdraw from foreign hostile activity with an organisation proscribed under this power but who are unable to do so because of duress or compulsion—and, indeed, in some instances are possibly themselves facing severe penalty as a result of desertion. That would be a worst-case scenario. Clearly, I think most Australians would consider it undesirable for any Australian to be involved in hostile activities overseas, but if there were circumstances where criminality was attached to that conduct and circumstances where a person was the subject of extreme duress or compulsion then there would be factors that we believe should be considered in the operation of the legislation.</para>
					<para>Criminal Code Act 1995. In essence, the amendments to that legislation that would be effected by this bill would create or amend the offence of being a member of a terrorist organisation. That offence would apply to organisations that are not listed by the Attorney- General. Currently there is an offence of belonging to such an organisation—one of those organisations that has been proscribed as I have indicated. In respect of these proposals, the offence would also apply to those organisations that a prosecution could prove in court were terrorist organisations—that is, any organisation, in the broad, that has committed, is committing or intends to commit a terrorist offence. I should indicate that the onus would still be on the Crown to establish beyond reasonable doubt the fact that the organisation was a terrorist organisation. Labor has consistently advocated in the context of an earlier bill that it is appropriate for courts to have a central role in determining, on the basis of evidence, which organisations are terrorist organisations. Accordingly, we can indicate that we support the amendment proposed by the government.</para>
					<para>The amendments in respect of the training offences are slightly more complex. In summary, in the first offence, which carries a maximum penalty of 25 years, the prosecution would no longer have to prove that the accused knew they were involved with a terrorist organisation but instead that they were reckless as to that circumstance. The use of the language in the Criminal Code means that it would have to be shown that the accused was aware of a substantial risk that the organisation was a terrorist organisation and, having regard to the circumstances known to them, that it was unjustifiable to take that risk. In the second offence, carrying a maximum penalty of 25 years, the prosecution would have to establish that the person was dealing with a terrorist organisation and the accused would have to discharge an evidential burden, which means pointing to evidence that suggests a reasonable possibility for their conduct was in existence and that they were not reckless as to the circumstances of that conduct.</para>
					<para>We have carefully considered this amendment, as it does introduce a modified form of strict liability and certainly the penalty of 25 years is not insignificant, but we certainly acknowledge the concerns expressed to the Senate committee, including those expressed by the Australian Institute of Criminology, about the burden this places on an accused. We have weighed up the considerations. Indeed, we have weighed up comments by Commissioner Keelty after the investigations into the Bali bombings. He indicated the extent of training being provided by terrorist organisations in not only armed combat but also the use of electronic technology, detonations and so forth. Having regard in particular to advice from the first response agencies, we have indicated again that we will support these measures. I quote, for example, the words of ASIO Director Dennis Richardson in the report of ASIO to parliament in November 2003. He said:</para>
					<quote>ASIO is aware of a number of Australians who have received terrorist training since the late 1990s. The level of instruction received by these individuals ranges from basic military training to advanced terrorist tactics. Identifying other Australians who have undertaken terrorist training remains a priority.</quote>
					<para>Similarly, as I have indicated, Australian Federal Police Commissioner Mick Keelty specifically said that the significance of the training and the speed with which information is transmitted to potential terrorists through such training is of such significance that consideration should be given to the concept of criminal recklessness in terms of either providing training to terrorist organisations or receiving such training. We believe these statements highlight the real concerns of our front-line agencies about Australian involvement in terrorist training. Again, on balance, we are satisfied of the need for parliament to strengthen the training offences in the Criminal Code, and we will support these amendments, as I have indicated.</para>
					<para>Finally, I turn to amendments to the Proceeds of Crime Act. The bill makes three main changes to this act. Firstly, the bill would specify that a literary proceeds order can be made where a person's notoriety results directly or indirectly from their commission of an offence. Secondly, where a foreign indictable offence is concerned, the bill would remove the requirement that the proceeds were derived in Australia and replace it with a requirement that the proceeds were either derived in Australia or were derived overseas and have been transferred to Australia. Thirdly, the bill would amend the definition of 'foreign indictable offence' to include conduct that was not an indictable offence under Australian law at the time of the conduct but had become such an offence by the time of the relevant application to the court—and obviously, in 2002, we introduced significant antiterrorism provisions and offences—and also to specify that offences against the law of a foreign country include offences triable by a United States military commission established under the United States President's military order of 13 November 2001.</para>
					<para>It should be acknowledged that the Proceeds of Crime Act already covers a substantial portion of literary proceeds that could be derived from terrorist activity. The grave and unique nature of terrorism is already recognised in the act, which excludes terrorism from the statute of limitations which applies to all other offences—that is, a period of six years. The residual categories of terrorist literary proceeds that would not be covered are, firstly, those derived from overseas and transferred to Australia and, secondly, those derived from overseas terrorist activity which predated the enactment of antiterrorism legislation in Australia in mid-2002. Again, it is appropriate that these loopholes be closed.</para>
					<para>We are not opposed to amendments that result in closures of those loopholes, although we do agree with the unanimous conclusion of the Liberal and Labor members of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee that these amendments would have a retrospective operation. In this respect, the explanatory memorandum which asserts otherwise is incorrect, and we believe it should appropriately be corrected. We certainly agree that the independent review mandated by section 327 of the Proceeds of Crime Act should examine the impact of the retrospective operation of these amendments which I have described and, in particular, whether they have implications beyond the area of terrorist literary proceeds.</para>
					<para>In considering these amendments, we have had regard to the fact that two key safeguards in the current act are maintained. The first safeguard of significance is that the civil burden remains on the prosecution to prove on the basis of evidence that the person committed a terrorist offence. For example, in the relevant cases of David Hicks or Mamdouh Habib, the court is certainly not obliged to recognise any conviction by a United States military commission as conclusive evidence of the issue, but rather the Crown would have a civil onus of proving that fact.</para>
					<para>Secondly, the court retains the ultimate discretion of whether or not to make a literary proceeds order at all and, if it does make such an order, whether to confiscate all or only some of the profits. Under the act, the court must take into account a range of factors when determining whether or not to make such an order, including the nature and purpose of the product or activity, whether supplying the product or carrying out the activity was in the public interest, and the social, cultural or educational value of the product. In considering those criteria, the members of the Senate committee have recommended that item 24 of the bill be amended to remove the words 'or indirectly' and that item 26 of the bill be amended to omit the proposed reference to the United States military commissions.</para>
					<para>In my letter to the Attorney-General, I have indicated that Labor agrees with these bipartisan recommendations. Specifically, in relation to item 24, I have drawn the Attorney's attention to the Australian Law Reform Commission's 1999 report, Confiscation that counts, which formed the basis for the literary proceeds regime. That report stated:</para>
					<quote>… occasions may arise when the benefit gained by the person is property characterisable as attributable to the experience that the person has gained as a rehabilitatee and wishes to share with society. In such cases, it would seem inappropriate to mandatorily confiscate that part of the benefit, albeit that, ultimately, it is derived indirectly from the person's involvement in criminal, or prescribed unlawful, conduct.</quote>
					<para>Hence the reference to the public interest that I have previously referred to. We believe that, when that intention is considered, item 24 does go too far, and we would support an amendment either deleting the words 'or indirectly' or simply removing item 24 from the bill.</para>
					<para>Regarding item 26, I share the view of Liberal and Labor members of the committee that proposed subsection 337A(3) is inappropriate. The term ‘offence against a law of a foreign country’ appears several times in Commonwealth legislation but is deliberately left undefined, leaving it to the courts to identify and recognise foreign criminal laws. Labor does not believe there is a case for creating an exception by specifically referring to offences triable by US military commissions—offences which are promulgated by a single lawyer employed by the US Department of Defense in Military Commission Instruction No. 2.</para>
					<para>We acknowledge that, while parliament recently agreed to a reference to United States military commissions in the International Transfer of Prisoners Amendment Act 2004, that legislation was to support a humanitarian purpose—namely, to enable Australian citizens detained without charge for more than two years to serve any future term of imprisonment closer to family members and support networks in Australia. Similarly, as recommended by Liberal and Labor members of the Senate committee, we will be supporting an amendment to remove that provision.</para>
					<para>In conclusion, Labor supports the vast majority of measures in this bill and certainly supports the substance of those measures, and we will be supporting the passage of the bill through this House. As I have indicated in my letter to the Attorney-General, we intend to continue the bipartisan approach to this legislation demonstrated by Liberal and Labor members of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee and will be supporting amendments in the Senate to give effect to their recommendations. I strongly urge the Attorney-General to do the same on behalf of the government.</para>

						<para>—It is with a great deal of pleasure that I rise to support the government's <inline ref="R2032">Anti-terrorism Bill 2004</inline> in this place today. It is an important bill—important not just to the Australian people but to the future of this country. Over the last eight years this government has been about protecting, building and securing the future of this country not just for the next eight years but of course for the next generation and many generations to come. In the last 24 hours, this government has demonstrated its economic credentials—how it is that we have provided to Australian families and the Australian community through eight years of hard work since we were elected in 1996, how we have worked to provide, as I say, for the years to come—and demonstrated to the Australian community that we have the capacity as a government to build and secure the future for Australian families and for this country in general. This country will be remembered in decades to come for many aspects and many successes. One of those will be the economic successes of this government, as I said, with record low interest rates and the other economic factors— record low unemployment, which is now under six per cent, and low inflation. All of that makes for a positive and exciting future for the next generation of Australians.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>But equally important to the Australian community at this point in time—and I think for the next three or four decades—will be the government’s response to the issue of national security. I am very proud to be part of the Howard government, which has led the way in this country. Compare that to many other countries. It has led the charge in providing the framework for a secure and sustainable basis for this country. If we look around at some of the other examples of legislative changes in relation to terrorism, this country should be proud of the record that we stand by and the amendments that we have made over the last eight years by way of legislative change to provide that secure base for generations to come.</para>
					<para>It is no mistake that this bill today goes further to extending the powers and the obligations that we bestow upon the law enforcement agencies and the intelligence agencies within this country. This government is very proud of the work the law enforcement and intelligence agencies do. If we are going to win the fight against terrorism, if we are about providing for the security of this country, make no mistake: we must defeat terrorism wherever its head may rise. Through the process of creating this bill in the form in which it comes into the House today and through various other pieces of legislation, I think we have been able to demonstrate how serious we are about arming those intelligence and law enforcement agencies with the powers and the abilities to defeat that terrorism not just abroad but, specifically, wherever it may be present in this country.</para>
					<para>I think many Australians have, over the last decade or so, been quite blind to the terrorist threat that has been posed to this country. Thank God we have not seen any serious terrorism incidents on Australian soil. But of course the events of 9-11 and the tragic circumstances surrounding the loss of Australian life on the soil of Bali, one of our very close neighbours in Indonesia, has brought home over the last few years how vulnerable we will continue to be over the coming years in relation to terrorism and the attacks that those people make on our Western way of life. The Australian people are at risk for no greater reason than the fact that we enjoy a Western style of life. So, when we are trying to combat those extreme elements within the Muslim community and within other groups that are represented and which form themselves into these terrorism groups, we need to be aware of—and I think that, quite sadly, the Australian people have realised it—the reality that faces us as the Australian people.</para>
					<para>The bill that is before the House today has had much debate in many different forums. The honourable member prior to me spoke about the Senate report and the way in which the Senate has responded to the bill that has been proposed, quite rightly, by the Attorney- General. My understanding is that the government is of a mind to consider, as we quite reasonably always do, those recommendations which have been put forward by that Senate committee.</para>
					<para>I want to speak in strong support of the bill as we have proposed it to the House today. In its current form, the bill proposes to change several areas of legislation—firstly, the Crimes Act. The bill seeks to redefine and extend the investigation period set out in the Crimes Act for terrorism offences. Primarily, the proposed amendment extends the period of arrest or the investigation time for a person arrested for a terrorism offence to enable law enforcement agencies to properly investigate the offence.</para>
					<para>Sections 23C and 23D of the Crimes Act contain certain provisions in relation to persons arrested for Commonwealth offences and the periods for which those persons may be detained for the purposes of investigation. Quite interestingly, the proposal to increase the statutory time limit on an investigation seems to have come from the Victorian Police Commissioner. Of course it was mooted some time before that, I understand, by the Australian Federal Police and other Commonwealth agencies, who of course have been looking at the current legislative arrangements and proposing to government ways in which we can improve legislation to work hard towards a better legislative process to tackle terrorism.</para>

						<para>—Last week, on a cold and dark night, I visited the Elwood Children's Centre to discuss with parents the state of child care in Melbourne Ports. I met Kate Ryan, chairperson; Cass van der Drift, centre coordinator; and committee members Sonja Hood, Kate Redfern, Emma Last and Carolyn Morris. The meeting was packed with parents who were rightly agitated at the growing crisis of child care in the City of Port Phillip, which has 1,000 families waiting for child care. The problem is particularly acute for newborns to two-year-olds, for whom last night's budget does nothing. Expectant couples are putting their children's names on waiting lists before they are born, with waiting times of at least 12 months and longer in that part of my electorate.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>In Elwood, the crisis has never been more acute, as the Scott Street Children's Centre, where I went to kinder and which still caters for 32 children, is due to close next year. I am going to appeal to the Presbyterian Church to reconsider that particular decision. The Elwood Children's Centre, which is financially viable and above all provides a delightful niche for the children of Elwood, has 35 places. In a rationalisation of child care in the City of Port Phillip, the city is considering an option to close the Elwood Children's Centre and to open a larger centre, at which hopefully the children of the Elwood Children's Centre would be incorporated. However, it does not take into consideration the fact that Elwood is operating with a great deal of pride and is financially viable. Frankly, the mayor Dick Gross and others present at the meeting, including 50 families, considered a resolution that, unequivocally, supported the centre staying as it currently exists—as I do, and I am sure as the local councillors will when they fully consider the matter.</para>
					<para>In the past two years, there has been a 30 per cent increase in the cost of child care, and the median cost to families for a child in long-day care is now over $1,800 a year. This is yet another example of the government giving with one hand and taking with the other. Last night's $600 one-off offer will be nearly eaten up entirely by the increased cost of child care over the last two years. The lack of places and the rising costs are in part due to the chronic shortage of trained childcare staff because of the very low wages in the industry. No action was taken to fix that in last night's budget. The government refuses to provide more money to ensure that the people taking care of society’s greatest asset—our children—are decently paid and trained. In Victoria, before the recent living wage increases, the minimum wage of an adult childcare worker was $11.99 an hour. Librarians are paid $22 an hour; sales assistants, $15.40 an hour; and gardeners, $18.40 an hour. Surely our child-care workers should be paid more than our checkout operators.</para>
					<para>The child-care union is currently running a work value case in the Industrial Relations Commission to ensure that child-care workers are paid more, commensurate with their skills. This claim is being opposed by many child-care companies. Today, in the second day of a hearing in the Industrial Relations Commission for child-care workers, one of the witnesses was a top manager from ABC child-care centres. It is one of the biggest commercial child-care companies, whose chairman is former Liberal candidate Sallyanne Atkinson. The company appears to oppose pay rises for its employees. The company also sponsors the Brisbane Bullets basketball team. The manager was asked under cross-examination how much its sponsorship of the Brisbane Bullets cost. He answered, '$200,000 per year.' He was told that the pay increase asked for by the child-care union would cost his company around $250,000 per year. He was then asked, given that his company was opposing the pay rise, if ABC child-care centres would consider dropping its sponsorship and use the money to pay the salary rise for its employees. The answer was no. This company values sponsorship of a basketball team above its own staff, as seen by their wages. Its management would rather get flashy court side seats at a basketball game than pay its employees decent, respectable wages.</para>
					<para>Paying higher salaries to child-care workers will eventually expand the number of places available by bringing more workers into the industry. In my view, this budget does not address this with its one-off payment. The shortage of child-care places all around Australia, like the shortage of university places, has not been addressed in this budget, and it is something that this government will regret when the next election comes.</para>

						<para>— Tonight I rise to speak on a matter that is very close to my heart. On 5 March this year, there was a horrific road smash on the stretch of highway just south of Bulahdelah in my electorate, which claimed the lives of three very precious people. Sisters nine-year-old Rebecca and eight-year-old Jessica Campbell and their grandmother, 59-year-old Barbara Cheadle, lost their lives in that crash. This road crash occurred at the Keels Road intersection between Karuah and Bulahdelah.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>In what could only be called a gutwrenching experience, I met with the girls' parents, Kath and Greg Campbell, last Thursday. The pain and agony that Kath and Greg have gone through is not something that I will ever be able to express adequately on their behalf. Kath and Greg have a unique relationship. They were childhood sweethearts who met when they were 14 and 15. But there is no happily ever after for this family now; just loss and an empty space where three lives once featured so prominently.</para>
					<para>This year Rebecca was to start playing soccer and was excited about being on the same team as her best friend, Zoe. Kath and Greg showed me pictures of Jessica, a keen netball player. In one of these photos, Jessica is in her netball uniform giving her little sister a warm hug. Mr Speaker, as you know, I have three young children of my own, and yet I cannot imagine the extent of the heartache, the helplessness and the sadness that Kath and Greg are feeling. When I met them last Thursday, I was struck by how composed they were. It was obviously very difficult for them to talk about something so horrific and so fresh in their memory, but they opened their hearts to me and talked about their tragedy openly because they did not want to see another family hit with such a trauma.</para>
					<para>Their story has touched the hearts of so many people who are just as horrified as I am about this accident. Allied Plant Services, the mining hire company in Newcastle that Greg works for, have been incredibly supportive of Greg and Kath. Their compassion and thoughtfulness has been outstanding and so has the assistance of so many people, some of whom Kath and Greg have never met. They have asked me to publicly thank the following people on their behalf: Qantas; the police and emergency services; Newcastle Knights player Robbie O'Davis; Principal Lance Marsh and, in fact, the whole school community at Floraville Public School; the Newcastle Crash Investigation Unit's Brad Dawson; Bulahdelah police officer Glen Grainger; the media at large; and all of those people of Newcastle and the Hunter who took the time to contact Kath and Greg because they were touched by the tragedy of their loss.</para>
					<para>Before I talk about the Pacific Highway, I want to make one point very clear: this project is bigger than politics; it is about priorities. All levels of government must work together to fix this highway to provide dual carriageway for the entire route between Sydney and Brisbane. Yesterday in the budget, the federal government committed $93.2 million to the Pacific Highway in New South Wales for the next financial year. This $93.2 million will be used to complete the Karuah bypass, start the construction of 11 kilometres of dual carriageway between Karuah and Bulahdelah in the Great Lakes region and duplicate almost 10 kilometres of highway south of Taree, including an overpass at Nabiac.</para>
					<para>For my part, I make no excuse that I am lobbying hard for a dual carriageway between Karuah and Bulahdelah in my electorate. I lobbied hard for this dual carriageway before I met Kath and Greg Campbell, and meeting them has solidified my determination to get this funding. The New South Wales roads minister last week announced $1 million in funding to build a turning lane into Keels Road to make this intersection safer. While I welcome this funding, I would much prefer to see dual carriageway for the entire Karuah to Bulahdelah stretch. It should be the goal of all levels of government to strive to create dual carriageways quickly, efficiently and for the long term.</para>
					<para>I do not really care who funds this upgrade, but I will be fighting for Kath and Greg Campbell and for the memory of their daughters, Jessica and Rebecca, and Greg’s mother, Barbara Cheadle—in fact, for all those who have lost their lives—to make sure these funds are used quickly to fix the Pacific Highway to ensure road crashes like this are eliminated. There have been nine deaths along this stretch of the road since 2003. Other families have lost children, husbands, wives, mothers or fathers. I put it quite simply: let us get on with the job of making dual carriageway along the entire Pacific Highway and remove these deadly turn-offs for all motorists who travel on this important road.</para>

						<para>—Warnings that petrol prices in Australia may hit the $1 mark shortly gives me an opportunity to raise a number of concerns regarding petrol pricing and the predatory practices of some in the oil industry. When researching this topic it becomes glaringly obvious that fuel and oil, unlike other consumer products, are almost impossible to dissect into their core cost components. This is important to know, because there seems to be no accountable and transparent guide to the breakdown of the cost of fuel, both wholesale and retail, and the cost components that go into the production and pricing of this product for consumers.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>The other most interesting aspect of the oil industry is that, in essence, it is operated, and integrated both vertically and horizontally, in a manner which gives incredible control of production, distribution and final sale by only a few. This does not exclude smaller players from participating in the market, but it makes their ability to compete and survive very difficult and open to certain pricing strategies. The great fear I have is that, while the current climate of pricing regimes and cycles of petrol prices at retail outlets delivers reasonably priced fuel, this will no longer be the case in the future due to a lack of competition, with no possibility of reversal if the market becomes a full duopoly.</para>
					<para>The approval by the ACCC of retailing of fuel by the major supermarket chains could in a few short years create an environment where no independent and small service stations will exist, as they will be driven out of business by so-called discount pricing strategies. I say 'so-called' because the lower price is cross-subsidised by higher retail supermarket prices. This means that the discount petrol prices at major fuel outlets are lower than the price at which independents can purchase fuel at the wholesale price. This creates a biased market, driving smaller retailers out of business.</para>
					<para>The Senate committee inquiry into section 46 of the Trades Practices Act has delivered a bipartisan report on the failings of this section of the act to protect small fuel retailers from the predatory pricing policies of major retailers. The fact that the report findings are bipartisan demonstrates the understanding of the need that exists for reform in the law and in this industry. The government has now had some time to digest the report and its recommendations and to begin the reform. I am calling on the government to act now to end the predatory pricing policies of the major oil companies and restore fair play and competition in a complicated market.</para>
					<para>A Latham Labor government will legislate to protect small business service station franchisees from being forced out of business, and will protect motorists from high petrol prices by ensuring the retention of competition in the petrol retail market. Labor is not prepared to leave the fate of dozens of small business operators and motorists solely in the hands of the courts. We will move to curtail the combined market power of Australia's biggest grocery retailers and oil companies.</para>
					<para>Just one example of the behaviour of the major oil companies has led to Caltex service station operators taking out a Federal Court injunction to prevent the Caltex corporation from proceeding with its plans to force more service station owners out of business. A leaked memo which instructed Caltex staff to use tactics of 'fear, uncertainty and doubt' when negotiating with Caltex service station operators is the type of behaviour that needs to be eliminated in the industry. Labor is not prepared to sit back and allow the fate of service station operators and motorists to be determined by the Federal Court or by the oil companies themselves.</para>
					<para>The current regulatory regime, designed to curtail the market power of the oil companies, is antiquated and needs reform. The Howard government has had almost eight years to produce an acceptable reform plan but has failed to do anything in this critical area of competition. The emerging duopoly in petrol retailing and the demise of the many independent, particularly rural, service stations is the result. This is an industry that is using market power and its sheer size to determine price and competition. The ACCC should play a role in further investigating the long-term effect of allowing discounts and pricing policies that drive small businesses out of the industry and the reason this is taking place. My message to the government tonight in delivering these few short words on the oil industry is to remind them that they have an obligation to protect small business from larger corporations. They can do this through either legislation or the ACCC. We have had plenty of inquiries and reports. It is now time for the government to act in this vital industry.</para>

						<para>—I wish to speak tonight about a matter of great concern to all Australians—the protection of that great natural asset: the Australian coastline. In recent weeks, several events have occurred that have caused me to wonder: do state governments really care about coastline protection? For years now, I have argued that there must be an integrated national plan involving all levels of government and members of the community to protect our coastline. I have not been alone in that crusade, and it is fair to suggest that most Australians want their coastline protected and, more importantly, conserved. It is a sensible and sound belief because our coastline is an asset of great natural beauty and ecological importance. It provides not only a refuge for native flora and fauna but also recreation amenities for our human population.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>My argument for coastline protection is, I believe, more valid when one considers that the coastlines bordering our major state capital cities are ecologically stressed and, in some cases, facing environmental degradation. Bluntly, some areas of our coastline near our major cities are facing potential desertification. That is because the nearby human population is unwittingly trampling, polluting or bulldozing what natural vegetation still exists in some portions of city coastline areas into dangerously stressed remnant vegetative stands.</para>
					<para>In Sydney, for example, one of the potentially worst offenders in this process is the Carr government. This government, which is headed by a coast-dwelling premier, is presently considering a proposal to turn the city's colonial-era quarantine station and its extensive grounds, containing native vegetation, into a commercial venture. The proposed venture will contain a hotel positioned within the station's heritage buildings, and a theme park a la Disneyland in the old quarantine station’s grounds. The Carr government's quarantine station proposal is development planning gone mad. It must be opposed, and that is why I am alerting the House and the people of Australia to its existence.</para>
					<para>In New South Wales, federal-state cooperation on the issue of coastal protection was also hampered by the Carr government last year. For a while, the New South Wales Minister for Infrastructure and Planning, Craig Knowles, stalled on concerns from the Howard government about New South Wales's then coastal management policies and cooperation in coastal management between the Carr government and the Howard government. Subsequently, the Carr government relented and signed the Natural Heritage Trust Extension Bilateral Agreement, which in Public Service speak is NHT2.</para>
					<para>Let me repeat that, strategically and statistically, it has to be acknowledged that longterm damage to coastline areas is more likely to occur in areas with high human populations, like the coastline of Sydney, which borders my electorate and the electorates of several members of this House. On the coastline side of my electorate are three councils— Waverley, Woollahra and Randwick. One would think that, because of their positioning and the importance of the coastline amenity, these councils’ past knowledge of coastline protection would count for something under the recently signed NHT2 bilateral agreement. It appears not to be so.</para>
					<para>Professor Bruce Thom, a leading expert in the field of coastline protection and a constituent, says that the agreement's focus on regional catchment management authorities means that local councils participating in the catchment management authorities have to bid for funds as a partner in the new authorities. He says that the catchment management authority model 'will not meet the needs of local councils like Woollahra or Waverley, where they are seeking federal contribution to infrastructure works.'</para>
					<para>Thom adds that the remediation of bays such as Parsley Bay in my electorate, in Vaucluse, just inside Sydney Harbour, would not occur under the catchment management model. That is because NHT2 has a basic flaw: there should be a tripartite agreement between local governments, state governments and the federal government. That there is no such agreement means it is difficult for local governments to individually access funds for urgently needed coastline work. Further, NHT2 funds are mostly going to rural, not urban or newly urbanising areas. For instance, only $600,000 of NHT2 funds this financial year will go to the Sydney Catchment Management Authority, which covers the area of potentially greatest coastline damage risk in Australia.</para>
					<para>Professor Thom's arguments for coastline protection are worthy of reflection and action. He says:</para>
					<quote>
						<para>There are four components to my image for a better coastal future. … a more comprehensive national cooperative approach or strategy which builds on the natural resource management framework process currently underway.</para>
					</quote>
					<para>He says there is a need for the Council of Australian Governments to recommend to the federal government the need to enact a coastal zone management act. He says that within this legislation there should be enshrined an agreement between the federal and state governments about national objectives, guidelines, standards and financial assistance. I believe Professor Thom is talking good commonsense. I recommend his viewpoints, distilled from many years of experience in this area. They should be considered by all members of this House, and I believe they need to be seriously considered for adoption at some point in the near future, and the sooner the better. If we do not, I fear many good intentions to protect our coast will come to nought.</para>

						<para>—In a week that is dominated by discussions about the budget—a budget that is based on shortterm political expediency in an election cycle as against long-term vision—I want to return to a subject that I have raised on a number of occasions: access to after-hours primary medical care, especially in my electorate through the Northern Hospital at Epping. As I have indicated to the House before, some 60 per cent of presentations at the emergency department at the Northern Hospital are categories 4 and 5, which are categories which indicate that they could be serviced by attendance at a general practice. There are over 50,000 attendances at the emergency department at the Northern Hospital—it is the third busiest in Melbourne.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>I am told that, characteristically, afterhours categories 4 and 5 at the Northern Hospital are young children with fever, minor lacerations and sporting injuries and adults with upper respiratory tract infections—the type of patient that could be serviced if they were able to go to a general practice that was accessible and open at the hours that these people are seeking medical attention.</para>
					<para>In the budget of 2001 there was an announcement about the After Hours Primary Medical Care Program. It was indicated that $43 million over four years was to be allocated to this program. Some two years into this program, I am told that only about onequarter of that amount of money has been spent and much of that has been on seeding grants and the like. In fact, one of the interesting things about the Northern Hospital is that, despite the member for McEwen indicating that the Northern Division of General Practice had not approached the federal government about it, they actually did get a seeding grant under the AHPMC program of $50,000, and it was to investigate the best model of after-hours care from a hospital based setting incorporating existing services and ensuring follow-up with the GP.</para>
					<para>This is on top of the decision made by the Bracks state government to actually build a purpose-built after-hours GP clinic on the hospital campus. That building is there; ready to go, adjacent to the emergency department. But it is still not known what is going to happen and what proposals can be made about the ongoing funding of this afterhours GP clinic. In fact there is a proposal before the federal government which is still awaiting the go-ahead.</para>
					<para>This is my real concern, because I have now discovered from discussions with another general practice division operating in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne that there is a similar story there. That division was involved in putting forward an application. Applications, I am told, closed on 16 June last year. There was an expectation that an announcement about the funding would be made by September so that there could be a start-up date for this project of 1 November. Further research has indicated that the importance of the start-up date was that, as the program was only a four-year program—and will now finish in June 2005—there needed to be a length of time for proper implementation. Never mind the fact that if we got these services in place they would be of great service to the local communities—the one in my electorate, based at the Northern Hospital, and the one proposed in the eastern suburbs, which was a model akin to the Hunter Valley after-hours GP model. That model offers triage over the phone with a nurse who then refers people appropriately—either to specialised GP clinics, which can be funded and available or off to the emergency department if that is seen as the best fit.</para>
					<para>My concern is people are getting the impression that what is likely to happen is that, in the run-up to an election, with great fanfare these announcements will be made—but they will be made six months, nine months, 12 months late so that the local communities who have worked up these solutions to their local problems will be without these services for that length of time. My concern is that the election is permeating the decisionmaking of the present government and that things are being done for political expedience. They are not being done for the longterm advantage of communities of the nation.</para>
					<para>I hope that the Minister for Health and Ageing can look at these applications, which I understand have been sitting on his desk for months, and make the announcements under the After Hours Primary Medical Care Program that would be best suited to the local communities. The trials that have been conducted and the services that have already been funded under this program have been absolutely successful. This is one of the ways in which the federal government can show its partnership with state governments and local communities in providing these muchneeded services.</para>

						<para>—This evening I want to discuss one of the regular issues that come around for MPs, which is that you are invited to a local state school to discuss politics. Recently, I was invited to Tarampa State School. The first part of my visit involved the presentation of the national service medal and another service medal to Councillor Bruce McCallum, a local identity who was there in the lead-up to Anzac Day. He related some of his experiences as a serviceman to the students. It was quite an interesting gathering.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>I was not invited to the school by the school principal, the staff or even by the school P&amp;C; in fact, I was invited by the students themselves. These years 5, 6 and 7 students have decided to get involved in politics. Of course members do have regular invitations to discuss the responsibilities and duties of an MP and to discuss the role of government, and many local schools have shown an increased interest. I believe that in recent times the numbers of schools and students interested in the role of government have been on the increase, and I take that as a very positive thing.</para>
					<para>Students love to conduct mock parliaments— to speak and pass their own bills as part of the education process. Topics such as reducing school hours or the need for a local skate ramp are always popular and always get up in the parliaments of local state schools. But at Tarampa it was a little bit different because the students there had a very real issue that they wanted to promote, and they went about it in a very professional manner. The issue they were interested in was the Global Movement for Children's Big Lobby, and they set up a petition under the title 'Every child has a right to education.' When I went to the school, after the medal presentation ceremony the infants left and the years 5, 6 and 7 students gave me a PowerPoint presentation covering all the relevant issues. They read a poem outlining the concerns of children for basic human rights worldwide. They presented me with a petition with 140 signatures. These were gathered by visiting years 5, 6 and 7 classes in each of the six schools in the local school cluster. There, they discussed the issues and gave local children the opportunity to contribute.</para>
					<para>I want to pass on my congratulations to the children of years 5, 6 and 7 at Tarampa State School and also to those who made the PowerPoint presentation on that day. They included Lucas Bird, Rachel Reid and Jessica Knightley, who were the speakers. The PowerPoint presentation itself was constructed by Acacia Stevens, Wade Ballard and Pearce Flint. While unfortunately the petition they gathered does not conform to the forms of the House, it is quite an effort by those students to have gathered 140 signatures and to have gone around gathering those names.</para>
					<para>I would like to invite MPs who are interested in that issue, if they wish to, to come and peruse the petition and learn of the concerns of the students in that local school cluster and Tarampa State School, particularly the issues as raised under the Global Movement For Children's Big Lobby. I would like to once again commend them and everyone involved in the process—particularly the mums, who turned up with some lovely refreshments after the petition had been presented. It was a good day and good fun was had by all. I hope those children will go on to maintain their interest in politics and to get actively involved once again.</para>

						<para>—I rise today to speak briefly about a street stall that I recently conducted in Cranbourne. Cranbourne is a fantastic area. It is a city that has a population of about 34,000. It is a city that has a lot of young families in it. It is a city which is going to grow to a population of about 100,000 people in about 10 years. It is on the outer fringes of Melbourne, about 38 kilometres as the crow flies but about 49 kilometres drive from the CBD of Melbourne. In conducting that street stall, a number of issues were raised. First and foremost was the provision of a Medicare office for Cranbourne. For too long, Cranbourne has done it very tough. Cranbourne, with that population and with the very large number of young families living in it and others who are shifting into it, does not have a Medicare office.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>Cranbourne is part of the city of Casey. Until very recently the city of Casey had a population of 210,000 people but no Medicare office. Many young families in the city of Casey wanted a Medicare office in the FountainGate Shopping Centre because for 10 years they had been lobbying for one and for 10 years they had not actually received one. The people of Cranbourne have now noticed that the government has given FountainGate Shopping Centre a Medicare office. FountainGate borders the federal seat of La Trobe. It is no coincidence that, after being told for 10 years that they could not have a Medicare office, they are now being told that they can. That is fair for the people of the federal seat of La Trobe but there should be parity for the people in the federal seat of Holt. People in Cranbourne would like to have a Medicare office. I recently tabled in this place a petition containing some 4,000 signatures requesting a Medicare office for the people of Cranbourne. When I conducted the street stall, I found that that was a leading issue, along with STD rates in Cranbourne.</para>
					<para>A number of people in Cranbourne wanted to know why the people in the city of Berwick, which is roughly the same distance from Melbourne as the city of Cranbourne, pay a local rate when they call Melbourne and why the people in Cranbourne have to pay an STD rate. This has been happening since the sixties, when a very strange boundary was drawn by Telstra. The people of Cranbourne, when looking at the budget that was tabled last night, are asking some questions: where is our Medicare office; why are we paying STD rates; why do we still have bulk-billing in free-fall; and when is the government going to do something for the people of Cranbourne, this great city with a lot of young families? They are sick of being discriminated against. I hope that we are elected at the next election, then we will be able to deliver the services that I have just mentioned and that the people of Cranbourne desperately need. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para>

						<para>—Contrary to what the previous speaker has said, the federal government, due to sound economic management for eight years, actually has money to spend for families—$19.2 billion in fact. This money has come about only because of strong economic management. This money would not be there to spend—whether or not the opposition thinks that it is more or less or too little in the wrong areas—but for the strong economic management and the record of this government.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>One of the things that have been missed in the enormous coverage of the budget and the many things that it does to assist Australia is the $18 million for a medical school at the University of Western Sydney. That budget provision reflects the government’s commitment to education excellence in Western Sydney. My Western Sydney colleagues, the member for Macarthur and the member for Parramatta, have lobbied the health minister, the education minister and the Prime Minister about funding a medical school at UWS. My vision for the university is that no Western Sydney student will go past UWS to get a degree. UWS should be the No. 1 choice for all students who have grown up in the west, gone to schools in the west and wish to live near their parents in the west.</para>
					<para>I believe that anything else is not good enough. It is not acceptable to have our students travelling past UWS campuses to go to either the University of Sydney or the University of New South Wales when more than two million people live west of Parramatta. I am calling on the state government to pledge their financial support. Our financial support takes effect in the year 2005-06, with expected first enrolments occurring in 2007. The university has to take up this money, take up the challenge and get on with the job of providing a first-class medical school, with places at either Liverpool or Nepean hospitals. Obviously, I will be lobbying for the school to be at the campuses in my area. I have no doubt that the member for Macarthur will be lobbying for the campuses in his area to be the beneficiaries of this new school. Either way, I know that we support each other in delivering this facility to the people of the west.</para>
					<para>I will continue to fight for these medical school places to be bonded to the Nepean region. This is a region in which over 60 per cent of the local GPs do not live in the area. The school will also help fight the doctor shortage in the west. I will continue to fight for a dental school and a number of other university schools that need to be established on the UWS campuses to match the great eight sandstone universities. I will continue that campaign. However, this first $18 million is a down payment on our commitment to Western Sydney. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para>

						<para>—Today I would like to raise an issue that should be of great concern to members on both sides of this parliament: cover for ambulance services for pensioners. Centrelink currently advertises in their publication that all pensioners are covered for ambulance services no matter where they travel in Australia. The fact is that that is not quite true. There has been a problem with agreements between the states in relation to ambulance cover for pensioners. That has resulted in some pensioners being hit with very large bills when they have had to seek treatment in another state. In the ACT, New South Wales pensioners are fully covered, as they are in South Australia and Victoria. In the Northern Territory and Western Australia they are covered only for emergencies, and in Tasmania they are covered for emergency situations only by state ambulance. However, in Queensland they do not have any cover whatsoever.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>I am currently dealing with some constituents who may have to sell their house to pay for the ambulance service that they received in another state in an emergency situation. Centrelink has been contacted. They were unaware of this. I think the government is beholden to advertise through the Centrelink publication that pensioners are not covered for ambulance services when they are travelling in Queensland. A lot of the private health funds will not accept ambulance contributions from pensioners because they argue that they are covered for ambulance services by their pension card. NIB says that they believe that pensioners are fully covered by their health card. MBF says that there is no need for extra cover. HCF says a similar thing. This is getting the wrong information out to pensioners.</para>
					<para>I encourage the government to include something in the Centrelink publication that says that pensioners do need to get extra cover and that they are not covered when they are travelling interstate. If they do not know this it can result in a very nasty situation where pensioners could even be forced to sell their house to cover the bill they receive. I am sure that the Minister for Health and Ageing will take this up and make sure that pensioners throughout Australia are made aware of this situation. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para>

						<para>—Today I want to inform the parliament of a very special event I attended in my electorate last month. I have had the great pleasure and privilege of being patron of the Eagleby State School for many years now. It is a remarkable public school that is doing a fantastic job and setting standards in many respects, including in boys' education, literacy and numeracy. We hear so many negative stories about public schools, largely due to the false and negative media campaign being waged by Labor and the unions, but I have to say that this school is truly remarkable. There are many other public schools in my electorate, and it really annoys me when I see Labor continue to perpetuate the myth that public schools are not as good as private schools and public schools do not get the same degree of funding.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>Before I speak about the special event I attended at Eagleby State School, I want to place on record the simple fact that when it comes to school funding the 2.2 million students who attend state schools get about $19.9 billion of total public funding and the 1.04 million students who attend Catholic and independent schools receive a total of $6.2 billion in public funding. So private schools teach about half the number of students but get less than a third of the funding of public schools. I state this simply to make the point that the campaign that Labor and the unions are running is simply wrong. Worse than that, I believe that they denigrate the public school system. They try to portray them as some poor second cousin, and in doing so they are sending the message that private schools offer a better education than public schools. I see in my electorate that that is just not the case. Certainly Eagleby State School is a case in point.</para>
					<para>The special assembly I attended last month included presentations to the school's sporting and house captains. The children delivered wonderful speeches they had written themselves on leadership, and one day I am going to take the opportunity to read them out in this House but I do not have the time this morning. I want to commend Aislinn Spencer and Kye French on their inspirational speeches. We certainly need leadership like that of Aislinn and Kye in the future, and no doubt they will inspire many other Eagleby State School students to do their best and take on leadership roles, both in school and hopefully in the wider community. The values that these children are learning at Eagleby State School are quite remarkable, due largely to the support, guidance and examples they receive from their teachers. I take the opportunity to thank and congratulate all teachers at Eagleby State School on the excellent job they are doing. The leadership programs you have in place and the excellent curriculum are clearly reaping benefits at the school.</para>
					<para>In the short time I have left I want to quickly congratulate one particular teacher, Mrs Sharon Dwyer, who is one of a handful of teachers selected out of over 1,800 nominations around Australia for the national Excellence in Teaching Award. It would take much more time than I have to list all the excellent work that Sharon has done. I sincerely congratulate her on her achievements. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para>

						<para>—The vast majority of Logan residents will get nothing from last night’s federal budget. The income tax cuts are available only to those earning more than $52,000 a year and the increased family payments are for people with children. The fact is that four out of five Logan City residents will get no tax cut because they are not on high incomes—they are certainly not earning more than $52,000 a year—and three out of five will get nothing at all from the budget. Logan's residents are the forgotten people in this budget. John Howard used to call lower income people the Howard battlers; they are now John Howard's forgotten people.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>Sixty per cent of Logan residents will not get one red cent out of the budget. When asked why so many people miss out in this budget, Treasurer Costello said on budget night that they got a tax cut last year. That was the $4 a week 'sandwich and milkshake' tax cut that now the Treasurer is saying is more than enough for 60 per cent of Logan residents. It was a derisory tax cut given last year and is one that is taken back as this government gives with one hand and takes with the other. In fact, average Australian households will be paying $12,000 more in income tax in a couple of years time than they were when the Howard government first came to office.</para>
					<para>I also condemn the government for its appalling decision not to fund the vaccine for the deadly pneumococcal disease. I am incensed that the government has described this vaccine as middle-class welfare, which is what John Howard described it as in a discussion. It is not middle-class welfare at all. Families in Logan City do not have a spare $500 lying around for each child's vaccination. For the Howard government to describe immunisation against this deadly disease as middle-class welfare is disgusting and shows just how out of touch this government is.</para>
					<para>I have now tabled more than 5,000 petitions in the federal parliament calling on the government to fund the vaccine for pneumococcal disease. Mr Costello, as is evident from the budget that was released last night, will get a $42 a week tax cut but he is too mean to protect vulnerable children against pneumococcal disease. That will force parents to make a terrible choice between whether they pay the $500 that many residents of Logan City cannot afford or leave their children exposed to and at risk of developing this deadly disease. It is a mean government. It is a government that has excluded many residents of Logan City from the tax cuts and from the family payments, which means that the vast majority of my constituents will miss out altogether—they will not get one red cent. It is a derisory budget for the people of Logan City. That is very disappointing but I do not think that you could expect much more from this mean and tricky and out-of-touch government.</para>

						<para>—Tuesday's budget delivers a trifecta for working mothers. It delivers on taxation reform, on superannuation reform and on aged care. It also addresses national security issues which have been of long-term concern to many Australians. There are aspects of the budget in relation to youth services and self-funded retirees which perhaps need further addressing, but let me come back to the trifecta for working mothers. The most important reform in that regard is threefold. Firstly, there is the maternity allowance of $3,000, rising to $5,000 in 2008 for each newborn baby. In addition, the government will spend $19.2 billion on increased family assistance over a five-year period, including the family tax benefit part A, which will include a lump-sum payment of $600 per child plus an annual $600 increase. Secondly, there are the 30,000 child care places, which I know are close to the heart of the minister involved and indeed will be welcomed in my electorate. The third important reform is the tax cut for working mothers, especially if they work part time and could do with those extra dollars in their pocket.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>I have mentioned other aspects which I consider to be important for my electorate, and of course taxation reform is one of the foremost. The cut in the 42 per cent rate, so that the threshold is lifted from $52,000 to $58,000 from 1 July and then to $63,000 from July 2005, will be very welcome for middle-income families. The threshold for the top rate of 47 per cent, jumping from $62,500 to $70,000 on 1 July and then to $80,000 a year later, is also very welcome for middle-income families who have been suffering in the last few years.</para>
					<para>I have mentioned aged care. I have an aged care forum in my electorate. We have pressed for reforms such as those that were brought in by the budget last night, and they are welcome. Apart from the surplus, of course, there are a number of measures which small business will welcome through the small business advisory forum which I conduct. Youth have expressed concern about HECS and self-funded retirees have mentioned the benefits that could flow from a readjustment of the pension. In that regard I commend the budget. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para>
