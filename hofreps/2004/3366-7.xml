The thresholds will be lifted in two stages. From 1 July this year the 42 per cent threshold will be increased from $52,000 to $58,000, and the 47 per cent threshold is to be increased from $62,500 to $70,000. From 1 July 2005, the 42 per cent threshold will be further increased to $63,000 and the 47 per cent threshold to $80,000.</para><para>These changes are specifically targeted at encouraging Australians to increase their work force participation.</para><para>People on middle incomes should not face the top rate of income tax. Policemen and women, fire officers who work harder, who go for a promotion, who do some overtime, cannot be expected to pay 47 cents in the dollar on each additional dollar that they earn. As a matter of incentive, this bill will move that top income tax threshold.</para><para>Australia must also remain internationally competitive in terms of the income threshold at which the highest marginal tax rate cuts in. Many highly skilled Australians, including our young people, are internationally mobile and can choose to work anywhere in the world. It is important that the tax system does not discourage talented people from staying in our country and developing their skills and careers here. This bill will ensure that the top marginal rate does not cut in at an internationally uncompetitive level. It will ensure that Australia strengthens its international position as a low-taxing nation.</para><para>This bill also addresses the unfinished business. It addresses that part of the income tax restructure that was defeated in the Senate in 2000. These tax cuts will deliver on that part of the package that should have been put in place four years ago.</para><para>The tax cuts in this bill will mean that more than 80 per cent of taxpayers will have a top tax rate of 30 per cent or less over the forward estimates period.</para><para>These changes improve the structure of Australia's income tax system. They make it more internationally competitive. They improve incentive. They will help those with skills receive better reward for effort.</para><para>Full details of the measures in this bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum.

It believes that all Australians should have the opportunity to obtain a better standard of living in retirement than the superannuation guarantee and the age pension alone can achieve.</para><para>It was for this reason the government introduced the co-contribution scheme on a dollar-for-dollar basis for eligible low-income earners who make voluntary superannuation contributions.</para><para>But we now propose to take this further.</para><para>This bill will provide a $2.7 billion boost to superannuation incentives over three years. This builds on the government's retirement income policy achievements to provide incentives, flexibility and security in retirement.</para><para>From 1 July this bill will increase the matching rate to $1.50 per $1 of employee contributions up to a maximum co-contribution of $1,500. If an eligible person pays $1,000 into superannuation, the government will match it with $1,500.</para><para>The bill also increases the lower income threshold, up to which the maximum co-contribution applies, to $28,000. Furthermore, for the first time employees with incomes between $40,000 and $58,000 will become eligible for the co-contribution. Currently the co-contribution phases out completely at $40,000.</para><para>These changes will improve retirement savings for over one million Australians who already receive the co-contribution, even if they do not change their saving behaviour. More importantly, they facilitate a significant improvement in retirement incomes for those willing to save a bit more.</para><para>This bill also does more than provide a generous co-contribution scheme. Over the next three years, it will accelerate and further reduce the maximum superannuation contributions surcharge rate to 7.5 per cent for higher income individuals, relative to the current scheduled reduction from 15 to 12.5 per cent. More than half a million Australians will receive a boost to their retirement savings as a result of this initiative.</para><para>In total these measures are estimated to cost $2.7 billion over the forward estimate years. More than three-quarters of the benefits provided by these measures, or $2.1 billion of that $2.7 billion, are targeted to low- and middle-income workers.</para><para>The measures presented in this bill provide a significant opportunity for employees to improve their standards of living in retirement. It is for this reason I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Swan</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>MEDICAL INDEMNITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (RUN-OFF COVER INDEMNITY AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2004</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>28582</page.no><id.no>R2047</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>28582</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Abbott</inline>, and read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>28582</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>28582</page.no><name role="metadata">Abbott, Tony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ABBOTT</name><name.id>EZ5</name.id><electorate>Warringah</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Health and Ageing</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>This <inline ref="R2047">bill</inline>, together with the <inline ref="R2046">Medical Indemnity (Run-off Cover Support Payment) Bill 2004</inline>, gives effect to the final element of the government's medical indemnity package, announced on 17 December 2003.</para><para>This final element will provide a government guaranteed run-off cover scheme to provide secure insurance for doctors once they have retired against compensation claims arising from their previous work. Eligible doctors will not have to pay for this cover once they have retired. The run-off cover scheme will cover the cost of medical indemnity claims for eligible doctors notified from 1 July 2004. </para><para>The government has made a substantial investment in the long-term affordability of premiums for doctors so they can continue to practise with security. Of course, security of cover for doctors also provides security for patients.</para><para>The run-off cover scheme resulted from the recommendations of the Medical Indemnity Policy Review Panel. The role of the panel, which included senior members of the medical profession, was to recommend ways for ensuring an affordable medical indemnity insurance system that would allow doctors to continue to practise with certainty.</para><para>Doctors made it clear to the panel that one of their main concerns about medical indemnity insurance was the need to maintain cover for the possibility of any claims made against them after they retire or leave the medical work force. Many doctors were worried that they would find it difficult to continue to pay for insurance after leaving work. Some groups said that the high cost of retirement cover meant that they felt pressured to continue to work past the point at which it was safe for them to do so.</para><para>The need to purchase insurance in retirement is an outcome of claims-made insurance, under which claims will only be covered if the doctor had current insurance both when the incident giving rise to the claim occurred and when the claim was notified. Under claims-incurred cover, which will meet a claim if the doctor is covered at the time of the incident, the need for retirement cover does not arise.</para><para>While the medical indemnity sector had been moving away from claims-incurred cover for some time, the introduction of APRA supervision of the sector in mid-2003 and the lack of claims-incurred reinsurance in the market led to all medical indemnity cover from that point on being offered on a claims-made basis.</para><para>During consultations with the medical profession it became evident that older doctors who were used to claims-incurred insurance had not made financial provision to maintain claims-made cover once they retired. Even for younger doctors, the need to save throughout their working lives to pay for insurance through their retirement—without any certainty about the level of premiums in retirement—was a very significant concern.</para><para>The government had always intended to resolve the retirement cover issues as part of its broader medical indemnity package. Initially, the government made sure through regulations under the Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) Act 2003 that doctors would have access to run-off cover for six years after they retired or left the private medical work force. But this was only an interim measure while the government, the profession and the insurers worked together on a long-term solution.</para><para>This process fed into the deliberations of the Medical Indemnity Policy Review Panel and led to its proposal for a run-off cover scheme to provide the long-term solution that doctors need.</para><para>The scheme will be established by making amendments to:</para><para>	the Medical Indemnity Act 2002 to set out the eligibility criteria for the run-off cover scheme and the payment arrangements for associated claims; and</para><para>	the Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) Act 2003 to require all medical indemnity insurers to grant indemnity to doctors who are eligible for the run-off cover scheme at no cost to the doctors. </para><para>The basic design of the scheme is that insurers will grant eligible doctors an indemnity, which will be deemed to be a contract of insurance for most purposes.</para><para>As claims against those doctors emerge they will be managed and met by the insurers.</para><para>The government will then reimburse the insurers for the costs of the claims.</para><para>The government has also agreed to pick up through the scheme the incurred but not reported claims against eligible doctors arising from their period of claims-incurred cover with a medical defence organisation.</para><para>Under the eligibility criteria for the scheme some doctors will be covered permanently and others will leave when their circumstances change. The following practitioners will be covered by the scheme:</para><para>	retirees over the age of 65 or more who have declared that they have retired permanently from the private work force;</para><para>	doctors who are permanently disabled;</para><para>	doctors who are under 65 years of age and have not engaged in private medical practice for three years—and I note this group can include those who have retired before the age of 65 and those who are no longer practising medicine or are solely working in the public sector;</para><para>	doctors who are on maternity leave; and</para><para>	doctors who have died (provided that a claim can still be made against the doctor's estate).</para><para>There will also be a capacity for new groups of doctors to be included in the scheme by way of regulations including temporary resident doctors who have left Australia permanently to become eligible for the run-off cover scheme immediately on leaving Australia. </para><para>Doctors who already meet the qualifying criteria will be eligible for cover from the run-off cover scheme for claims notified on or after 1 July 2004. Other doctors will become eligible over time.</para><para>Doctors won't have to apply for cover under the scheme. Insurers will be obliged to issue a contract when they are aware that the doctor is eligible.</para><para>Under the scheme the scope of doctors' cover will be determined by the last cover they purchased during their working lives to cover incidents which occurred while they were practising. This arrangement should provide doctors with a seamless transition into the scheme once they are no longer practising.</para><para>However, if a doctor returns to the private medical workforce then he or she is no longer eligible for the scheme in respect of new claims notified after his or her return to private medical work.  </para><para>As not all doctors who cease private practice will immediately meet the eligibility criteria for the run-off cover scheme, the government will also amend the Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) Act 2003 and its associated regulations so that insurers will provide run-off cover to doctors not eligible for the scheme who require run-off cover for at least three years `at cost'.</para><para>The government will also contract with insurers to provide run-off cover at nominal cost to doctors who have been members or policy holders for 10 years or more and who are not eligible for the run-off cover scheme.</para><para>Medical indemnity insurers will contribute to the cost of the scheme by an annual charge on their individual gross insurance premium incomes. This charge will be set as a tax in the Medical Indemnity (Run-off Cover Support Payment) Bill 2004, which forms part of the package of bills presented here today. </para><para>The upper limit of the rate of tax is set in the bill before you. This is simply a default rate, to allow some scope to respond to changing circumstances over time. I propose to put forward regulations to the Executive Council which would set a lower rate of 8.5 per cent from 1 July 2004. This lower rate reflects the estimated total cost of the cohort of doctors entering the scheme each year as they retire.</para><para>Most medical indemnity insurers will be able to provision for their payment to this scheme from 1 July 2004 as their premium cycles run on a financial year basis. Their run-off cover support payment will be due at the end of each financial year.</para><para>To take account of one insurer collecting premiums on a calendar year basis, I propose to put forward regulations which will provide for it to be taxed at the end of a calendar year. As the first year for which the insurer will be taxed will be 2005, I also propose that it be taxed at a rate 1.0625 per cent higher than other insurers for the first four years of the scheme. This will ensure that the insurer makes an equivalent contribution to other insurers to the cost of the scheme, even though it will not be taxed for the first six months of the 2004-05 financial year. Its members will already be eligible for the run-off cover scheme from 1 July 2004.</para><para>Representatives of the medical profession have told the government how important the run-off cover scheme is and also appreciate that this tax will be applied proportionately and transparently to premiums paid by practising doctors. I acknowledge the support and assistance of the medical profession as the government has developed this aspect of its medical indemnity package.</para><para>The government is also very aware of doctors' needs for both transparency in financial transactions and security of insurance cover in their retirement. The government has responded to these concerns in two significant ways in its design of the run-off cover scheme.</para><para>First, medical indemnity insurers will have to include information on doctors' premium invoices which shows the gross premium payable by the doctor and that proportion and amount of the premium which the insurer will pass on to the government under the run-off cover support payment scheme. </para><para>Second, the government will provide a money-back guarantee to working doctors, if the run-off cover scheme were ever terminated in the future before they became eligible for the scheme without an equivalent government scheme being provided. The government will refund these doctors their implicit contribution to the run-off cover support payment made by insurers, plus interest. The refund will be paid at the direction of individual doctors for the purpose of purchasing alternative medical indemnity insurance. </para><para>These arrangements show the government's clear commitment to transparent, secure arrangements for medical indemnity insurance.</para><para>To make sure that there is a seamless transition between the run-off cover scheme the government will also refine aspects of its existing Exceptional Claims Scheme. Under the proposed changes the Exceptional Claims Scheme will be able to pay claims against doctors for claims arising from treatment of public patients in public hospitals where the doctors were covered by a medical indemnity provider at the time of the incident giving rise to the claim. Such claims are presently excluded from the Exceptional Claims Scheme. </para><para>As a result of the amendments proposed in the bill a retired doctor who was once covered for such claims under `claims made' discretionary cover with a medical defence organisation would not be personally liable for amounts in excess of the limit of their run-off cover scheme contract. </para><para>The government is also aware that doctors continued to be concerned about their personal exposure to exceptional claims in relation to services they provide when accompanying sporting teams or cultural groups. The government has responded to these concerns by introducing regulation-making provisions in this bill to widen the scope of the Exceptional Claims Scheme. I propose to put forward regulations extending the scope of the Exceptional Claims Scheme to overseas treatment by doctors in these circumstances.</para><para>The run-off cover scheme is good news for doctors. Together with the Exceptional Claims Scheme, and the government's continued work with the states and territories on the implementation of tort law reform, this scheme will allow doctors to continue to practise with security into the future, and security when they retire. This is essential for the maintenance of health services and the protection of patients</para><para>The scheme demonstrates the government's commitment to doctors to support them in the vitally important services they provide to the Australian community.

Tourism Australia will harness the skills of four of Australia's key tourism bodies under one umbrella, and is integral in the delivery of a number of the tourism white paper initiatives. A smooth transition of these bodies into Tourism Australia will ensure that the Australian tourism industry can capitalise on the upcoming launch of Brand Australia and the 2004-05 budget initiatives such as aviation and border security, transport measures, Commonwealth Games funding, the boost to the Regional Partnerships program, income tax cuts and tax reductions for the wine industry.</para><para>The Tourism Australia (Repeal and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2004 has two main objectives.</para><para>First, this bill repeals the Australian Tourist Commission Act 1987.</para><para>Second, this bill puts in place arrangements to assist the transfer of the undertakings and employees of the Australian Tourist Commission, the undertakings of the Bureau of Tourism Research and the Tourism Forecasting Council, and particular assets associated with See Australia into Tourism Australia.</para><para>The tourism white paper was the culmination of a process that was characterised by an unprecedented level of industry and government partnership.</para><para>The first stage in this process was the release of <inline font-style="italic">The 10-year plan for tourism: a discussion paper</inline> in May 2002. The paper was accessed by 42,000 people. Consultations were held at approximately 30 locations around the country with a diverse range of industry sectors and interest groups, resulting in 270 written submissions.</para><para>This process fed into the tourism green paper, which was released in June 2003. It was the first time a nationally focused draft strategic plan had been informed by a coordinated whole-of-industry response, through the tourism industry forum—a collaborative forum of key industry associations.</para><para>The tourism green paper was accessed by over 90,000 people and prompted an additional 155 written responses, which came from the widest possible range of governments, tourism operators and industry associations.</para><para>The feedback from stakeholders was of considerable assistance to the government in the development of the tourism white paper, which was launched on 20 November 2003. The release of this paper was the fulfilment of a coalition election commitment to develop a medium- to long-term strategy for tourism.</para><para>As part of the tourism white paper, the Australian government seeks to strengthen relationships between governments, within government and with the tourism industry. A number of groups have been established to help implement initiatives in the tourism white paper, including a Tourism Australia structural reform group, which was formed to provide advice on the establishment of Tourism Australia.</para><para>An industry implementation advisory group comprising representatives from key national tourism organisations and state and federal tourism bodies was also established to advise the government on the implementation of white paper initiatives and to provide feedback to their members.</para><para>Like the Tourism Australia Bill 2004, this bill has been prepared in consultation with the Tourism Australia structural reform group and the industry implementation advisory group and has the support of both groups.</para><para>The Australian Tourist Commission is a statutory body corporate continued in existence under the Australian Tourist Commission Act 1987. On repeal of this act, the Australian Tourist Commission will cease to exist. Provisions in the bill will be used to effect the seamless transfer of the assets, liabilities, contracts and employees of the Australian Tourist Commission to Tourism Australia without the need for any conveyance, transfer or assignment. </para><para>The Bureau of Tourism Research and the Tourism Forecasting Council are administrative bodies within the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources. Provisions are included in the bill to effect the transfer, via ministerial declaration, of the assets, liabilities and contracts of the Commonwealth which relate to the activities of the Bureau of Tourism Research and the Tourism Forecasting Council to Tourism Australia.</para><para>The Australian government will transfer ownership of intellectual property which relates to the activities of the Bureau of Tourism Research and the Tourism Forecasting Council to Tourism Australia.

The bill makes provision for the employees of the Australian Tourist Commission (other than the managing director) to become employees of Tourism Australia at the commencement date. Employees will be engaged by Tourism Australia on the same terms and conditions as they are currently employed by the Australian Tourist Commission. The service of a transferred employee as an employee of Tourism Australia will also be taken to have been continuous with the service of the employee as an employee of the Australian Tourist Commission.</para><para>Employees of the Bureau of Tourism Research and the Tourism Forecasting Council will be transferred to Tourism Australia using mechanisms prescribed in section 72 of the Public Service Act 1999.

These businesses generated $5.5 billion in export revenue and reported employment of over 122,000 Australians.</para><para>The Australian government has a continuing focus on assisting small and medium Australian businesses. This is evidenced nowhere better than through the EMDG scheme. Last year 65 per cent of EMDG recipients were employing 20 people or less. Equally importantly, 860 or 23 per cent of grants were paid to businesses in rural and regional Australia.</para><para>Currently under the EMDG Act 1997, even if an applicant may otherwise have been eligible for a grant, there are provisions that determine circumstances in which a grant will not be paid. Sections 85 to 87A specify that grants are not payable if the applicant is not a resident of Australia, does not have an Australian business number, has outstanding disqualifying convictions or is under insolvency administration. </para><para>What the legislation does not presently allow for is the non-payment of a grant to an applicant who may be viewed by the Australian community as an inappropriate person to represent and promote the public interest of Australia in relation to trade overseas, whether by reference to his or her trading history or otherwise.</para><para>This government does not condone behaviour considered by the Australian electorate to be inconsistent with accepted community standards of commercial and personal propriety. We have a duty to taxpayers to ensure that grants paid via government schemes are not paid to recipients other than those who meet these standards.</para><para>Austrade will only be able to make such decisions with reference to ministerial guidelines, which the Minister for Trade will table shortly. The consent of an applicant or his or her associates will be required prior to Austrade undertaking criminal or other relevant checks.</para><para>The proposed changes are to take effect for EMDG claims from the 2003-04 EMDG grant year. In other words, this provision will apply to applications received and grants paid from 1 July 2004 onwards.</para><para>I commend this bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Swan</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ANTI-TERRORISM BILL 2004</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>28590</page.no><id.no>R2032</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>28590</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 12 May, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ruddock</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>28590</page.no><name role="metadata">Dutton, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DUTTON</name><name.id>00AKI</name.id><electorate>Dickson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I made some opening remarks last night in relation to this very important issue. I want to continue today to speak about the effect that the <inline ref="R2032">Anti-terrorism Bill 2004</inline> will have and the benefit that it will provide to the Australian people by way of giving additional resources and abilities to the Australian defence and intelligence agencies. I spoke last night about the proposed amendments in the first part to the Crimes Act. The second element that I want to discuss today that this bill has an effect upon is the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act. That act currently deals with incursions—hostile invasions—into foreign states by Australian citizens or residents. The <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline> says:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Among other things, the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act creates the offences of entering a foreign state with intent to engage in a hostile activity in that state, and engaging in a hostile activity in a foreign state ... The objective of the activity must be to overthrow the government of the foreign state; engage in armed hostilities; cause death or bodily injury (or fear thereof) to the head of state or a person who holds or performs the duties of public office; or unlawfully destroy or damage any real or personal property belonging to the government of the foreign state ...</para></quote><para>A person does not commit an offence under subsection 6(1) if he or she was serving `in any capacity or with' the armed forces of the government of a foreign state or `any other armed force in respect of which a declaration by the minister under subsection 9(2) is in force'. </para><para>That act also creates offences of preparing for incursions into foreign states, in section 7; recruiting persons to join organisations engaged in hostile activities against foreign governments, in section 8; and recruiting persons in Australia to serve in or with an armed force in a foreign state, which is covered by section 9. The act also provides that the written consent of the Attorney-General is required before instituting a prosecution for an offence under the act, which is covered in section 10. </para><para>At the Security in Government conference in Canberra in March this year, the Attorney-General outlined his plan to amend the act by way of this bill `to make it an offence to fight with a rogue or terrorist state'. The Attorney explained the rationale for the amendment as follows:</para><quote><para>The reason is quite clear. In looking at the matters of Hicks and Habib where we sought to see whether there was a basis on which they could be prosecuted in Australia for their behaviour abroad ... we found that enactment did not enable us to deal with a range of situations, particularly where terrorist organisations are in fact instruments of a state such as the Taliban.</para></quote><para>The Attorney said that the amendment would not be retrospective, with the effect that the amended law `could not be used to bring Hicks and Habib, the two Australians detained in Guantanamo Bay, back to Australia to be prosecuted'. That is an important aspect that needs to be highlighted today as part of this debate.</para><para>The bill seeks to amend the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act to broaden the scope of the offence contained in section 6. The bill provides that the defence in section 6(4) does not apply if a person enters a foreign state while in or with an organisation which has been proscribed by the regulations as a terrorist organisation at the time of entry. The bill also provides that the defence in section 6(4) does not apply if the person engages in a hostile activity in a foreign state while in or with an organisation which is a proscribed organisation at the time of the hostile activity. It is very clear, from a digestion of that proposal, that the current law does need to be amended. That is what we as a government seek to do in the second part of this bill.</para><para>The third aspect of this bill, broadly speaking, is that it seeks to amend the Criminal Code Act to extend the operation of the membership offence in section 102.3 to include membership of an organisation which falls within paragraph (a) of the other definition of `terrorist organisation' in section 102.1(1). At present, a person commits an offence under section 102.3 if the person intentionally is a member of an organisation; the organisation is a specified terrorist organisation—being one which falls within paragraphs (b) to (e) of the definition of `terrorist organisation' in section 102.1(1); and the person knows the organisation is a terrorist organisation. Again, that is an important aspect of this bill. The bill also seeks to amend the offences in section 102.5. The bill now distinguishes between non-proscribed organisations or those which a court may find fall within paragraph (a) of the definition of a terrorist organisation when a terrorist offence is prosecuted—that is the proposed section 102.5(1)—and those organisations specified as terrorist organisations under the proposed section 102.5(2).</para><para>The fourth main element to this bill relates to the Proceeds of Crime Act. Among other things, the Proceeds of Crime Act currently empowers a court to control certain proceeds from publications that relate to an indictable offence against Commonwealth law or a foreign indictable offence. A court can control literary proceeds of indictable fences. I would not think that there is anything that is more abhorrent to the Australian people than to see somebody benefit or receive proceeds from their crime through the sale of a book or some other such activity, and that is the loophole that the Attorney sought to close in this section of the bill.</para><para>The revised definition extends the meaning of foreign indictable offence to provide that, where a person commits an offence against a foreign law at a time when the conduct was not an offence under Australian law but where the conduct is an offence against Australian law at the time when an application is made for a restraining or confiscation order under the Proceeds of Crime Act, the conduct is then treated as a foreign indictable offence. In this way, the effect of the proposed amendment is to provide for the retrospective application of future offence provisions, not to charge or convict a person but to prevent a person deriving a commercial benefit from the conduct. </para><para>The bill also extends the operation of the legislation to situations where literary proceeds are derived overseas but later transferred to Australia. According to Mr Ruddock's second reading speech, the purpose of the proceeds of crime legislation is to:</para><quote><para> ... discourage and deter crime by diminishing the capacity of offenders to finance future criminal activities and to remedy the unjust enrichment of criminals who profit at society's expense.</para></quote><para>As I said in my opening remarks, this bill before us today provides for a better platform and a stronger basis from which the Australian defence and intelligence organisations and the law enforcement agencies in this country can go forward to fight the evils of terrorism.</para><para>This bill effects important amendments to ensure the continuing effectiveness of Australia's counter-terrorism laws. In summary, I say that it does that by: firstly, equipping law enforcement agencies with the ability to appropriately investigate terrorism offences; secondly, ensuring foreign incursion offences extend to cover terrorists; thirdly, strengthening certain Criminal Code offences to better target membership of and training with terrorist organisations; and, fourthly, enhancing the application of the literary proceeds regime to persons who commit foreign indictable offences. The bill updates Australia's law to meet the new terrorist environment while ensuring that appropriate safeguards are put in place to maintain the balance between security and individual rights and freedom.</para><para>I am sure this bill will pass through this place and move to another place and be discussed in other forums. The opposition and the minor parties in the other place need to approach this bill with sensitivity and understanding of the seriousness of what this bill proposes. As I said before, we do provide protection of people's rights—and quite rightly—while at the same time balancing that with the necessary protections to provide security for the Australian people. I say to the Labor Party that this is not a bill to play politics on. You need to change your previous stances and the way in which you have dealt with antiterrorism legislation in this country. I am sure the Australian people would expect of the Labor Party what we have not seen up until now—that is, a more bipartisan approach that supports the government's strong stance against terrorism and supports the government's strong stance in providing support to those agencies that combat terrorism. I urge the Labor Party not to continue to be held up by this ideological opposition and this very blind, inward-looking process that they have adopted so far in opposing and amending at every step of the way legislation that we have put forward.</para><para>The Labor Party need to come together with the coalition government in relation to this very important legislation to support its passage through the Senate and to support its passage through some of the committees that have been set up. It is a good opportunity for the Labor Party to send a message to the Australian people that they are now of a mind to agree with the coalition's strong stance against terrorism, to stop playing political games and to stop being held to ransom by the lunatic left of the party, who cut all these backroom deals. I am sure that this is an opportunity for the Labor Party to stick their hands up and say, `This is an opportunity for us to support the coalition government, which continues to support the Australian people and continues to try and provide the opportunity for our intelligence and law enforcement agencies to combat and defeat terrorism wherever it might rise.' I say to the Australian people today that the Howard government remains committed over decades to come to protecting and securing this country and to building the future of this country. We will remain committed to those values for as long as we are in government and for many years beyond. I commend the bill to the House. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>28593</page.no><name role="metadata">Danby, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DANBY</name><name.id>WF6</name.id><electorate>Melbourne Ports</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to give the opposition's bipartisan support for the provisions of the <inline ref="R2032">Anti-terrorism Bill 2004</inline>. This bill arises from the commendable bipartisan recommendations of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. The defence of Australia and Australian citizens abroad against the threat of terrorism is a matter that is above party politics in this House. Indeed, it is my belief that, when serious proposals by the government have come to this House, they have always been dealt with in this way by the opposition while this government has been in office. When this government introduces antiterrorist measures which are judicious, have appropriate safeguards and can be shown to be in the national interest, those measures have the support of this side of the House. I am sure that members opposite will still support such measures when they are introduced by a Labor government in the future.</para></talk.start><para>I have a particular interest in this bill. Many residents in my electorate live in fear of terrorist attacks on their schools, their places of worship, their businesses and their homes. They have seen such attacks in Argentina, Turkey, France, Germany, Tunisia and, of course—almost on a weekly basis—Israel. They worry, and not unreasonably, that Australia will be next and that they and their families will be next. People in my electorate have gone to great lengths to provide for their own security. Every weekend I see many armed guards outside synagogues and schools in my electorate. My constituents, like all Australians, have the expectation—a valid expectation—that this parliament, together with state parliaments, will take all reasonable steps to prevent terrorist attacks in Australia and to prevent Australia being used as a base for such attacks on other countries. </para><para>What is the nature and the capability of the terrorist threat? It was very well described in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> today by its well-informed columnist, Mr Gregory Hywood, who said of terrorists these days:</para><quote><para>Well funded, well armed, with time on their side, the internet at their fingertips and open societies as their targets, radical Islamists can make this a much more dangerous world in a decade or two. The sort of place where attendance at  public meetings, sports events, bars, parties and the like involve inordinate personal risk. </para></quote><para>In other words, the victory of al-Qaeda would put at risk the Australian way of life. Before 12 October 2002, when 88 of our countrymen were killed in Bali, we had a belief in Australia that we were immune from the attentions of international terrorism. We know that that was carried out by Jemaah Islamiah, the local franchise of al-Qaeda. Australians were deliberately targeted by this network. Their initial reason for doing so was because of the terrible crime Australia allegedly committed in helping liberate the people of East Timor from Indonesian rule. That is something that had bipartisan support in this House.</para><para>It is undoubtedly true that the operation in Iraq has increased the risk of terrorism, as Australian Federal Police Commissioner, Mick Keelty, has said. That is something that needs to be faced squarely and not evaded. The need for the measures in this bill flows directly from the lessons learnt in investigations of the Bali bombing. Commissioner Keelty of the Australian Federal Police, supported by state and territory police commissioners, made a strong case to Australian governments that if governments were serious about not only catching those guilty of such atrocities but also preventing repetitions then our intelligence and law enforcement agencies needed to be given appropriate powers to carry out these tasks. On 18 March this year the Commonwealth, state and territory police commissioners issued a communique referring to: </para><quote><para>The need to ensure that the Commonwealth Crimes Act allows for appropriate investigative processes and interviewing of persons suspected of terrorist-related offences. </para></quote><para>They were of the view that: </para><quote><para>The current Commonwealth legislation may undermine a successful prosecution of offenders engaged in significant terrorist activity. </para></quote><para>This statement reflected the police commissioners' view that, while we have not suffered a terrorist attack inside Australia, after what happened in the United States on September 11, after what happened in Istanbul in November 2003 and certainly after what happened in Madrid on 11 March this year, we cannot assume that such a thing will not happen here. </para><para>There are countries such as Israel where people live with attacks on innocent civilians every day. On 2 May Palestinian Islamic Jihad, an Iranian backed terrorist surrogate—very recently proscribed in Australia, with bipartisan support—murdered pregnant Tali Hatuel and her four daughters. I want to describe what they did so that we understand the nature of these people and what we are up against. They went up to the car and deliberately shot the four young sisters Hila, aged 11, Hadar, aged 9, and Roni, aged 7, who were sitting in the back of the car, and two-year-old Meirau, who was strapped into her baby seat. Thankfully, Australia does not have to face atrocities of this kind, but we must accept the fact that people of the kind who carry out these types of deeds are capable of doing something similar in Australia. </para><para>There are two elements to the campaign against terrorism: the prevention of terrorist attacks and the apprehension of those responsible when attacks do occur or when planning for them is known to have occurred in Australia. Australians were gratified that the Indonesian police, led by General Pastika, acted as efficiently as they did to apprehend the Bali bombers. The Deputy Speaker and I, along with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, had occasion to meet some of the Indonesian authorities in Jakarta in recent months. We were very impressed by their efficiency in the terrorist investigation. The obligation cuts two ways: we have an obligation not only to our own citizens but to those of countries like Indonesia and the Philippines, where terrorist attacks have been carried out, to ensure Australia is not used as a base for the planning, financing or commissioning of acts or indeed for recruiting for them. </para><para>Last year this parliament addressed the issue of prevention when we agreed to give ASIO new powers to detain and question persons with information about terrorist offences. This bill is a necessary complement to last year's bill. It gives Australia's police forces additional powers for the purpose of gathering evidence that would assist in prosecutions. This bill does a number of important things. First, by amending the Crimes Act, it gives police the power to ask a magistrate for permission to question a person suspected of a terrorist offence—and this term is carefully defined—for up to 24 hours, rather than for the four hours currently allowed. Indigenous Australians and minors are excluded from this provision. It also allows police to detain a person for a reasonable additional period while inquiries into their activities are made in countries outside Australia, bearing in mind difficulties created by time zones. These are reasonable provisions in the current circumstances. </para><para>Organisations like Jemaah Islamiah and al-Qaeda do not play by Marquess of Queensberry rules, as we saw on television with the shocking murder of Mr Berg yesterday. In an earlier brutality of Lashkar-e-Taiba—another al-Qaeda franchise—they carried out the equally shocking murder of <inline font-style="italic">Wall Street Journal</inline> South-East Asia reporter Daniel Pearl. These organisations seek to build networks in countries like Australia through which they can seek recruits and raise funds to carry out attacks in countries in our region. There must be appropriate safeguards so that innocent people are not unfairly treated. I will return to this point shortly. There also must be a legal regime which allows police a reasonable opportunity to question a person who may be guilty of carrying out or planning to carry out one of these atrocious crimes against innocent civilians. </para><para>Second, by amending the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act and the Criminal Code Act, this bill provides stronger penalties for Australians who commit terrorist acts outside Australia or who choose to join an organisation which they know to be a terrorist one. An Australian who joins such an organisation, in the knowledge that it is an organisation which is planning to carry out terrorist attacks, is in my mind a terrorist—even if they do not actually plant the bomb themselves, even if the terrorist acts that the organisation carries out take place in Spain, Turkey, Baghdad or Gaza rather than Sydney, Canberra or elsewhere in Australia. Australians have a commonsense understanding that joining one of these fanatical groups or going abroad to train with them in Afghanistan or Pakistan is not a game. People who train and fight with organisations like Lashkar-e-Taiba are not making a political protest against the Australian government, the US government or any other government. They are making a conscious decision to participate in terrorist organisations and terrorist acts all around the world.</para><para>The Labor Party make no apologies for supporting greater police powers to combat terrorism, but we also make no apologies for being a party which has a long history of safeguarding the civil liberties of Australians. Those of us who grew up during the Cold War and the Vietnam War have unhappy memories of the way in which governments misuse police powers to suppress legitimate dissent. For a bill such as this one to be acceptable to the Australian people, it must be accompanied by appropriate safeguards. As the honourable member for Barton has said:</para><quote><para>Prolonged detention of citizens without charge is an extraordinary measure which should only be sanctioned in exceptional circumstances where it is necessary to counter a demonstrated and urgent threat to the safety of the community.</para></quote><para>Much as I detest terrorist organisations and anyone who aids them, I strongly agree with this sentiment. I think it is the general sentiment of people in the opposition. However, it creates a dilemma for me and those on this side, as I am sure it does for members on the other side. If we allow the rights of Australians to be eroded in the name of fighting terrorism, we give the terrorists a victory, but if we fail to recognise that we are dealing with ruthless, desperate and, quite frankly, evil people and do not take appropriate steps to stop them we also give them a victory. There is no easy or perfect solution to this dilemma. But I am pleased to see, thanks to the bipartisan labours of the Senate committee, that important safeguards have been built into this bill. The honourable member for Barton outlined these in his speech, and I fully support them. </para><para>The most important of the amendments to the Crimes Act is the safeguard that a magistrate or justice cannot allow the police an extension of the period for questioning a suspect unless they are satisfied that further detention is necessary to preserve or obtain evidence to complete an investigation, that the investigation is being conducted properly and without delay and that the detained person or their legal representative has been given an opportunity to make representations about the application to extend the period of questioning. The bill also contains safeguards for persons aged under 18, for persons whose first language is not English and for persons who are not Australian citizens. It imposes on police an obligation to treat a suspect humanely and to tape-record any questionings of suspects.</para><para>I think the bill as it now stands represents a reasonable balance between the need to give our police forces effective powers to investigate terrorist acts and terrorist threats and the need to ensure the rights of Australian citizens are not infringed. I agree with the member for Barton that this parliament must scrutinise the operations of the act we are amending, and I support his proposal that there should be an independent review of the operation of these amendments after three years.</para><para>There are also safeguards in the amendments to the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act and the Criminal Code, particularly for persons who find themselves involuntarily conscripted into the armed forces of a state which is acting as a sponsor of terrorism. There are some Australians who may be liable to conscription in their countries of birth and once conscripted they may not be able to withdraw from the armed forces of this country, even if they become aware that those armed forces are involved in terrorism. I find it hard to imagine the circumstances in which this is likely to arise, but I agree that there is a need to protect such `theoretical' persons. Any bill which increases the powers of the state, whether it is the armed forces, the police or security organisations, in relation to the rights of the citizen by giving agencies more powers to arrest, to detain, to interrogate, to investigate and to scrutinise citizens must be given the most careful scrutiny by this parliament. My instinct, and I am sure the instinct of most members, is to oppose such suggestions.</para><para>One of the things that makes Australia a better place to live than practically any place in the world is the freedom of speech and action that we enjoy—free from control and supervision by the state. My electorate is full of people who have come to Australia to get away from precisely the types of regimes which restrict individual freedoms and, indeed, which place people's lives in peril. But the sad fact is that we now live in a world not of our choice—a world in which terrorists, particularly of non-state organisations, pose a threat to our freedom, our property and our lives. It is also a sad fact that a tiny number of Australians are foolish or misguided and support some of these organisations. Some of them have even sought to join them or to join in their evil actions.</para><para>I represent an electorate where many people feel the threat particularly sharply, since they rightly feel that it is directed against them specifically. Therefore, I have to decide where the balance lies in any particular case. I would oppose a proposal to give the police unlimited powers, but this bill is not such a proposal. It is a balanced and appropriate bill, agreed to after proper scrutiny by senior members of both parties who sit on the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee. It contains important safeguards and a provision for it to be reviewed after three years. Therefore, I and the opposition have no hesitation in supporting this bill. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>28597</page.no><name role="metadata">Ciobo, Steven, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CIOBO</name><name.id>00AN0</name.id><electorate>Moncrieff</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the <inline ref="R2032">Anti-terrorism Bill 2004</inline>. It is an important piece of legislation that makes a number of amendments to previous acts of this parliament to deal with the need that we as a nation have to adequately protect ourselves against the activities of terrorist organisations. The purpose of this bill is to strengthen Australia's counter-terrorism measures by amending specifically the Crimes Act 1914, the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act 1978, the Criminal Code Act 1995 and the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. The effect of these amendments is to provide a more robust response and preparedness to deal with terrorism and with those who engage in terrorist recruitment, training and acts.</para></talk.start><para>This bill will ensure that we equip law enforcement agencies with the ability to appropriately investigate terrorism offences. It ensures that foreign incursion offences are extended to cover terrorists. It strengthens certain Criminal Code offences to better target membership in terrorist organisations and training with terrorist organisations. It enhances the application of the literary proceeds regime to persons who commit foreign indictable offences. And, importantly, it updates our laws to better deal with terrorism, while maintaining a balance between the safeguards to protect individual rights and freedom and the need to ensure security.</para><para>I was pleased to listen to the member for Melbourne Ports, who on the opposition benches is one of those solid individuals who concerns himself with the fight that Australia has to ensure that we are adequately protected against terrorists. I am pleased that the opposition is also supporting the broad thrust of this bill, which is to provide safety and security to Australians. There were several aspects that concerned me, though, of not only the contribution of the member for Melbourne Ports to the debate in this chamber but also comments that the member for Barton and, for example, the Democrats and the Greens have made in debate as well as broadly in the media.</para><para>With respect to a comment that the member for Barton made and as part of the overall thrust that I have heard from the opposition about the importance of balancing civil liberties with the need to ensure security, I will make some comments. The member for Barton made comments to the effect that prolonged detention of Australians in the absence of extraordinary circumstances is unacceptable. That certainly is a principle with which I believe no-one on this side of the House would have any problem. The question, though, is really: is the extension as outlined in this bill of concern? Is an extension from eight hours to potentially 24 hours of detention something that most Australians would feel is prolonged detention?</para><para>When you consider that the offences with which we are dealing and concerning ourselves today are terrorism offences then you have to say—and I expect that most Australians would be in agreement—that 24 hours is not prolonged detention. I am quite comfortable to say that 24 hours is a very reasonable time to enable our police officers and security to deal with the kinds of issues and investigate the kinds of matters that lie at the core of a terrorist offence. Most definitely, if members of the opposition argue on a matter of principle that we should be concerning ourselves with whether this amount of time is appropriate, I ask: at what point do you draw the line in the sand? Why is eight hours considered to be an appropriate amount of time but not 10 hours? Why not six hours? Why not 12 hours? The point is that these are arbitrary measures. </para><para>At some point in the past when the debate was had, it was agreed that eight hours should be the period for serious offences as outlined in the act. Yet now we concern ourselves with saying, `Hang on. We've reached the eight-hour threshold. Now we want to be concerned about whether it should be 24 hours.' In principle, the debate that really should be had—and it is outlined in the bill—is the debate about whether those people who are held in detention are getting an expeditious investigation into the allegations made against them, to determine whether that is the principle that is being breached. It seems to me that what would offend most Australians is the thought that someone is in detention without there being an exhaustive investigation taking place while that person is in detention. The reality is that the amount of time—be it eight hours, four hours or 24 hours—is probably secondary to the concern about whether the police and other agencies involved are using their time in a judicious way to undertake investigations as are required.</para><para>I also heard the member for Melbourne Ports, and I pick up on this one point, talk about how some Australians unwittingly or perhaps foolishly get involved in terrorist activities and training. My concern with this is that I do not believe it is a valid justification for turning a blind eye. I certainly do not believe that those Australians that are foolish enough to get involved—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WF6</name.id><name role="metadata">Danby, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Danby</name></talker><para>—We are in furious agreement.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AN0</name.id><name role="metadata">Ciobo, Steven, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CIOBO</name></talker><para>—Perhaps I mischaracterised the comments that the member for Melbourne Ports made. If I did, I apologise to the member for Melbourne Ports. But there are certainly other members of the opposition who do make comments that those Australians that unwittingly and foolishly get involved in terrorist organisations perhaps ought not to have the full weight of the law come down on them. When you concern yourself with what these—for lack of a better term—foolish Australians are being involved in, I think most ordinary, decent Australians would want to see the full weight of the law applied. It is simply not good enough that some Australians, perhaps naively and foolishly, become involved in terrorist organisations in faraway lands which put the lives and limbs of Australians at risk because of their activities; that these people, because of their activities, contribute to an overall terrorist framework around the world. I believe those people should be held accountable for their actions. Whether they do so recklessly, naively, foolishly or deliberately, the reality is that it does threaten all Australians, and I believe the full force of the law should be applied.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The Democrats have raised arguments in the past claiming that the bill may unwittingly capture passive individuals who are involved without actual knowledge. The reality is that the operation of the amendments provides that membership of a terrorist organisation and the ensuing offence are brought into line such that all terrorist offence provisions operate to apply in unison. Those provisions pertaining to training do require that individuals concern themselves—appropriately, I believe—with whether they are involved with the training activities of a terrorist organisation and that they are not reckless in this regard.</para><para>In terms of the benefits of the bill for the investigation and prosecution of Commonwealth terrorism offences, we now know that, as I said, the bill before the House today seeks to amend a variety of acts. To this extent it advances the objectives of not only the Proceeds of Crime Act but a variety of acts including the Crimes Act. In dealing with the operation of the amendments, let me say that the Crimes Act is changed by this bill such that this bill seeks to redefine and extend the investigation period set out in the Crimes Act for terrorism offences. Principally, the amendments extend the period of arrest, or the investigation period, for a person arrested for a terrorism offence so as to enable law enforcement agencies to investigate the offence. </para><para>Currently, section 23C of the Crimes Act provides that, if a person is arrested for a Commonwealth offence, the person `may be detained for the purpose of investigating', whether the person committed the offence or another Commonwealth offence; subsection 23C(2) provides that the person may not be detained `after the end of the investigation period'; and subsection 23C(4) provides that the investigation period does not extend beyond four hours unless, after the arrest, `the period is extended under section 23D'. Section 23D, as I outlined before, deals with the extension of the investigation period if a person is under arrest for a serious offence, which is defined to mean `a Commonwealth offence that is punishable by imprisonment for a period exceeding 12 months'. This is the principal point that I was speaking about earlier. The point of time is a fairly arbitrary measure, in my view. People ought to concern themselves with the effectiveness of the investigation whilst the person is in detention rather than the arbitrary line in the sand about whether it is eight hours, 12 hours or 24 hours.</para><para>The Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act currently deals with incursions and hostile invasions into foreign states by Australian citizens or residents. This act, inter alia, creates the offences of entering a foreign state with intent to engage in a hostile activity in that state and engaging in a hostile activity in a foreign state. The objective of the activity must be to overthrow the government of the foreign state or engage in armed hostilities, to cause death, bodily injury or fear thereof to the head of state or a person who holds or performs the duties of public office, or to unlawfully destroy or damage any real or personal property belonging to the government of the foreign state. Under section 6, a person does not commit an offence if he or she was serving in any capacity in or with the armed forces of the government of a foreign state or any other armed force in respect of which a declaration by the minister under subsection 9(2) is in force.</para><para>So we see there the broad framework that applies under the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act. In effect, what does all that mean? It means that we do not allow Australian citizens to be involved in hostile foreign incursions in other countries. But, as part of that, where they are operating as part of an army of another state, then it is permitted.</para><para>That led to some difficulties. It led to difficulties in circumstances in which Australians might go overseas, become involved in the military of another country and engage in hostile activities. What if that foreign country is in fact under the control of a government, a dictatorship or an organisation such as the Taliban—an organisation which is in effect sponsoring terrorist organisations—and the person involved in that state's army, military or whatever form of service it is is in fact prosecuting terrorist offences by being involved in that state's army?</para><para>This bill seeks to ensure that those people can be captured. We saw that in particular in regard to Hicks and Habib. The rationale for the amendment is quite clear. In the matters of Hicks and Habib, where we sought to see whether there was a basis on which they could be prosecuted in Australia for their behaviour abroad, it was found that the enactment did not enable Australia to deal with a range of situations, particularly where terrorist organisations are in fact instruments of a state, such as they were with the Taliban. </para><para>The Attorney-General, who I note is in the chamber today, said that the amendment would not be retrospective, with the effect that the amended law could not be used to bring Hicks and Habib—the two Australians who are currently detained in Guantanamo Bay in Cuba—back to Australia to be prosecuted. But I note that Stephen Hopper, who is Habib's lawyer, is reported as saying that laws which promote peace and good behaviour should not be used selectively. In fact I believe he said that Australians did military training in Israel, the United States and other countries without being subjected to the same treatment as Habib.</para><para>My principal point of differentiation is that Israel and the United States—and I am not sure which other countries he had in mind—are democracies that do not engage in terrorist activities. You will often get the loony Left that would like to portray the state of Israel or the United States as somehow going round the world prosecuting terrorist acts, but that is a political point of view, not an objective one. The reality is that democracies do not undertake the kinds of terrorist acts that we see—acts that specifically focus on individuals, on civilians—and do not prosecute that murder or that threat to life and limb. What is more, where that does occur—and some obviously would highlight what has occurred most recently in Iraq—the principal difference is that it is not glorified. It is not held out as being a wonderful thing. It is not held out as being a type of conduct that ought to be promoted and encouraged; rather it is disdained and the countries concerned will hold those people accountable for their activities. And that will always be the fundamental difference—the mens rea of the offence, so to speak.</para><para>So let there be no mistake by those who prosecute the argument that there are democracies that undertake terrorist activities. There is a very great gulf between democracies undertaking these kinds of activities—and I would highlight the fact that, in my view, these activities are not under the auspices of the government but rather perhaps in the hands of a few rogue people. Where those activities are uncovered they are exposed to the light, they are exposed to scrutiny and the people concerned are prosecuted as they appropriately should be, which is a far cry from the acts of, for example, the Taliban or other groups such as Hamas or Hezbollah, which are actively encouraged and sanctioned by the governments or dictators of those countries.</para><para>With respect to the Criminal Code, the bill seeks to amend the Criminal Code Act by revising the offences of being a member of a terrorist organisation and of training a terrorist organisation. Initially, the bill seeks to extend the operation of the membership offence in section 102.3 to include membership of an organisation which falls within paragraph (a) of the definition of `terrorist organisation' in subsection 102.1(1). At present, a person commits an offence under this section if the person intentionally is a member of an organisation, the organisation is a specified terrorist organisation and the person knows the organisation is a terrorist organisation. This offence currently carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. According to section 5.3 of the Criminal Code:</para><quote><para>A person has knowledge of a circumstance or a result if he or she is aware that it exists or will exist in the ordinary course of events.</para></quote><para>The term `member' of an organisation is defined in subsection 102.1(1) of the Criminal Code to include `a person who is an informal member of the organisation', `a person who has taken steps to become a member of the organisation', and `in the case of an organisation that is a body corporate—a director or an officer of the body corporate'. </para><para>There is a second way that the bill amends the offences in section 102.5. Currently the act provides for two offences: firstly, if a person intentionally provides training to or receives training from an organisation and that organisation is a terrorist organisation, where there is a penalty of up to 25 years imprisonment; and, secondly, if a person provides training to or receives training from an organisation and the organisation is a terrorist organisation and the person is reckless. The first limb is that the person knows that the organisation is a terrorist organisation and the second limb is that the person is reckless as to whether the organisation is a terrorist organisation. A penalty of 15 years imprisonment applies to that.</para><para>The bill now distinguishes between non-proscribed organisations—or those which a court may find fall within paragraph (a) of the definition of terrorist organisation; that is, knowingly—and those organisations specified as terrorist organisations. That is a fundamental difference that ensures that there is some concern as to whether the person is knowingly involved in the training or whether the person is reckless with respect to that. </para><para>The proceeds of crime amendment is an important aspect that deals very deliberately, and I think appropriately, with examples such as Hicks and Habib. The reality is that Australians would find it offensive if those people engaged in terrorist activities then subsequently sought to make profit, for example off the back of book sales, television interviews or other types of events like that—to sell their story, as it were, because they believed they could make some money from selling that story. In my view it is appropriate that we as a government should jump all over that and ensure that these people do not benefit from engaging in hostile terrorist activities and selling their story and that these people are not placed in a financially better situation because they have a story to sell and because there is perhaps interest in consuming the kind of tale that they have to tell about their time and their involvement in a terrorist organisation. It is very appropriate that we as a government act to ensure that these people are not materially rewarded in any sense by their activities. Rather, in my view they should spend their time sitting in jail thinking about what they have done.</para><para>The Anti-terrorism Bill 2004 is an important bill that continues to build on the strong measures that the Howard government has taken to ensure that Australians can feel as safe as possible in this world. The reality is that this bill continues the bringing together of the fabric of laws that exist to protect Australians and to ensure that we will not tolerate those Australians or other nationals who may be involved in terrorist activities. I am glad it has the support of the opposition. I am hopeful that it has the support of all parties in the Senate. In my view, the bill is thoroughly worthy of commendation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>28601</page.no><name role="metadata">Kerr, Duncan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KERR</name><name.id>RH4</name.id><electorate>Denison</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Speakers hitherto in this parliament have addressed the specifics of the <inline ref="R2032">Anti-terrorism Bill 2004</inline>, and I will not recanvass much of that debate. Rather, I want to reflect on some underlying principles which, whilst material to the current legislation, are also material to the broader issue about how we should deal not only with this specific piece of legislation but with other legislation that this parliament may later face and indeed about how we as a society ought to deal with the very real threat that we are subject to—that is, the possibility of attacks on our community by those who wish to damage us through terrorism. In this regard, no-one would come to this parliament with any object other than the proper protection of the liberties, safety and wellbeing of their fellow citizens. The question is: how do we best address these issues, and what is the framework for policy setting in this area? </para></talk.start><para>I will address three specifics from the bill and then make some broader philosophical observations. The first issue I will address goes to periods for which persons can be held and interrogated in relation to alleged offences in relation to which they will later face trial. In this regard we have been advised that, following the Bali bombings, the Federal Police Commissioner alerted the Attorney-General and the community to his concerns that there may be an inadequate period of time to allow those processes to be followed. That was then followed up by a meeting in Melbourne of police commissioners of all the jurisdictions.</para><para>I have enormous respect for the Australian Federal Police Commissioner and for all commissioners, but we should be wary of taking it as a necessary conclusion that what is asserted is in fact substantially correct. The instance I will give of this is my own very direct experience of the introduction of the measures which now exist in the legislation which provide finite limits for the questioning of persons after arrest. Prior to their introduction in 1991, the High Court made certain rulings which made it doubtful that we could sustain a regime which effectively allowed an unregulated period of time during which persons could be held after arrest but before being brought before a magistrate.</para><para>At the urging of many of my colleagues and me, the then Labor Attorney-General brought forward legislation, which was passed into law in 1991, which provided a fixed period of four hours when questioning could be undertaken and the possibility of one further extension on judicial order for a further period of four hours. There were of course periods built in—what is called dead time—to exclude from those four-hour periods necessary delays occasioned by finding translators and by giving rest to persons who were the subject of interrogation and the like. But the basic framework was that you could conduct a record of interview for an initial period of four hours and then for no longer than a period of a further four hours. That questioning also had to be videorecorded or tape-recorded.</para><para>Prior to this parliament's enactment of those measures, there were expressions of substantial concern from law enforcement agencies right across the country that the introduction of these measures would in some very substantial way prevent the effectiveness of law enforcement proceedings in relation to those against whom charges were later to be brought. Notwithstanding that, this parliament passed that legislation and the end result was extraordinarily beneficial, counter to those who had raised concerns that law enforcement would be disadvantaged by these measures. All the issues that had hitherto troubled the effective prosecution of cases in which there were disputed records of interview were swept aside. No more were there allegations that persons had been verballed. No more were there contested issues relating to the admissibility of records of interview. Trials were shortened. Pleas of guilty were facilitated. One of the blights on the criminal justice system—the substantial and, regrettably, sometimes verified sets of allegations that police had made up alleged confessions or had concocted records of interview—was swept aside.</para><para>It was a wholly beneficial initiative. There has not been one instance where any law enforcement authority which has introduced and maintained that regime has pointed to a circumstance where the period of eight hours to conduct records of interview has been proved to be inadequate. Of course, Commonwealth laws do provide for matters of enormous complexity involving interjurisdictional issues. It is important to make a distinction between the kinds of issues that we are dealing with here—that is, the time in which law enforcement can conduct records of interview and conduct further matters in relation to an investigation after arrest in a process which leads, in the generality of matters, to a person being brought before a magistrate and charged with an offence—and those which we have dealt with previously in this parliament under the ASIO legislation which go to seeking information to prevent the commission of an offence. </para><para>My concern is that, notwithstanding I think the undoubted good motive of the Attorney-General and of police commissioners in bringing these matters forward, this may in a sense counterintuitively create greater difficulties for law enforcement agencies than they currently would suffer. Why is that? For the first time defence counsel will be able to point to the fact that persons held under this new regime will be held for extended periods of time in circumstances where their presence is not always being videotaped, because there will be substantial delays built into the system, and allegations of a kind that used to be routinely made in criminal trials about abuses outside of the formal interrogation procedures will be renewed. It presents grave difficulties in that regard. I only flag that issue, but I think it warrants careful consideration.</para><para>One of the points that the shadow Attorney-General has raised is the necessity for us to review the effectiveness of these measures in a three-year time frame. I think that is wise counsel, and I commend it to the Attorney-General as an undertaking that he might wish to make. From the framework where I was once responsible for law enforcement in this country, I recognise that enormous reform was effected by removing the possibility of allegations of impropriety in these processes and that possibility should not be allowed to be reintroduced. I certainly think, without any intendment, this could happen through mechanisms that are designed to allow for an extended period of holding a person who is the subject of the making of records of interview in circumstances where alleged confessions will be attacked on the basis that they were made in circumstances where the will of the person was overborne, where they may have been subject to pressure outside of the times in which their actual interrogation was being conducted and recorded and where they may be argued to have been placed in a circumstance where they felt that they could not effectively exercise the rights that they will be told they have when they are first made subject to these interrogation procedures such as the right to silence.</para><para>So that is the first point that I make. I make it in general terms, but I do think it is an important one that we should bear in mind. It does not mean that we should resist these initiatives, but it does mean that we should treat them very carefully. We should recognise that they should not be regarded as any precedent for changes to the generality of circumstances that apply after arrest. They should not be seen as the thin edge of the wedge. We should be very cautious that they in fact do not reopen the very circumstances which necessitated this parliament legislating to provide finite and close limits to the conduct of interviews after arrest.</para><para>The second point I raise goes to the circumstances of persons who serve in foreign military forces. If I had my preference in this regard, I would counsel that this parliament should do everything possible to make it unlawful for Australian citizens or Australian residents to play any part in armed services or forces other than their own. But that is not what our law provides. For historical reasons, that is understandable. Historical reasons go back to the Spanish Civil War, where many Australians of persuasions similar to my own went to defend the then republican government against the Franco regime. It goes to circumstances which recognise that Greek Australians, for example, who travel back to Greece become the subject of conscription. It recognises the fact that Australian Jews frequently travel to Israel and undertake service in the Israeli government. It recognises the fact that, from time to time, outside of those circumstances of compulsion and conscription, Australians will serve in the military of other countries. </para><para>Given that we have a law which facilitates that, I think we have to be very careful about passing legislation which may in practical terms create retrospective criminal laws which apply to those people. Take, for example, a person who has joined up to a military force legally under Australian law and then, during that course of service, the government of the day decides that that military force has been guilty of substantial crimes against humanity. That may occur, for example, because that force gets involved in a dirty war against terrorism. The Israeli military is sometimes accused of those matters. Accusations about the way in which the US military has conducted itself in Iraq are currently the subject of grave scandal.</para><para>Let us assume that an Australian citizen goes and serves by way of either conscription or volunteer service in the military force of some other country—neither of those countries I just mentioned are good examples; it may be some other country—and the Attorney-General of the day proscribes that military either because of its association with a terrorist organisation or because of its conduct in a dirty war. How is that person then going to respond? If they are in active service and they leave their post then, under the military regimes applying to most armed forces, that is characterised as desertion. Desertion, certainly in active service, is frequently punishable by death. I would assume that that would be more likely in a case where armed forces are of the kind that we see as so atrocious in their conduct that we would proscribe membership of them through this parliament. So we do have to build in the circumstance—and the shadow Attorney has addressed this—where a person's current service in those forces cannot be abandoned because of the reality that they would be the subject of duress or punishment, immediate and direct, should they seek to remove themselves from that active service.</para><para>The second circumstance that we have to address is that the proscription may not in fact be known to that person at all. Let us assume that somebody has gone back to Croatia at the time when the Croatian military forces were engaged in ethnic cleansing and the Attorney proscribed service in that organisation. Some Australians did that and they may not be aware of the proscription at all. They are engaged in a military conflict far away from this country. They may never come to the knowledge that they are in fact in a service that the Australian government has proscribed. I think we have to make realistic provision for these things. Given that, rightly or wrongly, we allow Australians to serve in the military forces of other countries, we have to be realistic about the real circumstances that they face.</para><para>There is one safeguard, I suppose, that is built into this—that is, any prosecution requires the fiat or permission of the Attorney-General. That only emphasises the intensely political nature of what we are doing under this legislation and the capacity for discrimination not on grounds of the substance of the offence but because of the political attitude of the government of the day towards participation in such circumstances. I think that, when we are passing substantive laws of this kind, we have to bear in mind the real circumstances that Australians, who we permit to serve in foreign armed services, may face. I do not like those circumstances and I wish it was not happening. I wish we could prohibit the service of Australians in any military forces other than our own. But our law does not do that and these amendments may catch people in circumstances where anyone looking at those circumstances may say that it was most unfair and it could not possibly have been intended. So there are some changes that are necessary there. </para><para>The third point I raise is the issue of strict liability. This legislation passes perilously close to imposing what would essentially be crimes of association. Normally in our society we resist guilt by association. This legislation teeters somewhere between an offence of strict liability and liability of the kind that the Model Criminal Code generally requires for the imposition of criminal liability. I am not certain how these provisions will be interpreted and I doubt that the Attorney is certain how they would be interpreted. They are novel. But they are somewhere between strict liability and ordinary offences which require recklessness. I am not certain how they will be interpreted, but they do require us to exercise some caution and review because we as a society certainly do not want to find ourselves in circumstances where people, through acts which most would regard as stupid or callow but not criminal in their intent, are captured under a criminal justice system which can impose penalties of very substantial periods of imprisonment. That is not to ignore the seriousness of the issues involved; it is simply to recognise that we need to have another look at this and its operation if these matters do later come to be tested.</para><para>The last matter I wish to raise is a general reflection about how we should address these matters. I suppose it is the balancing theory. I have long accepted, broadly, the propositions that are being advanced on both sides and the reasons for bipartisan support for this legislation, which is that we should seek to balance in some way our response to threats by necessary changes to our law enforcement regimes. I have advocated this frequently in speeches, but I have had to reflect on this. If we are facing very serious threats, the real question which then arises is: to what degree do you give up your liberties and basic fundamental freedoms to respond to those? Benjamin Franklin, one of the founders of the United States, posed a rhetorical question and then answered it in a phrase later inscribed on a plaque in the stairwell of the Statue of Liberty. He said:</para><quote><para>Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.</para></quote><para>In practice, however, a balancing theory of rights has become much more influential. That balancing theory works well when Australia faces modest threats because all that is ever demanded on the other side is modest concessions. But when we face very grave threats, does that really justify very grave retreats from our rights? If we, as parliamentarians upholding the rule of law, do not think so then we have to work out a justification for civil rights that goes beyond balance. That is a critical task because, applied in the circumstances of grave threats such as terrorism, the balancing theory of rights can lead to Alan Dershowitz's logical conclusion that arbitrary detention or even torture can be justified.</para><para>It is important to bear in mind that the war on terror is not something that will have a discernable end. If it is a war in the same sense as we have a war on drugs then the war on terror, like the war on drugs, may—and, sadly, probably will—be with us for decades. I do not think our basic rights and freedoms should be sacrificed and corroded for decades. That is the threshold question. It is a philosophical question and it challenges me as a parliamentarian. It requires us all to reflect on how we make these judgments. In relation to this specific legislation, the shadow Attorney-General has put forward very sensible proposals which reflect those made in the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. I trust the Attorney-General will look favourably at least on the majority of those and, I hope, all of them. To conclude, whilst I join in the general consensus in relation to these issues I do flag my concern about these broader issues and put on record my concern about the theory that should underlie our future practice. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>28606</page.no><name role="metadata">Hunt, Gregory, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HUNT</name><name.id>00AMV</name.id><electorate>Flinders</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In rising to address the <inline ref="R2032">Anti-terrorism Bill 2004</inline>, I come to the House as a member of the Amnesty International Parliamentary Group, as do the Attorney-General and my colleague the member for Denison. I take up immediately from where the member for Denison left off. There are challenges before this House: firstly, in securing Australia and Australians, both at home and abroad; and, secondly, in balancing those challenges with the fundamental rights which are the essence of all that we believe in in creating, establishing and continuing a functioning democracy. That balance between security and rights is fundamental. In addressing that balance I believe there are three things we have to look at: firstly, there is the question of threats; secondly, there is the question of our responsibilities as a society in terms of both liberty and protection; and, thirdly, we have to address any breaches of those responsibilities. </para></talk.start><para>The context we face today is a type of threat which as a society we have not known before. September 11 and the events in Bali and Madrid all represent fundamental attacks upon the security of people within Western societies, in their homes and during their day-to-day lives. They represent the fact that there is a civil war within Islamic society which leaches into the confrontation with certain elements of Western society. There is a fundamental fight between moderate elements and those who seek to create a Taliban style globe—that is al-Qaeda's long-term objective. Its vision of a 100 years is of a Taliban style globe, and its strategic objective is to convert Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Indonesia—the four pillars of Islamic society—from the states that they are now to Taliban style extremist states. What we have there is a civil war between a fringe extremist group and mainstream Islamic society.</para><para>That carries over into the confrontation which has been brought against different elements of Western society. The means which are to be used are very simple: the spread of mass terror so as to break down the connection between the West and those countries and lead those four countries to a situation where there would be internal unrest, possibly fragmentation and the capacity to fill a vacuum through this form of Taliban style extremism as propounded, promoted and executed by al-Qaeda. That is the threat that we face, and it is a real threat, because it is absolutely clear that their objective is always to inflict as much human suffering as possible. If they are able to gain control of some form of chemical or biological weapon or other weapon of mass destruction, they will do so and use it without compunction. That is the nature of the threat. It is a different type of threat because it is not a classic state against state threat; it is an insidious one. There are many cases which have already been stopped, as we saw recently with the allegations of major plans for actions against sporting bodies and gatherings in the UK, plans which have been made against Australia's own embassies overseas and other plans for elsewhere in the Western world. This is a real and ongoing threat. </para><para>There is also Iraq, a country which had carried out a reign of unprecedented terror against its own citizens: summary executions, organised rape, mass torture, eradication of entire sections of the population—the Marsh Arabs, the Shiites and the Kurds were all subject to wilful, continuing murder on a mass scale. It was twinned with a regime which had the most evil intent in terms of chemical, biological and ultimately nuclear capacity and which had known links with organisations such as the Palestinian Liberation Front, the Abu Nidal organisation, the Mujaheddin-e Khalq and others. Against that backdrop we have responsibilities as well. We have responsibilities in Australia to our own citizens to protect people here. We also have responsibilities to ensure that we protect our own fundamental democratic rights—we protect the very nature of what we are. That is the balance which has to be struck. </para><para>Looking at this, we are a party to the Geneva conventions and so we have domestic and international responsibilities. In condemning the actions of the Hussein regime and al-Qaeda, I would not be fulfilling my responsibilities to this House, my own commitment as a human rights lawyer and my very fundamental beliefs if I did not acknowledge that there have been breaches of our fundamental responsibilities in Iraq carried out by forces from the United States. Those breaches are utterly unacceptable, utterly unjustifiable and must be met with the full range of punishments available under the law. I make that statement to the House, knowing that it would be a violation of my own personal responsibilities not to acknowledge them, condemn them or demand that they be addressed.</para><para>We do not know the extent of things at this stage, but we are absolutely certain of the fact that certain US forces have breached their responsibility to act with humanity and compassion towards those prisoners in their care. It is utterly unacceptable, utterly to be condemned and certainly to be punished. Those are my clear and absolute convictions. Against that background, however, I should also note that nothing compares with the horror, nothing compares with the brutality, of the Hussein regime. But nothing justifies the breaches carried out in the name of forces which are there to create a new democracy. You cannot create a new democracy by adopting methods of brutality which are at odds with our responsibilities under the Geneva convention.</para><para>In turning from the broader global context to this bill, I want to address three things: firstly, that context; secondly, the intention of the bill; and, thirdly, the importance of the bill. In looking at the context, what that means for Australia today is that these threats require ongoing vigilance. They require us to take steps to investigate that which is a threat to Australia. As I have mentioned, it is a different type of threat to anything we have received before. That leads me to what has been done so far. So far the Australian government has taken a series of actions. It has overhauled Australia's legislative framework to complement existing laws already targeting terrorism. Counter-terrorism forces have been bolstered—most recently in the budget two days ago—and the criminal justice system has also been strengthened. The federal Criminal Code has been updated to ensure that the offence regime responds to terrorism and the Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Act 2002 introduced a suite of offences into the Criminal Code.</para><para>This bill has four particular actions of importance. Firstly, it improves the capability of Australia's law enforcement agencies to properly investigate terrorism offences. It does this by allowing agencies to use some of the `dead time' not currently used so that it does not exhaust the finite investigation period. There is a current initial period of four hours with an eight-hour extension, which is not sufficient for complex investigations with an international aspect. The bill will ensure that the extension period is increased to 20 hours, subject to authorisation from a judicial officer and subject to ensuring that there is full and adequate protection of the individual in question. The investigatory safeguards put in place to maintain the balance of security and individual rights and freedoms are critical, and I would not support these actions without them. I note that there are recommendations within the Senate which are being considered by the Attorney, and I urge the Attorney to look at those recommendations. Whilst I may not agree with all of them, there are certainly some which are worthy of consideration and adoption. </para><para>Secondly, the bill attempts to close loopholes in the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act. This is a valuable tool in protecting Australia's national security and interests. It makes sure that individuals cannot just be excused for activities on the basis that they are part of the armed forces of a foreign state. In addition, a person belonging to a terrorist organisation, which has effectively been grandfathered in, as part of the armed forces of a foreign government will now be treated as having committed an offence. That is important. So any person associated with hostile activity will be liable for prosecution under the act. It is a recognition that states can create paramilitaries which will be used for essentially terrorist purposes, as was absolutely clear in the case of Afghanistan, and that that can in no way be a cover for the actions of terrorism.</para><para>Thirdly, the bill attempts to dissuade persons from becoming members of terrorist organisations. It places an onus on individuals to ensure they are not participating in terrorist activities. There has been a question as to whether this might in some way represent strict liability. It is absolutely clear, it is commonsense and it is in no way a breach of fundamental liberties if people are placed on notice to make sure that they are not in carriage of actions of terror. That is not an onerous responsibility; it is a simple, practical, legitimate and realistic extension of the most basic principles of personal responsibility. Fourthly, this bill ensures that people are unable to derive gains from criminal activities associated with terror and to exploit their notoriety for commercial purposes.</para><para>So for all of those reasons I endorse the bill and I commend the bill. But I will return to where I began. I take up and agree with some of the principles put forward by the member for Denison when he quoted Benjamin Franklin. These are difficult challenges for Western society—for democracies, for people who found the very nature of their society on the fundamental principles of individual liberty. And so I make two points. Firstly, we cannot trade away our fundamental freedoms to ensure peace and to ensure security. It is a great and ongoing challenge of vigilance that we push to maintain our basic freedoms whilst ensuring there are adequate security mechanisms in place. Secondly, we can never, ever justify the sorts of breaches which represent the exception in the case of coalition forces in Iraq.</para><para>It is clear that Australian forces have been in no way involved. But it is also clear, as I mentioned earlier, that there have been breaches and that those breaches must be punished. The difference between what we are as a society and what regimes such as those in Iraq and Afghanistan are is that in our society people who carry out those breaches will be sought and punished, whereas under those regimes they were rewarded. Those societies were based on terror and based on abuse. We can never accept that; we can never accept the leaching of those basic rights, and we must follow through and prosecute them to the full extent of the law. </para><para>This bill is about dealing with the threat of terror that faces Australia and it is about doing so in, I believe, a measured, careful, considered manner which has critical safeguards built into it. For those reasons I commend the bill to the House. Above all else, I commend the combination of our beliefs in liberty and our vigilance to ensure that we maintain and uphold the rule of law in our society.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>28609</page.no><name role="metadata">Organ, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ORGAN</name><name.id>BNL</name.id><electorate>Cunningham</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Attorney-General has told us that the purpose of the <inline ref="R2032">Anti-terrorism Bill 2004</inline> is to strengthen Australia's counter-terrorism laws in a number of respects, a task which he told us was made more urgent following the tragic terrorist bombings in Spain. Quite why a Basque separatist organisation bombing in Spain specifically makes strengthening our counter-terrorism laws more urgent is a mystery. ETA, which finances its activities primarily through extortion and robbery, has been primarily involved in bombings and assassinations of Spanish government officials, security and military forces, politicians and judicial figures. The group has killed more than 850 persons and injured hundreds of others since it began lethal attacks in the early 1960s, but to the best of my knowledge none of them in Australia.</para></talk.start><para>The Anti-terrorism Bill 2004 seeks to redefine and extend the investigation period set out in the Crimes Act. It proposes changes to foreign incursion offences in situations where terrorist organisations are operating as part of the armed forces of a state. It would amend the Criminal Code Act relating to members of terrorist organisations and make it an offence to provide training to or receive training from a terrorist organisation, and it seeks to amend the Proceeds of Crime Act to tighten restrictions on any commercial exploitation by a person who has committed foreign indictable offences.</para><para>As I have said before in this House, balancing anti-terrorism and civil liberties is a complex and difficult task. I have also expressed my concern that the government is tipping the scales too far, and the bill now before us is an extension of that tipping. The <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> made the point well in an editorial on 13 April this year. The editorial said:</para><quote><para>In a plural liberal democracy, the yearnings of the police and intelligence services have traditionally been countered by a legislature making laws that create and protect citizens' rights. The present climate makes it harder for liberal voices to be raised in the discourse about setting the right balance, but they must be.</para></quote><para>It is all very well for the Attorney-General to tell us, as he did in his second reading speech:</para><quote><para>Our counter-terrorism laws require review and, where necessary, updating if we are to have a legal framework capable of safeguarding all Australians from the scourge of terrorism.</para></quote><para>But how much further does the Attorney-General intend to erode our civil rights? It has already been suggested that the government is gearing itself up for a `terror' election campaign, and that is a very dangerous game. As the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> put it in its editorial:</para><quote><para>No one doubts that there exists a deeply troubling threat to orderly society by some fanatical individuals and organisations. But who within the two major Australian political parties is raising his or her voice about the importance of balancing the perceived need for more draconian measures with the equally important preservation of civil liberties? </para></quote><para>The answer is: very few, if any. That is perhaps not surprising given the climate of fear that the government is cultivating by the use of emotive phrases like `the scourge of terrorism' and logical gymnastics like tying the need for the Anti-terrorism Bill to a bombing in Spain, tragic though the consequences of that reprehensible act were.</para><para>When we debate legislation like this we should bear in mind that it is 24 years since Australia ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, yet we remain the only democratic country—that is right, the only democratic country—in the world not to have passed laws that give effect to those obligations. Instead, the Howard coalition government, our government, has introduced no fewer than 17 pieces of legislation in the last three years which in some way restrict civil freedoms in the name of enhancing the power to combat terrorism.</para><para>Members will be aware, I am sure, that the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee has been considering the Anti-terrorism Bill and presented its report just yesterday. While there are a couple of changes proposed by the committee, it has basically accepted the thrust of the bill. How prescient that <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> editorial of 13 April now seems, where it said:</para><quote><para>When a federal Labor Opposition indicates it is prepared to agree to future government legislation even before its detailed content is known, alarm bells should ring.</para></quote><para>Well, they did ring and they are still ringing.</para><para>The Anti-terrorism Bill is another egregious assault on civil liberties by the Howard government. As I said earlier, the bill would amend the Crimes Act to extend the fixed period for investigations into suspected terrorism offences to a maximum of 24 hours. The Attorney-General maintains that this is necessary because the current four-hour initial period, which can be extended by eight hours for serious crimes if authorised by a magistrate or other judicial officer, is:</para><quote><para>... an inadequate length of time in which to question suspects in the context of complex terrorism investigations that may have international aspects.</para></quote><para>I feel that is not much in the way of justification. Certainly the Castan Centre for Human Rights Law at Monash University do not think it has much substance. This is what they told the Senate committee's inquiry that I mentioned earlier:</para><quote><para>However, no evidence is offered to support this claim that the investigation of terrorist offences is sufficiently complex as to warrant a doubling of the total permitted time of detention from 12 to 24 hours. Indeed, given the breadth of the definition of `terrorism offences', it is difficult to see how such evidence could be produced. The potential subject matters of investigation are simply too varied.</para><para>For example, it was explained above that it might be possible to commit a terrorism offence by possessing the minutes of a union meeting. The investigation of this sort of offence does not seem overly complex. Why is a special exception, permitting a doubling of the time of detention of an arrested person, required? Even for those cases in which the offence for which a person has been arrested is closer in nature to such stereotypical terrorist conduct as planning a bombing or a hijacking, there is no reason to think that, in general, the investigation of such offences would be any more complex than the investigation of narcotics importation, white collar fraud or other organised crime.</para><para>It is a fundamental principle of the rule of law that no one should be deprived of his or her liberty arbitrarily. This is a principle to which Australia is committed under article 9 of the <inline font-style="italic">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</inline>. It would seem highly arbitrary for an arrested individual's liability to detention to turn simply on the chapter of the statute book in which the alleged offence is to be found. But no reason has been given to suggest that terrorism offences would have anything else in common, and distinct from other offences, in virtue of which an extended period of detention would be warranted. </para></quote><para>The Civil Rights Network had similar concerns:</para><quote><para>We are concerned that this proposal does not seem to have arisen from any real, practical difficulty which has been experienced. Further, there has been a complete absence of debate as to the reasons for and necessity of this amendment. When changes to Australia's legal system which have the potential to severely impact on individual's liberty and rights are proposed it is fundamentally important that the community is properly consulted and informed before our elected representatives act.</para></quote><para>Australian Lawyers for Human Rights sounded an even more dire warning:</para><quote><para>... potentially, the total time a terrorism suspect could be detained could be as much as 40 hours. Legislators should be aware of that available interpretation of the legislation and not be misled by assertions that the total period of detention (as opposed to investigation) is 24 hours prior to charge or release.</para></quote><para>Then there is the provision to permit law enforcement agencies to reasonably suspend or delay questioning a suspect while they make inquiries overseas as part of an investigation. The Attorney-General has told us that the present questioning regime `does not permit investigators to make overseas inquiries without running down the investigation ``time clock'' or, worse still, releasing the suspect'. The Attorney said that international time zones are `a likely cause of delay in responding to requests for information and assistance from Australian authorities'. Therefore, the Attorney-General said:</para><quote><para>... the bill prescribes this time as `dead time' so that it does not exhaust the finite investigation period.</para></quote><para>Do not forget that the Attorney-General had already proposed extending the investigation period to 24 hours.</para><para>Professor George Williams from the Gilbert and Tobin Centre of Public Law at the University of New South Wales is not impressed by the `dead time' idea. He said it should be amended to impose an absolute limit on detention, pointing out:</para><quote><para>Otherwise, the detention could be extended for undue periods. For example, while the time that can be disregarded while waiting for a reply from international agencies must not `exceed the amount of the time zone difference', this alone could add up to an extra 23 hours to the detention period. This and the other potentially lengthy periods of disregarded time mean that there should be a cap on the absolute amount of time a suspect can be kept in custody without charge.</para></quote><para>The Public Interest Advocacy Centre has expressed similar concerns. It told the Senate inquiry:</para><quote><para>While this `dead time' is limited to not extending beyond the time zone difference between Australia and the relevant time zone, this period could add an extra 23 hours to the detention period. Together with other areas of `dead time', this could mean potentially very long periods of detention in order to conduct up to 24 hours of investigation time. With this potential, if nothing else there should be an absolute limit on the time that a suspect can be detained in custody without charge. Anything less could be a breach of the human right of an arrested person to be “promptly informed of any charges” against them. Finally, if this new category of `dead time' were to be adopted, it would be a departure from the nature of the other areas of `dead time', which generally, as outlined above, apply to conduct for the benefit of the detainee. Such a departure from the fundamental principle that any deprivation of liberty should be restricted to absolute necessity would require serious consideration. The current Bill appears to have failed to give adequate attention to this principle, as it is arguable that most international inquiries could be made either prior to or without the suspect's detention.</para></quote><para>The Castan Centre for Human Rights Law goes further:</para><quote><para>This amendment to the `dead time' provisions for terrorism suspects would constitute an undesirable departure from the principles on which the current dead time provisions are based. Currently, the periods of time not counted against the investigation period are either: one-off events that are not part of the investigation itself but are necessary preconditions of it, such as conveying the suspect to premises suitable for the carrying out of the investigation, or applying for an extension of the investigation period; time spent on matters that are for the benefit of the suspect, such as rest, medical treatment or the contacting of a lawyer; or time spent on investigative procedures that demand the presence of the suspect, such as identification parades. The amendment would introduce periods of `dead time' that result directly from investigative activities, but which are not activities requiring the presence of the subject. At present these matters are presumably investigated prior to the arrest of the suspect, or subsequent to their release or remand. No reason has been given as to why this needs to change. </para></quote><para>The New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties is similarly unimpressed. It told the Senate inquiry:</para><quote><para>The Council is in general concerned about any extension of the power to detain people as proposed by this bill.</para></quote><para>So am I.</para><para>The proposed amendments to the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act are also problematic. The Attorney-General asserted:</para><quote><para>The recent armed conflict in Afghanistan demonstrates that in today's security environment terrorist organisations may be acting in collaboration with the armed forces of a foreign state.</para></quote><para>You will note, Mr Deputy Speaker, the clever `step and swerve' around the fact that the Taliban were the government of Afghanistan. One might be forgiven for thinking that the Attorney-General had David Hicks and Mamdouh Habib in mind when he wrote that. Maybe that is what the Civil Rights Network had in mind in framing their comments on this part of the bill. They said:</para><quote><para>The proposal to grant the power to prescribe terrorist organisations under the Foreign Incursions Act and to make it an offence to fight with the armed forces of the State if also involved in a prescribed organisation is problematic on a number of levels:</para><para>(i) the Attorney General already has the power to list organisations as terrorist organisations without those organisations being listed by the United Nations. Under this Bill the Attorney General would also have the power to prescribed organisations under the Foreign Incursions Act. Neither the Explanatory Memorandum nor the Bill identifies what criteria will be used before an organisation is prescribed. Given the clear intention expressed in the explanatory memorandum to be able to prescribe organisations swiftly it is imperative that clear criteria be given in order to justify such listing. Whilst regulations may be disallowable, any actions taken under that instrument before it is disallowed could have significant impacts upon the life and liberty of Australian citizens overseas.</para><para>(ii) Given the rapidly changing nature of international geopolitics it would seem likely that an organisation which may be listed as a terrorist organisation in some circumstances would not be considered to be such an organisation in others. We recommend that the committee considers whether it is appropriate (if it accepts that the Attorney General should have the power to prescribed terrorist organisations under this Bill) to insert what in effect would be a sunset clause for the listing of organisations. It may well be that there should be a provision that requires the reconsideration of the status of any organisation listed under this Act.</para><para>(iii) It should be made clear that if a person enters into a foreign state with the intent to engage in hostile activity while in an organisation and that organisation is acting at the behest of that foreign state, and at that time that organisation is not a prescribed organisation, any prospective listing of that organisation will not extend liability to that person. It would be against the rule of law to retrospectively impose criminality upon an individual.</para></quote><para>In other words, they are saying that this amendment should be rejected—and so it should. </para><para>The Civil Rights Network is just one of the organisations concerned about the proposal in the bill to broaden the scope of terrorist offences by including training. They say the reason for adopting strict liability is not adequately explained in the explanatory memorandum to this bill, nor in the Attorney-General's second reading speech. The Castan Centre for Human Rights Law are particularly critical of this aspect of the legislation. They say:</para><quote><para>The proposed new offence should also be opposed. The Explanatory Memorandum describes it as a strict liability offence, and while technically true this is, once again, not as informative as it might be. The proposed new offence is best conceived of as a reverse-onus recklessness offence. It differs from the existing recklessness offence in three respects. First, it applies only to an individual who trains with an organisation proscribed under paragraph (b), (c), (d) or (e) of the definition of terrorist organisation in sub section 102.1(1). Second, it carries a more severe penalty (25 years imprisonment rather than 15 years). Third, the effect of proposed subsections 102.5 (3) and (4) is to make the offence, for practical purposes, a reverse-onus recklessness offence according to which the onus is on the accused to establish a reasonable possibility that they were not reckless, before the prosecution then incurs an obligation to prove their recklessness beyond reasonable doubt.</para></quote><para>They continue:</para><quote><para>This proposed new offence should be opposed on two grounds. First, no reason has been given as to why the onus of proof with respect to the recklessness of the accused should be reversed in this matter. In his Second Reading speech, the Attorney-General says that </para><para>The effect of this amendment is to place an onus on persons to ensure that they are not involved in training activities with a terrorist organisation.</para><para>This amendment will send a clear message to those who would engage in the training activities of terrorist organisations, which could result in an attack of the kind seen in New York or in Bali, that they can expect to be dealt with harshly (Commonwealth, <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Debates</inline>, House of Representatives, 31 March 2004, p 26475).</para><para>The first of the quoted paragraphs is extremely misleading, exploiting as it does an ambiguity between the law's `placing an onus' on someone not to perform a certain act, by criminalising such conduct, and the technical sense in which a criminal law may place an onus of proof on either the prosecution or the defence. The law already places a clear onus on persons to ensure that they are not involved in training activities with terrorist organisations, by prohibiting such conduct under section 102.5. And the law already has the capacity to deal harshly with such offenders. As indicated above, the maximum penalty for knowingly training with a terrorist organisation is 25 years (the same penalty as section 268.59 of the <inline font-style="italic">Criminal Code</inline> imposes for the war crime of rape), and the maximum penalty for recklessly training with a terrorist organisation is 15 years.</para></quote><para>Finally there are the provisions to broaden the scope of the Proceeds of Crime Act or, as I like to think of it, the `make sure David Hicks and Mamdouh Habib never have the chance to tell their story publicly to a wider audience act'.</para><para>The Public Interest Advocacy Centre dismisses this idea out of hand, saying:</para><quote><para>The general rule is that laws should not be given retrospective operation. Arguments for a serious deviation from such a fundamental principle should be carefully considered, particularly in an area such as this that relates to freedom of speech.</para></quote><para>But there is more:</para><quote><para>If passed this definition would give recognition in Australian law to offences that are the creation of the executive arm of the United States Government. This would essentially breach a basic cornerstone of democracy and the Australian political and legal system, the separation of powers.</para></quote><para>I think I have made the point. This bill is poorly drafted. It is bad law. It is a further erosion of civil rights, and the real experts are telling us to reject it. That is what I recommend. And, if, as the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> asked, there are people in this place raising their voices about the importance of `balancing the perceived need for more draconian measures with the equally important preservation of civil liberties', this House will reject the Anti-terrorism Bill. I certainly reject it, but I suppose it is a big ask for others to join me. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>28614</page.no><name role="metadata">Hatton, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HATTON</name><name.id>LN6</name.id><electorate>Blaxland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am happy to disagree with the member for Cunningham. It is not the first time I have done so and I expect it will not be the last. He argued reasonably—given that it is a basic and accepted proposition in terms of people's rights—that no-one should be deprived of their liberty arbitrarily. That is true. It is a fundamental human right that no-one should be deprived of their liberty arbitrarily. But I would equally argue that no-one should be deprived of their life arbitrarily. And in the balance between one's liberty and one's life, I expect that most people would come down on the side of people preserving their lives.</para></talk.start><para>The <inline ref="R2032">Anti-terrorism Bill 2004</inline> does have a context. It has a context of more than 10 years of attack on Western governments, Western organisations and Western people. People were not killed because they had committed any heinous crime against a group, an organisation or a government; they were killed simply because they were different and did not share the fundamentalist beliefs of the group of terrorists who were perpetrating the acts they have now continued to perpetrate for more than 10 years.</para><para>We now know, as fully as we can, the nature of al-Qaeda, the nature of the terrorist organisations associated with it and the fundamental driving force behind those organisations: to attempt to set up within the Asian region a fundamentalist Islamic state and to attempt to bring down—that was their first intent, but they could not do it—governments in the Middle East and replace them with fundamentalist governments such as that which operated under the Taliban in Afghanistan. We have seen people deprived of not just their liberty but their very lives: 88 people from Australia died in Bali. Their rights were completely disregarded by those terrorists who deprived them of their lives. </para><para>I completely reject the Greens' approach in arguing for the overriding importance of civil rights, human rights and liberty well ahead of the preservation of people's lives. These are not normal times; they require different legislation from what has previously been in place. They also require that the major parties, both in government and in opposition—we have been interchangeable entities for more than 100 years—exercise a steadfast responsibility not only to protect Australia's constitutional rights, as written in the Constitution, but to protect our normal civil rights. We always should have an eye to that. We need to take account of the fact that the times in which this bill comes forward are dramatically different from previous times. If you ask any one of those people in the families of the 88 Australians who died in Bali whether times have changed, whether the context has changed and whether the proper role for government and opposition is to address this matter in a different way, I am pretty sure they will answer in the affirmative. </para><para>The arguments put forward by the member for Cunningham and others highlighting the civil rights aspect of any proposal to change laws relating to terrorist threats are in concert with the way in which people of that ilk have argued for more than 100 years. They are concerned purely with the rights of the individual, no matter what that individual has done, no matter that that individual may be a terrorist, no matter that that individual may have attempted to take part in terrorist warfare against Australian troops or troops allied with Australia and no matter that that individual may have attempted to be part of an organisation whose fundamental purpose is directed towards destroying the fabric of life that we have here in Australia and trying to rip to pieces the fundamentals of Western civilisation. I cannot cop that kind of approach. I do not think it is either responsible or sensible to place an individual's rights above those of the community as a whole. I do not think it is right to place individual liberty above the life and liberty of a nation's people. I do not think it is appropriate to protect and guard the rights of people who are involved in terrorist organisations from the laws of the country that they are attempting to subvert. I do not think that is a sensible approach at all. We need a measured, balanced approach towards protecting our common liberties and ensuring that our people are protected, in so far as they can be, as much as possible.  </para><para>In looking at the Anti-terrorism Bill and its specific provisions, it is necessary to keep that context in mind. This is not a values-free exercise. It is not an exercise where you do not look at what has been happening in the world for more than a decade and say that we just stick up for one fundamental point. That is what the Greens are doing. This is about something deeper and far more important: our people and their protection. It is about the protection of people who live in my electorate of Blaxland in the middle of Sydney against the violence of a terrorist organisation that would seek to destroy their whole way of life. It is a case of trying to protect our soldiers—who may be fighting, as they did in Afghanistan—from people who seek to join terrorist organisations like the Taliban, a terrorist organisation that became a government. </para><para>The provisions of this bill which I call the antimercenary provisions seek to specifically deal with people who choose to join and fight for an organisation such as the Taliban. Previously, they could argue—and may have got away with it—that they were fighting only for a government. Quite rightly, we have already said that, given the nature of the Taliban and the fact of its association with al-Qaeda, it is a terrorist organisation. It totally eroded the lives and the liberties of people in Afghanistan and, if allowed to continue, it would have changed the whole nature of the region and wherever else in the world it could change. The context in which we view this situation has changed dramatically.</para><para>Section 1C of the Crimes Act 1914 deals with the broad context of liberty versus detention. I want to argue that what has been put here is not something that is absolutely extraordinary; it is a case of a reconsideration of what, practically, will assist our police forces to do their job of investigation with a view to prosecution. Based on the experience of police officers from our several states and their recommendations and a series of other considerations that have been given, this bill says that it is not unreasonable to extend a period of investigation for those purposes to 20 hours instead of the current eight hours and to increase the total maximum investigation period to 24 hours instead of 12 hours. I do not think it is a giant step to move to that. There is a rider in that, in cases where investigations need to be made overseas or where they need to be prolonged, the clock can be stopped for a period of time.</para><para>What is not intended by this bill is indefinite detention. I think that is absolutely clear. It was clear in the previous bill, and it is clear in this bill. Labor members would have a significant problem, as would members of the coalition, if the period were to be one of absolute indefinite detention. But that is not put forward in this bill. I also point out that this is not about ASIO's powers—that is dealt with separately—but about police powers. </para><para>A fairly good judge of these matters—certainly better than I am in regard to what is now demanded—is Professor George Williams, whom we know to be a significant constitutional expert. Speaking within the context of the Bali bombings and the 88 Australians who had their liberty completely taken away from them because their lives were taken away—I refer to his speech on 16 October 2002—he in his considered view said:</para><quote><para>The only element that arguably might be missing, I think, from that regime which might merit attention from the Prime Minister's review is that there is no longer detention period for terrorist suspects. It's at least arguable that the current 8 hour maximum period of detention may not be long enough in the context of a terrorist suspect where the police cannot hold the period longer than 8 hours because they lack the information at that stage to charge that person. The United Kingdom for example has introduced a period of 7 days' detention for terrorist suspects, Canada has a period of 3 days' detention for terrorist suspects. My own view is that a longer period of detention for terrorist suspects may well be appropriate in the climate after the Bali attack.</para></quote><para>Professor Williams has rightly pointed to the fact that the context for Australia has dramatically changed as a result of what happened in Bali. He has rightly pointed to the fact that the police forces may need that extra time in order to move towards finding the information that would be the basis of a successful prosecution.</para><para>We could make a further comparison and look not just at what Australia's situation is, what was previously in the Crimes Act and what changes have been made already but at what is happening in Britain and Canada and so on—as Professor Williams has alluded to. For a broader comparison, I will quote from the notes made by the member for Barton:</para><quote><para>By way of comparison, equivalent reforms in the United Kingdom and Canada also enable longer periods of investigative detention of terrorist suspects. Under the United Kingdom <inline font-style="italic">Terrorism Act 2000</inline>, police can detain a terrorist suspect for 48 hours, extendable for a further 5 days. This is within the Guidelines on Human Rights and the Fight Against Terrorism, issued by the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers, which states that detention of terrorist suspects for up to 7 days before charge may be justifiable. Similarly, the Canadian <inline font-style="italic">Anti-Terrorism Act 2002</inline> allows for detention of 24 hours extendable by a further 48 hours.</para></quote><para>What is being proposed in this bill is not without precedent. The Senate committee may have come down with its report yesterday. I have not seen that yet. Labor have previously indicated that they want to have a close look at the recommendations in the report. We have indicated that we would support this bill and, if necessary, we would make amendments later during the Senate process when it considers this bill. Fundamentally, the approach taken here is not out of kilter with experience overseas. It takes account of the fact that one's life has a higher value than one's liberty, without disregarding the fundamental importance of that within Western societies and within constitutionally based societies such as ours.</para><para>Having spoken directly to the provisions of this bill, I want to go a bit wider into an area that would normally be seen to be within the jurisdiction of the states. It is a question of Commonwealth criminal law but, quite often, members of state police forces have to undertake investigations in this area. There is a conjunction between state and federal in dealing with terrorist matters. I want to deal with some practicalities that I fear may have been overlooked. I want to look at the security question. We have had a lot of publicity about what has been done, and rightly done, not only in this budget but in previous expenditure to improve the situation at our ports and airports in providing greater security and control and improved measures to ensure that we do not have problems with people taking material through security or seeking to take guns onto aircraft or to hijack aircraft and so on. Those general provisions are welcomed, but an area which I do not think has been properly looked at, and it is an area of great vulnerability for Australia, and which has occasioned a significant problem is the contracting-out mania that has occurred Australia-wide, particularly in the last eight years. </para><para>If you look at the way in which the security industry operates—for example, those people providing security at Kingsford Smith airport and elsewhere in Australia—you will find that their registration is such that there is a head organisation, a major company, which has the security licence. It subcontracts that out to another organisation, and that organisation then takes on individual subcontractors and they perform the actual security work. I know this may not be the appropriate place, but I would like to put before the Attorney-General and the government as a whole the fact that there is an area of significant vulnerability here if those subcontractors are not in fact properly vetted. Given that the major responsibility for the arrangements lie with the states, the question of fighting terrorists and fighting people who would seek to destroy our society is for the Commonwealth and the states conjointly to work out.</para><para>I think it is not just possible but quite probable that people who are working as security agents—whether at Kingsford Smith or our other airports, at our ports or at our major installations—can be members of terrorist organisations. They can be there, simply waiting their turn to be told to go and commit a terrorist act. I do not think that we have enough control over the people who are there to provide that security. There may have been in the past, when the controlling company controlled its employees totally, but given the way it operates now, where the company that gets the major contract devolves that responsibility to a series of companies and they then go and hire individual employees on a part-time or full-time basis, I suspect that there is very little security clearance work done with those security employees.</para><para>An example of how this can operate is what happened recently in Saudi Arabia, when an Australian person lost his life because three or four security officers in the company that had been providing security just opened up. They had their orders. As I understand it, they were security officers within that company who had been doing their job for a number of years. They got the orders, they went in and they killed people at random in a terrorist act directed towards trying to force people out of Saudi Arabia. The same problem that occurred in Saudi Arabia with people who were trusted to be in a position to provide security for others could occur here. We have a position where people who are trusted to provide fundamental security at our airports, ports and other places may in fact have a back door to commit acts of sabotage and terrorism, because we have not adequately looked at the way in which the context of their employment has changed.</para><para>Despite the fact that the registration of security organisations is a state matter—I completely understand that—I ask the Attorney-General to take this matter into consideration to find out if there is proper security vetting of those people. The information that I have, which I will pursue later, is that this is not the case; that this is an open door that has not been closed or sealed; and that terrorists could quite readily gain access to our major facilities and do great damage and harm to the lives and liberties of Australian people. In general, I support this legislation, because it does give our police forces a greater capacity to question people with a view to prosecution where major acts of terrorism are concerned. It also seals off the possibility of people being able to benefit monetarily from literary proceeds of terrorism and it deals effectively with those people who would seek to fight for quasi-government terrorist organisations. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>28618</page.no><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name><name.id>0J4</name.id><electorate>Berowra</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Attorney-General</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—in reply—First, I take the opportunity to thank the members who have contributed to this debate: the member for Barton, in particular, for his indication of broad support of the measures that are contained in the proposed legislation; particularly the members for Dickson, Moncrieff and Flinders, who spoke supportively of the measures that the government is proposing; and the members for Melbourne Ports, Denison, Blaxland and Cunningham, who have contributed, many in quite positive ways, in relation to the legislation but have also raised some questions, which I will address.</para></talk.start><para>In thanking members for their careful consideration of this bill, I invite their attention to a speech I made at the Sydney Institute fairly recently. I wanted to spell out then that, with regard to civil and political rights—which we seek to protect and which were advanced by many during the course of this debate as being matters that we do not wish to see in any way challenged by our responses to terrorism—if you go back to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, one of the most fundamental of human rights is the human right to safety and security. </para><para>Governments have a responsibility to protect citizens and permanent residents of this country and to ensure that they are not exposed as civilians to gratuitous acts of violence by those who intend to try and achieve political objectives by terrorising civilian populations. We have not seen acts of civil disobedience of the order of magnitude that are challenging us now. We have seen terrorist acts before, but the enormity of the situation that we now face needs to be clearly understood. We are not immune from possible attack. I know some people think there is a degree of inevitability about it—I do not accept that. One of the reasons that the government has responded so quickly with very significant legislative reforms—enhancing our security agencies and enhancing the powers of our policing bodies that might have to investigate possible terrorist offences—is to do our level best to ensure that we do not have to endure such an act in our community. The importance of this legislation needs to be seen in that context. It is a question of getting the balance right.</para><para>I think our civil and political rights are important. However, I use as an example some very matter-of-fact questions that all of us understand in relation to our daily living. I went to the United States back in 1977, I think it was, to attend a conference on road safety. I was being bullied by Americans who told me their civil and political rights would be offended if they were required to wear seatbelts to secure their personal safety. I notice that in the United States they have now changed their minds in relation to that. One of the reasons they went down the route of developing airbags was that they would not wear seatbelts. It was seen as some great infringement. We just take it for granted. It is important to recognise that there are certain requirements to protect civil and political rights, but we have to get the balance right in relation to those matters.</para><para>In relation to the threat that we face, I think some members participating in this debate today—I think it was the member for Melbourne Ports—suggested that activities in Iraq had increased the danger of an attack here in Australia. I do not want to reopen issues that have been debated before, but I do want to make the point that we were a target for Jemaah Islamiah and al-Qaeda long before the tragic events of September 11, 2001, in the United States of America. We could have decided not to fight terrorism and hoped to be a small target. But the problem is, when you look at the sort of criteria that are being used by these terrorist organisations to identify who they legitimately think they can pursue, simply being Jewish or Christian is a sufficient identification in itself to make you a target. I think it is important that we recognise that you have to respond to the challenge. There might be people who are concerned that that response might constrain their activities, and they might make threats, but you cannot be put off in relation to those matters. </para><para>So this bill is about building on Australia's existing counter-terrorism laws in critical areas. It continues the government's practice of proactively updating our legal framework. It contains important measures to give police the operational flexibility they need to fairly obtain reliable and credible information on terrorists in investigations, while maintaining the longstanding protections that are entrenched in the Crimes Act. It tightens the provisions of the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act, so that Australian citizens and residents can be prosecuted if they serve in any capacity with a terrorist organisation in or with the armed forces of a foreign state. It improves the offences targeting those who take up membership in terrorist organisations and ensures that these offences are consistent with other terrorist offences in the Criminal Code. It enhances the offences of providing training to or receiving training from a terrorist organisation. It severely restricts the possibility for people to cash in on their notorious connections with terrorism by reaping the benefits of selling their stories.</para><para>This bill was introduced on 31 March. It was immediately referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. The committee reported on the bill on 11 May. The government is now considering the report, and I will respond to the committee's recommendations—as I should—shortly. But I want to turn to the points made by the member for Barton, because he picked up some of the recommendations of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee with a view to identifying how those recommendations can be implemented—not to diminish the effectiveness of the measures, but rather to enhance their operation. I will outline our response when the bill is considered by the Senate. This response is likely to involve government amendments, and I hope that we will have the opposition's support for the bill in that context. I hope we will also have the opposition's support when I outline reasons why a number of those recommendations might substantially erode the importance and efficacy of the measures that we are seeking to implement. I hope the opposition will give a proper and considered response.</para><para>One issue that was raised by the member for Barton, outside the scope of the Senate committee's recommendations, was the legal position of a person who attempts to withdraw from a foreign hostile activity but is forced to continue participation because of threats. As the member for Barton would be aware, this situation is dealt with by section 10.2 of the Criminal Code, which makes it clear that a person is not criminally responsible for an offence if he or she carries out the conduct constituting the offence under duress.</para><para>I am pleased that the member for Barton now supports the competency of the courts to identify terrorist organisations for the purposes of the offence of membership of a terrorist organisation. The government has always strongly supported the application of the membership offence to those organisations found to be terrorist organisations by a court, as well as organisations listed as terrorist organisations in the legislation. </para><para>I remind the member for Barton that the exclusion of the courts from the role of identifying terrorist organisations for the purpose of the membership offence was as a result of an opposition amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate on 25 June 2002 during the Senate debates on the Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 [No. 2]. I remind the member for Barton that, at the time, the Minister for Justice and Customs pointed out to the opposition that the amendment `suggests that our courts are not equipped to do their job and makes a mockery of our judicial system'. I do not accept that our courts are not equipped to do that job. I am pleased that the member for Barton has recognised the error of his party's approach to this issue and is supporting an amendment that will bring the membership offence into line with other terrorist organisation offences in the Criminal Code.</para><para>There were some other matters that were raised by the members for Denison and for Blaxland, in particular, that I would like to deal with. Firstly, in relation to one of the three points made by the member for Denison about the question of the police and their involvement in these recommendations, it is important to understand that these amendments are not being moved just because of the word of the police commissioners. Their advice was important to us, but theirs were not the only views.</para><para>It is true that the existing investigatory framework of the Crimes Act<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>works well and contains important safeguards for the investigation of federal offences generally. However, the level of complexity and the probable large magnitude of a federal terrorism investigation conducted within Australia, which is likely to span across state and territory borders as well as international borders, presents a unique problem. Liaising with overseas agencies in different time zones will often be necessary, and these considerations demand a more flexible framework.</para><para>The level of complexity in any terrorist investigation would approximate the complexity associated with serious and organised drug investigations. However, arrests for questioning in drug investigations typically occur after a considerable preliminary investigation has been undertaken. That is unlikely to occur in relation to a terrorist matter. In contrast, investigators of terrorist offences will not be able to hit the ground running when questioning terrorist suspects after an attack. They will need to grapple with similar complexities with extreme urgency and will be faced with the problem that they do not have time to be able to pursue those inquiries. We cannot allow that to continue. People, I think justly, expect that our criminal investigations must evolve to enable authorities to investigate and, where appropriate, prosecute terrorism offences.</para><para>In relation to the foreign incursions and recruitment legislation amendments, the member for Denison also raised the point that there was a degree of retrospectivity in what is proposed. I just want to make it very clear that a person will not be liable for an offence unless at the time an act is committed the organisation is proscribed. The fact that a person is not criminally liable for acts prior to proscription means that there is no retrospectivity in relation to the amendments that we are proposing regarding the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act. </para><para>In conclusion, I thank the member for Blaxland for raising some additional issues, particularly in relation to the security measures in place for aviation subcontractors. The Commonwealth is currently implementing a new aviation transport security regime. As part of that, new requirements for aviation security identification cards have been introduced under air navigation regulations. The ASICs—that is, the aviation security identification cards; it is an interesting acronym—issued since last November have required favourable, that is to say negative, criminal history checks against politically motivated violence indices that ASIO produces. Subcontractors, particularly those who are required to work in sterile areas in the airports, do require an aviation security identification card. I think that should please the honourable member for Blaxland. </para><para>Finally, I would like to say that the recent barbaric attack by terrorists in Madrid was a stark reminder to governments of free and democratic states around the world that we must be prepared to meet and defeat global terrorism head on. Ensuring that our intelligence capabilities are appropriately directed towards terrorist organisations and their plans is arguably the most critical component of Australia's counter-terrorism efforts. However, our legal framework must evolve to respond to new and shifting terrorism environments. The most obvious challenge for a government in the current security environment has come from the terrorist attacks themselves, in which thousands of lives have been lost.</para><para>The less obvious challenge has involved enacting laws that sufficiently protect us against terrorism but that do not impinge on the very rights and freedoms that we are seeking to protect in the first place. Traditionally, counter-terrorism laws have sought to balance the competing aims of increasing national security against protecting human rights. According to this view, the protection of one aim undermines the protection of the other. However, I have to say that there is a new and emerging view whereby national security and human rights are not seen to be mutually exclusive. I would encourage people to read some of the work of my counterpart the Attorney General of Canada, Irwin Cotler, who has been a very well-known human rights advocate over a long period of time. He has written extensively on these issues. I think his views are worth reading and understanding.</para><para>In combating terrorism, we should focus on creating human security legislation that protects both national security and civil liberties. This does not mean that we should disregard measures to minimise the impact of counter-terrorism laws on human rights—the tightening of security will have some effect on certain rights—but rather that we should not presume that steps that enhance our national security will jeopardise our civil liberties. That seems to be the assumption of the member for Cunningham, and I would encourage him to read the works of Irwin Cotler particularly.</para><para>This bill responds proactively to the legal challenges that I have mentioned. Importantly, it will give police the ability to do their job properly while preserving the important safeguards already in Part IC of the Crimes Act. The bill is very much a part of this government's commitment to making Australia a safer place in which to live.</para><para>As I indicated earlier, we will be looking at some amendments arising from the Senate committee report. We may not be able to accept all the proposals. I will give the shadow minister reasons for that. I hope we can conclude a consideration of these measures which will produce unanimous support for the measures proposed. I will seek to engage constructively to achieve that outcome. I hope the opposition will take a similar approach. I commend the bill to the House.</para><para>Question agreed to. </para><para>Bill read a second time. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>28622</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>28622</page.no><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name><name.id>0J4</name.id><electorate>Berowra</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Attorney-General</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>— by leave—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this bill be now read a third time.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a third time.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT (ACCESS TO ELECTORAL ROLL AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2004</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>28622</page.no><id.no>R2029</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT (ENROLMENT INTEGRITY AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2004</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R2030</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>28622</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 1 April, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Slipper</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>28622</page.no><name role="metadata">McMullan, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McMULLAN</name><name.id>5I4</name.id><electorate>Fraser</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on behalf of my colleague the shadow minister, Senator Faulkner, who has developed opposition policy in these matters and has taken it through the various forums of our party. The bills before the House are the <inline ref="R2029">Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Access to Electoral Roll and Other Measures) Bill 2004</inline>, which for ease of reference from now on I will call the access bill, and the <inline ref="R2030">Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Enrolment Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2004</inline>, which I shall call the enrolment bill.</para></talk.start><para>Sadly, but not surprisingly, these bills represent the sum total of the government's agenda on electoral law reform. The bills are overdue and, coming on the eve of a federal election, represent more of a clearing of the minister's in-tray than a coherent policy statement on electoral law. The government has adopted its previous practice of placing uncontroversial measures in one bill and more controversial matters in a second bill. The access bill is relatively uncontroversial, dealing with essentially technical reforms to the Commonwealth Electoral Act. Labor will be supporting all the measures in the access bill. The enrolment bill is more controversial and provides for: the disenfranchising of many young Australians by closing the electoral roll as soon as the election is called; a bureaucratic and unmanageable electoral enrolment regime which will confuse people and will not deter fraud; the raising of the disclosure threshold for political donations from $1,500 to $3,000; the complete removal of voting rights for prisoners; and a number of other measures which will make it harder for disadvantaged Australians to exercise their democratic right to vote.</para><para>Before I deal with each of these matters, it is worth noting just how tired and completely lacking in creativity the minister and his office must be. All the matters I have just outlined have already been debated at least twice by the parliament. On each occasion they were defeated, and they will be defeated again. None of those measures is supported by the Australian Electoral Commission, nor are any of them supported by the multiparty Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. In fact, most of the measures are unanimously opposed by that committee.</para><para>One wonders why the government would bother proposing such measures as raising the threshold for disclosure of donations or closing the electoral roll when the election is called. On their face, both measures are patently undemocratic and serve no real purpose other than perhaps to throw a few bones to the minister's very small conservative cheer squad. Disappointingly, the federal government's only substantive response to the small number of electoral fraud cases in 2000 and 2001 has been to establish a complex and discriminatory enrolment witnessing regime and to reintroduce its longstanding proposals for early closure of the rolls. There can be no doubt that closure of the roll as soon as an election is called would be to the detriment of the franchise. In fact, it is my view that that is exactly what it is intended to do. When Malcolm Fraser closed the roll without notice in 1983, it was estimated that over 150,000 people were disenfranchised or had to vote in the wrong electorate. </para><para>Currently, the rolls are left open for seven days after the writs are issued. The government proposes to close the roll immediately for new enrolments and leave it open for only three days for transfers. Closing the rolls as soon as an election is called and not allowing any new enrolments would disenfranchise about 80,000 new enrolees at each election, mostly young Australians. If people wanting to transfer their enrolment have only three days in which to do it, rather than seven days, it is estimated by the Australian Electoral Commission that 200,000 voters would be affected.</para><para>Why would anybody consciously set out to disenfranchise 80,000 young Australians and to have 200,000 voters enrolled in the wrong electorate? It cannot be for the reason of enhancing the integrity of the election, because the people implementing it know that it does not. It is the Australian equivalent of a Florida type arrangement. It would cause massive confusion on election day, long queues for declaration votes and significant delays in declaring results in many seats. The restriction on enrolment recommended by the government would massively distort the electoral roll, leading to a totally unacceptable situation where at least 80,000 Australians were disenfranchised and more than 200,000 voters were enrolled at the wrong address. Without a fixed date for elections, this measure is quite undemocratic and will not be supported by the opposition.</para><para>The proposed enrolment witnessing regime goes further than the recent unanimous recommendation by the multiparty Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. That committee, made up of members of various political parties—I am not sure if there is a government majority on that committee, but it has substantial government membership of at least 50 per cent—unanimously agreed to a regime where a person could enrol without a witness, provided they gave their drivers licence details or another form of acceptable identification. If the enrolee did not have such ID, the committee recommended two enrolled witnesses be used to verify the enrolment. The committee's recommendation explicitly stated:</para><quote><para>... the Committee does not consider it necessary that the witness be within a specified class of people ...</para></quote><para>However, the explanatory memorandum for this bill directly contradicts that recommendation and states:</para><quote><para>Where no identification documentation was available, only people in a prescribed class would be able to provide written references supporting an enrolment application.</para></quote><para>The ID checking measures will require close cooperation with the states, yet surprisingly, to date, there has been little consultation with the states, for example, over data access arrangements and security, and draft regulations have not been circulated. Given the importance of the regulations, how could parliament responsibly pass this measure without even a draft set of regulations being circulated?</para><para>One would think such a radical change to electoral enrolment was a response to a crisis of some kind. However, this is not the case. The Auditor-General examined this matter and issued a report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Integrity of the electoral roll</inline>, which was released very recently, on 18 April 2002. It is a current report by our most authoritative assessor of public integrity. The Auditor-General found that the roll is more than 96 per cent accurate and of high integrity. Further, Mr Barrett, the Auditor-General, found that internal Australian Electoral Commission procedures to ensure roll security and prevent tampering with roll data were `robust and effective'. </para><para>Australians are amongst the most mobile people in the world, with a high level of internal migration. This translates into high levels of enrolment change. Given the normal delays in updating enrolments, a roll that is over 96 per cent accurate at any one time is a significant achievement. Furthermore, the Audit Office data-matched the electoral roll to Medicare residence records and found a greater than 99 per cent match. So, after the tick of approval from no less an authority than the Commonwealth Auditor-General, why is the minister wanting to continue to mess around with enrolment forms?</para><para>At a time when many people will be updating their enrolment and when many young Australians will be enrolling to vote for the first time, the government thinks it appropriate to seek to make a massive change to the system. Why is the government once again trying to dramatically change enrolment procedures on the eve of an election? The government tried to do so in 2001 but chose not to promulgate the laws which would have introduced a tablecloth style enrolment form in July 2001. No doubt, fearing an electoral backlash and considerable confusion, the Prime Minister put the kibosh on the radical last-minute changes to enrolment in 2001. It left the AEC with a warehouse full of what are now useless enrolment forms which cost millions of dollars.</para><para>To once again propose such a change, one would think that the government would be reasonably sure that its new system would actually stop enrolment fraud and that people would not be disenfranchised. Unfortunately, the fact is that the government has ignored advice from experts that its proposed system will not stop fraud. Alarmingly, the government appears to have also ignored advice as to the disenfranchising effect of its proposed electoral enrolment scheme. Along with the AEC and most of the states, the opposition have made it very clear that constructive measures to improve the integrity of the roll will be supported. However, we will not support changes to the system that do nothing about fraud while potentially disenfranchising many people.</para><para>It is quite perplexing that the government has not simply adopted the model unanimously proposed by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. Perhaps the reason the government has ignored the alternatives is that the other models for improving the integrity of the roll did not have the political spin-off that the government wanted—that is, to make it harder for people in remote communities, the homeless and people with poor English to enrol and to vote. Perhaps the government's proposed enrolment witnessing rules are all about political advantage and have nothing whatsoever to do with the integrity of the electoral roll. If the provisions were not about partisan politics then the government would have followed the model unanimously proposed by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters.</para><para>These enrolment procedures have been on the drawing board for over five years. Over that time, the government has ignored sensible alternatives from the AEC, state governments and, more recently, a bipartisan parliamentary committee report. By ignoring the legitimate concerns raised by the states, which are partners with the AEC in managing the roll, the government has risked the separation of national and state electoral rolls. Such an outcome would be disastrous for the integrity of the roll. As such, Labor will not support these provisions. </para><para>Notwithstanding Labor's criticisms of the government's radical proposals, in our view a balanced electoral reform process must be ongoing. We support the Australian Electoral Commission working with state and other Commonwealth agencies to improve enrolment of young and homeless Australians. We support details of age and gender being included on the certified roll on polling day, thus providing extra checks for voter identity. We support increasing penalties for electoral fraud. We support increased data matching between the AEC and other government agencies to help stamp out any chance of electoral fraud. We support the immediate reintroduction of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Electoral Information and Education Service. And we support the reasonable use of technology and widely accepted forms of identification to improve enrolment. But we do not support measures to restrict or reduce the franchise of those groups whose very disadvantage makes their right to vote so important.</para><para>Labor will also not be supporting the provisions of the bill which would remove the right to vote for all prisoners. The Labor Party will be opposing this item and proposing in its place amendments to tighten the current provisions. The provisions in this bill would deny all prisoners a vote. Hence, a person sentenced to eight weeks in jail which coincided with an election period could not vote, yet another prisoner, sentenced to two years in jail which coincided with a favourable electoral cycle, would be able to vote. It should be noted that denying the right of all prisoners, irrespective of sentence, would present a breach of our obligations under the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights as well as the United Nations Universal Declaration on Human Rights, which was re-signed by the Howard government in 1999.</para><para>Parliament has previously accepted that certain classes of prisoners should not be able to vote and we do not oppose those previous decisions by the parliament. It is possible to distinguish between major and minor crimes, as the parliament has previously done. We believe that the five-year rule should remain but that it should be amended so that, if any prisoner has been continuously imprisoned from the return of the writs of the previous election to the issuing of the writs for the next election, their vote should not be admitted to the count. We think that is the better approach and we will be moving that way in the Senate.</para><para>At the behest of the Northern Territory Country Liberal Party, the government has once again brought forward measures to restrict who can assist impaired voters. The fundamental right of Australians to cast their vote in private, free from interference and coercion, is a basic tenet of our society. As a general principle, the opposition believes that a person's right to a free and fair vote should be the paramount motivation in structuring any legislation. The needs of the political parties, be they Labor, Democrat, Liberal, National or the CLP, should be of secondary importance. If proposed changes to the Electoral Act compromise this paramount right of the voter then those changes should be discarded.</para><para>Section 234 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act and other related legislation currently provide in the case of a voter's sight being impaired or their being incapacitated or illiterate that the voter can appoint a person to assist them to carry out their vote. As the Electoral Act currently stands the voter would just take their voter friend in to help them vote. We think this is a practical way to handle the process. We also think that it is fair and preserves the secrecy of the person's vote. It does not compromise the voter's rights or the functioning of busy polling booths. It is important to note that the Australian Electoral Commission do not support the government's proposed changes to the Electoral Act. They believe the current system works well. </para><para>Currently, the voter has all the say in who assists them. Appropriately, the voter is free to choose someone they trust, without limitations. This sort of delegation is not unusual under Australian law. But that is not what the government are proposing here. They are proposing, for such an important social and legal obligation and right as voting, that a person who is unable for whatever reason to fully execute their right to vote should not control who they delegate that right and obligation to. The legislative changes currently being proposed would see that fundamental freedom of the voter taken away.</para><para>If the principle of secret ballots and personal freedoms are so important in other spheres to the conservatives, one has to ask why they are so willing to do away with that principle here. Perhaps it has something to do with ulterior, cynical, partisan political motives. Perhaps they think it will put them back in the running for seats where there are high levels of illiteracy. Perhaps it is because it will be largely the rights of Aborigines, disabled people and migrants that are affected here. Perhaps it suits their interests to make it even harder for the disadvantaged and vulnerable to exercise a vote.</para><para>The proposal the government has now put forward would have the presiding officer marking the paper, with scrutineers free to observe in some circumstances. It remains a proposal that will pollute the principle of the secret ballot and take rights away from the already disadvantaged in society. The key problem with the new legislation is that it is not the voter's friend who will complete the ballot paper but the presiding officer. Clearly, this will be particularly intimidating for Aboriginal voters in the Northern Territory, Western Australia and regional Queensland. In an Aboriginal community the voter's friend is invariably an Aboriginal person who may well also be a scrutineer, whereas the presiding officer will most likely be a non-Aboriginal person. A situation exists here where explanations and instructions may cross languages and certainly cross cultures. Conscious or unconscious intimidation of the voter could easily occur.</para><para>Under the government's proposal, there will be at least three people in the ballot box rather than two. With the intrusion of the presiding officer the voter's privacy is compromised, and with that the integrity of the ballot is also compromised. With unknown scrutineers also present the problem multiplies further. Any reasonable person concerned with maintaining the integrity of the process would support an appropriate level of control or supervision by the presiding officer. The opposition argues, as does the Australian Electoral Commission, that we currently have a system which provides the appropriate level of control. Indeed, in relation to assisted voting, the AEC's submission to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral matters stated:</para><quote><para>The changes to the assisted voting provisions would represent a significant weakening of the secrecy of the ballot for many of the disadvantaged members of the community ... The AEC is of the view that the current federal legislation relating to assisted voting is operating properly as the parliament intended and should be left unamended.</para></quote><para>The current assisted voting provisions—with the voter's friend filling out the ballot paper—work well as they are and ensure the greatest possible participation in the democratic process. There is no reason to change it. For those reasons, the opposition will be opposing the provisions of this bill relating to assisted voting. </para><para>The other provision in the enrolment bill which I want to touch on is the proposal to raise the disclosure threshold for political donations from $1,500 to $3,000. The opposition will not be supporting this measure as it will mean more donations to parties are hidden—in fact, that is its absolute intention. Our approach to this matter has always been different to that of the conservatives. We support transparency of political donations—they do not. Measures such as this will mean approximately 40 per cent of the donors currently disclosed in returns by parties would no longer be disclosed. And if the Liberal Party's full policy were to become law and the threshold were raised to $10,000, 80 per cent of the donors currently disclosed in returns by parties would not be disclosed. This proposal is dodgy with a capital D. It allows a higher quantum of hidden donations and the brown paper bag brigade will be the ultimate winners. That would be a disaster for the integrity of our political system and Labor will not support it. We will not support the measures in this bill which will hide political donations.</para><para>In conclusion, the integrity of electoral enrolment can only be assured if all Australians can easily get onto the roll and if the roll is secure and electoral fraud is deterred. These matters are equally important: enrolment must be fair and the electoral roll must be safe. The government's proposed early closure of the rolls and voter identification measures will reduce the integrity of the electoral roll. They will lead to a reduction in the franchise, which will particularly affect the young and the socially disadvantaged; a decrease in the accuracy of the rolls at the close of rolls; queuing delays, confusion and inconvenience at polling booths; an increase in declaration voting; and delays in the delivery of election results. </para><para>Labor's approach to electoral reform is guided by a desire to improve the franchise and make political donations more transparent. The electoral system must be fair and accountable. Changes to that system must build on those basic principles, not corrode them. We will be opposing the second of the electoral bills because it will corrode the franchise and make political parties far less accountable.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>28627</page.no><name role="metadata">Randall, Don, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RANDALL</name><name.id>PK6</name.id><electorate>Canning</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am pleased today to speak on the <inline ref="R2029">Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Access to Electoral Roll and Other Measures) Bill 2004 </inline>and the <inline ref="R2030">Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Enrolment Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2004</inline>. Before I speak to the meat of the bills and before the member for Fraser leaves the chamber, it is interesting to note that, as a former state secretary of the Labor Party in Western Australia, he is one of the people who does not want reform of the electoral system. The greatest beneficiaries of electoral fraud are people in organisations like his which follow the mantra of vote early and vote often. That is the Labor Party mantra: vote early and vote often.</para></talk.start><para>This would affect many marginal seats. As a person who has been in two marginal seats, I have a distinct interest in the integrity of the Australian electoral roll because any manipulation of it would see skewed results, and we know that has happened in the past. There have been volumes of books written about electoral fraud in this country, and most of it homes back to the Australian Labor Party and the organisation which attach themselves to it in the form of the union movement. They organise many of their pawns as workers to help circumvent the proper electoral process. So of course the member for Fraser would not want to see reform in this area, because, as a former state secretary, he has been a beneficiary of this sort of thing. I will expand on that shortly, regarding the electoral fraud I found previously as the member for Swan, and I will outline in detail how that was constructed. </para><para>These reform bills are necessary to address the manipulation and circumvention of proper democratic processes in this country. This legislation is the result of the recommendations from the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. It made its report into both the 1998 and 2001 elections and, as a result of the report, put forward certain recommendations, which have resulted in these two bills. It is very important that the integrity of the electoral roll is kept. I do accept the member for Fraser's point that 96 per cent of the Australian electoral roll was found by the Auditor-General to be correct. But it is the four per cent that is of concern. I wonder where that four per cent has its greatest impact. You would not have to be Einstein to realise that it is in marginal seats.</para><para>I point out the old `vote early and vote often' mantra. Let us say that we cannot get the reforms that we are looking for today. In the electorate of Canning, for example, where I won by 520 votes, there were 45 polling booths. You only need 12 people to hack around to each of those polling booths on the day of the election and vote in each. When they are asked, `Have you voted today, Sir?' they only have to say, `No, I haven't.' That is the only check. They then vote, and vote again—and they vote 45 times. Suddenly that 521 margin of votes in my seat of Canning is gone, because somebody has decided to vote early and vote often.</para><para>The member for Cunningham laughs, because he is an appendage of the Labor Party. The fifth faction of the Labor Party is the Greens in this political environment in Australia. You will never get someone like the member for Cunningham, as a member of the Greens, to ever support anything like this measure because in this House he has never voted with the government once. Not once has the member for Cunningham supported anything that this government has done. He is an appendage of the Labor Party—and that is what the Green movement is in this country. Shortly you will see Bob Brown do a deal with the Labor Party on preferences. They are the people that are going to try to deliver the Labor Party an election in this country, so of course he is laughing and of course he does not want reform. He is part of this whole process and he should be ashamed of himself. The people of Cunningham should know how compliant he is with the Labor Party on these electoral fraud matters that we are trying to fix up.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BNL</name.id><name role="metadata">Organ, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Organ</name></talker><para>—Weren't you here yesterday?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>PK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Randall, Don, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RANDALL</name></talker><para>—You are a disgrace! Just keep out of the argument. We are not going to put up with you. I do agree with the proposal about prisoner disenfranchisement because, at the end of the day, it has to be transparent across the whole prison system. You cannot have some people in prisons voting and others not. I have two prisons in my area: the Hakea Prison, formerly known as the Canning Vale prison, and the Karnet prison. Before the last election we dropped off some how-to-vote cards to the prisoners there. I think there were only two or three prisoners who got to vote. This is not a big deal, but it does tidy up an anomaly. So naturally I support this provision.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In terms of enrolment addresses and the objections to provisional voting, it is very important that we take on board the recommendation of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters as regards making sure that voters are registered at a residence rather than a subdivision. There is nothing more dodgy than finding out that people have their address as care of a post-office box—and we see them come through our offices all the time. People do not live in post-office boxes. They need to be at an identifiable address in the electorate so that they can be contactable. Yes, there are section votes for security reasons—people with domestic violence orders et cetera—which is understandable. But this increasing practice of people putting themselves care of a post-office box is not acceptable, because it raises serious questions about where you really live. There is probably nobody in this House who has knocked on more doors in relation to elections than me, and so many times I find that I turn up to see people who are supposed to be living at an address and it is a vacant block—someone is enrolled to vote at that address. This issue of actually having an address assigned to a person's name rather than a subdivision obviously needs supporting because again it is a security measure that will bring the integrity to the electoral roll that it deserves. </para><para>The Electoral Commission continually updates its rolls. I have a very good working relationship with my returning officer in the electorate of Canning, Mr Danny Wallace, and he does a very great job. But I am surprised that for this election there has not been a whole-of-electorate habitation survey. They have done only small spot checks in a couple of areas of my electorate and in a couple of CCDs. That is not good enough. We know that something like 25 per cent of an electorate can turn over within three years. It is not unusual for that to happen.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Cameron, Ross, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Ross Cameron</name></talker><para>—One-third.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>PK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Randall, Don, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RANDALL</name></talker><para>—It is one-third in the case of the member for Parramatta's electorate. So if a proper habitation survey is not done within this period it opens questions about the integrity of where people live. In my electorate office I like to sign my own letters as often as I can because it keeps me in touch with who is actually where. Many times I sign letters to a household and there are two or three different surnames there. It is quite understandable if there is a de facto relationship et cetera, but, when those two or three surnames have siblings, it is very hard—unless there are gipsies—when you find out that there are half-a-dozen people living in the same house. When you actually check it out they have often moved on and kept that address. That in itself is a real concern because, if somebody has left their address for a long period of time, that is obviously an opportunity to rort. That is what we are talking about: the opportunity to rort.</para></talk.start></continue><para><inline font-style="italic">Opposition member interjecting—</inline></para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>PK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Randall, Don, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RANDALL</name></talker><para>—You will always get people like the member opposite objecting to this because they are keen on rorts. The Western Australian Labor Party are under investigation at the moment for rorting their membership rolls. There is a federal intervention into the Western Australian Labor Party at the moment because Senator Bishop has complained about the integrity of the party's membership—they are rorting their applications and the representation at their own state executive. So here we have a party that have claimed that everything is sweet and nice, and yet they are being investigated because of the rorting of their own membership rolls, and the unions et cetera, which give them representation on the Labor Party's state executive, are under investigation. This is a bleeding sore on a daily basis. So laugh as much as you like. You are the people who are in the box on this issue. You should be trying to do something about fixing the integrity of the Australian electoral roll, and yet you laugh.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The compulsory transfer of enrolment is another issue that really needs to be addressed. One of the provisions is that the divisional returning officer has to be notified within 21 days if someone has been living at an address for a period of more than a month. That is quite reasonable. The penalty for noncompliance is one penalty point, which is $110. Again, proof of identity and address is something that the committee recommended as a reform. The resolution of the committee was that there were compelling arguments for better identification of where people live. What is the matter with producing your driver's licence when you decide to enrol to vote? I would have thought that it was quite sensible. </para><para>As has been said many times in this House, you have to provide more identification to join a video club at your local video shop or to join your local library than you do to enrol to vote in this country. The provision of having to produce your licence—and if, for some reason, you do not have an Australian driver's licence there is the discretion to provide other forms of identification—is quite a reasonable one. What is the matter with having to provide that sort of identification if you are not trying to rort?</para><para>We are told by the member for Fraser that the Labor Party will be opposing this provision because it puts unrealistic requirements on people trying to enrol, particularly Aboriginals. While I am talking about the enrolment of Aboriginals on the roll, I wish to relate how a roll can be manipulated by using Aboriginal groups. I used to be the member for Swan, and the previous member to me engaged an Aboriginal woman in his office. I will not give her whole name but her surname was Kickett. The head of the Western Australian Department of Aboriginal Affairs told me that the woman's job was to manage 2,000 Aboriginals in the electorate of Swan to vote. She kept their addresses, made sure that they were current and that the people were on the roll. Her job was to make sure that they voted on polling day in 1993.</para><para>Let us be clear about it: the general rule of thumb is that about 95 per cent of Aboriginals vote for Labor. It is very interesting to note that that member for Swan then won his election by only about 300 votes. So who is the beneficiary of this sort of manipulation of the Aboriginal vote? Do not be holier than thou and say that we are disenfranchising Aboriginals, when you use them like that. I am happy to give further details at any time for anybody who wants to further investigate the rort that was perpetrated in the electorate of Swan before the 1993 election.</para><para>The transient nature of many people is what the electoral reforms in this set of bills are trying to address. It is quite reasonable that we ask people to give proof of identity before they enrol to vote, because if they have nothing to hide they will not be embarrassed. They will not even feel compromised if they have nothing to hide, because that is what most people do when they join their local video club.</para><para>The early close of rolls is again a good recommendation. For those who are already on the roll and want to transfer, it is said that the new reform will mean that they will have three days, but for those wishing to enrol it will be on the day that the writs are issued. That is quite reasonable, because people have 12 months to enrol—they can enrol at 17, for 18. If they have not got on the roll as a new citizen or they have forgotten to get on the roll previously, they have years to do so. I meet quite a few people when I am doorknocking who say, `I have never got onto the electoral roll and I am not going to now because I might get fined for all the years that I have not been on the roll. I am just not going to bother.' There are many people out there who could be on the electoral roll but choose not to be on it. But when they do decide to enrol to vote they have plenty of time to do it. The disenfranchisement that the member for Fraser was banging on about previously is just ridiculous. There is plenty of time to enrol. We know that the real reason that this happens is that they actually want to crowd the electoral office and the electoral system so much that there is no way of checking. </para><para>The habit of provisional voting is addressed in this reform as well. Provisional voting is one of the great rorts. Again, the beneficiaries are generally those on the opposite side. For example, people say, `I live within the electorate of Canning but I am not on the roll and I want to vote.' They turn up to the polling booth on the day and say, `I live at such and such a street, Falcon, and I want to vote in the Canning electorate.' The officials say, `You're not on the roll.' When people say, `I am,' the officials have to take their word for it and take it away as a section vote. The flaw is that very few of them are ever checked. The member for Hinkler has related a story about how he kept a very good audit of all his returned mail and checked it against those wanting to vote provisionally. He found that there were hundreds who claimed to live in his electorate of Hinkler. I see he is listed to speak here shortly, and I bet he will talk about this. I think he won his seat by 61 votes or a couple of hundred votes or whatever it was. Knocking out those bogus enrolments was enough to stop him from being fraudulently tipped out of his seat.</para><para>That is what this reform bill is about: provisional votes and people claiming to live in an electorate when they do not. It is pretty easy to do. In my area there are quite a number of active unions, such as the CFMEU. Out at Pinjarra there is the AMWU and the AWU. They are very good at marshalling their troops and saying, `We do not need your vote in the electorate of Brand; it is a bit of a safe Labor seat. But we do need it in the electorate of Canning. There are a few spare beach houses and good caravan parks in Falcon. We will give that as your address so that you can vote in that very marginal seat.' I have actually doorknocked and found a trail of these letters. The people do not live in the electorate at all; they live in Rockingham, yet they have their address listed as a caravan park somewhere in Barragup. They get their mail redirected all the time because they do not live there, but for electoral purposes they turn up on polling day and say, `I live in a caravan in Barragup.' That is the way that provisional votes get rorted all the time, and that is what this reform addresses.</para><para>This sort of reform is necessary to stop multiple voting et cetera. This legislation makes multiple voting an offence. `Vote early and vote often' is the Labor Party mantra. This reform would not have been included here unless it was a recommendation of the committee. The reform makes it an offence under section 339(1)(a) of the act. Currently the act imposes a liability of 10 penalty units. This will make it 60. Each penalty unit is $110, so it is a substantial fine. The interesting thing is that it will also attract a penalty of 12 months imprisonment. As we know, if you wish to be a member of this House or of any parliament of Australia, under the Constitution a prison term of 12 months or more precludes you from standing for parliament. So this sends a very strong signal to those who want to manipulate the roll, defraud the electorate and benefit from fraudulent behaviour. Ultimately, the provisions in the bills have come from recommendations made by the joint standing committee. Unlike places like Zimbabwe and Indonesia that want to rort elections, we want to continue the good Australian way. Voting in elections here is compulsory, but a lot of people do not want to vote. For those who do not vote but still want to vote properly, we want to make sure that the Australian electoral roll has the utmost integrity. These provisions do that. As a result, I commend these bills to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>28632</page.no><name role="metadata">Organ, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ORGAN</name><name.id>BNL</name.id><electorate>Cunningham</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I welcome the opportunity to speak on the <inline ref="R2029">Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Access to Electoral Roll and Other Measures) Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2030">Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Enrolment Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2004</inline>. These bills address serious issues, despite the comments made by the member for Canning. I was smiling during his debate, especially when I heard his talk about `vote early, vote often' anecdotes in some way supporting rorts. They do not. As I said, these are very serious issues. We have a wonderful voting system here in Australia, with compulsory voting. Just last week I was speaking to some people from America who talked about the number of people turning up to vote there being 15 per cent or so. It is a very low figure. I am sure that many of us here in Australia welcome the fact that we have compulsory voting and that as many people as possible are able to engage in our democracy. </para></talk.start><para>In 1854 Abraham Lincoln said, `No man is good enough to govern another man without that other's consent.' These bills makes it obvious that the federal government is not concerned by such a basic proposition. If the second reading speech by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration is to be believed, these bills are simply another routine clean-up of the machinery of government. If the parliamentary secretary is to be taken at face value, these bills should not be considered controversial and will have only a positive impact upon the community. I have a different view, and it is a view based on a realistic reading of the bills.</para><para>According to the parliamentary secretary, these bills will implement new arrangements for proof of identity and address for applicants for enrolment or re-enrolment. They include the sex and date of birth of electors on the certified list as a check on identity when voting. They will allow for the close of rolls for new electors to be 6 p.m. on the day on which the writ for an election is issued, and for the close of rolls for those amending their enrolment details to be 8 p.m., three working days after the issue of the writ. They will allow political parties and Independent members of parliament to be provided with certain information about where electors voted on election day. They will provide that prisoners serving a sentence of full-time detention are not allowed to vote. They will prevent scrutineers from actively assisting electors who have requested an assisted vote. Last, but not least, they will increase a number of the financial disclosure thresholds to $3,000.</para><para>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration said that these bills are: </para><quote><para> ... important and urgent reforms to the electoral process, which should be implemented as soon as possible. </para></quote><para>Once again, I have a different opinion. In essence, these bills erode the accountability of the Australian electoral system and will have the effect of disenfranchising many Australians. The bills propose to increase from $1,000 to $3,000 the size of donations that must be disclosed by political parties. They also propose to increase from $1,500 to $3,000 the threshold for disclosure of donations by individuals to political parties, disclosure of donations to those acting on behalf of political parties, and disclosure of any amounts received or debts incurred by political parties.</para><para>While this falls short of the $10,000 floor on such declarations advocated by the Liberal Party in its submission to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, there is still no justification for such changes. They do not serve the public interest in any way; they simply make it easier for parties to hide the sources of their funds. The Greens have long called for increases in the accountability of political parties with respect to corporate donations. We have long called for the end to practices where corporations can buy political influence without the public's knowledge. The provisions regarding donations to political parties contained in these bills have nothing to do with their title, `Enrolment Integrity'. In fact, like much of the coalition's rhetoric, they will ensure the opposite. These bills are designed to hide the money trail of political donations. I call on the Labor Party to reject them. </para><para>These bills further erode the accountability of our electoral system by removing the requirement for broadcasters and publishers to lodge returns with the Australian Electoral Commission for political advertisements during an election period. Will this have the effect of making it easier for the media to avoid scrutiny? Surely, in light of the recent cash for comment saga, this proposal is inappropriate. These bills also propose that the electoral roll be closed for new electors at 6 p.m. on the day that writs are issued and, for existing electors, three days after the issuing of writs. These changes are fundamentally undemocratic.</para><para>The report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters on the 1998 federal election found that `the greatest catalyst for enrolment is an electoral event'. These concerns are raised by the Youth Action and Policy Association, YAPA, the peak community group for young people in New South Wales. In correspondence I have received from YAPA, they have told me that they want the parliament to be aware:</para><quote><para>YAPA is particularly concerned with the section of the bill which proposes to close the electoral roll for new electors on 6pm on the day on which the writ for an election is issued, and to close the electoral roll for those amending their enrolment details at 8pm three working days after the issue of the writ.</para></quote><para>YAPA believe that this bill will effectively exclude thousands of young people from voting.</para><para>It has been well established that young people aged 18 to 24 have the lowest enrolment figure of any eligible age group. According to recent information from the Australian Electoral Commission, only about 60 per cent of 18-year-olds are currently enrolled to vote. It has also been proven that young people are far more transient than other age groups and often leave their enrolment to the last minute. Young adults having reached the age of independence are often moving out of home or between rental accommodation due to their employment and education prospects. YAPA believe that this bill unfairly targets young people and will effectively limit the political voice of young people across the nation.</para><para>In the first week of the 2001 election campaign, 83,000 first-time voters signed up in the seven days after the election was called and 290,000 people updated their enrolment details, such as reporting a change in address. Under the proposed changes, many such citizens would be denied their voting rights. While YAPA acknowledge the demands on the Australian Electoral Commission in verifying enrolment details in a short period of time, they believe that alternative measures, such as the engagement of additional casual staff, should be investigated rather than removing people from the democratic process of voting. YAPA believe that the proposal is in direct contrast to federal government claims of a commitment to hearing the views of young people and they therefore ask us to exercise every effort to see that this bill is defeated.</para><para>YAPA are right. These bills will disproportionately and needlessly affect young people. They would effectively disenfranchise many young people—the demographic in which the Howard government enjoys little support. The government may wish to consider why young voters avoid the coalition like the plague. It may have something to do with record HECS debts, woefully inadequate TAFE funding, the war in Iraq, aspects of our environment and other issues. Perhaps the government could address these issues instead of attempting to block and remove young people from the electoral roll. The closing of the electoral roll on the day that writs are issued would also adversely affect new migrants. The proposed amendments would have the effect of disenfranchising many Australians. They are both unnecessary and unjust. </para><para>There are others who would be disenfranchised by these bills as well. The bills propose that the right of prisoners in full-time sentence to vote be abolished. Estimates suggest that 18,000 Australian citizens will be denied the vote as a consequence of these amendments. In a close election there is no doubt that 18,000 votes will matter and could alter a government. Currently, prisoners serving sentences of five years or more are prohibited from voting. These bills propose to extend such restrictions to all prisoners serving full-time sentences. Once again, these changes are fundamentally undemocratic.</para><para>The Greens believe that, whatever crime has been committed, a prison sentence should not involve the removal of basic citizenship rights. One of the goals of incarceration should be—must be—the rehabilitation of prisoners. It is not simply about punishment. The removal of voting rights for all prisoners serving full-time sentences is likely to further alienate such prisoners from Australia's democratic traditions and institutions. These measures will make the chances of rehabilitation more unlikely.</para><para>This point was accepted by the European Court of Human Rights when, on 30 March this year, it accepted prisoners' right to vote. In Canada, the same occurred on 31 October 2002 in the judgment of Sauve v. the Attorney-General of Canada (No. 2). Chief Justice McLachlin commented:</para><quote><para>Denying penitentiary inmates the right to vote is more likely to send messages that undermine respect for the law and democracy than messages that enhance those values. </para><para>The legitimacy of the law and the obligation to obey the law flow directly from the right of every citizen to vote. </para><para>To deny prisoners the right to vote is to lose an important means of teaching them democratic values and social responsibility. The government's novel political theory that would permit elected representatives to disenfranchise a segment of the population finds no place in a democracy built upon principles of inclusiveness, equality, and citizen participation.</para></quote><para>I could not agree more with those comments, particularly given article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, of which I remind the government Australia is a signatory, which states:</para><quote><para>Every citizen shall have the right and the opportunity, without any of the distinctions mentioned in article 2 and without unreasonable restrictions: </para><para>(a) To take part in the conduct of public affairs, directly or through freely chosen representatives; </para><para>(b) To vote and to be elected at genuine periodic elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret ballot, guaranteeing the free expression of the will of the electors ...</para></quote><para>How does the government's proposal which is before us sit with those ideals? It does not—it tramples over them.</para><para>In the European Court of Human Rights case of Hirst v. the United Kingdom, a seven-judge bench found that the restriction on voting rights for prisoners in the same way as these bills propose:</para><quote><para>... imposes a blanket restriction on all convicted prisoners. It applies automatically to all such prisoners, irrespective of the length of their sentence and irrespective of the nature or gravity of their offence. As pointed out in the Canadian courts, the actual effect on an individual prisoner's right to vote will depend, somewhat arbitrarily, on the period during which he happens to serve his sentence. A prisoner sentenced to a week's imprisonment for a minor infraction may lose the right to vote if detained over election day whereas a prisoner serving several years for a more serious crime may, by chance, avoid missing an election. </para></quote><para>It is a disturbing fact, which has been raised by previous speakers in this debate, that Indigenous Australians make up a disproportionate portion of our prison population. The changes in this bill would therefore target Indigenous Australians disproportionately. Indigenous Australians are likely to be further disenfranchised through this legislation. I am not surprised that this government is seeking to further disenfranchise Indigenous Australians. This is, after all, the year in which the government, with the support of the ALP, abolished ATSIC—the national representative body for Indigenous Australians. Rather than improving on and assisting with representation of the Indigenous community in Australia, it is being removed. The amendment before us is just the latest in a string of attacks by this government upon Indigenous Australians.</para><para>These bills also contain a number of overly punitive measures—for example, the proposal to increase the penalty for failure to notify a change of address. The proposed increase from $50 to one penalty unit, which is currently $110, is a significant increase and, I believe, an unnecessary one. People who change address on a regular basis and who are therefore likely to come under the scope of these changes would usually be renters and low-income earners. To increase the penalty for what might be a common occurrence among a vulnerable group is excessively punitive. These bills also propose to enable regulations governing proof of ID for the purposes of voting. Many people do not have drivers licences and therefore any regulations governing ID would have to include a broad range of forms in order that Australian citizens not be disenfranchised. Homeless people, in particular, are vulnerable to changes in ID requirements. While there are some welcome measures contained in these bills, their undemocratic and punitive aspects mean that I cannot support them.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>28635</page.no><name role="metadata">Panopoulos, Sophie, MP</name><name role="display">Ms PANOPOULOS</name><name.id>00AMU</name.id><electorate>Indi</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am very pleased to be speaking on the <inline ref="R2029">Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Access to Electoral Roll and Other Measures) Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2030">Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Enrolment Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2004</inline>. These bills highlight the importance the government places on identifying and correcting instances of voter fraud and maintaining and strengthening the integrity of our electoral system. I was interested to note that the previous speaker, the member for Cunningham, said in not so many words that it would undermine respect for the rule of law if 18,000 prisoners were prevented from voting in a particularly close election. That is a very interesting observation for the member for Cunningham, who is also a member of the Greens. I would be very interested to know the reaction of the Australian public, particularly the voters in my own electorate, to the concept that an election result may hinge on the votes cast by those in prison at the time of an election. It seems a quite perverse notion that the member for Cunningham says that it would undermine the law to prevent these people from voting when they have in fact severely undermined the law and that is why they find themselves in prison accommodation at Her Majesty's pleasure. </para></talk.start><para>The measures contained in these bills are designed to clamp down on the vexing issue of voter fraud and to enhance the integrity of the electoral system. They cover a broad range of issues related to the electoral roll and enrolment processes. The integrity of Australia's democracy depends on the will of the Australian people being accurately reflected. Fraud within the electoral system equates to fraud against the Australian people. We should never forget this and as elected representatives we should ensure that we do all we can to reduce if not eliminate voter fraud.  </para><para>We have the greatest democracy on earth yet one of the least enforced systems of voter enrolment. The culture of voter fraud within the Australian Labor Party was highlighted by the Shepherdson inquiry into voter fraud in Queensland in 2001, an inquiry that was initiated by Premier Peter Beattie. The inquiry's report demonstrated just how important it is to maintain the integrity of the electoral roll. In addition, the Commonwealth's Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters also reinforced this viewpoint in their reports <inline font-style="italic">User friendly</inline><inline font-style="italic">,</inline><inline font-style="italic"> not abuser friendly</inline> in May 2001 and <inline font-style="italic">The </inline><inline font-style="italic">integrity of the electoral roll</inline> in October 2002. All three reports made recommendations stating that voters should present some form of valid personal identification when enrolling. Unfortunately, the Labor Party do not support this notion, as it would clamp down on the unrepresentative unions who unfortunately have a stranglehold on their party. In 2002 the Labor Party ignored the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and disallowed regulations in the Senate pertaining to the requirement that citizens present photographic identification at the time of enrolment.</para><para>There are countless examples of electoral fraud being perpetrated by the Australian Labor Party. One needs to look no further than the entrenched culture of voter fraud within that party's division in Queensland. Unfortunately, Labor are still unprepared to clamp down on electoral rorters in their own party. Instead, they continue to entertain the factional warlords that call the shots within the ALP hierarchy. There is a long litany of abuse of the electoral roll and the electoral systems under the watch of the Australian Labor Party. Former Deputy Premier in Queensland, Jim Elder, quit on 22 November 2000, admitting fraudulent enrolments at his home address. He quit the Labor Party on 30 November. Karen Ehrmann, a former Townsville Labor candidate, pleaded guilty to forging party membership forms in an elaborate, illegal branch-stacking exercise in Townsville in the mid-1990s. She previously worked in the office of disgraced former Deputy Premier Jim Elder and was convicted of electoral fraud and jailed for nine months for forgery in August 2000.</para><para>The state member for Springwood, Grant Musgrove, quit parliamentary committee positions on 29 November 2000, admitting he probably engaged in electoral fraud. ALP returning officer, Joan Budd, admitted to posting fraudulent enrolment cards to the Electoral Commission and having her family members cast illegal votes for her husband, the member for Redlands, John Budd. She stated that this was not evidence of electoral rorting but just a family thing. I would beg to seriously disagree that this is just a family thing. This is an Australian thing. This goes to the very heart of the right of the Australian people to have their votes validly recorded.</para><para>The member for Woodridge, Mike Kaiser, quit his position and his party on 10 January 2001, admitting fraudulent enrolment. Mr Kaiser admitted to signing an electoral form used to enrol him in the electorate of South Brisbane in 1986 as part of a branch-stacking exercise, despite the fact that he did not live in the electorate or at the address used. However, his illegal actions have earned him the affection of a number of his federal Labor colleagues, including the member for Jagajaga who said, `He's paid the price and should be given the opportunity to come into a position in the Labor Party and really make available his excellent outstanding campaign skills.' The member for Hotham welcomed Mr Kaiser's ascension as the Labor Party's assistant national secretary. The member for Lilley—the rooster turned saint—also shares union membership of the aptly named Australian Workers Union with Mr Kaiser. Not a bad achievement for a bloke who Peter Beattie previously described as scum. </para><para>Another electoral fraudster, Queensland Labor identity Andy Kehoe, was convicted in 1997 and given a suspended sentence for fraudulent activity when he was numbers man for fellow fraudster, Townsville councillor Shane Foster. Former Wayne Goss staffer, David Barbagallo, pleaded guilty in the District Court to falsely representing to the Electoral Commission in 1986 that a friend lived at a Kangaroo Point address. He was also charged with forging four electoral enrolment forms during a Labor preselection battle 15 years ago. And the list goes on. This litany of fraud and illegal activity does need to be stamped out. It is this type of activity that clearly compromises the steadfast adherence of the great majority of Australian voters to responsible electoral activity. The actions of some individuals within the Queensland Labor Party that I have highlighted are the antithesis of responsible behaviour in a democracy and the very type of behaviour that these bills aim to counter.</para><para>When speaking about the amendments contained in this legislation, particularly in the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Enrolment Integrity and Other Measures) Bill for the requirement for photographic identification to be presented at the time of enrolment, I feel compelled to mention a policy initiative of the Leader of the Opposition. He wants to use a photo identity card for foreign workers in Australia to ensure their employment legitimacy. Amidst the policy-free zone of their national conference earlier this year, the Labor Party managed to inculcate a message to the adoring fans that the Australian Labor Party would somehow be tough on foreign workers.</para><para>The Australian people will believe this when they see it. My message to the Labor Party is: if you can be tough on foreign workers, you can be tough on the factional chieftains and union hacks who treat electorates as their private fiefdoms of power by clamping down on illegal electoral rorts. You should support the government in improving the integrity of the electoral roll by insisting that photographic identification be presented by prospective voters at the time of enrolment. It is a bit rich for the Labor Party to be suggesting greater compliance and identification measures for foreign workers when they themselves have consistently, stridently and arrogantly opposed similar measures to enable strengthening the integrity of the electoral roll which the Howard government have been pursuing since 2001.</para><para>One of the most important aspects of this legislation is that an amendment will ensure proof of identity and address are presented for electors wishing to be placed on the electoral roll. This was one of the major recommendations following the response to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters report on the integrity of the electoral roll. We need to address the current flaws in the management of the Australian electoral roll. Only when we take such measures, only then, will the public trust be recovered to ensure that instances that rocked the Australian Labor Party in Queensland are stamped out, and the circumstances that gave rise to their commencement are dealt with adequately through the amendments contained in these bills. We often hear the example that it is much harder for an individual to enter an RSL club or rent a video from the local video store than it is for a citizen to be placed on the electoral roll. To have this type of glaring inconsistency at the forefront of debate on this legislation is a sure sign that these amendments are absolutely essential to enhance the processes associated with enrolment. </para><para>We have in Australia the greatest democracy in the world. Unlike other parts of the world where elections have become mired in controversy, or some parts of the Arab world where electoral fraud is alive and well, Australia very proudly boasts the proudest of democratic achievements. But there is always room for improvement, and these legislative measures are an historic step towards such improvement. The Australian Electoral Commission can and does do its very best, but if the legislative mechanisms are not in place then fraudulent activity by a small minority cannot be adequately confronted and stamped out. The integrity of the electoral roll is of absolute and paramount importance to effective representation in our democracy.</para><para>In addressing this legislation today, I inform the House that it is just past the second anniversary to the day that the Labor Party used budget day to disallow key regulations related to electoral reform. On budget day 9 May 2002 the Labor Party rejected the government's legislation to require the presentation of identification in order to clamp down on Labor's proven track record of electoral rorts. On this occasion, Labor hoped that its intransigence would be hidden in the hype of the federal budget. That was also the period when the Labor Party was tearing itself apart in a debate about its identity and whether the union movement should have 60 per cent or 40 per cent representation within preselection ballots.</para><para>Regrettably, just as Labor's plan to curb union influence was simply window-dressing, their commitment to improving the integrity of the electoral roll and imposing sensible regulations aimed at stamping out electoral fraud once again proved too difficult for the Labor Party to support. Even prior to this, back in 2001, the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill was described by the member for Rankin as `an abuse of the parliament'. With the member for Rankin coming from Queensland, it is not difficult to see why he would refuse to support a bill that would have tried to clean up the infamous electoral rorts that plagued the Queensland Labor Party in the late 1990s and throughout 2000 and 2001. The examples of electoral fraud I have related to you this afternoon are only the examples we know about.</para><para>To an outsider, the very fact that we are debating the measures contained in this legislation may be curious, to say the least. To have opposition to these measures is even more curious. As legislators it is difficult to oppose these amendments. The requirement that individuals produce photographic identification detailing their home address at the time of enrolment or re-enrolment is hardly burdensome, nor is the amendment to require that the sex and date of birth of electors be disclosed to allow for the checking of one's identity when voting.</para><para>I congratulate the Special Minister of State on his continued persistence in, his interest in and his commitment to improving our electoral systems. I also congratulate the member for Sturt, who chaired the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in their report <inline font-style="italic">User friendly, not abuser friendly</inline> in 2001, and the member for Kooyong, who chaired the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in their report <inline font-style="italic">Integrity of the electoral roll </inline>in 2002. This work has laid the foundations for the debate on this legislation today. </para><para>I reiterate the very critical point that we have a duty as representatives of the Australian people to do all we can to accurately reflect their values, beliefs and concerns. The very basic starting point is to have their voting intention accurately recorded. Legislative loopholes that facilitate voter fraud only dilute the value of real people who actually live at their real address in a particular electorate. To reject these legislative measures is to say to the Australian public, as the Australian Labor Party is now saying, `We don't trust your judgment. We're contemptuous of your democratic right to choose your member of parliament, so we will dilute the value of your vote by allowing inaccurate and fraudulent enrolments.' This is totally unacceptable. I have been a very strong and persistent advocate of the reform of our enrolment system and the stamping out of voter fraud. It is unacceptable that these practices still continue. I am utterly ashamed that the other major party in this parliament continues to oppose these very sensible measures. I commend the bill to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>28639</page.no><name role="metadata">Snowdon, Warren, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SNOWDON</name><name.id>IJ4</name.id><electorate>Lingiari</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am not sure that the previous speaker, the member for Indi, is aware of the Labor Party's position on any of this legislation as she saunters out of the chamber. Frankly, I know that she is not. The shadow minister for finance, Mr McMullan, who spoke on behalf of the Labor Party in the chamber earlier, made it very clear that the Labor Party regard the <inline ref="R2029">Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Access to Electoral Roll and Other Measures) Bill 2004</inline> as largely uncontroversial legislation and we will be supporting the measures of the bill, which were, as I understand it, recommended by the bipartisan report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters after the 2001 election. The other piece of legislation, however—the <inline ref="R2030">Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Enrolment Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2004</inline>—is a different story. It is very disappointing indeed. Many of its components fly in the face of the recommendations of the joint standing committee and, in my view, are, as we have seen on repeated occasions in this chamber, a thinly veiled attempt by the government to disenfranchise people who they believe might not otherwise support them.</para></talk.start><para>I take this matter very seriously indeed. I will come to the reasons for my concern in a moment. What we need to understand about this bill is that it will actively disenfranchise many Australians, particularly young Australians, by stopping them from voting by closing the electoral roll as soon as the election is called. The bill also seeks to raise the disclosure threshold for political donations from $1,500 to $3,000. Why? I would have thought it was in the public's interest to ensure that every political donation of a reasonable size is disclosed and publicly acknowledged—that everyone understands, with the greatest transparency available to any of us, who made donations to which political party and for what purpose.</para><para>The bill proposes a complete removal of voting rights for prisoners, which is a major concern of mine. But of particular interest—and this is the area that makes me most agitated—are the measures that seek to make it harder for disadvantaged people to exercise their right to vote. That will have a particular impact upon the voters of my own electorate and upon other Indigenous people around Australia.</para><para>We know that this is not a new debate. These proposals have been before us previously and have been rejected previously. There is no doubt that the government is going to be persistent and will continue to put these sets of proposals forward in the hope that somehow or other the opposition, the minor parties and the Independents in the other place will wilt. Let me just make it very clear: in relation to those matters which actively seek to disenfranchise people, there will be no wilting of the opposition. Let that be very clear. Let there be no misunderstanding about our desire to ensure that all Australians, if they are of eligible age, are enrolled and vote. </para><para>We know that the integrity of the roll and the process of voting is based on these two basic elements: the right to be enrolled and the right to vote. It is on these areas that I believe the government should focus its reform. As we know already from previous contributions, the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters noted that electoral fraud was actually a relatively small problem. Its finding on multiple voting, outlined in chapter 4, was as follows:</para><quote><para>The number of apparent fraudulent multiple votes in the 2001 federal election was low, and the Committee accepts the AEC's assertion that these cases do not illustrate a pattern of concentrated multiple voting in particular Divisions.</para></quote><para>A far greater problem is the underenrolment of young Australians, homeless persons, people in remote communities and particularly Indigenous Australians who live in remote communities. Rather than address these problems, the government has sought—through the proposals which it is putting through in this second piece of legislation—to thwart the opportunities for young Australians and others to be enrolled and has sought to use every mean trick that it can connive to prevent people casting a valid vote.</para><para>I have been a witness to this sort of caper for almost 30 years, and I have seen—in a particular Western Australian state election—the absolute abuse of process by the Western Australian Liberal Party in a seat in the Kimberley in the mid-seventies. Not content with having people on the roll, the Liberal Party used every mean-spirited trick they could come up with to prevent Indigenous people from voting.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>7K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Entsch, Warren, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>IJ4</name.id><name role="metadata">Snowdon, Warren, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SNOWDON</name></talker><para>—The member laughs.

Hypocrisy knows no bounds, and the member opposite knows that only too well.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Let me just go to the bill and ask a couple of fundamental questions. The bill proposes the closure of the rolls at 6 p.m. on the day of issue of writs for new enrolments and 8 p.m. three days later for transfers. Think about it. If you live in Canberra close to a post office or even an electoral office and the writs are issued, you can thump down to the post office or the electoral office, get an enrolment form and, if you are lucky enough to have the appropriate ID, fill it out or have a witness to help you. You can carry out your obligations and enrol to vote by slipping in your enrolment form. What happens if you live in Kintore in my electorate, where the post comes maybe twice weekly and where invariably you will not have access to an enrolment form, no matter who you are? How are you meant to get on the roll? I am surprised that The Nationals cop this rubbish, because it does not only impact upon Indigenous voters—imagine a pastoral family living up on the Barkly Tableland or, dare I say, in Cape York in North Queensland.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>7K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Entsch, Warren, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>IJ4</name.id><name role="metadata">Snowdon, Warren, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SNOWDON</name></talker><para>—Oh, they don't have a problem with it? The election is called, they are not on the roll and they live somewhere up near Kowanyama. How do they get on the roll before 6 o'clock that afternoon? Answer me that question. Even if they are keen to get on the roll, how do they get on the roll? This purposely sets out to disenfranchise a class of Australians whom this government has chosen to ignore, who this government chooses to say should not have access to the rights of every other Australian—the right to enrol to vote and the right to vote on voting day. That is the impact of this. </para></talk.start></continue><para>In my own electorate of Lingiari, around 46 per cent or 47 per cent of the voters are Indigenous. Many live in very, very remote communities, some in small out-stations. In a very cynical move in 1996, what did this government do when it was first elected? One of its very first acts as the government, after the election in 1996, was to abolish the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Electoral Information Service—an obvious, cynical attempt by John Howard, the Prime Minister of this country, to reduce Indigenous participation in our democracy. That is what it was about. It was done for crude, base political reasons: as the member opposite, the member for Leichhardt, knows, in many parts of Australia Indigenous people—surprise, surprise!—do not support the government. </para><para>The Australian Electoral Commission had a very high regard for this program. When the Electoral Commissioner, Mr Andy Becker, was asked about the government's abolition of the program during Senate estimates in February 2001, he said:</para><quote><para>I think it was a very good program—an excellent program, in fact. But there was a funding commitment, and with the reduction of those funds we just did not have the resources to be able to maintain it.</para></quote><para>When he was asked about the impact of losing the program he said this:</para><quote><para>We do expect some drop-off in continuous enrolments, of course, because we have not got people in the field the whole time. What we have found in the past, when we have gone out for the three events that we have had since 1996, is that there has been a reduction in the enrolment—</para></quote><para>that is, the enrolment of Indigenous people. That is what the government wanted. I know the Electoral Commission officers in the Northern Territory for the division of Lingiari and indeed the division of Solomon—and I am sure this is true across Australia—are assiduous in, where they can, promoting enrolment and getting people on the roll, because that is what they should be doing. They do it where they can. But they are severely underresourced for that purpose, let alone for any element of providing education to assist people to understand the voting system and their obligations once they are enrolled.</para><para>The closure of the rolls affects that group of people. It also affects young Australians. We heard the member for Cunningham talk about a letter that he received—I received the same letter—from the Youth Action and Policy Association. They argue, I think very persuasively, that this bill will effectively exclude thousands of young people from voting, for the very reason that they will not have been on the roll and they will not have got themselves onto the roll prior to six o'clock on the day the writs are issued. That, in my view, is something this government should be thinking about for no other reason than to ensure that these young Australians, who will be the leaders of our country, are on the electoral roll when they turn 18 and that, when voting day comes around, they are out there to vote. Why don't they think about that? The fact is that they do not want them to vote. It is about time we had a bit of honesty in these discussions.</para><para>Similarly, there are the proposals to limit the opportunities for prisoners to vote. Does it surprise you to understand that this will have a disproportionate effect upon the Indigenous population of Australia? Why is that the case? Very simply, the Australian prison population is composed of a substantially disproportionate number of Indigenous prisoners. Prisoner disenfranchisement therefore has a disproportionate effect on Indigenous Australians. Indigenous persons are 16 times more likely to be imprisoned than non-Indigenous persons. The representation of Indigenous persons among Australian prisoners increased from 15 per cent in 1993 to 20 per cent in 2003. On 30 June 2003 there were 1,173 Indigenous people serving sentences of five years or more and hence falling within the current disenfranchisement provisions. If the proposed amendment had been put into effect then, the number of Indigenous persons affected would have been 3,747. </para><para>Let me go to my own electorate to highlight again the disproportionate impact this will have on the Indigenous population. Eighty per cent of the Northern Territory's prison population are Indigenous people. They comprise around 30 per cent of the population in the Northern Territory. This is proof positive of a very cynical attempt by this government to disenfranchise Indigenous Australians, albeit a class of Indigenous Australians who are incarcerated. I think the shadow minister, Mr McMullan, has elucidated very clearly our concerns about that process. </para><para>The other issue I am concerned about is the attempt to prevent Indigenous Australians in particular and also people who require assistance, by restricting who can assist impaired voters. Again this is targeted. We understand that this is all about targeting. It is about disenfranchisement, about stopping people voting—stopping people exercising their democratic rights in this country. The people they are targeting—and this is being promoted by the Country Liberal Party in the Northern Territory—are Indigenous Australians who require assistance at the voting booth.</para><para>As Mr McMullan said today, the fundamental right of Australians to cast their vote in private, free from interference and coercion, is a basic tenet of our society. As a general principle, the opposition believes that a person's right to a free and fair vote should be the paramount motivation instructing any legislation, with the needs of the political parties—whether they are Labor, Democrats, Liberal, The Nationals or CLP—of secondary importance. If proposed changes to the Electoral Act compromise this paramount right of the voter then these changes should be discarded. That is what this proposal will do. It will compromise this paramount right. We believe that the current provisions of the Electoral Act are fair and preserve the secrecy of the person's vote. They do not compromise the voter's rights or the functioning of busy polling booths. The AEC does not support the government's proposed changes to the Electoral Act. It believes the current system works well.</para><para>Currently, the voter has all the say in who assists them. Appropriately, the voter is free to choose someone they trust, without limitations. This sort of delegation is not unusual under Australian law. This should be the right that we want to preserve: the right of the voter. What we should be ensuring is that every person over the age of 18 in this country who is a citizen is enrolled to vote and that we do everything we possibly can to ensure that they can cast a secret ballot on voting day, not limit them as this government seeks to do. This piece of legislation, in terms of those amendments which the government seeks to put, are an indictment because they are aimed fairly and squarely at compromising the democratic system within which we live and undermining the rights of some Australians to participate in our democracy as voting citizens. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>28643</page.no><name role="metadata">Cadman, Alan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CADMAN</name><name.id>SD4</name.id><electorate>Mitchell</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—For a member of the Australian parliament to come in here and say that nobody should think about registering to vote until an election is called is irresponsible. That is what the member for Lingiari was promoting. He was saying, `There are people who need not register. I do not mind if they do not register. As a member of the Australian parliament I will encourage them not to register until an election is called, then we must give them weeks in which they can register.' I find that repugnant. It is our responsibility, at all times, in every place possible, to encourage Australians to register to poll. It is our responsibility, and the Australian Electoral Commission is out there in schools, in shopping centres and at naturalisation ceremonies, encouraging people to register to vote. The AEC is a very responsible group of people which runs an education program to inform the community of its responsibilities and privileges in being able to cast votes, and yet we have a member of the Australian parliament saying that we do not have to do that. He is saying that for three years they can go to sleep—18-year-olds do not have to be registered; people do not have to notify changes of address; and, in fact, the electoral roll can go to pot and only when an election is called should people be given an opportunity to register to vote. I think that is irresponsible. To advocate that people adopt an irresponsible, do not care, do not want to be registered attitude to voting sets a bad example for the people the member claims to represent.</para></talk.start><para>It is very well for the member for Lingiari to this attitude does not really affect things but what about the territory elections? What about the common roll local government elections? What about ATSIC elections? What about all of those elections for unions and for every other form of life that depends on the Australian electoral roll? The Australian electoral roll is a very precious and important commodity and its being accurate and up to date is a critical factor in the democratic operation of many organisations. The member for Lingiari seems to indicate that you do not worry about the accuracy of the roll except when a federal election is called. I would like to put to the House that there is a bit of self-interest there and it is only his election that really matters. What he is putting to the House is that it is only the way in which those communities can vote for him that really matters. That is irresponsible. That is not a law-abiding process with regard to the electoral roll and the need to encourage people to take part in our democracy at every opportunity that arises—whether it is at a state, territory, ATSIC, union or any other election. Anything that is dependent upon the electoral roll should be used to encourage people to register to vote at the earliest opportunity—the moment they change address or the moment they become eligible through naturalisation, by coming out of prison or by turning 18. If any of those factors for eligibility occur, we should endorse, encourage and promote registing to vote. I would like to see every member of parliament adopt a different attitude from that which has just been expressed by the representative of the Australian Labor Party.</para><para>With regard to the programs that are conducted by the AEC, I know that in my area the Australian Electoral Commission is in the high schools talking to 17-year-olds, encouraging them to register in time. I know that the AEC is at every naturalisation ceremony with cards waiting to sign people up. They are promoting a thing that is very precious to Australians and, yet, according to the member for Lingiari, we want to adopt a laissez faire attitude to the privilege of voting. I do not endorse that. People have three years between federal elections to enrol to vote. They have many other opportunities to exercise their right to vote and they should adopt a responsible attitude and be encouraged by their members, by their representatives, to register to vote as soon as they can. It seems that there is a dilemma in the Australian Labor Party between the old adage of `Vote early and vote often,' and `Not vote at all' or `Vote when I tell you you can.' It seems to me that there is a conflict of issues there in the Australian Labor Party and we want to see a greater responsibility expressed by the members opposite, because they seem to run away from what is an accurate roll. </para><para>I remind the House that the legislation we are discussing today refers to changes to the electoral and referendum bills and the laws that govern elections and referendums. The proposals that we have before us are within the <inline ref="R2030">Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Enrolment Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2004</inline> and the<inline ref="R2030"></inline><inline ref="R2029">Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Access to Electoral Roll and Other Measures) Bill 2004</inline>. I will deal first of all with enrolment integrity. By going through the bill in detail, those interested in elections will gather that there are significant and important integrity measures that the government is seeking to put in place—measures that people without any political bias would think are reasonable and without prejudice, yet they are being opposed by the Australian Labor Party.</para><para>There is a provision in the bill for voting information. This would allow senators or members of the House of Representatives who are not members of a registered political party to obtain information, on request and without charge, about where electors voted at an election. That is a commonplace thing. Another provision of the bill is an amendment so that information—including the names and addresses of electors who voted at an election, whether each elector voted at a polling place or by other means, whether the elector voted at a polling place in the division for which they were enrolled and the location of the polling place—can be provided to registered political parties and independent members of parliament. That is a reasonable process to let us know where a person has voted and if they voted. Prior to this, the electoral roll and where people voted was a matter only for the AEC and nobody could access it. This brings into the open and allows public scrutiny of whether a person has voted many times and whether they are who the say they are. It also allows for the objection process to be followed carefully. This lets people know who voted and where they voted, which is a reasonable proposition.</para><para>Another proposal in this legislation is proof of identity for people registering to vote. It is easier to register to vote than it is to get a card for the local video store. You have to have three forms of identity to entitle you to take out a $5 video overnight. Yet for the electoral roll, all we require is somebody to sign a piece of paper to say that the elector is known to them and that they live at that address. They do not have to have any particular status. There is no identity process except to sign a paper to say that a person lives at the address. This opens the electoral roll to the possibility of fraud. We are saying that if a person is going to apply for registration on the electoral roll, they ought to produce their drivers licence as there is a photograph on it and the Australian Electoral Commission will know that the person seeking registration is who they say they are. It is a simple identity test.</para><para>The most precious thing an Australian has is their citizenship and the right to vote, and yet we make it so easy for people to go on the electoral roll without proof of identity. I think that is appalling. We ought to value that right more. It is an easy way of identifying people for them to front up and say, `Here is my photograph and drivers licence.' Of course, the response will be that not everybody drives. The Commonwealth government is going to work with state and territory governments on other forms of identification for people who do not have drivers licences. I would hope that proof of identity is something that the states and territories, because they share the roll, would make sure they endorse so that they can say, `We have a roll that we think is worth supporting, and it is well kept by Commonwealth officials.' </para><para>Proof of identity is something that has worried me greatly ever since the loss of the electorate of Macquarie in an election I participated in, and the way that that was manipulated by Graham Richardson, the head of the Labor Party in New South Wales at that time. The way in which that was manipulated was shocking. The former member Mr Alasdair Webster took the matter to the court of review on his own account and was sure of an outcome in his favour, but when his legal bill hit $300,000 he decided that he would withdraw. It is very expensive for a normal person to appeal a situation of rorting and fraud. One of the areas of great concern during that election was the way in which people were able to go on the electoral roll, in the last couple of hours before the polls started, without any proof of identity. Nobody knew who they were or where they lived. Some of the claimed addresses when checked were found to be vacant blocks of land and streets with no houses. I checked those addresses myself and know that they were fraudulent, yet that election went through. It was contested in the court of disputed returns but was not able to be finalised because of a lack of funds of the former member. This is one way of rectifying that. It is a way that I agree with, and it is a sensible way—pull out your wallet and show your drivers licence to prove that you are who you say you are. I know that there are many people in this House, and Mr Deputy Speaker Causley I suspect that you are one, who would agree that proof of identity when registering to go on the electoral roll is a sensible thing. We want people to vote, but we want people who have an entitlement and are properly identified to vote. </para><para>There is a proposal that prisoners should not vote—that is, anybody who has been imprisoned or indicted for an offence for five years or more, not for a casual overnight stay—and that is reasonable. If you are going to show such a neglect to society that you commit crimes that put you in prison for more than five years, you deserve not to vote. If any person ignores the laws of our nation to the extent that they commit an act that causes imprisonment for five years or more, they should have their voting rights taken away. </para><para>Just think of the consequences if that did not happen. If we follow it through and say that there were to be changes to certain laws which brought about my imprisonment, who would I vote for? I would vote for the person who was going to change the law that put me in prison, no matter what the crime was that I committed. Therefore, mine would be a prejudiced vote. I would want a change to the law that would allow me to continue my illegal activity. Prisoners ought to have that right taken away from them after five years of imprisonment. I think it is perfectly reasonable that the controller-general of prisons in each state will be required to forward to the Electoral Commission each year the names of those people who are in full-time detention.</para><para>There are other changes to enrolment in respect of voters' addresses in this legislation. Too many people have been enrolling—and I think that every member of parliament is aware of this—giving a post-office box number. They could be living anywhere in Australia. They could be nowhere near the electorate they are seeking to vote in by giving a post-office box. We are requiring with these changes that a person actually lives at the address where they say that they are going to vote. That is a reasonable proposition. It is no good saying that people living in a marginal seat can adopt a post-office box in one of the towns or suburbs in that electorate and say that they live in that electorate; there must be proof that they actually live within that subdivision where they are seeking to vote. </para><para>In doing so, they must demonstrate that they have lived there for one month. If they change their address within that subdivision, they are required to give notification of that change within 21 days after the expiry of one month of living at that address. That is a reasonable proposition. `I am now no longer living at a certain street address; I have changed my address,' must be the proposition that they put to the Australian Electoral Commission so that the rolls are kept accurate and up to date.</para><para>I hope that I will see the day when there is an absolute acceptance of the processes of the Commonwealth act across the board. The confusion at the recent local government elections in New South Wales was created by subdivisional voting. It caused chaos and anger as people went to vote at a polling place that they were unfamiliar with, were told that they were at the wrong polling place and had to drive some distance to another polling place in order to have their name marked off as having voted in the local government elections. That is crazy. We ought to have a consistent law so that people become accustomed to voting at a certain place and go there to vote whether it is a state, local or federal government election and so that the roll they vote on is consistent. I see no problem with doing that. I wish that the government of New South Wales would see sense and change their own laws and those applying to local government so that there is absolute consistency between where people vote—that is, the voting places—and the subdivisional arrangements.</para><para>The transfer of enrolment is compulsory in this bill. A previous member was arguing that people should only be forced to notify the authorities of their change of address when an election is called. I think that is rubbish. There is a compulsory transfer requirement in these changes that a person must, within 21 days after the expiry of one month of living at a new address, notify that change. There is also a provision for silent voters. These are the voters that, due to their occupation or profession, should not have their address notified publicly. They may be judges of the Family Court or police officers. There is a range of people who should not have their private addresses notified. There is a silent address provision in the bill, but there is also an objection process so that if anybody is using this for shonky purposes and they are claiming to live at a silent address but have changed their address and are no longer there—and the only people who would know that would be the Australian Electoral Commission—they can be removed from that roll.</para><para>The main objections to enrolment that a person or an official can lodge under these changes that we are making is on the grounds that the elector no longer lives at their enrolled address and has not lived at their enrolled address for a period of at least one month. That is perfectly reasonable. What does that mean in a political sense? It will often mean that political parties will do street canvasses and check out whether people are living at the addresses they say they are. That roll cleansing process is just a checking up process to make sure people have not moved and failed inadvertently to notify of their address or, worse, maintained an address for a political advantage in a certain street or a certain suburb so that they can boost their party's election chances. That roll cleansing process will assist in making sure that people who are not living at their enrolled address can under notification and proof be removed from the electoral roll. </para><para>Another factor that comes into play here is the provisional vote. When you or I, Mr Deputy Speaker, go along to the polling booth and find we are no longer on the roll, we can claim, `There has been a mistake here. I insist that I vote.' There are certain conditions within this legislation that we are debating that restrict our right to say that. If somebody is living in another state and they are not on the roll when they go to vote, their right of objection is removed because they should have notified the authorities of their change of address prior to that. There is a provision here that, if you have moved a few streets away within the same electorate, the provisional vote can be taken. I think these amendments are sensible—they clean up the roll and they stop some of the possibilities of rorts. The Australian Labor Party should be supporting every measure. These measures are sensible, they are well thought through and they are not politically motivated; they are just going to make a better roll.<inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>28647</page.no><name role="metadata">Danby, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DANBY</name><name.id>WF6</name.id><electorate>Melbourne Ports</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Sadly, but not surprisingly, the <inline ref="R2029">Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Access to Electoral Roll and Other Measures) Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2030">Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Enrolment Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2004</inline> represent the sum total of the government's agenda on electoral reform. They do not contain anything about fixed terms, four-year terms or any of the things that really should be considered by a government concerned with democratic reform in Australia.</para></talk.start><para>The enrolment bill has some controversial recommendations which are completely against the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, of which I am the deputy chair and which the government chairs. I want to outline these controversial recommendations to the House. These government proposals would disenfranchise many young Australians by closing the electoral roll as soon as the election is called. They would institute a bureaucratic and unmanageable electoral enrolment regime, which would confuse people and would not deter electoral fraud. They would also raise the disclosure level for political donations from $1,500 to $3,000.</para><para>Let me deal firstly with the government's proposal to close the roll as soon as the election is called. This would disenfranchise people, according not only to me but also to the nonpartisan Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. When in 1983 Malcolm Fraser closed the roll in the manner that the government is proposing in this bill, it was estimated that 150,000 people lost their right to vote. With a federal election coming up, one can understand that the government is anxious that younger people and people who have not advised the electoral office of a transfer of address do not have the right to vote. This is precisely the same kind of rort that was being thought of in 1983. </para><para>Currently the rolls are left open for seven days after the writs are issued. The government proposes to close the roll immediately for new enrolments and leave it open for only three days for transfers. Again, this government proposal is against the recommendation of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. Closing the roll as soon as an election is called and not allowing any new enrolments would disenfranchise about 80,000 new enrollees at each election, mostly young Australians as well as people who have moved but not advised the AEC. Seventeen-year-olds and other young people who have not previously voted do not have as the first thing on their minds enrolling for a forthcoming election. It is quite reasonable that they are given a few days notice, as soon as an election is called, and many quite responsibly then put themselves on the electoral roll. There is a very high turnover of voter addresses in my seat of Melbourne Ports, and seats like mine, which have a very high turnover of people who live in apartments or flats, would be significantly affected. </para><para>The proposed enrolment witnessing scheme goes further than the recent unanimous recommendation of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. The committee unanimously agreed to a regime where a person could enrol without a witness, provided they gave their drivers licence details or another form of acceptable identification. If the enrollee did not have such ID, the committee recommended that two enrolled witnesses could verify the enrolment. The committee's recommendation explicitly stated:</para><quote><para>... the Committee does not consider it necessary that the witness be within a specified class of people.</para></quote><para>However, the explanatory memorandum for the bill states:</para><quote><para>Where no identification documentation was available, only people in a prescribed class would be able to provide written references supporting an enrolment application.</para></quote><para>The effect of this again is to limit the democratic franchise. In my view, these government bills are measures deliberately framed to knock out votes that the government perceives would be antagonistic. The ID-checking measures will require close cooperation with the states, yet surprisingly to date there has been no consultation with the states over issues such as data access arrangements and security, and draft regulations have not been circulated. Given the importance of regulations, how could parliament responsibly pass this measure without even a draft set of regulations being circulated? I notice that the previous speaker, the member for Mitchell, is leaving the room, but he did not address this in his remarks.</para><para>One might think that such a radical change to electoral enrolment was a response to a crisis of some kind. However, this is not the case. The Auditor-General's report <inline font-style="italic">The integrity of the electoral roll</inline>, released on 18 April 2002, found the electoral roll is more than 96 per cent accurate and is of `high integrity'. The Australian voting procedures at election time are probably world's best practice in democratic robustness. We certainly have no butterfly ballots in Australia. We do not have different voting procedures and machines as they do in the United States. The changes to the electoral legislation that are being proposed here are all based on a false assumption that electoral fraud is a major issue in Australia. There is very little evidence that this is in fact the case. When you are doing something like this, every measure needs to take into consideration a cost-benefit analysis. If a measure disenfranchises 80,000 genuine voters and only reduces fraud by half-a-dozen voters, in my view and the opposition's view it is clearly not worth it.</para><para>My electorate of Melbourne Ports will be particularly affected by this provision. More than one in 10 residents in my electorate are tertiary students, who are often renting with friends and in shifting accommodation. Every year thousands of school leavers become eligible to vote. Of course they should enrol as soon as they are eligible to do so, but as we know, and as I said before, 18-year-olds do not have enrolment for forthcoming elections at the front of their minds. But they can exercise that responsibility within the five days normally given to them to do that. It is reasonable to have a small window of opportunity between the issuing of the writ and the closing of the roll to allow them, and many other people, to enrol to vote. By closing this window the government is deliberately disenfranchising hundreds of voters in my electorate, and in electorates right around the country, presumably because it assumes that they will all vote for the opposition if they get the chance. </para><para>The measures proposed by the government deliberately ignore the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. They are another sign that the government is preparing for an election. They are a sign that the government is using unfair measures to try to replicate what happened in 1983, when 150,000 voters were denied the right to participate in the forthcoming election. What kind of a government is it that proposes, against the recommendations of its own electoral committee, that 80,000 young Australians will not be able to vote if it changes the enrolment period?</para><para>The government should give young people in Australia the opportunity to have five days, as they always have had, to enrol to vote. Any measure taken by it to reduce this period and to close off the opportunity for young people particularly to enrol to vote is an attempt to disenfranchise them. I can assure you that this will rebound on the government as young people become aware of this measure. I am sure it will be rejected in the Senate. This is something that the government does, against the recommendations of its own committees, every now and again. These matters will become known all round Australia and will rebound in the government's face as young people rise up in revolt against this government's attempt to disenfranchise them. It is a disgraceful idea to close the rolls without any notice. Eighteen-year-olds deserve the right to vote as much as anyone else, and we should be taking every measure that we can in a democratic parliament like this to widen the franchise, not to restrict it. Therefore, this proposal to close the enrolment period on the day that the writs are issued and give no five-day period of grace to 18-year-olds is a democratic disgrace.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

There is currently a worldwide shortage of Prevnar as a result of production upgrades at Wyeth's facilities in the United States.

There were 56,200 new jobs created in Australia in April, and 43,300 of those were full-time jobs. The good outcome in April follows hard on the heels of the excellent result in March. Significantly, there was an increase in the participation rate. In other words, because of the strength of the labour market and the confidence of people, more Australians are seeking work and the participation rate rose from 63.7 per cent to 63.9 per cent. As a consequence, despite predictions that there might be a slight rise, the unemployment rate held steady at 5.6 per cent.</para></talk.start><para>As I have said to the House very frequently, for the first time since 1968 this country has the golden double of inflation below three per cent and unemployment below six per cent. But the real message in these figures is that they are the product of good economic management. We have low unemployment in Australia because the coalition over the last eight years has run the Australian economy effectively, responsibly and efficiently. The warning in these figures, as in so many other things, is that if the management of the Australian economy were handed over to less competent people, if it were handed over to people who believe in going into debt, running big budget deficits and, importantly, putting the trade union movement back in charge of the workplaces of Australia, if the economy were handed over to the Labor Party, which believes in reregulating the labour market, you would again see unemployment going up, just as you would see budget deficits reappearing and high interest rates returning. We have been able to achieve low interest rates, lower unemployment and the repayment of $70 billion of debt that we inherited from the former government because of good economic policy. It has not been a fluke. It has not been an accident. The economy in Australia is not on automatic pilot, and if the drivers change the economy will change, unemployment will go up again, debt will go up again and interest rates will rise.

Knowing the way in which the Australian Labor Party has been sloppy with facts over the last couple of days, I will not confirm them on the basis of the say-so of the member for Fraser. But what I will say is that the advertising of government programs did not begin with this government. I well remember Mr Bill Hunter being paid very large sums of money to appear on Australian television. I well remember advertising of the One Nation program on television. I well remember the super guarantee—where you watered a plant and the plant grew in front of your eyes—appearing on television.</para></talk.start><para>Over the next few weeks this government will make known to the Australian public family assistance benefits which they are entitled to receive and are entitled to benefit from, and we will do it for this reason: if the public is unaware of the benefits to which they are entitled, they can hardly apply for them. It is part of administering the government to actually know your entitlements in order to receive them.</para><para>I will make one final comment in relation to this. I do think one thing has dramatically changed in relation to government advertising. Beginning in New South Wales and now extending to Victoria, for the first time in my memory, state Labor governments have taken it upon themselves to go into television advertising against the Commonwealth, and they have done that in order to try to make out that in some way they have been financially penalised. Not only is that false, but the Australian Labor Party, which would have you believe in this chamber that it is against advertising, is supporting the most political advertising you have seen through its state governments, at least in New South Wales and Victoria. </para><para>We will not allow that to go unanswered. You cannot allow false advertising to go up on the television screens, such as that you saw from Premier Carr and you are seeing from Premier Bracks at the moment. You particularly cannot allow that to occur when every single state government is now receiving a bonus from the GST over and above the amount they would have received under the old tax system. Eight Labor state and territory governments are now in a bonus position. Having done the hard work to put into practice those arrangements, we say to each and every one of those state governments that that money should be spent on better services. Instead of running down their services, the state Labor governments should be building up the services and properly spending that GST revenue.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Employment: Statistics</title><page.no>28652</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>28652</page.no><name role="metadata">Cadman, Alan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CADMAN</name><name.id>SD4</name.id><electorate>Mitchell</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is addressed to the Treasurer.

I can inform the House that the labour force figures for the month of April showed unemployment continuing at 23-year lows of 5.6 per cent. In particular, in the month of April there were 56,000 new jobs created in the Australian economy and, of those, 43,000 were full-time jobs. That brings to 1.3 million the number of new jobs created since the government was elected. There are 1.3 million more people in work today after eight years of coalition government than was the case when the Labor Party was thrown out of office.</para></talk.start><para>The second thing that I think is particularly significant is that this is an unemployment rate below six per cent for eight consecutive months. The last time we had an unemployment rate below six per cent for eight months or more was January 1981, when unemployment was below six per cent for 10 months in a row. If unemployment were to equal that, the performance at the current time would be matched only by going even further back, into the seventies, to try to find a period of sustained employment like we have at the moment.</para><para>What are the factors that have led to this result? As the Prime Minister said, they are: balanced budgets, low debt, the repayment of $70 billion of Labor's Commonwealth debt, locking in low inflation under an inflation agreement with the Reserve Bank, the structural reform of Australia's taxation system, the cutting of the company tax rate, the introduction of full dividend imputation, halving of the capital gains tax, abolition of financial institutions duty, abolition of the wholesale sales tax, removing taxes from exports, taking bed taxes off for the tourist industry, taking stamp duties off marketable securities and putting Commonwealth-state financial relations on a secure footing.

You certainly do not hear any of the state Labor governments, which are now all enjoying GST windfalls, talking about roll-back. But there is one thing in particular that Australia could do to improve job prospects for those that are still out of work. It is not something that just this side of the House talks about; it is something that the IMF talks about, that the OECD talks about. In all the economic studies done on unemployment around the world, there is one feature in those economies which are more flexible and have better outcomes—that is, flexibility of hiring and flexibility against unfair dismissal laws. It is noticed, particularly in studies in Europe, that the more difficult the unfair dismissal laws are, the less flexibility there is in relation to hiring, the higher the unemployment rate. Unfair dismissal laws make employers employment-averse; they do not want to run the risk of putting on labour, being caught in a downturn and being unable to adjust their labour force accordingly. We have put to the Senate unfair dismissal law reforms that have now been defeated 41 times by the Australian Labor Party. The Australian Labor Party could do something for Australia by getting out of the way and by allowing those laws to pass so that more people in Australia can have work. </para></talk.start></continue></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Budget 2004-05</title><page.no>28653</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>28653</page.no><name role="metadata">Gillard, Julia, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GILLARD</name><name.id>83L</name.id><electorate>Lalor</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Prime Minister.

It delivered $19 billion of assistance to families, it cut income taxes across the forward estimates by $4.7 billion and it introduced a new superannuation incentive of $2.7 billion which is available to all employees up to an income cut-off of $58,000. What is more, it is fully funded and it enables the Australian budget to stay in surplus over the forward estimates.</para></talk.start><para>The Australian Labor Party, and in particular the Leader of the Opposition, have been promising for some time that they would lay out their own tax plan this week. When he was asked by Jon Faine, `So you would change the bracket limits? The thresholds?' the Leader of the Opposition said, `You will find these things out in budget week and the debate that will be had then.' Tonight, obviously, the Leader of the Opposition plans to announce his tax package, because he has been so critical of the government's, including his criticism that the government did not allow his family an income tax cut—a rather curious criticism which he made yesterday.</para><para>The Leader of the Opposition has encouraged newspapers today to speculate on the size of his tax cuts. The <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> promised us that Labor would `rush to trump' those tax cuts, meaning that his tax cuts would be larger. The <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> today told us that Latham's tax cuts will be bigger than the government's tax cuts. So, tonight, what we have been led to believe we will get, and what those newspapers will demand, is the income tax thresholds, the rates, the costings and how they will be paid for. That is what the Australian people deserve, isn't it? You would not expect the Labor Party to be opportunist enough to oppose what the government has proposed, promise that they would put forward their own tax plan and then dingo out in the budget reply.</para><para>The other thing I want to say about these tax cuts—after they have been announced tonight by the Leader of the Opposition—is of course they will have to be paid for. Let me just make this point: when you are looking for savings to pay for tax cuts, it is savings against the forward estimates. You cannot save something if it is not expenditure in the forward estimates; it has to actually be in the forward estimates if you are to save against it. Some of the so-called savings that the Australian Labor Party have put forward are not even in the forward estimates. Let me give an example. One of them, they say, is that they will not proceed with choice for public servants in relation to superannuation— </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5I4</name.id><name role="metadata">McMullan, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McMullan</name></talker><para>—That's long gone.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>CT4</name.id><name role="display">Mr COSTELLO</name></talker><para>—It is long gone, the member for Fraser says. All right; we will take that one. That was actually the largest one they had left, and that is long gone! Good. We agree on that. That was $780 million and it is long gone. Of the only other two that I can actually find that are still on the table of these savings—and no doubt we will be enlightened tonight—one is that they are going to abolish the employee entitlement scheme GEERS. That is not really true. They are going to keep the scheme but, instead of funding it from the budget, it is going to be funded with a new payroll tax. So that is fair enough; they have got money from the new payroll tax which they can spend tonight. The only other one that I can find, which was announced, I believe—of all things—in the higher education package, is that they are going to reduce the diesel rebate for the mining industry. I believe the reduction in the rebate is from 100 per cent to 90 per cent. One thing to call a reduction in a rebate is a saving; another is to call it a new tax, because what that means is you pay the excise and you only get a rebate of 90 per cent instead of 100 per cent.</para></talk.start></continue><para>So we are now down to the situation where there are no savings on superannuation, which happened to be the opposition's largest saving, and there are two things left which are designed to pay for tax cuts—and have a guess what they are: they are both tax rises. One is a payroll tax and the other is an excise tax. So we are down to a situation where the Labor Party, even if they were to reallocate both of those amounts, would not in fact be cutting taxes; what they would be doing would be changing taxes—changing them from excise and changing them from payroll—into the income tax cuts which they presumably are going to announce tonight. The only thing I say is, if Labor want to be an alternative government, they have got to be able to withstand scrutiny, and tonight is the night when this can be announced. Let us put it out there, let us have the opportunity to analyse it and let us know, most of all, how it is being funded.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Budget 2004-05</title><page.no>28655</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>28655</page.no><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name><name.id>DT4</name.id><electorate>Hotham</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Treasurer: does the Treasurer recall that he and his Prime Minister, before every election, have promised not to introduce new taxes or to increase existing taxes?

I can only assume that he is softening us up for some announcements which he proposes to make tonight. As far as this government is concerned, since this government came to office there has been no increase in the income tax; in fact, it has been cut. There has been no increase in the wholesale sales tax; in fact, it has been abolished. There has been no increase in the company tax; in fact, it has been reduced. There has been no increase in the capital gains tax; in fact, it has been halved. In this budget, in relation to wine equalisation tax, an exemption was given. In relation to the petrol excise, Labor's indexation was abolished. In fact, if that had not been done, the price of petrol, I am led to believe, would be 5c a litre higher today than it actually is. This government has not increased taxes. This government has abolished some, reduced others and changed the thresholds in relation to the remainder.</para></talk.start><para>Since we are on the business of increasing taxes, we all recall—and I cannot get away without recalling it, because it does bring back to mind the last time Labor won an election—that the last time Labor won an election in this country was in 1993. During that election, Labor campaigned on the basis of opposing a GST. When Labor was elected, it hiked all wholesale sales taxes, it abolished the income tax cuts which it had promised—no, it had not promised them; they were l-a-w—and it increased the petrol excise.

The alternative of just fleeing from Iraq in the teeth of people like Mr al-Zarqawi is to hand the country over to those people. That would be the most monumental victory for evil and the most monumental victory for terrorists that you could possibly imagine. Simply the worst imaginable thing to do in the teeth of this sort of opposition is just to run away and leave Iraq as a failed state.

But one of the main issues with the idea of screening some but not all airports in the way proposed by Labor is, in fact, to be found in the concerns expressed by the member for Braddon. Under his proposal, one of the airports he is concerned about would be screened; the other would not. They are 40 minutes drive apart. The intelligence agencies will tell you very quickly that that is a very silly thing to do. Somebody intent on doing something silly will turn up, find one screen and drive a few minutes down the road to the other one. It increases risk. That is why I say that that is not the Labor Party's policy. I say they should seek advice from the experts on this. If they will not take it from us, then they ought to seek a proper briefing. We are determined to target resources carefully and properly to maximise the security of people who are travelling in regional Australia.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The other area relates to the Asia-Pacific region in which we live. I think it is fair to say that we are playing an important role and a role that is appreciated and respected in the region. The Minister for Foreign Affairs referred to this yesterday in general terms. There is substantially more funding for our neighbours but, as a subset of that, we are doing considerably more in relation to capacity building in a range of Asia-Pacific nations—the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia. We are training personnel from Pacific island countries as they seek to develop, implement, put in place and then run their security plans. In particular, we are very active in Papua New Guinea, where we have already installed, and now have operational, four high-tech airport screening devices. We have trained personnel and, indeed, under the enhanced cooperation program we are supplying aviation and maritime security experts to work in relevant agencies in Papua New Guinea. There is considerable extra resourcing going into this as a result of the budget decision. We will spend more money and resources over the next four years in the interests of helping those Pacific neighbours of ours upgrade their security, not only for the sake of their own residents but for other nations in the region as well. </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Budget 2004-05</title><page.no>28660</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>28660</page.no><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name><name.id>DT4</name.id><electorate>Hotham</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Treasurer.

The phase-out in relation to their family tax benefit would have been 50c. That is where it was. The first round of tax cuts reduces that 43c marginal tax rate to 30c and, in the year 2000, the phase-out was reduced to 30c. So it came down from 43c and 50c to 30c and 30c. In addition to that, with an increase in the family tax payment, depending on the various levels, we have changed the taper from the maximum to the minimum rate.

The funny thing is that when you read the transcript, which is described as coming from 12 May 2004—and I table it; I am sure there is an explanation—it begins with an interview about the republic, plebiscites and national security. The interview that we heard yesterday did not involve the republic, plebiscites or national security, so we went back further and we found that there was another radio interview on Radio 6PR on 20 April 2004 that did talk about republics, plebiscites and national security. It appears to me—and I am sure I am wrong and I am sure there is an explanation—that the Sattler interview of 20 April 2004 got rebadged on the ALP web site as the Sattler interview of 12 May 2004. </para><para>Strangely enough, because the April interview was rebadged as the May interview, the April interview did not contain any complaints from the member for Werriwa that his tax cut was not great enough as listeners on 6PR actually heard yesterday.

It also includes ongoing commitments to those vital programs that have helped underpin progress and development in rural Australia over recent years.

So that will provide real benefits to our environment and ensure that our farmers have an appropriate natural resource base upon which to build. There is much more money for the Murray-Darling Basin—a matter of keen interest to the member for Barker and other members in that region. Our commitment to the water initiative is funded.

That kind of message will be very important for the pirates and others who have been stealing Australia's resources. There is another $40 million to help extend the Great Artesian Basin sustainability initiative to cap those bores which have had water flowing free for far too long. There is $11.3 million to ensure that the government is able to deliver on its commitments made in response to the Keniry review into the live export trade.</para><para>There is a whole range of measures that have been welcomed by farm industry organisations around the nation. One of particular interest to the honourable member for Barker is obviously the changes to the wine equalisation tax arrangements, which will mean that around 90 per cent of wineries will no longer have to pay any wine equalisation tax. The member asked whether there are any alternative policies. We know the opposition does have an alternative policy in relation to the wine equalisation tax. They have ruled out any concessions to the WET. Publicly they have no support for taking this load, this burden, off our important wine industry.</para><para>Referring to alternatives, I guess tonight we will find out whether there are any alternatives. But if the opposition leader is up to his usual form, agricultural issues will not rate a single mention during his budget reply.

The Hogan review was commissioned to undertake a very thorough inquiry into the financial needs of the aged care sector, including operating costs. Of his immediate term issues, the government has responded in full to each of the recommendations. He termed capital as a medium term issue and he suggested that should be considered in the light of 2008. This government has considered the issue of capital now, and over the next four years over $1 billion of capital will be injected into the aged care sector. That more than meets the analysis of capital requirements that this sector needs in fact not only over the next four years but over the next decade. We have met in full the capital requirements of this sector by the $1 billion injection into capital. Our policy on bonds remains unchanged.</para></talk.start></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Labor Party: Centenary House</title><page.no>28665</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>28665</page.no><name role="metadata">Elson, Kay, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs ELSON</name><name.id>6K6</name.id><electorate>Forde</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Ageing representing the Special Minister of State.

The office of the Prime Minister responded to her and copied their response to me, which also gave my office the impression that the matter had been dealt with.

By that technique, three members were, rightly, denied the opportunity to vote yesterday because the attendant at the door was more accommodating than he or she ought to have been and in fact the members entered the chamber. This is verified by other members and the Serjeant-at-Arms. They entered the chamber after the Deputy Speaker, as it was in this case, had indicated to lock the doors.

You will often find whoever is occupying the chair being quite accommodating by rather slowly appointing the tellers to enable people to get to their seats.

What I propose to do today is not engage in a polemic; I wish starkly to outline to the parliament the international legal obligations of this government, and how those obligations are not being met by this government.</para></talk.start><para>We have the Geneva conventions, in large part, because of the way civilians and prisoners were treated in World War II, including Australian prisoners of war—all 34,000 of them, including the thousands who lost their lives at the hands of the Japanese in prisoner of war camps. That is why the international community came together in 1949 to negotiate a better protective regime for the future—the Geneva conventions. Australia ratified the conventions in 1958. Menzies was the Prime Minister and Casey was the foreign minister, after whom this government has named the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade building. One member of parliament noted in a parliamentary debate in December 1957, `This bill represents a milestone in the history of humanity and in the history of international law.' That member of parliament was E.G. Whitlam. Another MP agreed, adding, `It touched the most fundamental concepts of humanitarian motives.' That member of parliament was Jim Killen, the Liberal member for Moreton. Here we now stand, nearly half a century later, confronting the obscenities that have occurred, most recently in detention centres in Iraq, as if we had learnt nothing.</para><para>What precisely did the Geneva conventions have to say about the protection of prisoners? The cornerstone of the Geneva conventions is the definition of the responsibilities of an occupying power. The term occupying power refers to a state which has invaded another state and remains party to the military occupation of that second state. The third Geneva convention outlines the responsibilities of an occupying power for the humane treatment of prisoners of war and other prisoners. The governments of the US, the UK and Australia have explicitly acknowledged that the third and fourth conventions apply to Iraq. So how does the third convention apply specifically to the treatment of prisoners? Article 3 imposes a general responsibility on occupying powers to specifically prohibit outrages on personal dignity, in particular, humiliating and degrading treatment. Article 13 of the convention states: </para><quote><para>Prisoners of war must at all times be humanely treated.</para></quote><para>Article 14 of the convention states:</para><quote><para>Prisoners of war are entitled in all circumstances to respect of their persons and honour. Women shall be treated with all the regard due to their sex and shall in all cases benefit by treatment as favourable as that granted to men. </para></quote><para>Beyond these general provisions, the Geneva convention outlines in article 12 specific provisions relating to the transfer of prisoners between what the convention describes as the detaining power and the protecting power.</para><quote><para>Prisoners of war are in the hands of the enemy Power, but not of the individuals or military units who have captured them. ... the Detaining Power is responsible for the treatment given them.</para></quote><para>This is of fundamental importance in this debate because it explicitly recognises that ultimate legal responsibility is borne by the high contracting parties to the convention—that is, the governments of the countries concerned, not the individual units of the armed forces of those countries. What article 12 details is that, if an invading state captures prisoners and then decides to hand over those prisoners to another invading state for the purposes of incarceration, the ultimate legal responsibility for the wellbeing of those prisoners lies with the country which captured those prisoners in the first place. The convention also, in article 131, defines as a grave breach of the convention acts involving the inhuman treatment of prisoners as well as other acts.</para><para>Furthermore, grave breaches of the third Geneva convention potentially fall within the purview of the International Criminal Court and the Rome statute. The United States is not a party to the ICC, but Australia and the UK are. The provisions of the third and fourth Geneva conventions were ratified by Australia in 1958. They were supplemented by the first protocol to the Geneva convention in 1977, which Australia ratified in 1991. The first protocol adds, significantly, a specific prohibition on violence, including mental and physical torture and `outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment ... and any form of indecent assault'. This, then, is the legal framework within which these revolting, degrading and disgusting instances of the inhuman treatment of prisoners must now be formally examined by this parliament.</para><para>In the last two weeks the Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Defence have been all over the shop on the question of Australia's legal obligations. The only thing that has been common in their various statements is this: it ain't our problem. The political strategy of the Howard government has been quite clear: this is a Tony Blair problem and a George Bush problem, but it is not a John Howard problem. The Howard political strategy has been to turn up for all of the military parades and take whatever political benefit the government could get out of the war but be missing in action when it comes to Australia's legal responsibilities, having participated in the Iraq war in the first place, as far as the treatment of the civilian population and prisoners are concerned.</para><para>The unsettling truth for John Howard is that Australia does have formal international legal responsibilities for the treatment of Iraqi POWs. It is my responsibility in this parliament to explain how. The cornerstone of Australia's legal responsibilities in Iraq derives from our status as an occupying power. John Howard stated, on 17 April 2003: </para><quote><para>We—</para></quote><para>that is, Australia—</para><quote><para>have the obligation of an occupying power under the Geneva Convention. We, along with the Americans and the British have responsibilities, certainly, and we won't neglect those responsibilities.</para></quote><para>Foreign Minister Downer has subsequently argued that our occupying power responsibilities mysteriously ceased on 22 May 2003, when the UN Security Council adopted resolution 1483. The foreign minister's argument is that, because the Security Council resolution does not specifically mention Australia as an occupying power, we are magically off the hook as far as our obligations under the convention are concerned. Put more crudely, because the Howard government did not have the guts to own up to its continuing responsibilities, like the Americans and the British, by sending a letter to the President of the Security Council, the government was home free.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>8K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Fitzgibbon</name></talker><para>—Do you stand by that, Alex?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4G4</name.id><name role="metadata">Downer, Alexander, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

What stunning hypocrisy! When it comes to Australia's status as an occupying power, the problem with the foreign minister's tactic is that it is legally meaningless. Firstly, Australia's occupying power status is defined by the fact of our invasion of Iraq and the fact of our continued military presence in Iraq. These are facts which give effect to our obligations under the Hague and Geneva conventions. Secondly, Howard and Downer cannot simply legislate away—</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—The member for Griffith will refer to members by their title or their seat.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83T</name.id><name role="metadata">Rudd, Kevin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDD</name></talker><para>—these continuing occupying power responsibilities by trying to have a Security Council resolution concocted which turns a blind eye to Australia's involvement in the occupation and in the invasion. Thirdly, Security Council resolution 1483 does not purport to be an exhaustive list of occupying powers as it simply notes correspondence received from two of them—namely, the US and the UK, not Australia. Fourthly, the authority referred to in Security Council resolution 1483 is the Coalition Provisional Authority—the vehicle for the political administration in Iraq of the occupying powers, in which Australia today continues to have high-level representation. In other words, you cannot pretend not to be an occupying power on the one hand while having direct representation in the political vehicle of the occupation—namely, the CPA—on the other. Senator Hill himself last October in the Senate described Australia as `a member of the Coalition Provisional Authority'.</para></talk.start></continue><para>For the purposes of the argument, let us assume for the moment that the foreign minister's minimalist definition of the time frame for Australia's responsibilities as an occupying power—that is, from March to May 2003—is valid. By the government's own definition, Australia, together with the US and the UK, had conjoint responsibilities at that time as occupying powers under the Geneva convention for the protection of both POWs and the civilian population. The Howard government's first responsibility under law, therefore, was to ensure that a comprehensive regime was established for the humane treatment of all prisoners of war and for the proper protection of civilians from the outset of hostilities. </para><para>Australia's second set of legal responsibilities under the Geneva conventions in Iraq are much more specific. They are obligations that arise under article 12, which concerns the detention and protection of prisoners. That is why the ADF negotiated with the British and the Americans an arrangement for the transfer of prisoners dated 23 March 2003—in other words, at the outset of hostilities. Remember that article 12 of the third Geneva convention outlines clearly the responsibility of the detaining and protecting powers—that is, those who capture prisoners in the first place and those who incarcerate prisoners in the second place. Remember that article 12 says that a detaining power or the capturing power is responsible for the treatment given to prisoners. Furthermore, if prisoners are then transferred to another power—in this case, the United States—and the Americans subsequently fail to carry out the provisions of the convention in any respect, the country which handed those prisoners to the Americans for incarceration is required to `take effective measures to correct the situation or ... request the return of the prisoners'.</para><para>So the practical question arises: did Australia detain prisoners during the Iraq war and did they do so during the period when the Howard government itself acknowledges that it was an occupying power under article 12 of the convention? The answer is yes. We know from the Senate <inline font-style="italic">Hansard </inline>that up to 59 Iraqis were taken prisoner by Australians. The minister indicated tonight that it was possibly up to 100. The practical question which then arises is: what mechanisms did Australia put in place to ensure that the prisoners it captured, detained and then handed over to the Americans for incarceration were protected in accordance with the Geneva convention? Were liaison officers appointed? What monitoring arrangements were put in place with the Red Cross?</para><para>There is not the slightest shred of evidence to date that any individual from the ADF mistreated prisoners, but there is little evidence to date that the Howard government put in place proper protective measures to ensure that its obligations under the convention were met. This is the responsibility of the Howard government as a high contracting party to the convention.</para><para>The trigger mechanism under article 12 of the convention is when Australia became aware of any maltreatment of Iraqi POWs. This leads us to the comedy and tragedy of the conflicting statements by the foreign minister and the Minister for Defence as to when they first knew of allegations of prisoner abuse. When first asked this, the defence minister said he only found out in late April. When the foreign minister was asked this he said he found out in the middle of January. The truth, of course, is that the US military on 16 January issued a statement outlining allegations of detainee abuse in Baghdad. This was reported by the ABC on 17 January. Furthermore, on 20 March the Coalition Provisional Authority, of which Defence Minister Hill says we are a member, issued a statement indicating that personnel had been charged with crimes including maltreatment of and cruelty to prisoners.</para><para>But the unexploded time bomb in the middle of all this is the Red Cross report of February 2004, a report which covers the whole period of March 2003 through to November 2003. It reveals a picture of systematic abuse. So when do the Australian government acknowledge that they received this February 2004 report? Answer: February 2004. So what do they do once they have received it? Answer: nothing, because their argument is that it was directed to the US and the UK. The question rightly arises, once they became aware of the existence of this report—which they said they did in February 2004—why they did not immediately request a copy of it and then take action arising from the contents of the report in terms of the tale of prisoner abuse that it contained. Why did they not do that? To date, the government have indicated that they took no action in response to that report. This constitutes a gross failure on the part of the Howard government to honour their obligations under the Geneva conventions. </para><para>So what should the Howard government now do?</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4G4</name.id><name role="metadata">Downer, Alexander, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83T</name.id><name role="metadata">Rudd, Kevin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDD</name></talker><para>—There are four core questions that the minister must answer in his reply.

As part of the coalition, Australia nonetheless complied with the responsibilities of such a power. The adoption of United Nations Security Council resolution 1483 on 22 May clarified that the United States and the United Kingdom were the occupying powers. In the period under question, Australian forces had contact with Iraqi prisoners on five occasions. On each of those occasions, an American officer accompanying the Australian Defence Force was the person with custody of the Iraqis or to whom the Iraqi forces were surrendered. Australia did therefore not have obligations under the Geneva Convention as a detaining power. </para></quote><para>That is the legal point—not, as the puerile member for Griffith would have it, the party political point. I will attest to this House that I would give greater credence to the advice of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Attorney-General's Department than I would to the member for Griffith, who has a particular interest in the puerile party political point.</para><para>Let me continue by making this point: we of course condemn the abuses that have taken place in the Abu Ghraib prison. As I said on the <inline font-style="italic">Lateline</inline> program last night, and as I have said to the Americans and to the British government as well, we obviously want this matter dealt with as quickly, as thoroughly and as effectively as possible. All known incidents of abuse need to be dealt with with the full force of the law in the United States and also, where appropriate, in the United Kingdom. We want that done quickly and we want that done decisively. It has not been the policy of the United States administration or the British government to abuse people in prisons. It is clear, though, that it is an action that has been taken by a number of people serving for the United States military and, possibly, in the British military. The role Australia can play is to encourage those countries to do the right thing. I think it is fair to say that those countries are doing the right thing—difficult as that is. </para><para>This leads me to make two other points. It reminds me that one of the people I have spoken to about this issue, not surprisingly, is my friend and colleague Jack Straw, the British Foreign Secretary. I am reminded to pass on to the member for Griffith—not that, of course, Jack Straw would know as much as the member for Griffith about international law!—that he pointed out to me, without any prompting, in a conversation I had with him recently: `Well, it is not such a problem for you because you are not an occupying power.' Not that Jack Straw would know, I suppose! He is only the Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom. He is also a member of the Labour Party.</para><para>What we need to contemplate through all of this, though, is: where to from here? I think it is interesting that the opposition has not gone out of its way today in question time to join with me and the government in condemning what happened to Mr Berg. They could have done that. They could have stood up in the parliament when I made those remarks in order to give that an appropriate profile.

My point is this: we do not want the sort of people who killed Mr Berg to take control of Iraq. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Cutting and running from Iraq is not a solution. We have to make sure that the interim government in Iraq comes to power on 1 July as an essentially technocratic government able to preside over a process leading up to elections in January 2005 so that the ordinary Iraqi people can wholly claim their own country. At the same time we need to provide security for Iraqis and gradually transfer that security to the emerging Iraqi police and the new Iraqi army. That is the sensible thing to do. Let us concentrate on doing those things and make sure that Americans, Brits and others who commit human rights abuses are brought to justice in the way that Saddam Hussein's abuses were not brought to justice. Let us have a sincere debate about human rights.</para><para>I think this government has an extraordinarily good record on human rights. We stood up against Saddam Hussein. We helped to overthrow his barbaric regime. We are proud of the moral role we played as well as the practical role we played in doing that. That was a most evil and barbaric regime. If the opposition thought it was evil and barbaric—and I assume they did—they nevertheless walked on the other side of the street. That is something we did not do. So do not come in here sanctimoniously and start lecturing us about human rights, because it is not a debate that the opposition is going to win.</para><para>I have remembered that there is one other challenge that the opposition makes, which is a challenge about when we knew about all of these things. I have made it perfectly clear. Actually, I was on holiday at the time, on 16 January, at Carrickalinga on the south coast of South Australia in my electorate. The Americans issued a press release saying they were investigating abuses. The Red Cross did not give the report to Australia. Why? Because the Red Cross—the member for Griffith would know better than the Red Cross, I suppose!—did not regard Australia as an occupying power. It gave the report to occupying powers in February. The Red Cross would not know as much as the member for Griffith, and nor would Jack Straw or the international lawyers in my department, according to the members opposite. I think in your hearts you know the member for Griffith is a bit of a stunt master, not somebody to be taken terribly seriously.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>28678</page.no><name role="metadata">Wilkie, Kim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr WILKIE</name><name.id>84G</name.id><electorate>Swan</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Firstly, I will refute a few of the comments made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.

It is not the Australian Defence Force personnel's role to command military prisons in postwar Iraq, but they have taken a role in capturing prisoners that has ultimately led to their incarceration in places like Abu Ghraib prison. I believe Australian troops would feel embarrassed and ashamed that as members of the `coalition of the willing' they are tainted by this despicable behaviour.

We received three months full-time training, and training went on for another nine months on the job before we were given full status as prison officers. What training have these people had? Look at the person who was in charge of the prison. In Iraq in June 2003 an Army Reserve brigadier general was assigned as a commander of the Military Police Brigade and put in charge of military prisons.

As early as July 2003, an investigation was launched into the prison system in Iraq. The report was handed down in late February this year. It said that institutional failures were considered `devastating' and that numerous instances of `sadistic, blatant and wanton criminal abuses' at Abu Ghraib were occurring. It is now known that the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Foreign Affairs both had access to this report.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The International Red Cross regularly complained to the US throughout 2003 about the treatment and abuse of Iraqi prisoners. Given that Australia is an occupying power in Iraq, it is incomprehensible that the Howard government, the Minister for Defence or the Minister for Foreign Affairs never acted on this report. They have squirmed their way out of directly answering, confirming or denying whether they were aware of the abuse of prisoners. Of course they knew. It is just that, because they have failed to act responsibly, they will not give a clear answer. They have said they did not need to act. That is ridiculous; of course they did. The Howard government, when committing our troops to Iraq, took on the responsibility for ensuring that humanity and international laws were respected.</para><para>The Howard government should have contacted the US and UK defence departments and raised their objections to the report of abuse. Yet it was not in their political interest. They sat on their hands. They washed their hands of any responsibility and hid behind the excuse that Australian troops were not involved in the incarceration of prisoners and, therefore, we had no moral or legal responsibility to make sure that they were treated humanely. But that is crazy. If you know that illegal acts are occurring, you have a responsibility to do something about it. If you do not, you are just as guilty as the people committing the acts. If you do not act when you know something is wrong—you do not even bother writing a letter and asking for a `please explain'—you are condoning the actions of the people who are committing them. It is absolutely ridiculous that they did not even bother writing to the American and British governments, asking for a `please explain'.</para><para>I believe that all along the Howard government has blatantly ignored the plight of Iraqis. We have seen situations where people who have been trying to escape from Iraq have been thrown overboard. We have seen situations such as immigration detention centres, where people have been abused and the government has not acted because it has not been in its political interest. Now we are seeing the abuse of prisoners—many of whom are civilians, not people who have been involved in crimes against the coalition.</para><para>I am also concerned about the way this matter is being handled. I am concerned that those charged may be made into scapegoats when in fact there are wider implications and issues that need to be dealt with. Seven US soldiers have been charged with abusing Iraqi prisoners. Military officer Harman says she was under direct orders from military intelligence to `make it hell' for inmates. The commanding officer of the prisons in Iraq, the reservist I spoke of earlier, claims she was overruled by her superiors in matters of jail operations. Command decisions came from higher up: from the commander of ground forces in Iraq and her successor, the US prison chief in Iraq. </para><para>The graphic photos and footage, with more images not released because of their horrific nature, were staged. The privates involved in prison operations received orders from superiors to take those heavily staged photos. The former commanding officer of prisons was told to use lethal force to keep order in prisons and refers to attempts by the new US prisons chief to make Abu Ghraib like a prison in Cuba—to `Gitmo-ise' it. As I said earlier, I was a prison officer for 4½ years. The photos that I saw of people in Abu Ghraib could not have been done in a brief period of time. They take time to organise. You cannot expect to believe that one or two, or maybe three or four, officers would round up six or seven Iraqis, strip them naked, put bags on their heads then abuse them in front of the cameras and not know that someone in authority had to be aware that it was going on. There are too many photos to suggest that it was an isolated act. We need to look at a proper inquiry into what is going on over there. We need to deal with it. I call on the Howard government to seek a full investigation of the handling of prisoners in Iraq, to ask the US and British governments to provide justification for these actions and to ensure that, as an occupying power in Iraq, we honour our obligations under the Geneva Convention for the treatment of prisoners.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>28681</page.no><name role="metadata">Hunt, Gregory, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HUNT</name><name.id>00AMV</name.id><electorate>Flinders</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In addressing this motion, I start by making a point, as I did this morning in another debate in this House, of condemning torture, condemning abuse and condemning summary execution wherever they occur, by whomsoever, irrespective of any circumstances. They are unacceptable in all situations, at all times, under all circumstances. Make no mistake about that. We saw this morning the news of the wilful and calculated summary execution of Nicholas Berg, an American citizen. It is an example of the situation which has prevailed in Iraq, whether now at the hands of those associated with al-Qaeda or at the hands of the henchmen of Saddam Hussein's regime over the last two decades. That has been the daily reality for Iraq. That is what the coalition has been involved in dealing with. But if in so doing—in any way, at any time, by anybody—there have been breaches of international law, breaches of basic decency and breaches of basic humanity, then that must be condemned, it must be investigated and those involved must be prosecuted.</para></talk.start><para>That is the position of the Australian government. That is the position that the government have had since the outset and, significantly, it is the position which we had in relation to the situation in Iraq under the Hussein regime. It was the most brutal regime on the face of this planet in the last decade—a regime which would still be in power and carrying out brutal acts on a monumental scale. We know that in the last decade alone 300,000 souls perished at the hands of Hussein and at the hands of all those associated with his regime, yet the implication before us today is that there is some moral equivalency between the wrong, outrageous and unacceptable events that have just occurred and an entire decade of state-sponsored torture, murder, mayhem and destruction.</para><para>The second thing I wish to challenge about what the opposition have said today is this implication by association. They say that it is a smear on Australian troops, but Australian troops are not involved. There is an implication by association. Nobody has the guts to come out and say it. It is what is called narrowcasting. It is this notion of sending out the message subliminally. It is sending out the message that, in some way, Australia is responsible and has allowed these things to occur. It is not the fault of the Australian troops on the ground, because they did not do it, yet it affects the troops. There is this logical inconsistency and a disgraceful and gutless attempt to besmirch the troops through implication.

I make two points. One is that, in Iraq, 300,000 souls perished and hundreds of thousands were tortured. Abu Ghraib prison, which has witnessed these unfortunate, unacceptable and outrageous acts, was the site of human misery, depravity and torture throughout the last decade. In that situation, it is curious that, as the foreign minister pointed out, there has been silence in terms of letters to the foreign minister about Iraq's human rights abuses under Hussein. There has been silence in terms of questions and silence in terms of motions. It is a fascinating thing that, at this last moment, there is now a focus on human rights abuse in Iraq under the coalition but no examination of what has occurred otherwise.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I also want to point out that, if there is concern—as there absolutely should be—about the lives of Iraqis and about their treatment, there was a choice that was before every member of this House. It was a simple choice: to allow what was occurring on a monumental scale in Iraq to continue—to allow the torture, the systematic rape and the degradation of an entire population to continue—not because anybody wanted it to but because that is the price of inaction, or to take action. On this side of the House we took action. It was a difficult choice, and I can respect the moral choice if others decided otherwise, but that choice would have allowed the continuation of all of those atrocities on a scale which has been repeated nowhere else in the world over the course of the last decade. Let me repeat this point for the House: inaction would allow the continuation of the most brutal regime with the most systematic approach to human rights abuses in the entire world throughout the last decade.</para><para>That was a moral choice open to those on the opposition. I do not condemn them for it, but that would be the consequence and the outcome of the decision that they made. But we have a second chance for people to consider their position. At this point in time, if we were to withdraw and walk away, there would be chaos in Iraq and a repetition of that gross and systematic torture and abuse of human rights across the entire country. For a second time we are faced with the choice of whether to act or whether to walk away and, again, let the same consequences occur for the people in Iraq. Most respectfully, I urge many of the goodwilled people in the opposition to reconsider their position, because the price of withdrawal would be massive human rights abuse within Iraq. That is the inescapable consequence of the action which the opposition are now advocating. It is a massive price, and it is a price which will be borne by the Iraqi people.</para><para>In that situation, I have no doubt that to stay in Iraq is the only responsible thing to do. It is a difficult situation to build a democracy when confronted with two groups who are willing to use all force necessary to prevent that democracy from being created, those groups being the remnants of the Baathist regime, and those associated with al-Qaeda. It is a difficult action. It is an action which comes with a terrible human consequence. Every day, we should remember the human consequence and never take it lightly; nor should we for one moment condone any breaches of international obligations, of international responsibilities and of our basic human responsibilities. Such breaches are unacceptable. They should never be repeated. They should be investigated and they should be punished. But that does not mean we walk away from our responsibilities. That does not mean we open the gates of hell on Iraq again, because Iraq has lived through over two decades of having the gates of hell open, and they were closed. It is a difficult and brutal process that we are now going through, but to walk away is to open the door to unspeakable crimes which would occur and accrue against ordinary Iraqi men, women and children as they did occur and go unpunished and untreated over the last two decades. </para><para>There is a key difference between what is occurring now and what has occurred before—not that it is in any way acceptable. When Hussein was in power in Iraq, those who carried out the atrocities were promoted. In the current situation they will be found, they will be prosecuted and, where they are guilty, they will be punished, because that is the essence of a democracy and that is what we stand for, and that is why, if we had stayed silent and allowed inaction to rule, human rights abuse on an unprecedented scale would have been allowed to continue. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

It is a regrettable attempt from two points of view. First of all, we know from past practice that at every federal election approximately 80,000 young Australians—17year- olds, 18yearolds and 19yearolds—who have not voted at a previous federal election take the opportunity between the declaring of the election and the close of the rolls, which takes place five working days later, to enrol. To go to the model that is suggested in this bill will disenfranchise them. Whose interests does this serve? It does not serve the interests of democracy in Australia. It does not serve the interests of 80,000 young people. </para></talk.start><para>I would also point out that the experience of the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Matters, which looked seriously at these issues, is that more than 200,000 people—not new enrollees but people who have changed their address—would be disenfranchised by the earlier date on which the government proposes to close the rolls. These people need sufficient time after an election is called to register their change of address. With a compulsory voting system, we in this parliament have a responsibility to see that the franchise at election time is as wide as possible and as generous as possible and that we do everything we can to make sure that every single person who has a responsibility to vote has the ability to vote. The changes foreshadowed in this bill will mean that we are not doing that.</para><para>In 1983 the then Liberal Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, closed the roll in the manner that the government is proposing with this bill. It was estimated not by me, not by the Labor Party and not by some propagandist but by the nonpartisan Joint Select Committee on Electoral Matters—which the government now chairs and on which it has a majority; it has argued against all the things that the government has put up in this bill—that 150,000 people lost their right to participate in the 1983 election. That is in noone's interest, particularly in a compulsory voting system. </para><para>I reiterate a recommendation of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters—a committee on which the government has a majority and which is chaired very capably by the member for Kooyong—on the issue of witnessing and acceptable forms of identification. The parliament is dealing with the hyped concern of a very small fringe group that there is so-called massive electoral fraud in Australia. By contrast, this was the parliamentary committee's recommendation: </para><quote><para>. . . the Committee does not consider it necessary that the witness be within a specified class of people ...</para></quote><para>What do we find in the explanatory memorandum for this bill? It says:</para><quote><para>Where no identification documentation was available, only people in a prescribed class would be able to provide written references supporting an enrolment application.</para></quote><para>What does that mean to the average person out in the community? They are going to have to get two people—a policeman, a chemist, a doctor or an MP—to provide identification for them if they do not have an acceptable form of identification for the electoral office. It is going to be such a bureaucratic nightmare for ordinary people who may not be skilled in soliciting prescribed witnesses, who may be intimidated by having to ask their doctor, with whom they may have a medical relationship, or by having to ask their chemist, from whom they may be accessing certain medical requirements or pharmaceuticals, or by having to ask their MP to identify them. These are not easy things for some Australian citizens to do. Why are we making it hard for them? This is a very silly idea and it is designed to limit the franchise. It limits democracy in Australia.</para><para>The amendments in this bill go against the recommendations of the nonpartisan Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, which is so capably chaired by the member for Kooyong. What is the reason the government has decided to give him and the government majority on that committee a slap in the face? I am totally unaware of what motivates it. It is quite an extraordinary state of affairs. When this parliament sets up a body of people who are allegedly experts in these matters and then just ignores what they say reminds me very much of the Joint Select Committee on the Republic Referendum, which was chaired by the member for La Trobe. A unanimous recommendation was made to this House on the form of the republic referendum. We had very long hearings, all the experts were consulted and there was a determination amongst the parliamentarians to show the best in ourselves—that is, that we could get nonpartisan resolutions. Of course, what did the government do? As soon as the unanimous recommendation of the committee, with a Liberal majority, came into this House, the government deliberately put a mechanism into the motion in order to subvert, torpedo and damage the prospects of a republic ever coming into being. They did that deliberately. They knew exactly what they were doing, just as they know with this legislation that they are trying to limit the franchise of young people and people who have recently shifted their addresses but not transferred their electoral addresses.</para><para>This is not good enough. It is not the kind of standard we should be expecting of people in an open and democratic society like Australia's. We should be here considering legislation, not things like this that knock out people and that stop them from voting, particularly our younger people who are perhaps only beginning to come to a realisation of the importance of democracy in their first opportunity to vote. We should be encouraging them and making it exciting for them to participate in the democratic exercise that we will have some time in the next few months. We should be having debates here on serious issues like four-year terms and fixed terms of parliament that would make this society more democratic and would prevent executives interfering with the parliament. These kinds of things are not before us today. In fact, what we have is a bit of a rort, to tell you the truth. It is an attempt to do what was done in 1983 and stop younger people from participating. It is an attempt to stop people who live in apartments and flats and who shift and who have not fixed up their electoral enrolments from participating. </para><para>This bill will remove prisoners' voting rights. This bill gives effect to address based enrolment, which the committee recommended in a 2001 report not be proceeded with. The committee recommended a sunset clause of three years for its proposed proof of ID, and that has not been picked up in this bill. The bill closes the roll for new enrolments as soon as the election is called and three days after for transfers. The committee recommended that the current seven-day period be retained. I sat on that committee, and I am astonished to be standing in the parliament knowing that the government has repudiated the member for Kooyong and the committee. I cannot understand it. I know the member for Kooyong is not the favourite son of the Prime Minister. Many would say that he might otherwise have been a minister now. It is really extraordinary that a very recent recommendation of the committee—the governments expert committee, established by this parliament with its majority—has been effectively repudiated by this bill. </para><para>The bill will also increase various financial disclosure thresholds arising from the government response to the 1998 election report, but it does not do anything to respond to the 2001 report. The second bill gives the Electoral Commissioner wide discretion in the manner and form in which access to roll information is provided. The committee recommended against this in the 2001 election report that we brought down. This is a regrettable and regressive attempt by the Howard government to restrict democratic rights, to knock out young people and people who want to transfer addresses. I can only assume that it is being done for the political benefit of the government or what they perceive to be the political benefit. But this will rebound on the government when the message gets out to the people whom they are attempting to disenfranchise, when, as inevitably it must, the Senate knocks these amendments out and when voters realise that the government have been trying to prevent them from voting at the next federal election.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>28686</page.no><name role="metadata">Hunt, Gregory, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HUNT</name><name.id>00AMV</name.id><electorate>Flinders</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am very pleased to rise to speak on the <inline ref="R2029">Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Access to Electoral Roll and Other Measures) Bill 2004</inline> and its cognate bill, the <inline ref="R2030">Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Enrolment Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2004</inline>. Taken together, these two bills are about a very simple concept. They represent an endorsement, an extension and an improvement of mechanisms to protect the health of our democracy. They do that by seeking to overcome electoral fraud. It is a simple, clear, absolute proposition. These bills are about overcoming electoral fraud. They build on work completed within and outside this parliament.</para></talk.start><para>I want to address three things in the bills: firstly, their background; secondly, their importance; and, thirdly, some of the proposals for democratic and civic participation which should flow from them. First and foremost, the legislation is about making a more workable and efficient electoral system by ensuring its integrity and its fairness. These two measures focus on enhancing and protecting the clarity of the electoral roll. They seek to overcome any attempts to distort, misuse or abuse the electoral roll. Above all else, they help to prevent abuse of the system and strengthen the foundation of Australia's democratic electoral system.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WF6</name.id><name role="metadata">Danby, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Danby</name></talker><para>—How many examples are there in the last 10 years?

The bills continue the government's strong commitment to making sure that we have a system that is free of fraud. There should be no opposition—I would hope—to that basic principle of ensuring that our electoral system is free of fraud. It is a very simple and basic proposition, to which I would be surprised if there was any philosophical opposition. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The mechanisms of the bills come in response to the improvements recommended by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. The government has adopted and embraced the vast majority of the improvements which have been suggested. The committee released the 1998 federal election report in June 2000. The government supported most of the recommendations made by the joint standing committee. These bills answer many of the concerns of the Australian Electoral Commission as submitted to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, while not supporting some of the recommendations based on the possibility that they could create loopholes for abuse.</para><para>It is important to understand where the opposition stands in relation to these bills. There have been—and I note the presence of the shadow minister for trade in the House—in Queensland some significant examples of electoral rorting, which have been attributed to those linked to the Labor Party in Queensland, as found by no less a figure than Justice Shepherdson. It is interesting to note, as the member for Melbourne Ports leaves the chamber, that the Australian Labor Party opposed key aspects of the Electoral and Referendum Act (No. 1) 1999 in such a way as to be against requiring first-time enrolments to provide one original proof of identity document.</para><para>These are not onerous obligations. These are basic obligations—less than would be required were you to seek to take out a new video membership, bank account or passport. These are requirements which ordinary Australians in everyday life deal with every day. These are not onerous obligations. I argue that these are the bare minima of what could be expected to ensure that there is even the most basic protection against enrolment fraud. I have a mind to argue for a stronger system than that which is being proposed here, one which is equivalent to that required to take out an Australian passport, to seek a drivers licence for the first time or to take out a bank account. In the interest of harmony, these requirements represent the bare minimum of that which must be expected. But to argue for less than that proposed here—to argue for an absence of basic protections—is an extraordinary position. I fundamentally disagree with that proposition, because it leaves open the door for the abuse of ordinary, fair and reasonable democratic procedures.</para><para>The Australian Labor Party is effectively supporting verification by drivers licence numbers but not by drivers licences. That is unworkable in many rural communities. Whilst claiming to support electoral reform in principle, in reality the Labor Party is seeking to make it less effective to ensure that there is less protection and that basic and fundamental guarantees of a free, fair and fundamentally clean electoral system are simply not in place. I find it hard to understand the opposition's position in relation to the basic proof of identity requirements which are set out here.</para><para>The importance of this legislation is simple: the electoral process needs to reflect the foundational role of popular sovereignty in the governance of Australia. It needs to ensure that there are increasing penalties for those who intentionally cast more than one vote or who cast a vote to which they are not entitled. It also needs to ensure the protection of people who need assistance while voting from scrutineers being overly active in their participation—who are, in effect, asserting the scrutineer's will and not the will of the entitled voter. </para><para>The amendments contained in these two bills protect the integrity of the electoral roll. They assert a set of steps which is no greater than that taken by ordinary people in the conduct of ordinary duties on an everyday basis—simple, clear and understandable. For those reasons, I am pleased to support—and I urge that the House supports—the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Access to Electoral Roll and Other Measures) Bill 2004 and its cognate bill, the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Enrolment Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2004. Above all else, I urge people to respect the fact that this is about ensuring that there is no electoral fraud, eradicating a practice before it takes root and making sure that basic guarantees are in place that our system is above and beyond any possibility of abuse by malefactors who would seek to distort the democratic process.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>28688</page.no><name role="metadata">Roxon, Nicola, MP</name><name role="display">Ms ROXON</name><name.id>83K</name.id><electorate>Gellibrand</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am pleased to speak on the <inline ref="R2029">Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Access to Electoral Roll and Other Measures) Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2030">Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Enrolment Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2004</inline>. I am also pleased to be following the member for Flinders, who clearly is concerned about the integrity of our electoral system, as I think all of us who are elected to this House must be. It is the source of our legitimacy to ensure that the electoral roll does have integrity, and there are a significant number of measures in these bills that are supported by the Labor Party and will no doubt be passed through this parliament. It is a misrepresentation—made by the member for Flinders and others—that the Labor Party are not concerned about the fraud measures that are in this legislation, and it is a misrepresentation of our position to suggest that we will not be supporting a number of those measures.</para></talk.start><para>The Labor Party have indicated that we object to a number of provisions—and the government and government members well know this, because many of the proposed changes included in this legislation have been proposed previously. They have been opposed in the Senate by the Labor Party and the minor parties; in fact some of them have been opposed twice. They will be opposed again, for the same reasons. The legitimate measures that are supported by both parties and by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters will be able to be supported. It would be quite outrageous if the government were to seek to put the good with the bad, as it so often does, when it well knows that we object to a number of these provisions.</para><para>It is probably not surprising that the government would still persist with putting all these issues together in the one bill, because the government is so keen, whether in electoral matters or in other legislation, to tie some measures that are beneficial and will improve the particular system being changed—in this case, the way our electoral roll works—to other matters that are highly politicised, where it knows that the Labor Party is opposed to them. In this instance, it also knows that the Electoral Commission is opposed to them and that its own Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters is unanimously opposed to a number of these issues.</para><para>Other shadow ministers, both in this House and in the other place, will detail each of the specific items that are going to be supported and opposed. I particularly wanted to speak briefly on this legislation to register my concern about one particular matter—that is, the proposal to close the electoral rolls on the day that the writs are issued. This is something that the government has been pursuing for a long time. It is one of the measures that has been rejected, I understand, twice previously, and the Labor Party has consistently argued that this measure is only about disenfranchising young people. There is no other way that it can be presented. The people who are most likely to need to make sure that they get themselves on the roll are those large numbers of new, first-time voters, who will only make sure—and realise that they have an obligation to make sure—that they are on the electoral roll when the election is called. </para><para>It is just an absurdity to think that, on the day that the Prime Minister decides to drive out to Yarralumla and call an election, every 18- and 19-year-old and maybe some 20-year-olds who have not had to be on the roll and vote previously will be able to find their way to an electoral office—or perhaps to a post office, but I do not even think that seems to be acceptable under these changes—to ensure that they are enrolled so that they can vote 33 days later in an election. It is not practical, it is not workable and the government members of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, who have analysed this time and time again, unanimously opposed this measure. The Australian Electoral Commission, which is not known as a radical institution of any type, has very sensibly pointed out the practical difficulties involved in closing the rolls on one day. It has made estimates of the number of people who would miss out, obviously using the calculations that it has made before of the number of young voters who enrol.</para><para>I gave a speech on this matter when I was the shadow minister for children and youth back in April 2002, I think it was—more than two years ago, when this measure was before the House previously. At that time, the Electoral Commission had actually commented on the government's proposal and said:</para><quote><para>Of particular concern is the possible impact of the early close of rolls on young people who wish to take up their franchise for the first time but are usually only motivated to do so by the announcement of an election.</para></quote><para>The commission estimated that there would be some 80,000 to 100,000 people—overwhelmingly young voters—who enrol for the first time in that week, who under this proposal would be likely to miss out on their opportunity to vote in an election.</para><para>You would have to say, in budget week, a proposal like this that is going to ensure that young people cannot vote seems to jell with the budget announcements that have been made this week. This is a budget that does not deliver anything for young people. Young people do not earn the $52,000 a year and will not get any tax return. It is young people who, more so than the rest of the community, are single or without children and who will not receive any of the other benefits. It is young people who will have to meet the costs of HECS, which the government is attacking. It is young people who are going to miss out in all of the initiatives that the government has been announcing. And—surprise, surprise!—it is young people who will not be able to vote.</para><para>It seems to me that if the government are really so confident that this is the best budget since sliced bread, they would be happy to have everybody who is entitled to vote voting in this election. If they really believed that, they would be supportive of making sure that everyone had the opportunity to vote—that franchise was as broadly available as is humanly possible. Making the window smaller for the time that people can enrol is really not the way to deliver a legitimate test of the government's attractiveness, if you like, in the community. You cannot just pick and choose which groups of people you will allow to vote. </para><para>I think it is undeniable—and I am sure that other speakers would agree with this—that this smaller window of time to be able to enrol to vote will disproportionately affect young people. Of course it will affect people who need to change their enrolment details, and others, but it particularly affects young people. Not only is it going to affect them because they may not be on the roll, but they are more transient in their housing arrangements, so it is obviously a matter of concern to make sure that they are enrolled in the right electorate and that their enrolment details are kept up to date, although the bill will allow some extra time for just the change of details.</para><para>I wanted to voice my ongoing concern and opposition to these measures. I think it is quite unfair that Australia's young people are the ones who are going to miss out on this. I have noticed that a number of the youth advocacy groups, including the New South Wales Youth Action and Policy Association, have been lobbying heavily on this. They believe strongly that the proposal to close the electoral roll to new electors at 6 p.m. on the day on which the writs for an election are issued and to close the roll for those amending their enrolment at 8 p.m. three working days after that will effectively exclude thousands of young people from voting. This is at a time when we say we should be increasing people's understanding about citizenship, improving our democracy and making sure people exercise their rights—and it is young people we are going to be excluding. </para><para>Young people between 18 and 24 have the lowest enrolment figure of any eligible age group—I am quoting the comments of the Youth Action and Policy Association in New South Wales—and, according to recent information from the Electoral Commission, only 60 per cent of 18-year-olds are currently enrolled to vote. So there is a big job ahead for us to ensure that people are enrolled and for the Electoral Commission to run its often successful campaign to get people to enrol and to ensure that there is sufficient time, once an election has been called and people are focused on this issue, to get them to fill out the appropriate forms and make sure they are on the roll.</para><para>That is all that I want to contribute on this matter, although, as I have said, others will detail why certain measures are going to be supported and others are not. Of course we are critical of the more extreme proposals which the government puts forward in this, but we do believe that balanced electoral reform is an important thing. We will be supporting a number of the initiatives, including the AEC working with state and other Commonwealth agencies to improve enrolment for young and homeless people. We will also be supporting details of age and gender being included on the certified roll on polling day to provide extra checks of voter identity.</para><para>We support increasing penalties for electoral fraud. We support the increased data matching between the Electoral Commission and other government agencies to help stamp out any chance of electoral fraud. We support the immediate reintroduction of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Electoral Commission information and education service and we support the reasonable use of technology and widely accepted forms of identification to improve enrolment.</para><para>So it is quite wrong of the speakers on the other side of this House to suggest that the Labor Party are not supporting these bills. In fact we are able to support the vast majority of the legislation, but the matters that are going to disenfranchise young people and the matters that are ignoring the good advice that has been provided by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and the Electoral Commission are things that the Labor Party intend to fight for to ensure that our electoral system gives the most people possible the opportunity to vote that they deserve and the opportunity to ensure that they can choose which party and which member of parliament will represent them best in this House. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>28691</page.no><name role="metadata">Gambaro, Teresa, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GAMBARO</name><name.id>9K6</name.id><electorate>Petrie</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak today to the <inline ref="R2029">Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Access to Electoral Roll and Other Measures) Bill 2004</inline>. The electoral roll is the bedrock of our democracy. Its integrity and accuracy are as fundamental to our democracy as the right to vote itself, because without them the validity and value of any vote is eroded. So the electoral roll is the key to the whole process of democracy and is vital to the conduct of elections. Not only does an accurate electoral roll guarantee that a person is validly entitled to vote but it is also essential to the planning and conduct of a fair election. This is true not only in the casting of votes but in the drawing of electoral boundaries. So the electoral roll is both the wellspring and the guardian of that essential element of democracy—the right to vote. The Australian Electoral Commission's role in maintaining the electoral roll is therefore a very vital one.</para></talk.start><para>While listening to the member for Gellibrand I must admit that I was rather surprised at some of her comments about young people. Having a 17-year-old who is about to turn 18, I think she did young people a great disservice. Young people are far more interested in the political process than they have ever been before. They are far more interested in their rights and responsibilities. I feel that the member for Gellibrand underestimated their ability to organise themselves.</para><para>I know that my soon to be 18-year-old certainly knows when she needs to get a learners permit, she knows all about ID cards and she knows that she has to enrol to vote when she turns 18. I think that to say that young people do not know what they are entitled to do and that they are not politically aware is certainly an underestimation. They are much more engaged than they have ever been before. They do have a sense of responsibility and duty and they do want to be informed about various issues out there, so I do not agree with her underestimation of their ability to get themselves organised and interested in the political process.</para><para>But it is important that we do maintain the roll and that we update it to maintain the integrity of that roll, which is used in federal, state and territory and local government elections. The AEC ensures that the Australian voter is able to vote in a fair and accurate way and have an important expression of their wishes. That is why electors are compelled to advise the AEC if changing their name or other vital information, including address details. The AEC has a hard enough job as it is without people not taking some individual responsibility on their own. Responsibility—particularly democratic responsibility—is a two-way thing.</para><para>Without such updating and the maintenance of accurate voter information, the integrity and validity of the vote cast is undermined, eroded and often open to confusion and challenge. That is why information on elector registration is regularly passed to the AEC, why the AEC maintains a continual review and reprocessing of such information and why it undertakes surveys and targeted doorknocks to collect the information it needs to maintain and update the electoral roll.</para><para>The public nature of the electoral roll is equally important and equally necessary to the conduct of fair, open and democratic elections. Making the names and addresses on the Commonwealth electoral roll public and accessible at all AEC offices further extends the accuracy of those details and allows the roll to be checked. That information is not, however, for sale. It is much too vital. </para><para>The information on the roll can be printed only once during the life of a parliament for public inspection and issue to members of parliament. This underlines the recognition of its value. Not all of the information contained in the roll is available to the general public. Under the Commonwealth Privacy Act 1988, some information is not available, and those Commonwealth government agencies which require it have been given specific exemptions under the act.</para><para>In her excellent book <inline font-style="italic">Frauding of Elections?</inline>, Dr Amy McGrath said that the link between the need for an accurate and well-maintained electoral roll and possible abuses of democracy is succinctly expressed by an excerpt from the <inline font-style="italic">Report on Northern Ireland, British House of Commons 1997</inline>. That report said:</para><quote><para>The backbone of the system is the Register. Without a reliable list of those able to vote, there can be no effective limit on voting fraud.</para></quote><para>Dr McGrath says:</para><quote><para>With four kinds of optional voting in Federal elections today, even the watchdogs of political parties are confused and bemused by the complexities that have crept into the electoral process. These are compounded by slack and dubious practices that have developed in managing it—ie the electoral process.</para></quote><para>If the experts are confused and bemused, small wonder that the general public, as the member for Gellibrand spoke about before, are so ignorant about something that is one of the most important and cherished rights of democracy. In her book, Dr McGrath also points to the fact that most voters have little comprehension about the principles that govern declaration votes, and none at all about how they are counted. She continues:</para><quote><para>Many certainly have little regard to restrictions on the right to cast declaration votes, such as the fact that they are not eligible to cast a pre-poll vote if they are within 8 kilometres of a polling booth.</para></quote><para>It is very interesting to look at the electoral process. Indeed, my home state of Queensland is a suitable case for treatment in the conducting of elections—a place where, to quote Dr McGrath again, `cynical abuse of the electoral roll' has been very famously—or infamously—documented. Please do not think, Madam Deputy Speaker Corcoran, that I say this from any party political basis. No less honest and well-placed an observer than the Premier of Queensland himself, Peter Beattie, has made no secret of it. Indeed, he has well documented it. In his own slim volume, a book that he titled <inline font-style="italic">In t</inline><inline font-style="italic">he Arena</inline>, he has explained it as a long and honourable tradition of cynical abuse of the electoral roll. He has often quoted the chapter in which he recalls his early innocent training in Labor politics, when he was shown how to trawl the suburbs of Brisbane to look for vacant allotments which could be used as addresses for phantom voters.</para><para>So the vantage point of Queensland is a good one from which to appreciate the challenges of maintaining the integrity of the electoral roll. The Australian Electoral Commission is to be given every encouragement in addressing this challenge, especially in Queensland, where even today people recount the horror of certain electoral situations that have occurred, particularly in Mundingburra. At the heart of that sorry chapter of electoral abuse lay the issue of voter identification, or the lack of it, when registering on the electoral roll.</para><para>It is extraordinary that the Labor Party continue to oppose these measures that bring integrity to the roll, and they continue to do so by not passing them in the Senate. They can agree so uniformly on so many other things but not on the issue of open enrolment without the need for voter ID. Why are the Labor Party so against passing some aspects of this bill? It certainly makes you wonder. I believe the roll needs to be made much more accountable. These measures that we have proposed today will certainly count towards greater integrity of the electoral system and the voting system. It is an important platform of our democracy, and one which all electors should be given the greatest possible freedom in exercising. I commend the bill. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>28693</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Laurie, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LAURIE FERGUSON</name><name.id>8T4</name.id><electorate>Reid</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will deal briefly with a number of matters in the <inline ref="R2029">Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Access to Electoral Roll and Other Measures) Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2030">Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Enrolment Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2004</inline>. Firstly, I will deal with the question of scrutineers. This is clearly aimed, by its derivation in the Country Liberal Party in the NT, at Aboriginal voters. Essentially, it is a major assault upon their privacy and rights, and their intention to vote in the fashion that they would wish. It is based, of course, on allegations that there is intimidation and people are compelled in a way to essentially sign over their rights. In reality, the choice is theirs. At the moment, the choice is not that of any of the political parties in this country. Those that think otherwise can complain if they feel that they are being abused, stood over and intimidated.</para></talk.start><para>What is really happening here, in contrast to all of the sloganising about abuse, is an attempt to reduce the number of people who would vote. We do not have to reach the area of sophistication in the US, where through polling you have a wide knowledge of who is going to vote Democrat or who is going to vote Republican, to the point where you only canvass that sector of the electorate. It is very obvious. I know that a previous speaker, the member for Canning, on another aspect of this legislation made the comment that 95 per cent of Aboriginals vote Labor. I think he is probably overstating our support but, be that as it may, it leads to the point that he has obviously estimated that Indigenous Australians vote heavily for the ALP and if you can reduce in any manner their voting levels, you essentially gain. Equally, in metropolitan Australia, in electorates such as mine where nearly half the population were born overseas, it is also of use if you can restrict the ability of people to cast votes in the fashion they wish.</para><para>It is clearly a reality in my electorate that both political parties offer help to people on election day. It can be abused. I noticed that, in the recent municipal elections, the Liberal Party, which in my region is basically the Lebanese party, obviously was very active in getting people to assist people on election day and putting a lot of pressure on people, but you have to live with those kinds of problems. At the end of the day, you hope that people can express their wishes. This is clearly an attempt to reduce the Aboriginal vote. The government also believes and estimates that those people who have poorer English—and some of them may even be illiterate in their own tongues—would disproportionately vote Labor, and this is a way of minimising their participation in the political system.</para><para>There is the issue of disclosure records—obviously, yet again, a perennial problem in relation to electoral laws in this country—and the attempt by the coalition to reduce public scrutiny. They carry on persistently about the integrity of electoral rolls, wanting legitimacy in the system and wanting to make sure that everything is transparent, but the one thing they do not want too much transparency on is the question of who donates. Anyone with a modicum of intelligence would appreciate that there is a correlation between public knowledge of donations and political decision making, and the public should know. There is no rational reason why a donation of $2,000 should not be acknowledged and known. The allegation is that perhaps people will be intimidated if their donations are known. That really does not curry any intellectual acknowledgement. </para><para>A previous speaker made the comment that, if the government were to have its full way, 80 per cent of donations in the country would not have to be revealed. That is another very worrying initiative by the government. The thrust of the opposition's position on this measure is that a large number of these initiatives by the government are matters that their own committee has essentially not come up with. These are more extreme versions, in some cases, of compromise positions that were agreed to at the committee, but the hard men in the Liberal Party have now decided that that committee did not go far enough.</para><para>On the question of prisoners, once again it is the thin end of the wedge in regard to reducing participation. We know the actual direction the government wants to go in. There is a pattern that we have seen in Florida. There has been a lot of discussion of the way in which ballot papers were not counted. But the real scandal in Florida at the last presidential election was the large number of people that were scrubbed from the rolls. Florida has laws which state that, if you have served a prison sentence, you cannot vote—not only while you are in prison but permanently, for ever and a day. This is the long-term thrust of where this government is going. In the short term it is to get to a position of denying people votes while they are in jail, but in the long term basically it is to ensure they can never vote.</para><para>It was very interesting to read an article in <inline font-style="italic">The Nation </inline>on this matter, entitled `Florida's “disappeared voters”: disenfranchised by the GOP'—the `grand old party'. It made this comment:</para><quote><para>It has been well reported that Florida denies its nearly half a million former convicts the right to vote. However, the media have completely missed the fact that Florida's own courts have repeatedly told the Governor he may not take away the civil rights of Florida citizens who committed crimes in <inline font-style="italic">other </inline>states ...</para></quote><para>What they did over there was not only deny votes to those who are incarcerated—and they basically do not allow people who have committed offences in Florida in the past to vote—but also illegally scrub off anyone who had committed an interstate offence. They employed a corporation to go through US criminal records and find anyone in Florida who had ever had a sentence anywhere in the country, and then they scrubbed them off. There was then a very convoluted process for those people to get back on the electoral roll. The article commented further:</para><quote><para>Passed by the Republican legislature's majority, the new code included an extraordinary provision to turn over the initial creation of `scrub' lists to a private firm. No other state, either before or since, has privatized this key step in the elimination of citizens' civil rights.</para></quote><para>That article recounts how some local county electoral commissioners stood up to the intentions of the state administration and tried to defend people's rights. </para><para>In the short term this is about saying: `These people have committed offences against society, so why should they participate in the process? They have sacrificed their rights.' The member for Canning said there is one chance in 50 million that a few people will vote from prison—two people in his electorate, I think he said, voted from prison last time—and `in a crucial election, they could turn the result. How dreadful it would be if these people decided the government of Australia.' Let's get serious! </para><para>I note the comments of Heather Lardy in regard to the rights of people in prison. She commented, in an article in <inline font-style="italic">Public Law </inline>magazine of 2002:</para><quote><para>Employing disenfranchisement as a punishment is also a questionable practice because it confuses the moral authority of the political community with its distinct power to determine its own membership. It is at least doubtful whether it is morally acceptable for the political community to exert a continuing power to punish those whom it has opted to expel through the act of disenfranchisement.</para></quote><para>I could be just as extreme as the member for Canning in my analysis of the repercussions of this. Theoretically, if this could be widened by the current government, you could have a number of people incarcerated for political offences—people who were resisting particularly harsh laws; for example, the poll tax in the UK. They could be resistant to a government on a particular series of issues of a political nature and they would basically be disenfranchised. That is an extreme possibility. People are affected by laws that are legislated by governments. This government is saying that a whole group of people with a particular interest should be denied any say in a system which can then basically prescribe legal changes that affect them very dramatically. This is a matter on which the Labor Party feels that there is a compromise position, which has been suggested, in regard to who should be denied a vote. Personally I do not think there should be any limits whatsoever. But there is a compromise position put by the Labor Party. </para><para>The issue of closure of the rolls is once again part of a pattern. Under the guise of authenticity and integrity, the pattern is to limit participation and to reduce the possibility of people voting who are likely to vote against the coalition—young people, transients, people of particular ethnic extractions and Indigenous people. That is the fundamental intent of these changes.</para><para>There is also an attempt, because a large number of people only enrol in the election period, to limit the period. Figures have been given that at the last election, I think, 83,000 new voters enrolled. Are we to use the excuse that it is a short period and the staff are overworked to deny these people their rights? In a perfect world, everyone is enthusiastic and everyone wants to be part of the political process, so they all jump to get onto the electoral roll. In the real world, as the member for Warringah clearly explored with regard to the Republican convention, people do not like politics and they do not like politicians, particularly some politicians, and they are not really interested in the system. Election time happens, there is advertising on television, interest is increased and a large number of people do try to become part of the system. This measure, under the guise of trying to make the system purer and cleaner, is clearly designed to make sure that a smaller number of them will become part of the system.</para><para>We are talking about enormous numbers of people. In a population of 20-odd million, there will be 200,000-odd people enrolling in that period. Sure, a number of them will still fit in the more limited time period—the vast majority probably will—but to say that, because of a lack of resources and the short time period, these people should be denied the vote because they have not been active enough prior to that time is a recipe for further disengagement from the political system. It is a recipe for fewer and fewer people to feel that they own part of the process and are in it. Even if they get knocked over on election day and lose out, they would at least have had some say, some minimal contact with the system. This, as I said, is very clearly a recipe to make sure fewer and fewer people will get on the electoral roll. </para><para>I note the comments of the committee at paragraph 2.174:</para><quote><para>In the light of these—</para></quote><para>that is, the proof of identity proposals. On this matter again, as I understand it, the government has gone to a more extreme position on identity than did the committee—</para><quote><para>the existing checking processes for the close of rolls period, and the prospect of unnecessarily disenfranchising voters by foreshortening the close of rolls, the Committee recommends that the existing seven-day period between the issue of the writs and the rolls closing should be retained.</para></quote><para>As I have said, the committee saw the evidence on a number of these issues. Some of the people on the committee, on both sides of politics, have been on the committee for a significant period of time and are regarded in general as people who know a fair bit. They might be partisan and they might have struggles on this committee but they are perhaps a bit more expert and a bit more interested in getting a reasonable compromise and a nonpartisan approach on these matters than the people who are dictating this legislation. Once again, on the issue of the close of the rolls, the provisions in the legislation are much more extreme than those recommended by the committee.</para><para>I listened to the member for Canning. He is always good for a bit of entertainment. He made the most outlandish allegations about how corrupt our political system is. We all know that, for all the disengagement and disinterest by large numbers of Australians, if you were to walk down the average street, whether in Toorak or Granville, very few people would tell you that they believe our political system is corrupt and that there is widespread impersonation and false enrolment et cetera. We all know the reality is that the Australian Electoral Commission is often consulted by other countries. It advises many of them and it has been utilised to sanction the legitimacy of elections in some countries. The kind of proposition by the member for Canning and others that we are living in Louisiana under Huey Long or under Boss Prendergast in Independence, Missouri is just ridiculous. But this is the kind of image the government want to put out there. It is in line with the member for Warringah's attempt to besmirch the system and say that there is endless corruption et cetera. </para><para>If we look at the movement of people within electorates around the country, there is no pattern such that there is a particular surge of enrolment in marginal electorates or a higher level of electoral problems in marginal electorates. Amongst the member for Canning's outbursts was one about some Aboriginal woman in the seat of Swan in 1993 who was trying to get people to vote. Firstly, it is still not a crime in Australia for an Aboriginal woman to encourage Aboriginal voters to cast their votes. He might think it is an offence, but it is not. In line with the ludicrous propaganda here, he said there were 2,000 Indigenous voters in 1993. </para><para>After that performance this morning, I bothered to look at the latest figures. They show 1,466 Aboriginals in the current seat of Swan. We know that Aboriginality in this country has been increasing in every census. The Parliamentary Library were not able to get me the 1993 census on Aboriginality in Swan, but on an estimate of municipal boundaries they said there were about 800 people. That is not from the Bible or the Koran but is the estimate from our Parliamentary Library. But the member for Canning was talking about 2,000 people and assuming that that woman could dictate to the whole 2,000—she just goes around with a shotgun and they all go down to the polling booth and do what she says!</para><para>We heard from the member the usual panoply of allegations about rorting, people voting often and early et cetera, and allegations that the unions are organising people to live in caravan parks and that sort of thing. He said he has got all the evidence, he has been there, he is tracing envelopes that he sends out, he has visited them at the caravan parks and he is aware of all these conspiracies—he is the Sherlock Holmes or Inspector Clouseau of Australian electoral laws! But no specifics were demonstrated.  </para><para>We know he can lay complaints; we know he can take action. We know that something can be done if he knows anything whatsoever about these things. But it is still this broad smearing and unsubstantiated series of allegations. He said that union organisers are flocking around the electorate and around the caravan parks, and that people really live in Rockingham but they are in a caravan park out there—as though he could not do anything about it if he really wanted to. He did say that he is aware that in this country there are circumstances whereby people with different surnames do live in the same house; he is aware that that can happen. However, he carried on about the prevalence of these things. That any political party has got the resources—the Liberal Party might have, as I certainly know from my own experience in the very marginal seat of Parramatta, next to mine—to go around in such a fashion is really doubtful. If they are ever utilised at all, it is within the Liberal Party and the Labor Party for internal faction fights—that is where you might see it. We have seen that exposed on a number of occasions. </para><para>The thrust of the coalition here is: `Let's say our system is dreadful. Let's say that we are like some tin-pot Central American or South American semidictatorship. Let's say that people's rights are being denied, it is all being manipulated and the whole system is corrupt. Under that guise, we can bring in a number of measures—whether it is in regard to the time in which people can be enrolled, people's enrolment rights, people's rights to get the person they choose to be their helper on election day or bringing in new identity provisions.' It is all about one fundamental thing. Basically, it is about discouraging participation, reducing the ability of some people to have some say in the system. That is the agenda; it always has been and always will be. </para><para>We know that when the coalition came to power the next speaker took a very courageous position in regard to compulsory voting. But, once again, it was hoped by some members of the coalition that if voting were not made compulsory and people were not pressured to be part of the system—a tradition in this country since the 1920s—more people would drop out of the system and more people would feel that they had no say in the system. They hoped—Tim Fischer, the former leader of the National Party, had a different view—that most of the people dropping out would be supporters of the Labor Party. And this is part of the same mechanism. It is all part of the same picture to discourage people, to make it hard for them to vote and to enrol. It is going down the US line, where only 25 per cent vote in some elections. It is about making it difficult for people to get people back in the system. That is what this is all about, despite all the talk about legitimacy and integrity.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>28697</page.no><name role="metadata">Georgiou, Petro, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GEORGIOU</name><name.id>HM5</name.id><electorate>Kooyong</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Our electoral system is not in the nature of the 10 commandments; it was not handed down from the heavens on stone tablets. It has been evolving since Federation. The very existence of a standing committee of the parliament on electoral matters recognises that the electoral system is not inherently perfect and that it does require ongoing scrutiny. When scrutiny reveals room for improvement, the parliament should legislate to pursue that improvement. </para></talk.start><para>As chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in the current parliament, and as somebody who has played various roles in the political system over some years, I do have an ongoing interest in the process of pursuing the inevitably unattainable goal of a perfect electoral system. I do want to emphasise that my belief is that the Commonwealth electoral system has a very high level of integrity. The changes proposed in the <inline ref="R2029">Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Access to Electoral Roll and Other Measures) Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R2030">Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Enrolment Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2004</inline> are not made to repair a system which is fundamentally defective; rather, the proposed amendments in the bills before the House today are designed to improve a system that, as I have said before in this place, is among the very best in the world in terms of its fairness, inclusiveness and integrity.</para><para>The bills span a vast number of issues associated with electoral and referendum processes—from enrolling to vote to the form of certifying returns. They include substantive and fundamental matters as well as technical and consequential ones. For example, the proposed amendments would update the dates on the electoral forms from the 20th century to the 21st century and extend the prohibition on canvassing within six metres of a polling booth or the entrance to a polling booth to prohibit broadcasts by loudspeakers located outside the six-metre limit but audible within the six-metre limit. It would introduce a new offence of intentionally voting more than once in the same election, it would allow the names of candidates elected to be attached to the writ rather than photocopied or printed on the back of them—which risks damaging the writ—and it would require the AEC to publish a written notice of reasons where it decides not to register a party name.</para><para>These bills take up a number of the recommendations made by the electoral matters committee in its report on the conduct of the 2001 election. I was very pleased that that report was a unanimous cross-party report—the first unanimous post-election report in 13 years. Once again, I do take the opportunity to thank my colleagues for the great care and deliberation they accord to committee matters and for their spirit of cross-partisanship.</para><para>It is also gratifying that the government has indicated support for the overwhelming majority of the committee's recommendations and that most of the necessary amendments to the electoral act to implement these recommendations are contained in these bills. Given time constraints, I propose to concentrate my remarks on some of the measures in the bill which were of major concern to the committee.</para><para>Electors' proof of identity when they enrol is a significant issue involving the integrity of the electoral system. The only existing verification requirement is that someone witnesses a person's enrolment form and signs a declaration that they saw the enrolee sign the form and are satisfied that the enrolee's statements are correct. The committee reported that, while established cases of roll manipulation are limited, `there is substantial agreement that the verification of identity on enrolment should be more rigorous'. Previous attempts to require verification identity have not succeeded. This is, understandably, a contentious issue.</para><para>As the committee reported, `it is the pivot of the tension between the demand for accessibility of enrolment to ensure that all entitled people are reasonably able to enrol, and the demand that the roll have unquestioned and publicly recognised integrity'. The committee noted that the touchstone of the perception problem about the roll's integrity is that: </para><quote><para>... the identification requirements to get onto the electoral roll are less onerous than ... the identification requirements for becoming a member of a video library.</para></quote><para>I believe the committee is to be applauded for tackling this fundamental and difficult issue, and the government is to be complimented for taking up the committee's recommendations and introducing a requirement for verification of identity and address for all new enrolments and changes to enrolment.</para><para>The explanatory memorandum indicates that the applicant would provide their drivers licence number on their enrolment form and the AEC would verify their identity by checking state and territory licence records. People without a drivers licence could use other documentary evidence of identity, and people without appropriate documents could use written references by people in a prescribed class. I think this is one of the variations that have been introduced in these bills that has caused a significant degree of controversy, which will undoubtedly sort itself out. Significantly, the proof of identity regime provided in these bills will not come into operation immediately but some unspecified time in the future, when satisfactory forms of proof have been negotiated with the states and territories. Negotiations with the states and territories have not yet commenced, and there appears to be no time frame for this. While recognising the efficacy of using drivers licence numbers and the importance of preserving joint roll arrangements, I have to say that it is important that there be no delay in implementing this significant measure.</para><para>The committee also recommended that the proof of identity requirements be subject to a three-year sunset clause. The government did not support this. I do expect, however, that the efficacy of the regime will arise as a matter for review by the electoral matters committee in the course of its future inquiries. Given the delicate balance that is being sought between the inclusiveness and the integrity of the roll, it is important that the scheme is evaluated, particularly to determine whether roll integrity is improved and whether concerns that identity requirements will increase disenfranchisement are justified. As I said before, established cases of roll manipulation are limited. However, provisional voting is one of the few cases where there is significant evidence that people may be voting in a division in which they do not live.</para><para>A person whose name is not on the certified list of electors on polling day may claim a provisional vote. If checks show that they are not enrolled elsewhere and that they were previously enrolled in the division in which they claim a vote, their provisional vote will be counted and they will be reinstated to the roll for that division. The AEC told the 1998 election inquiry that this `creates a loophole for people to claim enrolment for an obsolete address almost indefinitely'. The commission argued that address based enrolment would `remove the entitlement for provisional voters to be reinstated to the roll, potentially for addresses where they do not live'. The risk of this is that electors who move within a division without notifying the AEC of their change of address are disenfranchised.</para><para>The AEC suggested a means of minimising this—steps which are essentially taken up in the proposed amendments. If a person has moved but is still in the same division as their previous enrolled address, their vote for both the House of Representatives and the Senate would be counted. If they have moved to a different division in the same state or territory, only their Senate vote would be counted. This specific proposal was of great concern to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in its 2001 election inquiry. The committee observed: </para><quote><para>Under the proposed new system, people would be permitted to vote despite the fact that they have been removed from the roll correctly—</para></quote><para>That is, because they were not living at their enrolled address— </para><quote><para>Moreover, they will be able to do so despite uncertainty as to whether they are voting in the Division in which they are living.</para><para>The roll is an essential mechanism, and the prospect that someone could vote at an election having been removed from the roll properly, is objectionable on principle.</para></quote><para>The intertwined issues of address based enrolment and provisional voting have, I am afraid, created something of a tangled web, but the committee did work painstakingly to unravel the web and make measured, unanimous cross-party recommendations to address each aspect of the problem without creating a new problem by disenfranchising people whose votes would be appropriately cast or by creating the anomaly that people who have been properly removed from the roll are nonetheless permitted to vote.</para><para>To prevent people being reinstated to the electoral roll at an address at which they do not live, the committee recommended that a provisional voter be reinstated to the roll only if their address is verified by habitation review. To address the problem of people voting at an address at which they do not live, the committee recommended that, where a person's name is not on the certified list but they claim to still be resident in their last enrolled division, the person be required to provide proof of their name and address—and thus their entitlement to vote in that division—before the close of polls.</para><para>The proposed amendments take up these recommendations in providing for proof of identity by provisional voters and in requiring that the elector's entitlement to be enrolled at their claimed address be reviewed before they are reinstated to the roll. This was a very difficult issue and I think that the committee took its obligations to strengthen roll integrity very seriously. It took some very difficult steps in supporting the provision of ID at the point of voting. I genuinely thank the committee. I support the government's introduction of these measures to improve the electoral system's integrity. I trust that, like proof of identity for enrolments, the introduction of the requirement for proof of identity by provisional voters will be put in place promptly. I note in passing that the amendments would introduce address based enrolment—something that I commented on earlier. This would mean that people who are properly removed from the electoral roll because they are not at their enrolled address are nevertheless permitted to vote.</para><para>The close of rolls is another vexed issue in electoral matters. The close of rolls is essentially when the electoral roll is finalised for a forthcoming election. Between the close of rolls and election day, people may not enrol to vote and electors may not change their enrolment details. Currently the act provides that the electoral roll closes—to both new enrolments and amendments to existing enrolments—seven days after the issue of writs for a federal election. The proposed amendments provide that the roll closes for new enrolments on the day of the issue of the writs, and for enrolled voters wishing to change their enrolments, three days after the issue of the writs.</para><para>In the close of rolls period prior to the 2001 election, over 370,000 new enrolments, re-enrolments and transfers of enrolment were processed. Concern about these close of rolls enrolments, in my understanding, is primarily based on the belief that the validity of enrolments made during the close of rolls period cannot be checked. It was submitted to the 2001 election inquiry that close of rolls enrolments could be used to affect the outcome of an election, particularly in a marginal seat, in four ways: (1) by re-enrolment of electors validly enrolled in a safe seat to an address in a marginal seat, (2) by the enrolment of non-existent people, (3) by the enrolment of people not entitled to vote, and (4) by enrolment at a false address. </para><para>Given the suggestion that the close of rolls period provides an opportunity to undermine the integrity of an election, why not shorten the period? Despite a perception that there is a rush of enrolments prior to the close of rolls, in fact these enrolments are only a small percentage of total enrolments between elections—less than three per cent of total enrolments prior to the 2001 election. Nevertheless, an election being called is often a trigger prompting existing electors to update their enrolments and new electors to enrol. This maximises the accuracy and completeness of the electoral roll for the election.</para><para>More importantly, however, the committee found that it is a misconception that enrolments in the close of rolls periods are not checked and that checking and updating processes—normally and in the close of rolls period:</para><quote><para>... are essentially identical. Where the matching and checking processes disclose no anomalies, additions are made to the rolls. Where there are anomalies, changes or additions are not made to the rolls until these are resolved. </para></quote><para>Accordingly, the committee recommended that the existing seven-day period between the issue of the writs and the close of rolls be retained.</para><para>The government has not accepted the committee's recommendation. I note that if the amendment on this issue currently before the House is not accepted in the other place, as has been the custom over the years, implementation of the committee's recommendations for proof of identity for enrolments and provisional voters should alleviate doubts about the close of rolls enrolments.</para><para>The Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Access to Electoral Roll and Other Measures) Bill 2004 also contains some important reforms. There has been concern that allowing the electoral roll to be sold creates the risk that enrolment information will be used for commercial purposes. The AEC recommended that the electoral roll not be available for sale in any format, and the Office of the Federal Privacy Commissioner supported this. The committee commented that modern technology makes it easy to extract electors' information from the roll and that, given sufficient provision for inspection of the roll, there is no valid reason to continue to sell the roll. It recommended amendments to the Electoral Act so that the electoral roll is no longer available for sale in any format. This has been taken up in the bills.</para><para>End-use restrictions and penalties apply to elector information provided on tape or disk. Both the AEC and the Office of the Federal Privacy Commissioner proposed to the committee that end-use restrictions and penalties for wrongful disclosure or commercial use apply to all elector information contained in the electoral roll in any form. The committee recommended this, and these amendments are also amongst those currently before the House. The Electoral Act specifies the form in which the electoral roll may be provided, including microfiche, print and disk. The AEC submitted to the committee that this is restrictive and that rapid developments in technology made it inappropriate to specify the media for provision of access to roll information. The committee did not support giving the AEC this open-ended discretion and considered that the AEC should seek amendments as and when appropriate to stipulate new media for the provision of the electoral roll. </para><para>Despite the committee's conclusion, the amendments in these bills will give the Electoral Commissioner a wide discretion in the manner and form in which access to roll information is provided. On the other hand, the committee endorsed the AEC's proposals that public access to the roll in AEC divisional offices be provided firstly by a regularly updated electronic list of all names and addresses of electors in that division and secondly via an Internet inquiry facility for electors to verify their own details and as much of another elector's details as the inquirer knows. The government supported these recommendations. The amendments do not require the AEC to provide either of these services. Instead, the removal of the prescribed forms of the roll merely allows the AEC to provide the electronic list and Internet facility that the committee recommended.</para><para>Before I conclude, I would just like to note a few of the other reforms contained in these bills that are measures which have been taken up from the report into the conduct of the 2001 election. Significant reforms to the provisions for Australian voters overseas were recommended by the committee and are taken up in these bills. The time allowed for a person to apply for overseas voter status will be extended from two to three years. This will ensure that the eligibility period will include an election or referendum, which are the usual triggers prompting people to apply for overseas voter status. Applicants for overseas voter status will no longer be restricted to people who have left Australia because of their own or their spouse's career or employment.</para><para>Under these bills, to nominate for re-election, rather than obtaining the 50 signatures that are currently required, sitting Independent members of parliament will be required to obtain only one signature from an elector in their division or, if a senator, in their state or territory. These bills contain wide-ranging and important reforms to the electoral system—both fundamental and technical. They tackle the significant issues of proof of identity for enrolment, changes to enrolments, and provisional voters whose names are not on the certified list of voters. I commend the bills to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>28702</page.no><name role="metadata">Hatton, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HATTON</name><name.id>LN6</name.id><electorate>Blaxland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is a pleasure to follow the member for Kooyong in this debate. If everyone on the other side were as balanced and sensible in their approach to the question of electoral matters, then the opposition would not be in the position that we are in. We are supporting virtually everything in the <inline ref="R2029">Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Access to Electoral Roll and Other Measures) Bill 2004</inline> and we are supporting some of the matters in the <inline ref="R2030">Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Enrolment Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2004</inline>, but we are opposing a series of matters.</para></talk.start><para>Some of those matters, as he indicated in his speech, the member for Kooyong and other members of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters opposed. The most fundamental of them, which the member for Kooyong pointed out in his speech, with about five minutes of normal time to go, was that the committee had recommended that after the normal period for the closure of the rolls—that is, after the writs for the election have been delivered—there be a seven-day period in which the rolls would be open. This would mean that all of those who have traditionally been tardy in getting themselves onto the rolls, in particular the young but not so eager—in terms of this—would have a full week in order to get themselves on the rolls. The member for Kooyong pointed out that if this provision in the bill is knocked over in the Senate he would not be too unhappy. I would think that the other members of the committee would not be too unhappy either, because it would mean that, for the election that is now upon us, the normal provisions should stand. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4T4</name.id><name role="metadata">Melham, Daryl, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Melham</name></talker><para>—He remembers the 1983 election under Fraser, because he was his adviser.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LN6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hatton, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HATTON</name></talker><para>—He does, very well. The normal provision would be there for seven days. Instead of that, what do we have in the integrity bill? We have the proposition that, when the writs are issued, the polls should close at six o'clock that night. So imagine that the writ is out. The Prime Minister comes along at the end of this period of sittings and says, `Looks like we might go for another week or so.' After that extra week of sitting he trots off to the Governor-General and asks for a dissolution of the parliament, for an election on, say, 7 August. Once the writs for that are issued, if this provision were carried, after six o'clock that night people would not have any more chance to get on the roll.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We know from history—year after year, election after election—that there are a large number of people who have not gone onto the rolls who do so within that seven-day period. You can argue that there is something sinister about the process of those people getting onto the roll at that period of time—that there is something not right, something designed to change the way in which the election outcomes will be read. Like the member for Reid, I listened to some of the contributions earlier in this debate. I listened to the member for Canning on this very point. He argued that, effectively, the Electoral Commission would be jammed up with people trying to get onto the roll and that that was almost a purposeful thing that the Labor Party were seeking to do in order to make the process for the Electoral Commission more difficult and to hide a series of misdemeanours because there was so much of a rush on the Electoral Commission's doors.</para><para>I have to say that this is fantasy-land stuff, but it is indicative of the whole strain of thinking in the coalition about the Electoral Commission and about electoral matters—the belief that there is something fundamentally conspiratorial about the arrangements for elections and that what the Labor Party have proposed when in government in the past and what we have continued to propose within this House since is bent in a conspiratorial way to overcome the popular vote somehow.</para><para>In this regard, the member for Kooyong is not at one with the opinions of the member for Canning or that legion of other people on the coalition side who have taken to this view that there is something fundamentally wrong—who believe that the issue of double voting is real, it is in marginal seats and it is the thing that might have knocked them out at an election. They believe that coalition candidates in marginal seats would always have won elections if there had not been some kind of electoral chicanery. The fundamental problem here is that the whole series of assumptions that have been made about these matters—the closure of the roll and the amount of time properly available for that as well as the other things that the member for Canning dealt with—is based on a misapprehension of what this whole process is about.</para><para>In his contribution to the debate, the member for Reid made quite a fundamental point about the underlying assumptions with regard to this. Everyone who is involved in the political process knows that, in practical terms, it takes an enormous amount of effort and work to get people involved in the electoral process. Certainly, it takes a great deal of work to get people involved in the political process within any given political party, but to imagine that people have the time, the resources, the intent and the actual practice to go out and suborn the whole electoral process by putting tens, hundreds or even thousands of people onto the electoral roll to achieve an outcome different from what would have happened otherwise is just crazy. Not only is it not borne out by experience but it is not borne out by review after review undertaken by the Australian Electoral Commission and by parliamentary committees of what has been the practice in federal elections time after time. Indeed, the same thing has happened at the state level. </para><para>We know that for the whole period that we were in government, from 1983 to 1996, there was a building crescendo—a chorus—from the then opposition ranks of the coalition that there must have been something really wrong in closely fought elections for them to have lost. We know the brutal reality of losing elections on this side. We know that, since Federation, Labor have only had about one-third of the period in government and the coalition have had about two-thirds. We know that our period of government of 13 years from 1983 to 1996 reset that balance somewhat but, by and large, the majority of the time in government has been enjoyed by the coalition. We know that they have had control of the matters that we are dealing with now in terms of legislative responsibility and so on. Based on the experience that we have had, I think it would be unreasonable or unsound to argue that, throughout two-thirds of the time that the parliament has been operating, there has been fundamental chicanery of the sort where people have attempted to overload the electoral system and get thousands of people into electorates where they should not be.</para><para>But we do know that, through that period of time where Labor were not in power, there have been approaches to elections and electoral matters taken by conservative governments that are very similar to what is involved here—an attempt to put into practice a series of proposals which would make it more difficult for people to be able to vote. There is a presumption that, if you can exclude from the electoral process as many people as possible—because of their class or their general attitudes, or however they are pinned and targeted—in certain seats or places you will get a better result for the conservatives. If you look at the more than 100 years of federal government that we have had, the underlying presumption is that there are some people who do not deserve to vote because they do not exercise that vote properly.</para><para>We know that from 1924, when voting became compulsory in Australia, there has always been an informal vote. We know that there is a group of people who go along to elections, get their names marked off and vote informally just to not cop a fine. We know that there is a percentage of people who could not give a damn about the political or the electoral process, but we also understand and have understood since it was first enacted by this federal parliament that there are rights, duties and responsibilities and that they all go together. People do not just have duties and responsibilities; they have rights in relation to electoral matters that are equally weighed up against the duties and responsibilities, not only on them but on the people who make the laws about who should be able to vote.</para><para>Labor is opposing the provision that the rolls should close at 6 p.m. on the night of the issue of the writs. Both coalition and Labor members of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters argued that the provision should remain at the current seven days and that that is a short enough period of time in which to allow people to organise themselves. We could not have a longer period of time. In the normal electoral process there is a five-week period from the calling of an election until the date on which it is held. The seven-day period gives people ample time to get on the roll. It also gives ample time—tight as it might be—for the Electoral Commission to finalise the rolls and then to provide them, as they do, to members and to political parties in order for them to be able to communicate effectively with their constituents and electors at election time.  </para><para>These two bills are being dealt with conjointly. The first bill deals with access. As I said at the outset, Labor support all of the access measures. Here, as they have done in the past, the coalition have been reasonably sensible by putting all of the matters that they knew we would agree to into one bill, under the aegis of access to the electoral roll. They make a particular point of restructuring the roll access provisions, making them more understandable and silent as to the form the roll is produced in. The provisions say that all current entitlements should remain and that the roll should be removed from sale. This was one of the last points made by the member for Kooyong. I think it is an important one: both the government and the opposition indicate yet again that the roll and the information contained within the roll should be available only for specific purposes. </para><para>The intent behind changing the question of whether it should be silent with regard to form is covered by the fact that there has been a great deal of change in how that roll has been provided. We still get printed copies—a couple a year to members and so on—but the basic provision now of course is electronic. That allows us to deal with our electors in a much more efficient way. It allows the commission to deal more quickly and more aptly with how they put that roll together. We can do it a lot more simply and a lot more cheaply. But we can also ensure that we can guarantee the integrity of the roll much more effectively because of the increased technological capacity we have to ensure that access could be greater. </para><para>When looking at integrity matters, the fundamental proposition should be that access should be made available to all those persons in Australia eligible to be on the roll, that impediments to enrolling should not be put in their way. Therefore the position of those who are already rightly and properly on the roll should not be made more difficult. Some of the provisions in the second bill, the integrity bill, certainly go to that. The member for Canning, as well as others, spoke at some length with regard to people who seek provisional votes at elections. He argued, quite wrongly—there was almost a set of conspiracies—that these people have no right to be on an electoral roll, that when they claim the right to vote in a particular electorate there was a set of falsifications that you could actually prove. He argued that this was the case in the electorate of Hinkler and that the member for Hinkler had proven that previously, and he did it on the basis of returned mail and so on. </para><para>The member for Reid—who has dealt with these matters at considerable length, having studied them over a number of years—is balanced in his assessment of it, and what he says is quite true. This is part of a fantastic approach to these matters. Every member of parliament has dealt with the electoral process and knows that the Electoral Commission regularly moves through electorates to prove that people are or are not on the roll. That is done to ensure the integrity of the roll. </para><para>There is a great deal of movement of people from election to election. Many people move out of rented housing. It happens in my electorate. There is more movement in my part of Bankstown than there is in the southern part of Bankstown, represented by the member for Banks. People in rental accommodation generally move regularly. Other people move intrastate or interstate. When people move, the first thing on their mind is not re-enrolling. Whether they are moving within an electorate or to another electorate, the resettling process involving them and their family and their effects takes first place. They often will not be on the roll. If an election is called and they have not gone ro re-enrol in the seven-day period, when they go along to vote they find that they are not on the electoral roll. When they seek to vote, because they know they are bona fide electors, they are in a position where they are being allowed what we call a provisional vote.  </para><para>Labor has agreed, in general, that there should be specific witness provisions for people enrolling to vote. A drivers licence issued by a state authority can be used by an individual in order to prove their identity. We have agreed that a person coming forward as a provisional voter should be able to provide that kind of proof of their identity and as to where they should in fact be on the roll. We know from experience that thousands of people who are knocked back because they are there provisionally are re-entered on the roll and some of them are then taken off. If they have moved from electorate A to electorate B they then become properly enrolled.</para><para>But to seek to deny people their right to vote because they are in the process of moving within an electorate or from one electorate to another is to deny people their fundamental rights to have a say in how the country is run. It is important that that does not happen, that their rights are not transgressed in that way. To sum up, Labor completely support the access provisions. Labor have supported most of the provisions in the integrity area that were agreed to by the joint committee. But we completely reject those that fundamentally go to denying people their right to vote and to have their say in an election.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Gallus</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BUSINESS</title><type>Business</type><page.no>28706</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Rearrangement</title><page.no>28706</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>28706</page.no><name role="metadata">Gallus, Christine, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs GALLUS</name><name.id>CU4</name.id><electorate>Hindmarsh</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>——by leave—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That business intervening before order of the day No. 9, government business, be postponed until the next sitting.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Sitting suspended from 6.01 p.m. to 7.31 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2004-2005</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>28706</page.no><id.no>R2040</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>28706</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 11 May, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Costello</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>28706</page.no><name role="metadata">Latham, Mark, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LATHAM</name><name.id>K26</name.id><electorate>Werriwa</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—For the past five months I have been travelling around this great country of ours as Labor leader, talking to the Australian people about their concerns. It has been the experience of a lifetime. I have been holding community forums—old town hall style meetings, open to all comers. Thousands have come along to have their say—community leaders, school teachers, small business people, mums, dads and students. I call these meetings `democracy in the raw'—a chance to listen and learn, a chance to talk to people face to face. It is an important process, because as parliamentarians we need to be honest with ourselves. The Australian people have become disillusioned with the political process. We have lost their trust and confidence and we need to regain it, listening to people and addressing their concerns, staying in touch with the real-life circumstances of the Australian people. </para></talk.start><para>Tonight I am bringing those concerns and circumstances to Canberra. This is what the Australian people have been telling me. On the Central Coast of New South Wales they told me about the need to create new training and employment opportunities for the youth of the district, plus the need to put them in contact with mentors—role models who can point troubled teenagers in the right direction. At Gladstone in Central Queensland they told me about the need for more apprenticeships and group training opportunities—work force skills for the next generation. In Brisbane I heard about the need for bulk-billing doctors and a national dental program—doing something positive to help our senior citizens get their teeth fixed up. In Adelaide I heard about the problems in the social security system: family debts and disincentives for people who want to move from welfare to work. In the Latrobe Valley and Gippsland they told me about the loss of basic services, particularly in higher education and Medicare. At the community forum in Bairnsdale one man summarised what I have been hearing all over the country. He said that people were coming forward with `cries for help'—cries for increased social investment and better services; cries for stronger communities and lasting relationships; cries for a fairer society where, by working hard and pulling together, we can give all Australians a fair go.</para><para>Australia needs a government that answers this cry for help, a government that invests in its people and builds the services of a civilised society. After 20 years of economic reform—some of it Labor, some of it Liberal—our wealth and prosperity have grown. But surely as a nation we can make better use of our wealth. We can give it a stronger social purpose. We can use it to restore our services and rebuild our communities. We can answer the cry for help. This is what the Australian people are saying: it must be prosperity with a purpose. Surely in a prosperous nation we should not have 370,000 Australians on unemployment benefits for more than 12 months, many of them young people, without hope and direction in their lives. Surely in a prosperous nation we should not be losing bulk-billing doctors and Medicare services, the universality of our health system. Surely in a country like Australia we should not have children falling ill with serious diseases because their parents cannot afford the vaccines. Surely in a prosperous nation we should not have 500,000 Australians, most of them elderly, on waiting lists just to get their teeth fixed up.</para><para>That is the problem with the current government. It is a waiting list government that has turned us into a waiting list nation. It has got the wrong set of priorities. It is wasting our prosperity instead of turning it into opportunity for all Australians. Just look at Tuesday's budget: it is a political patch-up job, a short-term fix for the next election. It does not look to the long term, to the sort of future we want for our nation a decade from now. The government always spends up big before an election but then, as certain as night follows day, it claws the money back in the years that follow—through higher taxes and family debts, higher Telstra line charges and user-pays in education and health. It gives and then it takes, but it never lasts. It never lasts with the Howard government.</para><para>Tonight I want to outline Labor's alternative approach, the policies and priorities we believe are important for our country—the things we did not hear about in the budget. Labor has been listening to the Australian people—absolutely—but not just listening. We have been responding to their concerns with a new plan for the nation, a new program for social investment: investing in early childhood development; investing in our schools, universities and TAFE colleges; investing in our doctors and dental services; and investing in families and newborn babies. But not just social investment—Labor believes in investing in the environment, passing on our natural assets and heritage to the next generation and taking climate change seriously: ratifying the Kyoto protocol and establishing an emissions trading system, and establishing new national policies to save the Murray-Darling and to protect our native forests, our beaches and our coastline. </para><para>And when it comes to national security, Labor will never neglect the home front—always Australia first in our national security strategy. We will establish a department of homeland security, upgrade our port and regional airport security and create an Australian coastguard—maritime policing for our vast 37,000 kilometres of coastline. This is the future for our nation: services, conservation, security; opening up new opportunities not just for now but for the next 10 years. When I became Leader of the Opposition, I said that I wanted to be positive. I said that I did not believe in opposition for opposition's sake, and I do not. So let me outline Labor's positive alternative, our plan for Australia's future.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Economic management</inline></para><para>Our starting point is better budget management. The Howard-Costello government is the highest taxing government in Australia's history. There is no shortage of funds pouring into Canberra. Our task is to make better use of the money: to cut waste and mismanagement, to reorder priorities. While the government has gone on a spending spree, Labor has taken a different approach. For every $1 of extra social investment, we have been making $1 of budget savings—cutting back on government waste. So far we have identified more than $8 billion in savings, with more to come.</para><para>In this budget, the government is spending more than $100 million on taxpayer funded political advertising—spending for the Liberal Party, not the Australian people. The government also plans to sell Telstra, wasting $650 million on consultants and financial advisers. Under Labor we will be saving the taxpayers' money. We will be keeping Telstra where it belongs: in majority public ownership. A Labor government will reduce bureaucracy, abolishing seven government agencies and cutting a further 13 government programs. And as we examine this budget, more cuts will be made.</para><para>Not all of these decisions will be popular. Some interest groups will inevitably complain. But the decisions need to be made. Budgets are about choices and Labor's choice is this: to cut bureaucracy and wasteful spending to make way for our investments in education and health. This is also responsible economic policy. A Labor government will produce budget surpluses in each year of the next parliament, cutting net debt and holding down interest rates. We also believe in limiting the size of government. Too much spending and too much bureaucracy are bad for the Australian economy. This is why we will reduce Commonwealth expenditure and Commonwealth taxation as a proportion of GDP.</para><para>This is our budget pledge to the Australian people—our pledge of social investment, yes, but also an attack on waste and mismanagement. We also want to grow the Australian economy through more assistance for small business, backing their hard work and enterprise. We need to reduce red tape and paperwork, starting with the business activity statement. This involves huge compliance costs, with small business people filling out forms for the government instead of spending time with their families or actually running their businesses. This is why Labor will simplify the business activity statement. Our simpler BAS option will allow small businesses to use a tax office ratio to calculate their quarterly GST payments, with no annual or quarterly reconciliations. This method could not be simpler, with just one calculation and just two boxes on the BAS form. It is estimated that our policy will reduce compliance costs by 80 to 90 per cent. </para><para>Labor will also ensure that small businesses are not smothered by the market power of big business. We want a fair trading environment, strengthening the Trade Practices Act and the ACCC to protect small business against anticompetitive practices. Labor will outlaw predatory pricing and introduce jail terms and divestiture powers to deal with hard-core cartels. The ACCC will be authorised to issue `cease and desist' orders to provide immediate relief against market abuse. It will also be given new powers to deal with creeping acquisitions and the exploitation of franchisees. The Trade Practices Act is now 30 years old. It urgently needs an overhaul—new powers to protect small business against the anticompetitive conduct of big business. It is time to give the small business sector a fair go in the Australian marketplace.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Ladder of opportunity</inline></para><para>All my life I have believed in governments helping people and providing opportunity for all Australians. But I also know that people should be willing to help themselves—to work hard and to exercise responsibility. There is no way out of poverty and disadvantage without having a go and without effort. This is what I call the ladder of opportunity: the importance of hard work, strong communities and the civilising role of government. I want all Australians climbing the ladder, getting stuck in and working hard, supported by decent community services. The Howard-Costello government has been taking the rungs out of the ladder. I want to put them back in. I want to put them back in for the opportunities of the Australian people.</para><para>The first rung is education—investing in the skills and ability of the Australian people. Under the current government, this has been an area of big budget cuts. Under Labor, it will be our most important social investment. Our national reading program will help parents give their infant children the greatest gift of all: reading books aloud, building literacy in the early years. The parents of each newborn child will receive a series of story books. For parents who lack the skills to read them, Labor will provide new adult literacy services to overcome this problem. We want to invest early in education. Learning does not start on the first day of school; it starts on the first day of life. The lesson for government is to invest early.</para><para>When our children go to school with a love of reading and the ability to recognise numbers, their schools must be high-achieving schools. It does not matter whether they are government or non-government schools. That is a tired old debate. Let us move past it. I want quality and opportunity for all our students. Under Labor's new funding system, all schools will be funded on the basis of need. We will bring every school up to a high national standard of resources and achievement. The overall funding level for non-government schools will be maintained, but with a different and fairer pattern of funding distribution. Underresourced Catholic, Christian and independent schools will receive more at the expense of wealthy schools like Kings and Geelong Grammar.</para><para>We will also provide additional funds for government schools, lifting them up to our national standard of resources and results. For the most disadvantaged parts of our society, they have one great hope in life: the neighbourhood government school at the end of their street. It is their passport out of poverty. As Prime Minister I will not rest until that hope is fulfilled—until every school in this country is a good school. A Labor government will provide incentives for the best teachers to teach in our struggling schools. We will also improve school discipline through mentoring, community justice and `time out' programs. Parents have the right to have their children taught in an orderly school environment. Discipline is not an optional extra; it is an essential part of a good school learning environment. </para><para>And at the end of the school years, I do not want any talented child who has worked hard and studied hard to have to pause for a moment to consider whether they can afford a higher education. It goes against the great Australian principle that rewards in life should flow from talent and hard work, not your bank balance. That is why we will implement Labor's $2.3 billion Aim Higher policy: 20,000 extra university places and 20,000 extra TAFE places, without the need for slugging students. We will reverse the government's 25 per cent HECS hike and abolish its full fee system. We do not want $100,000 university degrees. We want opportunity for all—a pathway to excellence in education.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Youth Guarantee</inline></para><para>But still, not every young Australian will take advantage of these opportunities. We need to reduce the school drop-out rate and tackle the crisis in youth unemployment. Each year in Australia we waste the skills of 45,000 young people who leave school early and do not go on to full-time work or study. They are at risk of becoming a lost generation—dropping out of the system, dropping out of society. In some communities, the problem is critical: youth unemployment rates of more than 30 per cent in places like Wollongong, the northern suburbs of Adelaide and Wide Bay in Queensland.</para><para>As a society, we cannot afford to waste the potential of so many young Australians. We must give them new opportunities to work and to develop their skills. But so too, we need to demand from them a new level of responsibility—making good use of the education and employment services of government, working hard and having a go. Tonight, I can announce that a Labor government will create a youth guarantee: young Australians in either employment or education and training. Under our policy, young people will have just two options: they can be either learning or earning. There will be no third option of sitting around doing nothing. We will provide additional work and training opportunities, and young people will be obliged to participate—to do something good for themselves, their families and the community. Learning or earning—there will be no third option under a Labor government.</para><para>We will abolish TAFE fees for all secondary school students—a financial benefit for these students and their families. This policy will also encourage an extra 15,000 students to stay on and undertake vocational education and training while still at school. We will also create 7,500 new apprenticeships plus 7,500 TAFE places for 15- to 18-year-olds. For those who want to move into work, we will create a Jobs Gateway—wage and training subsidies to give 10,000 early school leavers opportunities in the work force. We will also support 5,000 homeless and disadvantaged youth, with life skills and training opportunities.</para><para>I say to young Australians: `If you fall, we will pick you up. We will help you, but we also expect you to help yourself—to respond to our youth guarantee, to be hungry for new skills and employment.' The youth guarantee is a $700 million investment in solving one of our most pressing social problems: the youth problem. It is a long-term investment in Australia's future, a chance to give our prosperity a true social purpose. </para><para>Our policy involves the employment of 1,100 training mentors working directly with young people at risk of dropping out. The mentors will help with education and employment but also social skills. We should never forget this social dimension in helping young Australians, giving them a sense of belonging and purpose in their lives. We need mentors right across the community—role models who can teach troubled teenagers the difference between right and wrong. This is why a Labor government will establish a national mentoring foundation, providing training support and other resources for 10,000 new mentors. We will also bring thousands of extra men into our schools—male teachers and community leaders to assist with the all-important development of boys.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Health Care</inline></para><para>Another rung on the ladder of opportunity is health care. Medicare must be a universal system, with good public hospitals and bulk-billing doctors available across the country. If it is not universal it is not Medicare. The government talks about a safety net. But you do not need a safety net unless you have turned the health system into a highwire act and families are in danger of falling off.</para><para>Labor does not believe in a safety net. We believe in Medicare, and we will never give up on increasing the rate of bulk-billing. We want it at 80 per cent:</para><para>	Increasing the patient rebate by $5 for every bulk-billed consultation.</para><para>	Providing incentive payments of up to $22,500 for doctors who each bulk-billing targets;</para><para>	And making more doctors and nurses available in regional Australia.</para><para>In areas where bulk-billing has collapsed, a Labor government will provide Medicare teams—salaried doctors and nurses to deliver bulk-billing through public hospitals and community health services.</para><para>There is another responsibility we will meet in the health system: the provision of dental services. It is not just a moral responsibility—it is actually in the Australian Constitution. If the current government will not carry out its duty to the Australian people, Labor will. We will create a national dental program: a $300 million investment with an extra 1.3 million dental procedures for aged pensioners and health card holders. This will clear away the existing backlog and give our senior citizens what they deserve: the care of a civilised society in getting their teeth fixed up.</para><para>The government says that this is a budget for families. But without a decent health system, what guarantees do we have for the future of our families? Every year in Australia 1,800 children contract the deadly pneumococcal disease. Today, I met one of the affected families—the Brooks family from Canberra. On Anzac Day, their 15-month-old daughter, Bella, was diagnosed with pneumococcal and began a fortnight-long battle for her life. Fortunately, young Bella is now out of danger and recovering well. I met her earlier today. She is a great young child and we wish her all the very best. But this is not always the case. Every year in Australia, 50 babies do not survive this disease.</para><para>In an attempt to save lives, the government's expert advisory group has recommended that a new vaccine against pneumococcal be made available to every baby free of charge. Yet this government, in all its meanness, has refused. Why can't it see the compassion and commonsense of this policy—saving the lives of children like Bella Brooks? The vaccine costs $500 and many families simply cannot afford it. They are having to make a choice—one of the worst choices in life—between their limited finances and the health of their children. Nothing could better illustrate why our health system must never become a two-tiered system and why Medicare has to be saved—a universal system, not a welfare system. Nothing could be more important in the creation of a good society than funding this essential vaccine. That is what Labor will do in government, making it available to every Australian child free of charge. Our babies cannot wait any longer. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Family polic</inline><inline font-weight="bold">y</inline></para><para>Another rung on the ladder of opportunity is the balance between work and family—spending decent time with our children and nurturing the next generation of young Australians. Let me congratulate the government on introducing a new baby care payment—$3,000 for working and non-working mothers to help ease the financial pressures of a new bub in the home. I announced this policy two months ago, so I am delighted to see it in the budget. And I hope the government also adopts Labor's policy to spread the payment over at least three months rather than pay it as a lump sum.</para><para>It is like the reform of parliamentary superannuation. It does not matter where good ideas come from—Labor or Liberal. Let us get them done for the benefit of the Australian people. A Labor government will take this agenda further. We will improve the rights of working parents, especially their ability to return to part-time work after having a child. In government, we will also overhaul and improve the tax and family assistance measures in this budget.</para><para>When he was first elected, the Prime Minister promised to govern for all of us. In this budget, he has forgotten about most Australians. He has forgotten about the hard workers on less than $52,000 a year—the sales reps, the technicians, the shop assistants, the teachers, the office workers; the very backbone of the Australian economy—who expected tax relief in the budget but got nothing; not one red cent. For them, last year's sandwich and milkshake looks like a feast.</para><para>Since 1996 the average Australian household is paying an extra $9,000 in federal taxes. Yet, in this budget, four out of every five families and singles have missed out on a tax cut. They have been forgotten by the government, but not by Labor. We will implement a bigger program of tax relief—a broader and fairer tax plan for the future. That is the best way of growing the Australian economy: giving people incentive and reward for effort, and ensuring that the hard workers—the people who do the overtime and the families with two or three jobs—receive a decent return on their work.</para><para>Prior to the next election, I will be announcing our tax plan for Australia—a broader and fairer plan; fairer for low income earners and broader for middle Australia. It will be a tax policy that will put incentive and productivity back into the Australian economy. This budget introduces three new taxes that affect business. Labor has a policy for a tax cut—to the superannuation contributions tax. We will reduce the rate from 15 per cent to 13 per cent. We want retirement savings to work for the retirement years—not be eaten up by taxes, fees and charges. And I give the House this guarantee: we do not support the Treasurer's policy of `work till you drop'. Labor will always protect the age pension and the superannuation system.</para><para>For families, the government has produced a policy for the next election, but not a plan for Australia's future. The new lump sum payment is compensating families for bad government policy—its inability to overcome the family debt crisis. More than 600,000 Australian families have family benefit debts averaging $900. They are unlikely to ever see the lump sum payment—it will be eaten up by their existing debt. The government is spending money without necessarily solving problems. In this regard, it needs to take a lesson from families themselves. </para><para>Raising a child is not a temporary job. It takes long-term commitment, planning and care. And that is the way governments should approach family policy: don't patch it up for today; get it right for the future. That is what a Labor government will do. Families need more assistance and we will provide it in a more effective way:</para><para>	resolving the family debt crisis;</para><para>	providing greater incentive for families in the interaction between the tax and social security systems;</para><para>	and paying the assistance when the families need it most—not at the end of the year, but fortnightly as the bills come in and as the children need new clothes, shoes and school books. Let us pay it when the families need the support.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Conclusion</inline></para><para>Tonight I have outlined the way in which Labor will answer the cries for help I have been hearing across Australia; cries for social investment and opportunity—health, education and community services.

They were compelled to leave the country with their parents at the age of 18. Mr and Mrs Schembri were both forced to renounce Australian citizenship at the age of 18 in order to retain Maltese citizenship after they moved to Malta with their parents. This was a requirement of Maltese law at the time. This law was changed in 2000. They have maintained close and enduring ties with Australia through their numerous relatives in this country. They see their future and the future of their children in Australia, yet the government denies them the ability to reacquire Australian citizenship because they are over the age of 25. </para></talk.start><para>Several of Mr Schembri's relatives, all citizens of Australia, are known to me and my staff through their involvement in community activities and service. Mr Schembri is a qualified solid plasterer and has been offered employment in Australia. His trade qualification is relatively rare and highly desirable in this country. Maltese law, prior to 2000, required young people of Maltese descent to renounce their Australian citizenship between their 18th and 19th birthdays in order to retain their Maltese citizenship. Those failing to do so became ineligible for free tertiary education in Malta and were unable to hold certain jobs, access social security benefits or purchase property without approval. </para><para>While the Australian government says it is unable to provide a proper estimate of numbers, it is understood that there are, at most, a couple of thousand Maltese Australians who have renounced their Australian citizenship because of this provision. It is highly unlikely that every single eligible person will apply in this regard. Minister Hardgrave has indicated that the Maltese community has raised the issue with him and that it is under consideration. I consider the minister's position to be a cop-out, given the history and given the unfair application to Maltese Australians. It is not immediately clear why this needs to be in line with age requirements on citizenship by descent, other than from a sense of bureaucratic tidiness. Meanwhile, many people are suffering needlessly from this law, and Australia has very little to gain and much to lose by denying many former Australians the chance to contribute meaningfully to the Australian community. </para><para>In my electorate there are many Maltese Australians and many who suffer from this inequitable situation. I think it is about time that we changed the law, given the discriminatory nature of its application. Labor is looking to consider this matter and to change the law in order to ensure that people such as Steve and Lillian Schembri will be able to become full Australian citizens, as they were prior to going to Malta, where they were forced to renounce their Australian citizenship. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Budget 2004-05</title><page.no>28715</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>28715</page.no><name role="metadata">Cobb, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JOHN COBB</name><name.id>00AN1</name.id><electorate>Parkes</electorate><party>NATS</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I feel very moved at this time to talk about the neglect of roads and branch lines in country New South Wales, especially in my electorate of Parkes. This is at a time when thankfully the coalition, and John Anderson in particular, has announced the extension of the Roads to Recovery program, with another $1.2 billion over four years. The 14 local governments in the Parkes area have fallen over with relief that the Commonwealth is doing that. On top of that, a further $1 billion for country roads was announced in the budget. It is to be announced soon how that money will be disbursed. But we also have well over $3 billion in the budget towards road and rail infrastructure. This is very necessary. The neglect of country roads and rail in my electorate is very damaging.  </para></talk.start><para>The West Wyalong to Burcher line is being closed. We have more trucks on the roads and less maintenance being given to them. I felt so strongly about it that I recently mailed out a request for people to send in a response about what they felt about branch line closures and maintenance around my electorate. We have over 2,000 responses by people who did not just have to put a cross in a box and send it back; they had to put their own stamp on it and mail it. That is an enormous response from an electorate when we consider that most of those people live in towns. I hope that, on behalf of my constituents, Andrew Stoner, the leader of The Nationals in New South Wales, will present their responses to the state government—to Mr Costa and to the minister for roads. There will be road closures in my electorate if the state government continues to ignore the result of failing to repair country branch lines.</para><para>Thankfully, the ARTC is taking over and getting $540 million to spend on the main lines in New South Wales in a month's time—that is, before the end of this financial year—but it is still up to the state government to pay the cost of maintaining those branch lines, which they are not doing. Obviously, they are considering closing a number of them. It is vital that Carl Scully and Mr Costa think deeply before they do any more closures and stop spending money and that they back up what the Commonwealth is trying to do for transport and communications in the electorate of Parkes.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Budget 2004-05</title><page.no>28716</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>28716</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Byrne, Michelle, MP</name><name role="display">Ms O'BYRNE</name><name.id>84S</name.id><electorate>Bass</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This week's budget has done little to advance the core concept of social sustainability: social systems such as health and education and the wellbeing of our community. When we take a look at our social systems we find a health system in excruciating pain and an education system starved of funding. The Howard government knows that Medicare needs fixing but it insists on bandaid solutions and cover-ups. The government had a perfect opportunity with this budget to inject much-needed funding into the health system, but fixing Medicare is not in the Treasurer's leadership campaign strategy; he obviously bought that through an `Acme' kit. If we turn to education we find a similar story: the very crucibles of advancement being starved of funding. </para></talk.start><para>In Bass I have urged the government to support some simple environmental initiatives but so far there is no support there either. I refer to initiatives such as the extension of the wood heater program to combat the declining air quality, the need to develop the sewerage capacities of Launceston due to the current inadequacies of the Tea Tree Bend plant, and strategic planning for coastal town developments for towns such as Bridport. </para><para>I recently wrote to the environment minister seeking support to examine the environmental and social impacts of increasing water flow through the Cataract Gorge in Launceston to address the health of the South Esk River. I am still hopeful that the minister will respond to this initiative and to the other measures that will restore the quality of the Esk River. A clear picture is emerging: the government is not sponsoring social sustainability, it does not protect the vulnerable and it does not even support equity in health and equity in education. </para><para>This budget is an election platform, not a foundation for social sustainability. The Costello push for leadership has begun by delivering tax cuts and family benefits for a very lucky few. This budget fails to deliver tax relief or assistance for three out of five Australian families, including thousands of Tasmanians. In Bass only 7.7 per cent of income earners receive in excess of $1,000 a week. As we see, there will be a tax cut for only some families. And what the Treasurer did not announce on Tuesday night was that the $600 payment to FTB recipients would be first used to offset any outstanding debts—and we know that they average $900. </para><para>I also want to use this opportunity to explain how angry and disgusted I am that this government failed to fund the pneumococcal vaccine. In Tasmania in 2002, 61 people contracted pneumococcal meningitis and 11 died; in 2003, 86 people contracted the disease. That is a high proportion in relation to the number of people who contracted the disease and the number of fatalities in the rest of Australia. I call on this government to finally do something and fund that important, independently recommended vaccine.</para><para>In the forthcoming election the people of Bass will have a very clear point of differentiation: a Latham Labor government—with its key platform of equity, fairness and opportunity for all—or more of the same Liberal arrogance.

She stunned the world at the age of 18 by winning three gold medals in athletics. From that moment, Betty Cuthbert became Australia's golden girl. After injury forced her withdrawal from the Tokyo Games, she then came back with an extraordinary victory in the 400 metres in Rome, thus becoming, with four gold medals, the most successful Australian athlete in Olympic history. You may not be aware that Betty comes from Ermington in the heart of my electorate of Parramatta, where she and her twin sister and their family grew up. The family still has a nursery in Ermington. She is our most celebrated citizen, and the main street of Ermington is called Betty Cuthbert Avenue.</para></talk.start><para>There is another extraordinary group of people in Ermington and they are gathered around the Burnside Family Learning Centre. They are a group of families, particularly mothers, who are concerned for the future of their kids; they want the best for them. They came and saw me and said, `What can we do to improve the opportunities for our kids?' There were about 20 mothers and we talked and met together quite a few times. Out of those meetings came this idea of a festival that would celebrate the best in Ermington. We would pick the young kids in Ermington who had most excelled in sport, academia and elsewhere, and bring them together. We would invite all of the other people—the churches, the community organisations, the Police Citizens Youth Club et cetera—and we would have a day celebrating the achievements of Ermington.

They travelled for over two hours from Bunbury to my electorate to ask me to present this petition to the House. They did not give it to their own MP, the member for Forrest, because they were not confident that he was actually interested in making submissions on their behalf. Apparently, he did not even give them the courtesy of a response to their correspondence. I was very happy indeed to agree to their request but extremely unhappy that the petition needed to be made at all. The students hope that in presenting this petition during the May sittings they might be successful and prevail upon the government to maintain the scheme, which allows students an eight per cent discount on the cost of eligible textbooks. Of course, this week's budget has dashed those hopes and condemns these students and others like them to further unreasonable hardship.</para></talk.start><para>The Educational Textbook Subsidy Scheme was introduced initially, as we know, to offset the impact of the GST. As we also know, the GST is still with us, and growing. The Educational Textbook Subsidy Scheme should still be with us as well. The failure to extend the scheme indefinitely highlights the government's bad faith on this issue—and, as an aside, I trust that the Democrats have learnt their lesson. This petition argues that the abolition of the subsidy is, in effect, an extra tax of some $40 or more per year on some of the most disadvantaged members of our society. That figure is borne out by a survey undertaken by the vice-chancellors called <inline font-style="italic">Paying their way: a survey of Australian undergraduate university student finances, 2000</inline>. It confirms that the average annual expenditure by students on textbooks—and this would apply to TAFE as well—was around $368, with the average for full-time students being $396. These are 2000 figures and, even with those now out-of-date figures, the removal of the eight per cent subsidy will mean an immediate annual increase of around $32.</para><para>That might not seem like a lot of money to some of us, but having to find that additional money means that students have to make a choice between working, attending classes or even eating.

Australia claims to be a civilised society—and I suppose compared with certain other parts of the world we have a lot to be proud of—but I have to say that, as an elected representative in the national parliament, I am very disturbed to find that in 2003 a child was able to be abducted and disappear without trace—and, despite the best efforts of his family, the police and the entire community, no trace has as yet been found of him.</para><para>I say to the Morcombe family that my best wishes and prayers are with them at this time.

This debate on Iraq has been dubious from the beginning. I was never in favour of sending troops there, for exactly the reasons that are coming out now. We do not know for how long they will be committed if it is left to the Americans. We are, after all, part of an invading force that has removed a country's leader and is now putting in place a government that by its very nature of appointment is supposed to be a puppet of the USA. This is not a recipe for success in the Middle East. The Iraqi affair has really had nothing to do with terrorism. The weapons of mass destruction are not there—and no-one really knows whether they ever were—and the world is being deflected from putting its energies into stopping terrorism.</para></talk.start><para>Australians should not be a part of the Iraq conflict. They should never have gone. This was a political war, one the Bush family wanted to have to make up for not finishing the first Gulf War. But Australia has very professional and successful troops. They have shown that they can keep out of trouble and still do a good job under very difficult conditions and leaders. Australians have always been well respected and able to carry out military and peacekeeping duties in an unequalled fashion. I am very proud of our troops, but they cannot be used as pawns in a political war.</para><para>Mark Latham is right in wanting to withdraw the troops from Iraq before next Christmas. I think they should come home as soon as possible. They do have other duties that they could and should have been doing closer to home. But that is not to say that our troops will never be used to assist countries that require help with peacekeeping. We have a number of small forces in our region at present, doing a fantastic job. I visited some of them myself recently in East Timor; I have the greatest admiration for the work they do in sometimes very basic situations.</para><para>As far as Iraq is concerned, there needs to be a lot more development work done there. It has been stripped of its economy and its ability to act independently. There will be a role for some time to come in helping to put this country back together. But any assistance should be through the United Nations on a much more practical basis—not a political one. When the UN can again take up its role as mediator and peacekeeper, it is likely to ask all the countries under its umbrella to help sort this mess out, and that I am sure would include Australia. Labor believes that Australia has a moral obligation to deliver the strongest level of economic and humanitarian aid to Iraq possible, given our involvement in the original invasion and the most recent World Bank-UN needs assessment, which indicates a large shortfall in the aid funding for the Iraqi people. </para><para>Mark Latham rightly pointed out that the troops currently in place in Iraq should come home. I believe that too. The picture is tainted over there. When there is a situation where peacekeeping is required and the invading forces have gone home, then there will be an opportunity to reassess any UN resolutions that could request assistance from us and other peacekeeping forces around the world. That is a choice for the new government. If a new, Labor government believes that we should concentrate our efforts closer to home and on Australian soil then I believe that is the direction that should be taken. It should be a measured and practical response, not a political one to use as a tool at election time.</para><para>By the way, what is the point of having intelligence briefings that are deficient in vital information? And isn't it interesting that the Prime Minister seems to know word for word what those briefings apparently contained? Not only that, but isn't it conceivable that some of those briefings might actually contain the truth that the Prime Minister does not want to hear? We live in peculiar times when these secret briefings are spread over the front pages of morning newspapers. Now we have this added dilemma of the abuse of Iraqi prisoners. This is not helping anyone's cause in trying to take the moral high ground in this debate.</para><para>These prisoners may have been fighting against coalition forces but one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter. Only the courts should judge whether they are guilty of some crime. They should be treated as human beings. That is part of the Geneva Convention. It is a question of ensuring that abuses of human rights are not condoned. The Western nations have responsibility in ensuring that justice is done and is seen to be done, without treating prisoners like animals.</para><para>If one reads resolution 58/187 of the United Nations General Assembly, dated March 2004 and entitled <inline font-style="italic">Protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while counte</inline><inline font-style="italic">ring terrorism</inline>, it reaffirms:</para><quote><para>... the fundamental importance, including in the response to terrorism and the fear of terrorism, of respecting all human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law.</para></quote><para>This resolution reaffirms the basic tenets of the stance of the United Nations in the light of current events. The United Nations must be allowed to set the international rights of the world. There is no good to come of denying responsibility, either. If we are in coalition, we are in coalition. It is the whole which has the responsibility. No-one should pass the buck. We ought to have known what was going on and we ought to be able to speak up if it is inappropriate. As our shadow spokesman for foreign affairs, Kevin Rudd, said at a doorstop recently:</para><quote><para>Unfortunately John Howard needs to read the III Geneva Convention and work out that it is a Howard Government legal obligation to provide for the proper treatment of Iraqi POWs...why do we have these things called the III Geneva Convention and the IV Geneva Convention? They were agreed in 1949 because the international community looked at the horror of World War II and decided there had to be a better way to govern the treatment of POWs and civilians in times of war. Australia signed that in 1949 and under the Menzies Government ratified it in 1954. So when John Howard says at a political level `hey this is a George Bush problem, this is a Tony Blair problem, but it's not a Howard Government problem', he should read the text of the III Geneva Convention which says that it's an Australian legal responsibility. </para></quote><para>No country is squeaky clean on human rights but it is important that we go for the highest common denominator, not the lowest, and ensure that our processes for dealing with prisoners of war and detainees for one reason or another are fair and just.</para><para>I still do not believe that we should have been part of the coalition that invaded Iraq. The country has had a long history of invasion and it is natural that many of the tribes that make up the Iraqi people will object to outside interference, even if they had a loathed leader. There have been many loathed leaders in the world who have been removed without the help of the US. Iraq has been a terrible mistake and now we have to disengage with the minimum hurt to either Iraq or our own forces. Then we need to look at doing the right thing by providing practical assistance when we are asked to do so.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>28722</page.no><name role="metadata">Hatton, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HATTON</name><name.id>LN6</name.id><electorate>Blaxland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This is the end of debate on the motion originally put by the Prime Minister on 30 March this year. The original motion, which I have a copy of here, has two parts to it. We are asked today to `take note of the paper' moved and that the following words be added to the motion `and to the Prime Minister's and the Leader of the Opposition's speeches of 30 March 2004 to the Prime Minister's motion relating to ADF personnel in and around Iraq.'</para></talk.start><para>When the Prime Minister spoke on 30 March, he let off what was really the first major shot of the election campaign which is almost upon us. What he sought to do was to drag into political debate the situation of our forces in Iraq. He sought to do that through the two parts of the motion that he originally put to this House. That motion we are debating here. That was changed because the Prime Minister did something that was quite extraordinary. There was an intended division on a motion— put forward by the member for Cowan, Mr Edwards, and seconded by the member for Lalor—that these two parts be split into two. The Prime Minister came into the House and in fact forestalled the division and agreed to these two parts being split. As far as I know, that is almost unprecedented in the history of the House. </para><para>If there had been goodwill in the first place, if this notice of motion had not been designed as a political tool to attempt to split the Australian Labor Party from its support base in the community on the question of ADF personnel in Iraq, then the Prime Minister would not have had two parts to this motion; two parts that were conjoined in the first place and not meant to be split. I think it was his intention to absolutely portray the Labor Party as not being in support of our troops in Iraq and to use that politically against the Labor Party, to use it as a mechanism to try to win favour and support in the community, and to use our military personnel as weapons in that way. </para><para>Eventually this motion was split, but it should have been two separate motions in the first place. I will read the first part of the motion. The Prime Minister gave notice that at the next day of sitting he would move that this House: </para><quote><para>(1) expresses its continued support for and confidence in the 850 Australian Defence Force personnel currently deployed in or around Iraq and records its deep appreciation for the outstanding professionalism they have displayed in carrying out their duties; </para></quote><para>That is a pretty simple, direct and straightforward contention. As Mr Edwards, the member for Cowan, later argued, there is nobody on the Labor side who would contend with any of what was said in part 1 of the motion. That is why he called for the Prime Minister to split it, because everybody on the Labor side could stand up and support that part. He argued, quite rightly, that the Prime Minister's intent to fold that into part 2, which we could not support, was in fact diabolical. He called on the Prime Minister to do a couple of things. He talked about campaign medals. Secondly, he said that the second part of the motion should be split from the first. I will read the second part so that we can see the context. It reads that this House: </para><quote><para>(2) is of the opinion that no elements of this contingent of Australian Defence Force personnel should be withdrawn until their respective tasks have been completed and that no arbitrary times should be set for such withdrawal.</para></quote><para>We know the context for the Prime Minister putting this second part forward. We know that he sought in his time-honoured fashion to identify and then exercise a wedge between the Australian Labor Party and the Australian people. He saw an opportunity to seek political advantage by utilising our military personnel, whom he had placed, on his order and the order of his government, in a situation of great and pressing danger by committing them to the war in Iraq in the first place and then continuing to have those personnel based in Iraq after the formal cessation of hostilities more than a year ago. The member for Cowan quite rightly called on the Prime Minister to split the motion. He said:</para><quote><para>Our troops are entitled to have motions put before this House which are designed to truly reflect the support that members of parliament on this side have for them and their families. This motion does not do that. Indeed, this motion of the Prime Minister's lets our troops down. It thrusts them into areas of policy and political division which are not of the troops' making. The Prime Minister can fix that. I call on him, in the interests of keeping our troops out of the political firing line, to do this. </para></quote><para>He then moved a motion to split these two parts of the Prime Minister's original notice of motion. </para><para>The Prime Minister, extraordinarily, came into the House and said that he agreed to it. He then went on to say:</para><quote><para>I have just come into the House and I understand that there has unexpectedly been a motion from the opposition to suspend standing orders in order to split the motion. I do not in any way want to force the opposition to vote against a generic expression of support for Australian forces. I do not.</para></quote><para>Why did he put it in in the first place? It was purely to seek political advantage. He was forced, under the impress of the parliamentary debate, to step back from that naked use of his motion to try to seek pure partisan political advantage. </para><para>The member for Cowan is a former member of Australia's defence forces. He was badly injured in Vietnam. He lost both legs as a result of a landmine incident there. He is someone who can speak for Australian Defence Force personnel who have been properly committed by an Australian government to serve overseas, whether or not one agrees with the context that they are committed in, no matter whether the particular war is the current war in Iraq, the previous war in the Gulf or the war in Vietnam. No matter what the context or the debate is about the rights or wrongs with regard to committing troops, the fundamental reality is that Australian troops, once committed, should be supported by the Australian people and the Australian parliament—and they have been. And the member for Cowan's point was absolutely crystal clear—this was the Prime Minister's attempt to use these troops politically. I am glad that, for once in the House, the Prime Minister could be forced into a position where he had to retreat from what was a grubby exercise in political manoeuvring. Australia's defence forces, the Australian people and the parliament deserve better than this dreadful exercise to put our troops at the very point where they become the issue, rather than the larger area of debate. It was right to split that motion. </para><para>Let me go to the broader questions of the context. The current war against Iraq has had different approaches. Labor and the coalition have taken entirely different stances with regard to whether we should be there and whether it should be prosecuted. Labor said that we should not be there, because it was not UN sanctioned, because this was a small coterie of nations joined together in a small coalition that did not have the broad support of the West—including most of the countries in Europe and, we argued, the Australian people—or of the general community of the United Nations. We also said that military adventurism in Iraq would take away our necessary concentration on the war against terror, which was real, which was pressing and which needed to be prosecuted with the greatest vigour possible, as it had been in Afghanistan. It needed to be prosecuted worldwide in defence of civilians from all of the countries of the West who are imperilled by the continuation of that very war operated by al-Qaeda and its associated organisations.</para><para>We argued, quite properly and correctly, that the adventurism of another war in Iraq would not add one jot or tittle to the solution or prosecution of the war on terror. We argued that this was, in fact, something that the Bushes—both former President Bush and the current President Bush—had taken on as a particular area of the concern for themselves and for the Republican Party. There was a determination on the part of the current President Bush to prosecute this war in Iraq come what may. He made the decision right at the start of his term, not later—not after September 11 but right at the beginning—to deal with unfinished business from the previous Gulf War. I think that was wrong. We know that there was a major debate within his administration, which was split over whether or not they should go into Iraq. I think that Colin Powell and the others who argued against it did the right thing; they put the argument that the war on terror was the chief thing that should be pursued and that defence personnel should not have their lives put at risk not only in the initial phases of a war but in what might happen afterwards.</para><para>What we are seeing now is what was predicted by some people at the time; that is, that winning the war in Iraq was the easy part. Afterwards, we have the occupation by those powers which have a responsibility for what happens there—Australia being one of those, Britain another and the United States another. The occupying powers have a specific set of things that they have to do. They have to look after the local civilians, and they have to ensure that all of the normal provisions of food, education and health are seen to. </para><para>We have a situation now where there is no-one but the occupying powers with that impress on them—the United Nations did not stay—and we have had another war develop after the full conclusion of hostilities. We have got a significant problem because we have a small number of Australian personnel currently there—not the SAS, who were pulled out almost immediately after the war was signalled to have finished over a year ago—who are there to guard our people in the embassies, to train people in the Iraqi police and defence forces, and to protect those Australians who are teaching others how to do air traffic control and so on. I know how effective those Australian troops have been. One of my neighbours was one of the people from Foreign Affairs stationed in Baghdad from the beginning; he is now home. I have heard from him just how effective those forces have been. </para><para>We also know that there is a great morass in Iraq. What stood in front of Colin Powell and George Bush Snr at the end of the Gulf War—the prospect that if they went through to Baghdad and took out the existing regime there could be a civil war in Iraq—is clearer and more apparent than it was a year ago, but the prospect was there strongly a year ago. That is what stopped them more than 12 years before. Our Australian troops are in an unenviable situation in Iraq. They are there and they continue to need our support, and they have that support from the Labor Party and the Australian people. They should not be put in a position, as the Prime Minister sought to put them in on 30 March, where the level of danger that they face increased, making them a more pointed target for those people who might seek to destroy them in order to make a political point the other way. Our troops should be above and beyond being taken up in the maelstrom of Australian politics. The Prime Minister should not have attempted to use them for political purposes on 30 March. The splitting of the motion was right. They should continue to have our support without political edge. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>28725</page.no><name role="metadata">Bevis, Arch, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEVIS</name><name.id>ET4</name.id><electorate>Brisbane</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Our troops in and around Iraq are, as always, doing a very important job, a very good job, as some of the best trained and best disciplined troops anywhere in the world. Unfortunately, though, they should not have been called upon to undertake this task. The battle in Iraq today is no longer a battle simply of guns, missiles and tanks; the battle in Iraq today is a fight for the hearts and minds of the Iraqi people—and, in that, America and its allies have lost the battle. In view of the recent photographs of mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners, I suspect that that is irrevocably lost and that it would not be possible to establish the confidence of the people necessary to win what is now a battle for the hearts and minds of the people in the streets and in the villages.</para></talk.start><para>Worse, there is now evidence that al-Qaeda has a foothold in Iraq and is cultivating some of the uprisings, a fact that did not exist before the invasion. Let there be no mistake: as bad and abhorrent a dictator as Saddam Hussein was, he was not a religious fundamentalist with links to al-Qaeda or any similar group. I have no doubt that, had members of al-Qaeda put their heads inside Saddam Hussein's Iraq, he would have very quickly put them up against a wall. There was no love lost at all between Saddam Hussein and those involved in al-Qaeda, including Osama bin Laden. Indeed, there is evidence of animosity between them.</para><para>Instead of being seen as liberators, the United States and its allies are now seen as occupiers by the Iraqi people. That is not a position from which we can build a nation. It is not a position from which we can obtain the trust of peoples in order to establish any coherent society. It is now even more important that America take a step backwards, moving back from its position of control and confrontation in Iraq, and ensure that the United Nations is given a much greater role not just in the conduct on the ground but in the broader management of affairs in Iraq.</para><para>The justification for the invasion of Iraq was not based on some lasting high principle but on varying political exigencies. We were told originally that there were weapons of mass destruction and that this presented a clear and present danger to the Western world—12 months after the war has ended, there is not a shred of evidence to support that. As that became clearer throughout the conflict, the United States and its allies changed their rhetoric—including our own Prime Minister and foreign affairs minister—from one of removing weapons of mass destruction to one of regime change and, then, as the political mood shifted again, to one of providing freedom to an oppressed population. </para><para>The justification for this invasion has been false from the beginning. As a party to this invasion, Australia has made one of the worst strategic mistakes that I think has been made since the end of the Second World War. It is high time that we refocused our efforts directly on the war on terror and removed ourselves from this terrible conflict in Iraq that has caused instability in the region and worsened global security.</para><para>These are not views of hindsight. The first occasion this parliament had to discuss this matter was in February 2003. I, along with a number of people, sounded the warning of these problems at that time—as similar warnings were being sounded in the United States and the United Kingdom. I want to refer to some of the comments I made in February of last year—well before the conflict had started—identifying these very problems. I quoted at the time the views of General Zinni, a very senior ranking officer of the United States forces. He said:</para><quote><para>You could inherit the country of Iraq, if you're willing to do it—if our economy is so great that you're willing to put billions of dollars into reforming Iraq. If you want to fight with other countries in the region to try to keep Iraq together as Kurds and Shiites try and split off, you're going to have to make a good case for that.</para></quote><para>Unfortunately, General Zinni's views, with which I strongly agreed, have proven to be the case. America and, by implication, those who joined in the invasion have now inherited a country of some 20 million people who do not want our patronage. Any doubt about that should be dispelled by a cursory look at the evening news. In my speech I also referred to the views of another highly decorated US general, General Clark, who told the US Senate Armed Services Committee that war with Iraq would `supercharge' recruiting for al-Qaeda. General Clark was right in his predictions about that—predictions he made well before the war commenced, predictions I referred to in a speech to this parliament in February of last year. Now we see, sadly, those predictions coming true as al-Qaeda feed upon the discontent to recruit more to their cause of extremism. </para><para>I made this comment in this parliament more than a year ago:</para><quote><para>... were this war on Iraq to occur in the current circumstances, it would undermine rather than support the war on terror. Security would almost certainly be worse in many nations, including Australia. Any hope of resolving the underlying causes of terrorism and overcoming the factors that extremists feed upon as they seek to recruit future terrorists would be dashed.</para></quote><para>Sadly, those words I mentioned some 14 months ago are now coming back to haunt us as the global security environment degrades week after week and as terrorist threats increase week after week. We now find ourselves in the situation of being advised against travelling to Greece for the Olympics, because even in Greece there are concerns about terrorist activity.</para><para>The world is a much less secure place because of the invasion of Iraq than it was before the invasion of Iraq. This has been one of the great strategic errors of the last 50 years. I commented on 5 February last year in this parliament:</para><quote><para>It is far too simplistic to equate the war on terror with war against Iraq. Worse, it is wrong ... The world should not be sidetracked into a debate about the virtues of Saddam Hussein's Iraq at the expense of the war on terror. Nor should we focus diplomatic and military efforts on Iraq at the expense of the war on terror.</para></quote><para>That is even more the case today than it was when I said those words in February last year. It is a sad case that many Liberals whom I discuss this with in forums where this issue comes up regularly say, `We can't change the past. Let's not talk about the past. Let's move on and see what we can do to fix the problem.' I agree that we have to look at what we can do to fix the problem. But let us be clear about this: the reason Liberals do not want to talk about what happened last year is that they now know they were absolutely wrong. Whether they were wrong by conviction or wrong by stupidity is irrelevant; they were wrong and they committed our country to a war of invasion that we should not have participated in. Today we have Australian troops in an area of high threat who should not be there. Worse, as a result of the government's folly—as a result of their willingness to follow unquestioningly the views of the American administration—we are now in a situation where our national security has been disadvantaged and where global security is much worse than it was before—and, indeed, than it should be. </para><para>It is past the time when we need to be fair dinkum about two things. We need to be clear about honestly approaching the problems in the Middle East, which go well beyond the borders of Iraq and involve a long-term and viable solution to agreed boundaries for the states of Israel and Palestine. We also have to be clear that the problems in Iraq are not going to be solved by guns, tanks and missiles. There has to be an economic and a political solution to the problems in Iraq and, sadly, America is ill equipped to provide that. In real dollars—that is, adjusted after inflation—America has already committed more money to Iraq than was spent on the entire Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe. That is a frightening statistic. Europe after World War II was rebuilt at a lower cost than the cost of the war in, and reconstruction of, Iraq so far. The cost in Iraq to date is just the tip of the iceberg, and, while that is a cost to America primarily, other countries are being asked to share it. And for what?</para><para>In Afghanistan we still have, by all reports, al-Qaeda cells operating at will in the provinces, with war lords still linked to those terrorist groups. Even within the capital, Kabul, there are regular terrorist attacks and there have been a number of assassination attempts on the president. Even in the capital city security is threatened. People have forgotten the problems in Afghanistan. We were right to go to Afghanistan; I supported the Australian deployment in Afghanistan. There was within the borders of that state another terrorist state that had no regard for the life of people around the world. I had no difficulty whatsoever in wholeheartedly supporting our deployment there. I regret that America and many of its allies have now turned their backs on the problems in Afghanistan, thrown the ball to Europe and said to the European members of NATO, `You can now try to fix up the problems in Afghanistan and get order there.'</para><para>How much better would it be if America had 100,000 troops in Afghanistan today instead of having sent 200,000 troops to Iraq? I put it to you and to the people of Australia that both the region and the world would be much more secure if there were a secure and stable government in Afghanistan, free of the impact of the tribal leaders and the al-Qaeda operatives who still function within Afghanistan, largely as they please. How much better would it be if we had focused our diplomatic, economic, military and intelligence-gathering attention on the problems closer to home—the difficulties that we confront in our region with Jemaah Islamiah? I have already mentioned the issue of al-Qaeda in Afghanistan but we also need to remember that in a sense these organisations function like international crime: they need the money to fund the things they are doing. How much better would it be if our attention had been focused on those who finance terror—on those who fund the extremists who preach violence in their schools and in other locations? We have dropped the ball as a country. America has dropped the ball as the leader of the world in dealing with this war on terror, to pick up a misguided whim of George Bush Jnr, slavishly followed by John Winston Howard, and we are all now paying a heavy price for that. Our troops in the Middle East are called upon to pay a heavier price than the rest of us because their daily lives are threatened by their deployment in those regions.  </para><para>Modern terrorism pays no regard to geography. The prospect of a traditional nation versus nation war is remote, and we are all pleased that that is the case. But when we look at the threat that we face today from non-state terrorism we realise that someone could be trained in Afghanistan today and undertake acts of terror in Spain, in our country or anywhere else in the world just as easily as someone could be trained in a terrorist camp in Asia and undertake deeds of violence in Europe, America or anywhere else. Geography is of no consequence in this. We need a global response to this threat, and that global response must include a military and strategic response. However, the war on terror will never be won by military means alone. The war on terror requires that there be economic and diplomatic measures to deal with the underlying causes—the reasons that people are recruited to do these violent acts. That has to be addressed, and precious little has been focused on that. What if some of the billions—I understand that the American Congress is approving $US1 billion a week for the war on terror—had gone to address the underlying economic and social concerns that allow these extremists to cultivate young people? Surely it is time that we took a rational approach to this. In Australia it is time that we analysed our national security interests according to Australia's needs, not George W. Bush's needs. Very often Australia's and America's needs will coincide, but when they do not we need a government that recognises that we are not the deputy sheriff of the United States.

The program is the Private Forest Reserve Program, which was formed to protect 100,000 hectares of private forest reserve in Tasmania. When the agreement was signed in 1997 by the Howard and Rundle Liberal governments, it was agreed that the program would receive $30 million in federal funding. The $30 million was broken down into two components: $20 million was committed from Tasmania's share of the National Heritage Trust and $10 million from other sources. The $10 million was transferred to the Tasmanian trust fund at the start of the program, and the money and interest earned were to be used for the program's running costs. The major proportion of the PFRP funding was the $20 million from the NHT. This was to be held in Canberra and transferred at quarterly intervals to Tasmania to pay landowners for direct costs associated with their signing perpetual covenants. I fear the Howard government is threatening to take back the $9 million remaining of the original $20 million. This would brutally end this important environmental program. </para></talk.start><para>The initial time frame for the Private Forest Reserve Program to distribute the $20 million to landowners signing perpetual covenants was by July 2002. This was unrealistic, as many factors such as all statutory agreements, advisory bodies and approval processes needed to be developed. Teams of people including biologists, administrative clerks and negotiators had to be recruited and trained; and, on top of creating a whole new program, delays were also encountered by the necessary accountability requirements put in place by the federal government. As a result there was a significant delay in starting the PFRP. In addition, there was reluctance by property owners to take up the program offer, as the federal government had neglected to change the capital gains tax rules and Centrelink income rulings. Long-term lobbying saw these serious impediments overcome in 2001 for capital gains and in 2003 for Centrelink and the deeming of income. I am happy to say that I was able to play a part in securing these changes. The program is now proceeding as planned and on track with its 2001 business plan endorsed by the federal government. It has secured protection in perpetuity of 27,641 hectares of important native forest and private land.</para><para>On 31 May 2002 the federal environment minister granted an extension of the time frame for the expenditure of the $20 million NHT component of the PFRP funding, to 30 June 2004. This extension was given on the proviso that specific improvements to the program were made. These improvements have been made, as indeed requested. In June 2003 the federal government advised that it was in their interests to transfer the remainder of the $20 million from the NHT—an amount of $9,914,052—to the Tasmanian trust fund. Unfortunately, the Commonwealth forced the inclusion of clause 6.2, which stipulated that if the funds were not expended by 30 June 2004, the money was to be returned to the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth insisted on this clause and, as such, the state had to agree.</para><para>In December 2003 and again in April 2004 the Tasmanian ministers for the environment wrote to the Hon. David Kemp, requesting an extension to this deadline. No response has yet been received to either of these urgent requests or to my letter of 27 April 2004. Why is this? As of 10 March 2004, the remaining NHT component of this funding was $8,892,562, a considerable amount. Ironically the Howard government have announced a further $350 million in funding in their 2004-05 budget, yet they appear set to revoke funds already allocated. This is truly giving with one hand and taking with the other. The Howard government need to extend the deadline for the Private Forest Reserve Program, preferably to 2010, to allow realistic time frames for the expenditure of the remaining NHT funding. This would allow this important environmental program to protect a further 40,000 hectares of under-reserve forest in Tasmania. Due to the fast-approaching deadline for the withdrawal of the previously allocated NHT funding, I hope the environment minister will respond to both my letter and the Tasmanian environment ministers' letters with haste.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Ryan Electorate: Centenary State High School</title><page.no>28729</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>28729</page.no><name role="metadata">Johnson, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JOHNSON</name><name.id>00AMX</name.id><electorate>Ryan</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In April I had the opportunity to represent the federal Minister for Education, Science and Training, the Hon. Dr Brendan Nelson, at a terrific new local school in my electorate, Centenary State High School. It was a great opportunity for me and a terrific day for the school as they opened a new general learning area block worth some $1.45 million. </para></talk.start><para>The federal government funding that contributed to this building is going to make a terrific difference and add to the school's world-class facilities. The capital works project was entirely funded by the federal government, notwithstanding the suggestion by Labor members and the Labor government of Queensland, through the local member in the local press, that they made a contribution to this project. That certainly was not the case.</para><para>These state of the art facilities are exceptional and will provide a wonderful environment for the local students and contribute to their learning and being able to realise their potential.</para><para>I take the opportunity in the parliament to acknowledge the fantastic work of the principal, Mick Mickleburg—and his deputy and current acting principal, Dallas Miller. The administration and leadership of the school makes a difference. They provide wonderful leadership and an environment in which the students of Centenary State High School can reach their potential.</para><para>Centenary State High School also has a great reputation in the local community. The school's facilities are used by a large number of community organisations. I want to acknowledge that the school allows this very generously. The new learning block for the Centenary State High School is a facility that I am sure the local community will also be able to use. It will be for more than just students.</para><para>I also had the opportunity of using the facilities of the school last month when I hosted the inaugural Ryan youth leadership and development forum. To be able to bring 150 students from throughout the Ryan electorate to Centenary State High School was a great pleasure for me. It also again highlighted the local school to the rest of the Ryan community.</para><para>All schools are doing very well under the Howard government. In every budget of the Howard government since our election in 1996 grants to every state and territory have increased. Funding for schooling has increased substantially and in Queensland the Australian government funding for state schools in 2004-05 will total almost $530 million, a 4.5 per cent increase over the past year. In this year's federal budget the government have allocated record funds of $7.6 billion to Australian schools for 2004-05. This is unprecedented funding for schools and continues the trend over the last seven or eight years of Howard government budgets giving tremendous recognition to education and opportunities to students throughout the country to realise their potential.</para><para>I want to pay tribute to all those in the country whose lives are dedicated to our young people and who make a contribution by giving opportunities to our young Australians. Those people work to create an environment that will help young people to make a great contribution to our country in the future. Schools throughout the country, both public and private, are dedicated to doing this. It is important that all members of parliament represent all schools throughout the country, not just one sector of the schooling community. There seems to be a lot of emphasis on public schools. That is certainly not entirely appropriate. Schools, both private and public, should have the full support of this parliament.</para><para>Labor's rhetoric and attacks on the coalition's record on schools are hollow politics. The people of Ryan should be aware that this is not acceptable. I will certainly be conveying to the Ryan community, and the many parents who send their children to the substantial number of independent schools in the Ryan electorate, the policy differences between the government and the opposition. I am sure that come election time they will be asking very tough questions and wanting answers on these issues. Let me pay tribute to the Centenary State High School for the work that they are doing in the local community. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Human Rights: Mr Mordechai Vanunu</title><page.no>28731</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>28731</page.no><name role="metadata">Albanese, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ALBANESE</name><name.id>R36</name.id><electorate>Grayndler</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish to use this opportunity to raise the human rights of Mordechai Vanunu, the whistleblower who exposed Israel's nuclear program in the 1980s and who was recently released from prison after serving 18 years. The Vanunu family migrated to Israel in 1963. Mordechai Vanunu was a good Israeli citizen who served his time in the Israeli army. He then went on to study philosophy and worked for 10 years as a mid-level technician at Machon 2, a top-secret underground bunker complex at Dimona in the Negev Desert, which built components for nuclear weapons. Vanunu expressed dissent as to what was occurring there. He was given a warning, and then in November 1986 he was made redundant. He took with him photographs of the inside of the factory.</para></talk.start><para>He became a backpacker and travelled through Asia down to Australia, where he became associated with Australians at the St John's church in Darlinghurst and met Reverend David Smith—a friend of mine and former Marrickville citizen of the year who is known as `Fighting Father Dave', who serves at Dulwich Hill. Vanunu then travelled to London and gave his story to the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Times</inline>. In Leicester Square he met an American woman, `Cindy', who befriended him and persuaded him to travel with her to Rome. It turned out that she was a Mossad agent, and whilst in Rome on 30 September 1986 Vanunu was overpowered, assaulted, drugged, kidnapped and smuggled back to Israel unconscious on a boat. He was brought to court for a secret trial. Israel had maintained a policy of nuclear ambiguity, neither confirming nor denying that it possessed nuclear weapons. It was protected from scrutiny by the United States and its allies. Vanunu's evidence showed the world that Israel had developed between 100 and 200 atomic bombs and had gone on to develop neutron bombs and thermonuclear weapons.</para><para>He was found guilty of treason and espionage and sentenced to 18 years imprisonment, served at a prison in the southern Israeli town of Ashkalon. He was held in solitary confinement for 11½ years. His cell was six feet by nine feet with no windows. His request for parole was denied at least six times, but he was finally released on 21 April this year. However, his punishment continues. Avraham Poraz, Israel's minister of the interior, has issued an order forbidding Vanunu from leaving the country for one year after his release. Also, Major General Yair Naveh, head of the Home Front Command of the Israel Defense Forces, citing quite extraordinarily the Defence (Emergency) Regulations from the British mandate period of 1946 prior to the formation of Israel which were subsequently incorporated into Israeli law, has ordered Vanunu not to speak with anyone about his employment within the Dimona program. He is also prohibited from approaching foreign embassies or consulates or conversing with non-Israelis. These restrictions are in force for six months and are renewable. Vanunu's lawyers are contesting these restrictions, which were provided for when Vanunu was originally tried and punished. This is a fundamental violation of due process. In support of these new restrictions, Israeli officials have cited national security concerns, but who could believe that information held by a junior technician 18 years ago continues to be relevant?</para><para>The double standards in this are astonishing. At a time when the world has gone to war over weapons of mass destruction, this individual was jailed for 18 years and held in solitary confinement for 11 years for exposing the reality of weapons of mass destruction being held in Israel. It is believed today that Israel has the world's sixth largest nuclear arsenal, with small tactical nuclear weapons, nuclear landmines and medium-range nuclear missiles launchable from air, land or sea. It is quite clear that Mr Vanunu is not safe where he is at the moment. This is not a sectarian issue. This should be of concern to all those who have an interest in nuclear nonproliferation. Israel is one of the three countries in the world that have refused to sign up to the nonproliferation treaty. It is important that all people of goodwill, apart from sectarian issues, defend Mr Vanunu's human rights. I congratulate Reverend Dave Smith and will be working with him to ensure that those rights are upheld. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Casey Electorate: Anzac Day</title><page.no>28732</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>28732</page.no><name role="metadata">Smith, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANTHONY SMITH</name><name.id>00APG</name.id><electorate>Casey</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—A nation can expect no higher individual commitment from its citizens than to serve their country in a time of war and conflict. The recent Anzac Day services across our country and in all of our electorates reminded us of the strong commitment to and the sacrifice for the ideals and the freedoms that we all hold so strongly. Anzac Day keeps the memory of Gallipoli and the First World War alive so that younger generations know of the sacrifice and can keep that spirit alive.</para></talk.start><para>But of course Anzac Day is also very much about the men and women who served Australia in some of the important conflicts that followed the First World War to protect those same values and freedoms. It is worth reminding ourselves constantly of the sheer number of Australians who served our nation in times of need. In the Second World War, 990,000 men and women served in various capacities in our services. In the Army, just over 26,000 lost their lives; just over 2,000 in the Navy; and 11,000 in the RAAF. More than 66,000 Australians were wounded in the Second World War. In Korea, 17,000 served, 339 lost their lives, more than 1,200 were wounded and 29 were taken as prisoners of war. In Vietnam, 42,000 served in the Army, almost 3,000 served in the Navy and 4½ thousand served in the RAAF. As we know, 520 were killed and 2½ thousand were wounded.</para><para>Like all members in the chamber, I was once again privileged to attend Anzac Day ceremonies. I attended ceremonies in Croydon, Lilydale and Monbulk. The dawn service in Lilydale had a huge crowd, as did the service later in the morning in Monbulk. On the day, many people, including many radio commentators and those in the media, expressed surprise that the crowds were still so large on what we all recall was a very wet and wintry day. But really this should be no surprise at all—just confirmation that Australians hold their beliefs strongly. They attend these services because of their enduring and unshakeable commitment, and nothing will keep them away.</para><para>The work that goes on in preparing for Anzac Day is often overlooked because of the focus on the day itself. In the brief time available to me, I would like to pay tribute to some of the many dedicated RSL members who work tirelessly each year selling Anzac Day badges and selling poppies before Remembrance Day. All of the funds are used in the RSL's welfare work. Many contribute right across the electorate and right across Australia, but I would particularly like to pay tribute to Mr Frank Voutier of the Croydon RSL. Each year he visits hundreds of Melbourne's businesses in the outer east. He also visits schools and community groups and sets himself up in the local shopping malls to sell as many Anzac Day badges and poppies as he possibly can. He has become a feature of the Croydon community and pretty much owns Main Street, Croydon, in the weeks leading up to Anzac Day, with his self-made badge display, where he sells badges to all and sundry. </para><para>The magnitude and dedication of his work and the work of many others who assist him in that area saw the Croydon RSL receive the status of the top Victorian sub-branch for sales in the 2003 Poppy Appeal, where they raised nearly $30,000 single-handedly. The Australian community needs its Frank Voutiers, and we are fortunate that there are so many like him across the country in all of our electorates, doggedly building and preserving that Anzac spirit. Their dedication to our nation in times of war and conflict is of course matched by an identical dedication to the welfare of the veterans and the communities in which they live. We must never forget their sacrifices. On behalf of the outer east and the Yarra Valley, I wish to publicly recognise Frank's efforts and those of so many who assist him not just on Anzac Day but throughout the entire year.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Agriculture: Apple and Pear Industry</title><page.no>28733</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>28733</page.no><name role="metadata">Zahra, Christian, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ZAHRA</name><name.id>84H</name.id><electorate>McMillan</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to raise today in the parliament an important issue relating to a key agricultural industry. As you and other Tasmanians would know, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, the federal government is revisiting the plan of allowing apples from New Zealand to come into Australia. This is something it has had a real agenda on for some time, causing an enormous amount of concern in the apple and pear industry in Australia, an industry which has been a great contributor to rural and regional Australia over many years. There is a long history to this issue. I am sure members of this House can remember that in the year 2000 Biosecurity Australia published a draft import risk assessment promoting and suggesting the importation of New Zealand apples. The draft proposed that New Zealand apples be allowed into Australia, which caused an enormous amount of concern. In 1998 AQIS first had a look at this issue. Before that, as you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and other people with an interest in this issue would know, the case for allowing New Zealand apples into Australia had been made in 1989 and was rejected by the Labor government. Previously, right back in 1921, the case had been made by New Zealand to allow their apples into Australia. Because of the risk of fire blight, the government then took the view that that should not be allowed. </para></talk.start><para>My real concern is that all of this sneaky behaviour on behalf of those people pushing for the importation of New Zealand apples into Australia has caused a great deal of uncertainty for apple and pear growers in Australia. The handling of this issue by the federal government is a textbook example of poor public policy and poor public administration by government. What we have seen over six or seven years is the federal government being incapable of making a decision in Australia's national interest when it comes to this issue. We should have a government that stands up and defends Australia. We should have a government that is proud to protect the interests of apple and pear growers in Australia—not a government that uses its agencies in order to promote the interests of apple and pear growers from a foreign country. We need to see some action from the federal government to decisively indicate to ordinary people in Australia who run these apple and pear orchards that it will not sell out their interests to New Zealand. </para><para>You, Mr Deputy Speaker, and the other Tasmanians in this parliament understand just how hard ordinary apple and pear growers work. In many cases they are the second and third generation of people on those orchards. Why is it that the Howard government does not stand up for these people who have contributed so much to the rural and regional areas in which they operate for so many years, in some cases for a number of generations? Why is it that we do not have a government that is prepared to take a stance on this issue in Australia's national interest? Why is it that we do not have Liberal and Nationals members opposite standing up in this parliament and advocating on behalf of these hardworking small business owners who have made such an important contribution? They work hard all their lives and pay taxes all their lives and have contributed so much to our national economy. I say to the parliament today that enough is enough in relation to this issue. We have seen the hardworking apple and pear growers of Australia have to put up with delays, changed processes, obfuscation and failure to make a decision from the Howard government for too long. </para><para>Enough is enough. These people should be focusing on their businesses. That is what they do best. They do not want to have to spend a third to a half of their time every week in lobbying the Australian government to stand up for Australia's national interest. That should be automatic. We should have a government in Australia that stands up for Australia's national interests and that understands and recognises the fundamental truth that bringing fire blight apples into Australia would be an absolute disaster for the apple and pear industry in this country. I say to the Howard government: stop sitting on your hands in relation to this issue; stand up for Australia's national interest and ban the importation of New Zealand apples into this country.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health: Cancer</title><page.no>28734</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>28734</page.no><name role="metadata">Farmer, Patrick, MP</name><name role="display">Mr FARMER</name><name.id>00AMO</name.id><electorate>Macarthur</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Cancer is a huge burden on our society. It is responsible for nearly 20 per cent of deaths and disabilities in this country. Around 34,000 Australians die from cancer each year. According to figures from the Bureau of Statistics, cancer is the most common cause of death in Australia. From the government's perspective, it takes up about six per cent of the national health budget. Australia is one of the few countries in the world where cancer mortality is actually falling for both men and women. In fact, the survival rate for many common cancers has increased by more than 30 per cent in the past two decades. The federal coalition government has played an important part in this statistic and has a strong record in developing and implementing effective cancer control measures.</para></talk.start><para>In our first year in office in 1996, we took the proactive step of making cancer control a national health priority, and we created a framework for a national cancer control plan. The following year, we established a national cancer control initiative to provide expert advice on all issues relating to cancer control. One of the strengths of this initiative is a partnership with the Cancer Council Australia, which has taken a strong lead in the fight against cancer at the community level since the 1960s. Representatives of the Cancer Council recently approached me with a practical plan for the government which would potentially save thousands of lives and millions of health dollars. The Cancer Council Australia and the Clinical Oncological Society of Australia have put forward a very strong case for a $5 million investment in infrastructure funding for cancer clinical trial groups. Based on the success of previous clinical trials, a $5 million investment could generate returns of tens of millions of health dollars each year. This type of investment stands to save thousands of Australian lives and reduce the suffering and premature disability associated with some cancers.</para><para>Clinical trials are the only reliable scientific method of testing whether treatments such as drugs, surgical procedures and radiotherapy work; whether one treatment is better than another; how to integrate treatments better; whether new treatments are better than older treatments; and, for treatments of equivalent effectiveness, determining which treatments cause fewer side effects and provide better value for money. Clinical trial groups have generated a number of remarkable successes, both in Australia and abroad. For example, studies in advanced breast cancer found that a high-dose chemotherapy with bone marrow transplantation was no better than a standard dose of chemotherapy. The estimated cost saving is $50,000 per patient—a total saving of around $50 million each year—and up to 1,000 patients a year will no longer have to endure an arduous, high-dose treatment. </para><para>An Australian trial in testicular cancer, the most common cancer in young men, found that one type of chemotherapy cured more patients and saved more lives than another; yet before the trial the two treatments were considered equally effective. Clinical trials also help to ensure that expensive new treatments are introduced in a careful, informed way, based on sound evidence and quality control. The Cancer Council puts a strong case in arguing the government's need to fund infrastructure for clinical trials through a respected community partner such as the Cancer Council Australia.</para><para>While the pharmaceutical industry conducts its own product related trials, I believe the government has a clear role in ensuring that trials are conducted which consider cancer treatments without a commercial motive. The Cancer Council Australia has a proud history of working cooperatively with government to help put the needs of the community first. I believe that the Cancer Council Australia would help to guarantee that clinical trials focus exclusively on the broader health gains of this important part of the fight against cancer. I would like to place on the public record my support for the Cancer Council's clinical trials and my endorsement of Cancer Council Australia's case for a $5 million investment in clinical trial infrastructure funding. On the advice I have received from the Cancer Council Australia I believe that additional support for Cancer Council clinical trials infrastructure funding would have significant short-term and long-term economic and health benefits for all of Australia.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Communications: Community Broadcasting</title><page.no>28735</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>28735</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MURPHY</name><name.id>83D</name.id><electorate>Lowe</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In 1993 the then federal Labor government's decision to give favourable consideration to a recommendation of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure ensured a sixth high-power national television channel was made available for community access. Eleven years later, I bring to the attention of the parliament the current crisis in community television and the shameful way Community Television Sydney, the current operators of Channel 31, have been treated by the Australian Broadcasting Authority and their masters—the Howard government.</para></talk.start><para>For 11 years CTS has provided local and international news, information and entertainment programs to Australians of non-English-speaking backgrounds, including the Italian, Greek, Lebanese, Chinese, Vietnamese, Tamil, Indian and Croatian communities in my electorate of Lowe and across Sydney on Australia's sixth free-to-air channel, Channel 31. After 11 years of successful operation, reaching over 1.3 million people every month in Sydney alone, the ABA has decided not to renew the temporary licence of CTS but instead to award a permanent licence to another, less experienced, provider, Television Sydney—TVS.</para><para>There are at least two important issues concerning the way in which CTS was treated which can only be described as grossly unfair. The first is the absurd length of time the ABA took to finally make its decision to grant a permanent licence. The second is that, having made the decision to disregard the application from CTS and grant the permanent licence to TVS—a consortium that I understand will not be ready to broadcast until 2005 at the earliest—neither the ABA nor the Howard government have indicated whether or not CTS will be allowed to at least continue broadcasting until TVS is ready. This would obviously be in the public interest and in the interests of the CTS staff, program providers, volunteer networks and other stakeholders. </para><para>When my constituent Mr Salvatore Scevola, an important program provider of the <inline font-style="italic">Italian Television Network</inline> which broadcasts on Channel 31, approached me earlier this year informing me that the ABA had been investigating the granting of a permanent licence to CTS for over two years and that Channel 31's temporary licence was about to expire in just over two weeks, I was furious and determined to take the fight to the government on behalf of Mr Scevola. I immediately asked the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts question No. 3270 appearing on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper </inline>on 4 March this year to expedite the granting of a permanent licence to CTS. I also made representations to the ABA chair, Professor David Flint, to have CTS granted the permanent licence—to no avail.</para><para>We now know the permanent licence has gone to Television Sydney, but I want the minister for communications to explain why the ABA abandoned CTS after 11 years and overlooked their submission for a permanent licence, ignoring more than 200 letters of support, including letters from numerous members of the government's own backbench. I have also asked the minister for communications another question, No. 3443, calling on him to explain why the ABA awarded the permanent licence to TVS when their proposed programming schedule reveals that they only intend to provide 3½ hours of ethnic community broadcasting per week—nowhere near the 18 hours per week currently being provided by CTS. Even worse, it appears that the new licensee, TVS, will not be able to broadcast before 2005, which breaches the ABA's guidelines under subsection (2) of section 84 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992.</para><para>The minister for communications needs to explain what the programmers at CTS, the sponsors who support community television and the 1.3 million viewers of Channel 31 in Sydney are supposed to do for the next eight months. It is clear that the Howard government is not interested in these viewers or anyone who supports community television. This may surprise some people, but it does not surprise me and it does not surprise the people in my electorate of Lowe, who understand and are outraged by the appalling way the Howard government is prepared to reward Australia's most powerful media owners at the expense of our democracy by ripping up Australia's cross-media laws through the <inline ref="R1534">Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002</inline>, which is in the Senate at the moment. The Howard government's proposed media laws will allow the largest media owners to own television stations and newspapers in the same city. This will mean fewer journalists and fewer opinions, and it will damage Australia's democracy.</para><para>In conclusion, given the Howard government's media policies and its failure to promote media diversity in Australia, its contempt for CTS and Channel 31 is tragically predictable. However, I know Mr Salvatore Scevola will not give up; I know CTS will not give up; and I know the people who support community television in my electorate of Lowe and across Sydney will not give up. And I am sure they look forward to the opportunity to sack the Howard government when the federal election is held later this year. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Local Government: Mayoral Elections</title><title>Law Enforcement</title><page.no>28737</page.no></subdebateinfo><title>Law Enforcement</title><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>28737</page.no><name role="metadata">Gambaro, Teresa, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GAMBARO</name><name.id>9K6</name.id><electorate>Petrie</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to congratulate Brisbane's new Lord Mayor, Campbell Newman, whose outstanding victory recently in the local government elections was an overwhelming victory for the people of Brisbane and for accountability in local government. That accountability, sadly, was missing under the previous Labor civic administration. Campbell Newman stands for what the people of Brisbane overwhelmingly voted for: a city hall that listens to them, consults them, treats them with honesty and respect and puts their quality of life before Labor Party factional or financial interests. Anyone who doubts how Labor ran things in Brisbane should look at the example of a neighbourhood group in my electorate who fought the previous Labor city hall administration and the state government that ran it.</para></talk.start><para>Last year, the Remick Bushland Preservation Group were fighting to save six hectares of native vegetation that was used and cared for by locals as a community open green space. The land is owned by the state government, which lodged a development application to council against the wishes of the local community. The community fought back, forcing the state government to withdraw its development application from council. The state government then played a game of payback by threatening to sell to a private developer instead. The group wrote to me, quoting the state government's ominous `inference that as a consequence we would suffer a development “far less favourable” than the development by the state government'. Is it any wonder that that ward recently went to a Liberal candidate? Before the election, the candidate took up this issue with the community and with the sitting state Labor member, Terry Sullivan. His only response was to ask how the community, through council, would fund a buyback from the state government. On its web site the Beattie government claims to recognise:</para><motion><para>That public spaces and natural landscapes make an enormous contribution to the social, cultural, spiritual and environmental health of our community.</para><para>That having access to natural environments adds significantly to the quality of life of all Queenslanders who live in an increasingly urbanised society ...</para><para>Empower communities and secure solid partnerships with local government and regional communities ...</para></motion><para>I call on the Queensland government to live up to those fine words—and they are fine words on that web site—and to hand over the Remick Street bushland preserve to the Brisbane City Council to be held in trust for the local community.</para><para>I would also like to place on the record my appreciation of the Prime Minister's recent announcement of the $20 million community crime prevention initiatives in our local communities around Australia. This is an investment not only in the security and safety of ordinary Australians but also in the peace of mind of those who are most vulnerable in society. Community organisations are the logical place to tackle the increasing problems of vandalism and petty crime on our quality of life. No-one is better placed to fund long-term solutions than those grassroots organisations.</para><para>In my electorate of Petrie I am no stranger to the problem. I know from first-hand experience the frustration, inconvenience and expense caused by petty crime like vandalism. A more unlikely setting for it is very hard to find than the wonderful environment of my electorate office on the Redcliffe waterfront, where the blue waters of Moreton Bay lap against a palm-fringed lagoon straight out of a holiday brochure. But over the past two months, like all businesses fronting this wonderful panoramic view of the bay, my office has been the subject of repeated vandal attacks which have shattered every plate glass window in every pub, cafe and small business. And no sooner is the glass replaced than it is smashed again. The inconvenience and the economic impact are pretty self-evident. </para><para>Less visible, though, but even more damaging is the way in which fear spreads among the most vulnerable members of our community: the elderly who live alone in their homes, whose last shred of security is stripped away, who have become too scared even to indulge in the innocent pleasure of visiting shops and who fear that they will be the next victim. It is some time since I proposed a scheme to set up a community telephone network coordinating the local Neighbourhood Watch, Red Cross, Rotary and other organisations to make daily phone calls to local elderly residents living alone and to check on their security and safety. The recognition by the Australian government of the role that such a community organisation can play in protecting the vulnerable is very welcome. I look forward to helping organisations in my electorate avail themselves of this funding to ensure that the most frail members of our community, the elderly, are called each day to see whether they are okay and to ensure that they have dignity, safety and respect in their own homes.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Roads: Funding</title><page.no>28738</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>28738</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MARTIN FERGUSON</name><name.id>LS4</name.id><electorate>Batman</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise this morning to raise some very important transport infrastructure issues. In passing, I will make some comments on the Brisbane metropolitan area. I noticed that the member for Petrie referred to the recent election of a new mayor of the City of Brisbane. I simply say that infrastructure is about honesty and integrity and actually putting your plans out for proper public consideration. In the lead-up to his election the mayor promised a range of major infrastructure tunnels in Brisbane. I suggest to the House this morning that only one of those tunnels—the east-west tunnel—actually stacks up in financial terms.</para></talk.start><para>I therefore call upon the Mayor of Brisbane to release for public scrutiny all the costings which he claims to have that do not require a call on the public purse in terms of the range of tunnels he proposes be constructed in the Brisbane metropolitan area. It is about time people were forced to come clean about promises they make before the election and their capacity to actually deliver them after the election.</para><para>In that context I want to call for Australia to have a national land transport plan. I notice that the Minister for Transport and Regional Services in this week's budget finally put a date to the release of the AusLink plan: Monday, 7 June. That is interesting, especially when we were told with the release of the green paper in November 2002 that the final paper was not far down the track.</para><para>I want to raise some important questions in terms of what might be released on 7 June. I suggest to the House that the government's approach to a national land transport plan, titled AusLink, is not a constructive approach to infrastructure planning and delivery in Australia but more importantly an exercise to shift cost and responsibility onto state and local governments. This is a very serious issue because in Australia in the 21st century we are falling further and further behind on the infrastructure front—and not just in roads and bridges and access to ports and railways but also, for example, in access to the communication system. </para><para>We, first and foremost, therefore need an independent infrastructure advisory council to actually assist all levels of government in making decisions on independent objective criteria so we can take the politics out of decision making and make sure that the projects that we select are selected for the right reasons. That goes to one of my primary criticisms of the proposed AusLink plan. On numerous occasions since November 2002, and this is a national issue, the Minister for Transport and Regional Services and, in more recent times, the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads have said, fairly and squarely, that the government does not regard the national highway as any longer a full Commonwealth government responsibility. I want to make it clear that I believe that the Commonwealth, in terms of land transport in Australia, has a national responsibility.</para><para>Our freight task is going to double. It is not going to happen overnight. It is happening every week of the year. What we require is a system of rail and freight national opportunities for us to move that freight on in the future. That means we have to take the politics out of decision making and move away from the cherry picking of projects—as will occur under AusLink on the national highway system—and provide a guarantee that one level of government, the Commonwealth government, accepts the ongoing responsibility for maintaining and improving our national highway system.</para><para>I say today on behalf of a range of communities around Australia that an AusLink plan which does not provide for the Commonwealth to maintain a full commitment to the construction and maintenance of the national highway system is unacceptable. It is unacceptable, for example, for the people who have to use the Hume Highway. It is unacceptable to the people of Melbourne awaiting the construction of the Deer Park bypass. It is unacceptable to the people who depend on the Ipswich Motorway. It is unacceptable to the people who depend on the Bruce Highway; for example, those who saw the Bruce Highway recently cut because of flooding at Tully.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>0V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Slipper</name></talker><para>—What about Scoresby?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LS4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MARTIN FERGUSON</name></talker><para>—It is also unacceptable to the member who interjects, because his own community depends on the Commonwealth accepting responsibility for the Bruce Highway.

This year was no different. On Anzac Day 2004 I attended seven different commemoration services, all over the electorate. It is heartening to see the increasing crowds each year. You would have seen the increasing crowds in your own electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, particularly the numbers of young people who come out to dawn services and to the various main services. It is important to remember the fact that in this nation we have freedom, stability and a way of life that has made us the envy of people throughout the world. To go to Anzac ceremonies is to recognise the sacrifice made by so many, and the lives of so many others which were risked, in the cause of making sure that we have the free society that we do. </para></talk.start><para>The services I went to included the dawn services at both Maroochydore and Kawana. Through a strange quirk of climate, the dawn breaks a whole hour later at Kawana than Maroochydore, which meant I was able to go to both services. I went to the Buderim main service, the Caloundra main service and a lunch with the veterans at Maleny—an area which has been returned to the Fisher electorate from Longman in the recent federal redistribution—following the ceremony there. I also went to the service put on at the Centaur Memorial Nursing Home at Caloundra.</para><para>It is always humbling to talk with veterans, who have given so much to ensure that we have the way of life we do, about their wartime experiences. Perhaps the increase in attendance year by year is a recognition that the world is not a safe place and that there are new and different threats confronting our nation, particularly with the war against terror. I think that all of us recognise the wonderful role carried out by ex-servicemen and women in making our country a safer place.</para><para>When we look at the fact that today we have some 2,000 personnel deployed on more than 10 operations around the world, we see that the role being carried out by our personnel today is every bit as important as the role carried out by those who participated in world conflicts. Our personnel are involved in the rehabilitation of Iraq, the war on terror and peacekeeping missions in East Timor, the Solomon Islands and other places. They are carrying on the wonderful tradition of the Australian armed forces, protecting our way of life. On behalf of my constituents in the electorate of Fisher, I want to take this opportunity to thank all of our serving and past personnel for their contribution to our nation.</para><para>I think the continuing interest in Anzac Day commemorations is also a result of the wonderful programs being run in schools, both government and non-government, which ensure our young people learn about our heritage and the conflicts that have helped shape the Australian society that we enjoy today. A number of schools in my electorate held Anzac Day ceremonies, and I was able to attend Mountain Creek State High School, Talara Primary College and Conondale State School. I was particularly pleased to be able to distribute the Anzac Day Saluting Their Service information packs, posters and badges for students to schools throughout my electorate so that they could all use them to prepare for, and as part of, their Anzac Day commemorations.</para><para>I have been pleased to talk with many students and teachers to encourage students to take further part in Anzac Day commemorations by entering the Anzac Day Saluting Their Service awards. These awards are an initiative of the Howard government, designed to support schools in developing innovative ways to commemorate the Anzac tradition and learn about the importance of Australia's maritime heritage.

Schools have the option to enter class or whole-of-school activities, and every school that enters will receive a certificate acknowledging their participation.

I was surprised to receive representations in my office from two young Australians who have been treated shabbily by immigration authorities at Heathrow and Manchester airports in England. Many of us have unfortunately experienced the intolerable, inflexible and authoritarian attitude of immigration officials in our travels around the world. Australia has had a long and strong bond with what was once called our mother country, the United Kingdom. Prior to the formation of the EU, countries once part of the British Empire, and subsequently the British Commonwealth, were given some priority when it came to entering Britain. Now, as one enters either Heathrow or Manchester, one is shuffled to the periphery, sidelined almost as an alien. One has to justify why he or she should be allowed to enter a country our forefathers fought and died for in two world wars. As members of the coalition of the willing in the war against terrorism, and with our involvement in the war in Iraq, one would have thought that we should have some reasonable entry at any time into the United Kingdom as Australian citizens. Unfortunately, the terror paranoia that is being fostered by the US administration and implemented by the US immigration authorities is now being adopted by the UK immigration authorities.</para></talk.start><para>Vijesh Nandan, a 22-year-old Tasmanian, suspects that he was interrogated and refused entry to Britain because of his colour. VJ, as he is known to his friends, had twice been to the UK on a working visa, the last time working at a Leeds court. VJ suspects that because he looked like a potential threat to the UK he was taken aside, questioned repeatedly and body-searched, despite having sufficient money and a return air fare to Australia. VJ says:</para><quote><para>I kept asking why they were doing this. I thought it must be the way I look.

VJ has also lost $3,000, the cost of his ticket. </para><para>A couple of days later, a 30-year-old former student of mine, Tyrone Gregs, was similarly humiliated when he reached the UK. Tyrone had worked and saved $4,000 to have a three-month visit to the United Kingdom, which was going to include attending a wedding in Scotland at which his girlfriend was to be the matron of honour. British immigration officials implied that he planned to stay and work illegally in the country. Tyrone said:</para><quote><para>It was just the way they treated me, like I was scum trying to slip through the system. Our diggers stood side by side with this country during the war; the Queen's head is on our money.</para></quote><para>Tyrone similarly was questioned. He was handcuffed and made to wait in a glass booth while passengers passed at Manchester Airport. He was deported, using his own return air fare, and, like VJ, had a black cross placed on his Heathrow stamp. I told both of these constituents that I would raise their cases with the British High Commissioner and his office. I have done that. I am waiting to see what the bloody hell has being going on. I am still waiting, as I say, for their response. I would urge all young Australians who are thinking of visiting the UK to please get a visa, or else you might never set foot outside Heathrow Airport. </para><para>It is interesting to note that I heard, as an aside, in the House yesterday that an honourable senator in the other place who had just attended the IPU conference in Mexico was similarly humiliated by American immigration authorities, despite carrying an official passport, which we members and senators are all allowed to have. She was absolutely humiliated in one of the American airports. If you would like to know what Senator Ferris thought of the whole operation of the authorities, I would urge you to go and talk to her. This paranoia of the American immigration authorities and the British immigration authorities needs to be questioned. All young Australians who are thinking of visiting the UK, for goodness sake, go and pester the British High Commissioner, Sir Alastair Goodlad, and say to him: `What is going on? I thought we were friends and partners. Do we need a visa, or can we just rock up there, with our return air fare, and expect to be humiliated, handcuffed, body-searched and then deported on the next Qantas or British Airways flight?' It is not good enough, and it has to stop.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Parkes Electorate: Roads and Rail</title><page.no>28742</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>28742</page.no><name role="metadata">Cobb, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JOHN COBB</name><name.id>00AN1</name.id><electorate>Parkes</electorate><party>NATS</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In recent months, and in Tuesday night's budget, there has been very good news for country regions and industries, especially for the electorate of Parkes, where export industries certainly underpin the whole economy—whether that be in agriculture, mining or tourism. The one in four people directly involved in those industries are totally dependent upon export industries, yes, but also on the transport system. Transport affects whatever the inputs might be to those industries—whether it be superphosphate, grain or whatever—and also the products going out, which by and large go to ports around Australia, whether they be in Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney or Brisbane, or south in the coal region.</para></talk.start><para>I am very proud to be part of a government that has recognised that we cannot be a potential Brazil or a potential Argentina whose infrastructures have crumbled. Certainly, in the case of Brazil, this has probably prevented the potential to far exceed and surpass what Australia does in agriculture and exports generally. The reason they have crumbled and are in the economic mess that they are in—certainly in respect of the industries to which I refer—is because their infrastructure, their transport, their road and their rail systems are totally decimated in comparison with what we are proposing to do with ours. Under John Anderson, we are virtually looking at about $11.4 billion now committed towards a road and rail infrastructure program. On Tuesday night, well over $3 billion was committed straight into Auslink to join the Roads to Recovery. Also announced on Tuesday night was $1 billion, which will largely go to regional councils for roads as well. They are mostly, and very sensibly, bypassing state governments, not allowing them to take off their 15 per cent or whatever it is they choose to take out by way of administration. Going directly to local governments, or to whatever particular scheme it might be, is certainly money saving for the Australian taxpayer. In the case of the New South Wales government, I can guarantee it is.</para><para>The industries in my electorate that are going to gain so much from this renewal of the ongoing support that is going into our roads and rail is enormous. Certainly, in New South Wales, and particularly in western New South Wales, it is more important than ever. We are expanding and extending our road funding, getting into rail and taking over the ARTC under the guise of the Commonwealth, which is taking over pretty much all national rail systems. It is taking over the New South Wales rail system in the very near future and that will get, I think, $540 million in the coming month of June to invest into New South Wales main lines because of the absolute neglect that they have had from the New South Wales government. The New South Wales government has cut back its funding on roads and rail at the same time as we are expanding and taking over those things. What we find is that the minute we fund something New South Wales cuts back on it. </para><para>But the point I make this morning is that the industries we have in western New South Wales which are expanding and developing are absolutely reliant on us maintaining and expanding our road and rail system. Because branch lines are being neglected and not being kept up, it is putting far greater pressure on the roads—mostly state, local and regional roads—and they cannot carry the traffic. So, at the same time as funding is being cut back on roads and rail, the call on them is greater than it ever was. In recent times, for example, in West Wyalong in the south of our electorate, Frank Pace and his family have opened up Pace Farms, which will be the largest egg producing centre in the Southern Hemisphere. They will call upon 200,000 tonnes of grain a year. That has got to be carried and it has got to be carried on good roads. At the moment that is not happening, not out of the state system. However, through Auslink and what we are doing at the federal level, the $11.4 billion that we are committing is certainly going to make that easier. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment: Perth Airport</title><page.no>28743</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>28743</page.no><name role="metadata">Jackson, Sharryn, MP</name><name role="display">Ms JACKSON</name><name.id>00AN2</name.id><electorate>Hasluck</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Sadly, I stand here today to report to the House how this government, in particular the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services and the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, have sat idly by and allowed at least two serious cases of environmental vandalism to take place at Perth airport—with a third pending. The Perth airport site contains areas of high conservation value, including significant areas of banksia woodland that are habitat to several rare flora and significant fauna species. The site also contains areas of wetland which are recognised nationally, predominantly mapped by the state as conservation category and recognised as requiring retention. A substantial part of these bushland areas has recently been cleared or drained for commercial operations not related to core activities.</para></talk.start><para>The master plan at Perth airport recognises the environmental significance of much of the areas or precincts within the airport site. There is in addition to the master plan a memorandum of understanding which was signed between the Westralia Airports Corporation, the private lessee of Perth airport, and the Western Australian state government—indeed, it was signed by Richard Court, the former Liberal Premier of Western Australia. That memorandum of understanding determines that the Westralia Airports Corporation will consult with the state department of environment on issues that would require referral or consideration by a state agency if the land was under state rather than Commonwealth control and planning laws.</para><para>In the first case I want to refer to, Commonwealth approval was given for a large area of bushland to be cleared to accommodate a warehouse development. However, this approval was given contrary to a state department of environment submission advising that the development plan would need to be modified to minimise impacts on areas of the greatest conservation values. Indeed, the Minister for Transport and Regional Services' own environmental assessment report revealed some interesting information about the proposed development. For example, it says: </para><quote><para>The Forestfield Bushland listing also includes most of the southern section of Precinct 2C (44 hectares in extent). In terms of the proposed development, the vast majority of this precinct will be cleared. Approximately 38 % of the precinct is covered by vegetation rated as part of the top 5% of remnant vegetation remaining within the Perth Metropolitan Region. This vegetation is found over much of Precinct 2C in both the north and east and it is difficult to see how such a large structure could be sited without significantly impacting on these values. Alternative sitings of the structure within the precinct would have similar impacts.</para></quote><para>It goes on to talk about the potential damage to the area and touch upon the significant Aboriginal heritage associated with much of the site. Despite this internal environmental assessment advice to Commonwealth ministers, they apparently chose not to follow the advice, to give no consideration to the opinion of the state government agencies involved, and they allowed the clearing of the whole area proposed for development. No consideration was given to recognising, let alone properly managing, this significant biodiversity area. Tragically, this has resulted in the clearing of Bush Forever and National Estate listed bushland.</para><para>The second case involved drainage maintenance work that took place at Perth airport. Drainage earthworks were carried out to enlarge and deepen an old drain to divert the waters of Poison Gully Creek. Poison Gully Creek was one of the main streams feeding the Munday Swamp, which is part of the National Estate listed area at the airport site and a designated Aboriginal heritage area. Diverting the waters of Poison Gully has the potential to seriously impact on the environmentally sensitive Munday Swamp. If the swamp dries out, it would threaten the only significant populations of two WA endemic fish species that are surviving in the Perth metropolitan area. This work was undertaken without any reference to the relevant state departments and Commonwealth agencies. Indeed, it would appear that the Westralia Airports Corporation received retrospective approval from the federal government.</para><para>This is an extraordinary situation, and one has to seriously question this government's commitment to protecting areas that are set aside for retention under Commonwealth and state regulation and legislation. The failure of Westralia Airports Corporation to honour the memorandum of understanding with the Western Australian government is high handed at best and is deliberately irresponsible. The Deputy Prime Minister should have taken action against Westralia Airports Corporation. What have the Commonwealth ministers done to address this situation? Apparently nothing. I urge them to act before the proposed take of groundwater by Westralia Airports Corporation. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Cape York Alcohol Management Plan</title><page.no>28744</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>28744</page.no><name role="metadata">Entsch, Warren, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ENTSCH</name><name.id>7K6</name.id><electorate>Leichhardt</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Last year, the Queensland state Labor government in its wisdom decided to introduce an alcohol management plan into Cape York—a plan which was clearly designed to win votes in Brisbane and areas outside the Cape York area but which had little consideration for the impact it was going to have on Cape York communities. I will make it very clear in the first instance that alcohol is a major problem in these communities. There is no doubt about it, and the communities themselves recognise it as a major problem. The domestic violence, the dysfunctionality of families et cetera that are caused by this addiction need to be seriously addressed, but in trying to impose something like prohibition onto a community without the support of the community you are guaranteeing to have a project that is going to fail. There is no doubt about it. </para></talk.start><para>We have a situation where they imposed this prohibition without any consideration for those people up there who are already afflicted with alcohol addiction. As a consequence, one day they are alcoholics and the next day they have no access at all to alcohol—no treatment, no detoxification and no way of dealing with their problem. As a consequence, we now see in many of these communities where they cannot get grog that they are into petrol sniffing, glue sniffing and other alternatives. If they cannot access this, they are moving out of these communities and into mainstream towns like Weipa, Cooktown and even Cairns and transporting the problem with them. Of course, their actions then reflect badly on the communities they come from.</para><para>In spite of continued pleas by the various community leaders asking that they deal with the detoxification in a different way, the state government has ignored them. The stupidity of this law was seen recently when the state minister for Aboriginal affairs, the local state member and a newly elected state member travelled into an Aboriginal community with alcohol on board their aircraft. There was outrage over it but eventually, with a bit of political spin, they managed to be exonerated of any misdemeanour. However, Aboriginal community people who have gone in with one empty can have been prosecuted and fined in their own communities. It has to raise the question of whether there is one law for one group and another law for the other.</para><para>I was recently in Mapoon talking to one of the community leaders up there, Ricky Guivarra. He said that in Mapoon they are looking at putting out signs in their community saying `Please don't feed the natives', because it is okay up there for non-Aboriginal people to have a drink but Aboriginal people are not allowed to. They have situations in Mapoon and other communities where they are trying to establish tourism operations to get away from the dependence on welfare, but they are having major problems now because they cannot even serve their guests a glass of wine with their meal at night. We have another situation up there where the canteens have been the primary source of income for many of these communities for many years. What has happened now? They have shut them down. The resources from those canteens were being used for a whole lot of community type projects. Now they are out of pocket. The state government has given no consideration to adjusting the losses from, in some cases, the only private enterprise income that came into those communities. Those incomes have gone. The councils have lost those, and now the people there are becoming more and more dependent on welfare.</para><para>It is a crazy situation that really needs to be addressed. The communities have to be compensated for those losses. Detoxification and alcohol treatment programs and medical treatment programs have to be brought into those communities today to deal with those people who already have those problems—and they have to engage the local communities. The Labor state government has to engage local community leaders with this. It has to offer them support and accept their advice on how to deal with this very serious problem, otherwise we are going to continue to see this farcical situation that we have up there at the moment where they are patting their backs in Brisbane and saying, `We've fixed the problem in Cape York,' and in Cape York the problem continues to grow. I am calling on Peter Beattie and his minister, Liddy Clark, who had a recent brush with the law herself in the `winegate' affair in Lockhart, to sit back and take note—and to take note of the recently elected state member for Cook, who was also caught up in that and, as a consequence, has come out himself and said that this system is not working. They should take advice from this newly elected state member, if not from me, and sit down and talk to local communities. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Local Communities</title><page.no>28746</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>28746</page.no><name role="metadata">Tanner, Lindsay, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TANNER</name><name.id>YU5</name.id><electorate>Melbourne</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In national politics it is sometimes easy to overlook the fact that we all come from local communities, that we all represent local communities and that our nation comprises a vast array of different local communities. So it was a great pleasure for me just a few minutes ago to meet with a very large number of children from the Belmont Primary School—from a local community in New South Wales in the electorate of the member for Shortland. It was especially pleasing to meet up with Mitchell Sanderson, who is the son of the people who run and own the Pelican Palms Motor Inn, which I happen to have had the pleasure of staying at when I visited the electorate a couple of months ago. Mitchell has a great interest in the parliament and the political system. It was tremendous to be able to foster and encourage that interest  and also to talk to the kids from the school.</para></talk.start><para>I make this comment by way of introduction because I want to talk about the local community I came from, Orbost in East Gippsland, which I had the pleasure of visiting with the Leader of the Opposition very recently. A few weeks ago, the <inline font-style="italic">Today Tonight</inline> program featured two local communities as representative of the richest and poorest communities in our nation. They chose Mosman as representing the richest communities and, for reasons that I find hard to understand, they chose Orbost as representing the poorest parts of Australia. Some members of parliament may be pleased to say they come from the poorest part of Australia; I am not. I do not think the characterisation of the program was accurate. Indeed, I think it was an unfair representation of a town that has suffered significant economic change and some degree of economic decline but is nonetheless battling hard to grow and improve and is fighting back against the adverse economic pressures that have been affecting it over the last decade or two.</para><para>On 29 April, with the Leader of the Opposition, I had the pleasure of visiting a very important economic success story just outside Orbost, Snowy River Seeds, which grew from some predecessors that were cooperatives. I would like to express my very sincere thanks to the acting general manager, Leo Schoots, and his staff, who I met when the Leader of the Opposition and I visited there. Snowy River Seeds is involved mostly in processing sweet corn that is grown on the Snowy River flats, and it is exporting its product all around the world. It is engaging in significant R&amp;D. It has a qualified genetics expert on staff, who is engaged in hybridisation design to get better quality seeds for export. It employs a dozen or so permanent full-time people and seasonally employs 20 or so casuals to process, sort and arrange the seeds. It is a real success story for the region. It processes the product that is grown in farms on the Snowy River flats, which have amongst the most fertile soil in Australia. It really does offer a beacon of hope for the East Gippsland economy, which has suffered significantly from economic change.</para><para>Until a couple of years ago, my father had a farm on the Snowy River flats. He grew beans until he ceased to be able to run the farm, which subsequently was share-farmed and involved sweet corn and various other things. Unfortunately, as a result of this trip, I have discovered that beans are no longer grown in the region because disease has affected the capacity to grow beans. It is great to see a beacon of economic recovery in East Gippsland. It was a tremendous experience for the Leader of the Opposition and me to visit Snowy River Seeds and see that a local, export oriented business that is adding value to the local economy and community is so successful in the region and is having such a marked positive impact on the economy of that local area. </para><para>I am proud of where I come from and I am proud of the effort, thought and commitment that is going into Snowy River Seeds. I am sure that it will play a major role in an economic resurgence for East Gippsland and help a struggling community gradually recover from the impact of economic change. As opportunities open up, as distance narrows, as broadband access eventually spreads throughout Australia, some of the barriers to economic success that currently afflict remote country towns like Orbost will start to melt away and we will see more and more economic resurgence from these communities. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Herbert Electorate: Townsville Port Facilities</title><title>Budget 2004-05</title><page.no>28747</page.no></subdebateinfo><title>Budget 2004-05</title><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>28747</page.no><name role="metadata">Lindsay, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LINDSAY</name><name.id>HK6</name.id><electorate>Herbert</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—For some years now the Townsville community has been discussing what is called the Townsville port access road. After the Douglas arterial road, it is probably the most significant road project that our city should consider. It came out of the vision of David Carmichael, formerly chairman of the Townsville Port Authority, who saw that if you built a new road and a cross-river bridge and connected the port to the Stuart industrial area you would avoid the chicken and egg situation of no development occurring unless there is a road and no road occurring unless there is development. His view was simply that the community should get in and be visionary, build a new connection, and the development will follow.</para></talk.start><para>Unfortunately, the process through the Queensland government has seen this process stalled. I do not think there is any other word for it. It took four years to do the environmental impact assessments on the project when really you could have done them in six months. That has caused a problem for the federal government in relation to how we might assist by helping to fund that particular project. With the delay of so many years, the cost has blown out and there has probably been a $25 million increase in the cost, which is also unfortunate. Of course, the community has not had the benefit of being able to use that road because it is nowhere near in sight of being built. </para><para>We really need to assess where the project is at this time. The Queensland government wrote to the federal government on 22 December 2003 asking that the Commonwealth government consider the connection between the Flinders Highway and the Bruce Highway to be declared part of stage 1 of the new port access road, seeking Roads of National Importance funding. It further made a request in the same letter that an amount of $9.5 million was required, matching RONI funding, for planning corridor requisitions and detailed design. Unfortunately, based on the Queensland Department of Main Roads current timing for the proposals, development of stage 2 appears to be several years away, beyond the 2006-07 horizon. With design planning at an early stage, it may well yet cost significantly more than the current preliminary estimate of $75 million. It is a terrific shame for the community and for the development of our city that we are seeing these costs grow out of all proportion when we really could have had this whole thing built by now for about $50 million. I am hopeful that we might get higher priority on this and get the state government moving along. At this stage it certainly does not seem likely. </para><para>I turn quickly to the federal budget that was brought down on Tuesday night. I am pleased to see that this is a budget for families. Some will say it is a budget for everyone else as well—for older Australians, younger Australians, businesses and people who pay high marginal rates of tax—but primarily it has been a budget for families. I am really pleased to see that in my particular electorate defence has also been well and truly looked after by the federal government. We have almost $90 million going into looking after the men and women of the Australian Defence Force in Townsville alone. That is money that will be spent in the local community and will circulate in the local community. As well we have got $50 million of capital works going on in this next financial year. Again, that is money that will support the building and construction industry and keep jobs secure. It will also help to make sure that families can plan ahead with confidence.</para><para>It is particularly good to see Professor Ian Wronski from James Cook University with us this morning. JCU benefited by $128 million in the federal budget on Tuesday night, and I know that that money will be spent wisely and well. Thank you, Professor, for being with us today. We are about to go and do some more good work for James Cook University, and I hope we are successful in that.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Defence Force: Parliamentary Program</title><page.no>28748</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>28748</page.no><name role="metadata">Snowdon, Warren, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SNOWDON</name><name.id>IJ4</name.id><electorate>Lingiari</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am privileged to be able to participate in this discussion this morning and inform you about a recent trip I had with NORFORCE. You will know, Madam Deputy Speaker Corcoran, that the Australian Defence Force Parliamentary Program provides members of parliament and senators with the opportunity to spend time with elements of the Australian Defence Force to gain a deeper understanding of the work being done by them in maintaining our security. I know you know this well, Madam Deputy Speaker, or Corky, as you are called—you will forgive me. As part of the program, I spent three days with NORFORCE, which operates across Northern Australia, principally in the Northern Territory and across the Kimberley.</para></talk.start><para>NORFORCE's role is to conduct surveillance and reconnaissance throughout Northern Australia, through the establishment of patrols in the particular squadron areas of responsibility, and grew out of the heroic deeds of the Nackeroos in the Second World War. NORFORCE makes sure it employs the special skills and knowledge of the local population, which is principally made up of Indigenous people in that part of Australia, and they form the majority of NORFORCE personnel. Indeed, between 60 and 65 per cent of NORFORCE comprises Indigenous personnel. I was heartened to see—as I am sure you were, Madam Deputy Speaker, when you undertook this brilliant experience last year—how hard NORFORCE has worked to provide real opportunities for these people and the positive effect it is having on local communities across the Top End and through the Centre.</para><para>There are four operational surveillance squadrons within NORFORCE: the Arnhem Squadron, headquartered at Nhulunbuy; the Centre Squadron, based in Alice Springs and responsible for the central and lower portion of the Northern Territory—its eastern border is shared with 51 Far North Queensland Regiment—the Kimberley Squadron, based in Broome in Western Australia; and the Darwin Squadron, based at Larrakeyah Barracks, which is the squadron I spent time with. The Darwin Squadron has a complement of 130 people, 60 per cent of whom are Indigenous. The squadron operates from the Tiwi Islands, where my time was spent—as was yours, Madam Deputy Speaker—and east to Manangrida and south to Wadeye. I was able to experience how NORFORCE patrols conduct their surveillance and how these exercises are planned, commanded, and conducted—as I know you were, Madam Deputy Speaker. </para><para>I want to mention the Commander of NORCOM, Air Commodore Steve Walker, who was kind enough to give me a briefing; and Lieutenant Colonel Clay Sutton, who is the commanding officer of NORFORCE. I also want to mention the members of the Darwin Squadron who participated in the exercise that I was involved in: Major Lloyd Scholes, Darwin, supervising officer; Captain Jacek Olchowik, Darwin, who is the officer in charge of all activities; Lieutenant James Morrison, Darwin, squadron headquarters liaison; Sergeant Chris Brannelly—a mate of mine for 20-odd years—Darwin, supervisor water operations; Corporal Cecil Black, Milikapiti, Melville Island, coxswain water operations 2IC; Corporal Phil Maker, Darwin, driver vehicle operations and tracker; Corporal Darren Rashleigh—who knows you fondly as Corky, Madam Deputy Speaker—Nauiyu-Daly River, vehicle operations 2IC; Lance Corporal Rob Korljan, Darwin, coxswain water operations; Private Clinton Barker, Darwin, advanced combat patrol first-aider, medic, and driver vehicle operations; Private Robbie Austral, Nauiyu-Daly River, scout vehicle operations; Private John Harris, Darwin, squadron headquarters signaller; Private Scott McKeon, Darwin, signaller water operations; Private Russell Yunupingu, Nguiu, Bathurst Island, signaller vehicle operations; Private Edward Tipungwuti, Nguiu, Bathurst Island, bowman water operations; and Private Andrew Portamini, Nguiu, Bathurst Island, coxswain water operations.</para><para>Madam Deputy Speaker Corcoran, I read those names into the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> because I know they were the same group of people who accompanied you. I was most impressed by their professionalism, energy, drive, knowledge and aptitude for the tasks they were given. I think they are a very good exemplar of how NORFORCE operates throughout its area of operations. NORFORCE plays a very important part in the defence of Northern Australia, particularly in terms of the surveillance of our coastline. It is a very integral part of our Defence Force and is an operational unit, unlike many other reservist units across Australia, and I thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to spend time with them, as I know you did last year.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Forde Electorate: National Volunteer Week</title><page.no>28749</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>28749</page.no><name role="metadata">Elson, Kay, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs ELSON</name><name.id>6K6</name.id><electorate>Forde</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thought it fitting today that in the middle of National Volunteer Week I take the time to thank and recognise the many volunteer workers in my electorate who do a marvellous job day in and day out. As someone who devoted a great deal of time to voluntary work before I entered this House, I know at first-hand how valuable, rewarding and important voluntary work is to our community and to our nation. It is definitely part of the Australian way of life—that is, giving a mate a hand, putting something back into our community and helping others. We are fortunate indeed that as a community we value and encourage voluntary work, and I firmly believe this work is what gives our local community its heart and soul.</para></talk.start><para>I have been delighted for the past seven years to host the annual Forde community contribution awards. I established these awards as a way of saying thank you to our local communities and to the many local residents who give their time so selflessly, never seeking recognition but always deserving it. Over the years we have had some remarkable recipients—many who have devoted 30, 40 and 50 years to voluntary work in a number of local charities and community organisations across Forde. I am also pleased to say that we have had a number of younger winners. It is great to see the next generation also contributing in this way and it certainly is a great sign of the future success of voluntary organisations in our community. </para><para>I am pleased to report to the House that we have again had some very outstanding recipients of the 2004 community awards. I will be formally presenting these awards next week, but I would like to take the time in this House today to inform members of the extraordinary people who have given a great deal of their time to our local communities: Mary Krueger of Fassifern Valley, Evan and Florence Roberts of Roadvale, Herbert Haupt of Cannon Creek, Elaine Gilmore of Boonah, Donald Lynch of Tamborine, Josephine Ferguson of Beaudesert, Lesley Rohan of Beaudesert, Karen Barney of Tamborine, Jane Bell of Coochin, Dawn Markwell of Beaudesert, Janet Dennis of Beaudesert, Murray Willmann of Beenleigh, Jacqueline McSwan of Beenleigh, Ian Bray of Eagleby, Kenneth Baker of North Tamborine, Frank Barnes of Mount Warren Park, and Marrianne Uhlmann of Cedar Grove. Our special community spirit award goes to Dean Sammut and Kathy Stone of Logan Village, and the group which has won the best contribution for 2004 is the Jimboomba Veteran Support and Advocacy Service. On behalf of our community and our nation, I thank these wonderful people for their hard work and dedication. All of our award recipients have been nominated by grateful local residents who have been touched by their kindness and generosity. I believe that one of the best aspects of my job is that I can recognise and thank our voluntary workers in this small way, and I look forward to continuing to host these awards well into the future.</para><para>I also want to take a little time to congratulate the 15 local community organisations which recently received funding from our Volunteer Small Equipment Grants. These grants were established by the government to help make the valuable work of our volunteers safer and more enjoyable. In the latest round, 15 community organisations in Forde got to share just over $32,700. This comes on top of several other previous rounds of funding. These grants will be of very real practical help to our local community organisations—for example, $4,108 will help Cedar Creek and Wolffdene Rural Fire Brigade to purchase CB radios, global positioning systems and weather meters. Some of the other community groups to benefit are the Beenleigh Soccer Club, Beaudesert Landcare, Community Care and Food Link, Tamborine Mountain Historical Society, Jimboomba Community Care and Boonah RSL. This is just a small example of the practical support these grants offer to our community organisations to help the volunteers and to support their work.</para><para>I am very pleased to be part of a government that recognises the value of our voluntary work and is offering real, practical assistance where it is most needed. In National Volunteer Week I want to thank most sincerely the recipients of the 2004 community contribution awards and all of the many residents in my electorate who do great voluntary work in schools, sporting clubs, charities, community groups, churches, hospitals, service clubs and other organisations. They do a marvellous job, and we are grateful as a community and as a nation for all their efforts.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Main Committee adjourned at 12.11 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate></maincomm.xscript><answers.to.questions><debate><debateinfo><type>Answers to Questions in Writing</type><title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title><page.no>28751</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following answers to questions were circulated:</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Agriculture: Dairy Exit Program</title><page.no>28751</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1209)</subtitle><id.no>1209</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>28751</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Martin Ferguson</name><name.id>LS4</name.id><electorate>Batman</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, upon notice, on 9 December 2002:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	On what date was the Dairy Exit Program (DEP) announced.</para><para>(2)	On what date was the first DEP project approved.</para><para>(3)	Who is eligible for DEP funding.</para><para>(4)	How many applications for the DEP have there been to date.</para><para>(5)	How many of these applications are from farmers who have also lodged a Claim After Sale form.</para><para>(6)	How many of these applications are from farmers who have not yet lodged a Claim After Sale form.</para><para>(7)	How many DEP grants have been approved to date.</para><para>(8)	How many DEP grants have been paid to date.</para><para>(9)	Of DEP grants approved, what is the average payment for each farmer.</para><para>(10)	What is the total DEP expenditure to date.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>28751</page.no><name role="metadata">Truss, Warren, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Truss</name><name.id>GT4</name.id><electorate>Wide Bay</electorate><party>NATS</party><role>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	The Dairy Exit Program(DEP) was announced as part of the Dairy Industry Adjustment Package on 28 September 1999. </para><para>(2)	The first application approved under the DEP was in January 2001.</para><para>(3)	To qualify for DEP funding, a person must: </para><para>	have been be a farmer, and have been for a continuous period of at least two years immediately prior to applying for the DEP;</para><para>	be over 18 years old;</para><para>	be an Australian resident and living in Australia;</para><para>	hold a Certificate of Inability to obtain finance from a financial institution;</para><para>	be granted a payment right under the Dairy Structural Adjustment Program (DSAP) or the Supplementary Dairy Assistance (SDA) scheme; and</para><para>	have applied by 30 June 2002.</para><para>(4)	As of 29 February 2004, 171 initial applications for the DEP scheme had been lodged.</para><para>(5)	As of 29 February 2004, of the 171 initial applications received there have been 107 `Claim After Sale' forms received.

The Australian High Commission in Dhaka has sought further information about the detention of Mr Choudhury from relevant authorities in Bangladesh, to which we do not have a response at this time.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Communications, Information Technology and the Arts: Trade Unions</title><page.no>28753</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 3146)</subtitle><id.no>3146</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>28753</page.no><name role="metadata">Bevis, Arch, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Bevis</name><name.id>ET4</name.id><electorate>Brisbane</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 1 March 2004:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	For the year (a) 2000, (b) 2001, (c) 2002, and (d) 2003, what payments were made by the Minister's department to (i) registered unions of employees, (ii) registered unions of employers, (iii) unions of employees peak body, and (iv) unions of employers peak body.</para><para>(2)	In respect of each payment, (a) how much money was provided, and (b) what was its purpose.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>28753</page.no><name role="metadata">Williams, Daryl, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Williams</name><name.id>7V5</name.id><electorate>Tangney</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(1) and (2) No payments have been made to registered unions of employees, registered unions of employers, unions of employees peak body or unions of employers peak body in 2000, 2001, 2002 or 2003.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Industry, Tourism and Resources: Trade Unions</title><page.no>28753</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 3152)</subtitle><id.no>3152</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>28753</page.no><name role="metadata">Bevis, Arch, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Bevis</name><name.id>ET4</name.id><electorate>Brisbane</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, upon notice, on 1 March 2004:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	For the year (a) 2000, (b) 2001, (c) 2002, and (d) 2003, what payments were made by the Minister's department to (i) registered unions of employees, (ii) registered unions of employers, (iii) unions of employees peak body, and (iv) unions of employers peak body.</para><para>(2)	In respect of each payment, (a) how much money was provided, and (b) what was its purpose.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>28753</page.no><name role="metadata">Macfarlane, Ian, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Ian Macfarlane</name><name.id>WN6</name.id><electorate>Groom</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>For the purposes of this answer:</para><para>- a “registered union of employees” is taken to be an association of employees which is registered under the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (“the Act”);

This decision was taken following analysis of Language, Literacy and Numeracy Programme (LLNP) data which showed that more than 71% of job seekers were being allocated 400 hours of training.  Given that over 69% of clients who withdraw from training did so before undertaking 100 hours of training, this was considered to be an inefficient use of resources which could be better directed to new clients.</para><para>(c)	This arrangement is consistent with the original contract as it still allows providers to review client performance after delivery of between 190 and 200 hours (as a mid point review) and increase the number of hours to the maximum in the client's training plan and if the client is attending well, shows motivation and needs further training, then allocate increased hours to bring their total allocation up to a maximum of 400 hours.   </para><para>DEST also negotiated with a number of providers to allocate additional funding to assist with the increased demand for the LLNP.  However, the offer of this additional funding was contingent on providers implementing strategies to manage the increased demand within their budgets while still maximising the flow of new clients through the programme. </para><para>As part of this additional funding offer the Department offered WEA Illawarra an increase of $84,000 on their base funding allocation of $275,000 for English language training in 2003-04.  On accepting this funding offer WEA Illawarra proposed, and the Department agreed to, the following strategies to be implemented for all new clients assisted with the additional funding: </para><para>	Offering only 300 hours of training to those clients who are assessed as NRS level 1 or below;</para><para>	Offering only 200 hours of training to those clients who are assessed as NRS level 2 or above; and</para><para>	Offering second rounds of training to existing clients only in exceptional circumstances. </para><para>The implementation of these strategies for the new funding has been necessary to ensure that WEA Illawarra can maintain a flow of new clients and provide assistance to a greater number of jobseekers in the Illawarra region over the remaining LLNP contract period. </para><para>The Department continues to work with all providers facing high demand for programme places to ensure that these providers place client interests at the forefront of the strategies they implement to ration access to programme resources.</para><para>(3)	According to DEST records WEA Illawarra had a client intake of 40 or more in the current financial year only once in July 2003.

The US Navy has been charged for all costs associated with the two Sea Swap trials conducted to date.  In addition, in order to meet ongoing Australian Defence Force needs, refurbishment work was conducted on accommodation blocks at Leeuwin Barracks at a cost of $250,825.  As the US Navy has used these facilities during the two Sea Swap trials, they have contributed $25,000 towards the refurbishment costs.</para><para>(5)	The Sea Swap program has been a trial conducted by the US Navy.
