I was privileged to be amongst a group of parliamentarians who visited both Japan and the Republic of Korea between 8 and 19 December last year, led by the President of the Senate, Senator the Hon. Paul Calvert. The others who comprised the delegation were: Senator the Hon. Nick Bolkus; Senator David Johnston; Mrs Margaret May, the member for McPherson; and Mr Brendan O'Connor, the member for Burkeâwho is here in the chamber today. We were also accompanied by the Usher of the Black Rod, Ms Andrea Griffiths; and the President of the Senate's private secretary, Mr Don Morris. This was a hardworking group of people, who made the most of the opportunity to see first-hand the cultural, economic and political environments of these two nations and, in return, come back with fresh ideas about the direction of our own nation. Our meetings were at significant government and political levels and included the Prime Minister of Korea. Both embassies arranged in-depth briefings with resident Australian businesses and businesses trading with Australia.</para></talk.start><para>Both Japan and Korea are enormously important nations in terms of our trade activity, and I predict they will become even more so, given the gathering strength of the neighbouring Chinese economy. We noted that the growing demand by China for raw materials was fuelling a new dynamic in the Asian region. This has created new opportunities for the Australian resource sector, as last week's iron ore deal confirms.</para><para>Our delegates were fortunate to visit many high-profile industries in both countries, along with significant cultural sites. Whilst in Japan, we toured the Toyota factory near Kyoto and watched the astounding process of Australia's raw materials being transformed into modern motor vehicles. We also had the good fortune of visiting Kyoto itselfâthe old Edo capital of Japanâwhich is a model of vibrancy and the next host of World Expo. But perhaps the poignant moment of the trip came when the President of the Senate laid a wreath at the United Nations war memorial at Busan, commemorating the 339 Australian casualties. It was most important for us and a very significant event for me personally.</para><para>Turning to the industrial aspect of our visit, I was particularly interested in the rapid development that has been taking place in South Korea. Thanks to close domestic government and business ties and sponsorship of specific industries, South Korea has achieved enormous economic growth over recent times. In fact, last month South Korea recorded a trade account surplus of $US2.05 billion for the sixth straight month, and exports were up by 45.9 per cent from the same period last year, the largest margin recorded in 16 years.</para><para>The South Korean industries which particularly interested me included POSCO steelworks, where we saw blast furnaces casting iron ore into slabs and then the slabs being pressed out into hot-rolled coils. We were given greater insight into the processes of the General Motors Daewoo car factory, where we saw hot coiled metal being pressed out into car bonnets and car doors. Significantly, this new sector of GM, through GMH's holding in the venture, is using Australian engines in its Kalos model. Similarly, the Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering site at Busan can roll out three 300,000-tonne ore tankers every five weeks. That is an incredible output, achieved by 20,000 employees in this yard.</para><para>I have a particular interest in metals processing, as Gladstone is in my own electorate. Gladstone is literally a powerhouse of wealth generation, courtesy of cost-effective coal generated power, and is home to heavy industry, including major minerals processors, and services such as power and engineering. If I may make a personal comment, I find it incongruous that the opposition has pledged to sign the Kyoto protocolâand hence actively cripple Gladstone's industrial strengthâwhile hoping to maintain Australia's resource exports.</para><para>South Korea was our third largest export market last financial year, comprising 7.9 per cent of our total exports, valued at $9.1 billion. Japan has long been our largest coal export market, our top four commodities being coal, iron ore, beef and aluminium. These figures show the importance of our trade links with these two nations, and I believe the visit gave us a valuable insight into our current and future relationship with Japan and South Korea. I thank Senator Calvert for his excellent leadership of the delegation, and my co-delegates for their companionship.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>26120</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Brendan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR</name><name.id>00AN3</name.id><electorate>Burke</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to add my reflection upon the report tabled on the Australian parliamentary delegation to Japan and the Republic of South Korea between 8 and 19 December last year. As someone who has had a keen interest in both countries but had not, up until the delegation, visited either, I was profoundly affected by this experience. As the report indicates, the main objectives were to review the bilateral relationships and prospects for further development in respect of trade and security, project an image of Australia as an advanced economy with a strong interest in the region, identify both countries' views on the North Korean threat and encourage South Korea's continued dialogue with North Korea.</para></talk.start><para>One of the first formal visits upon arriving in Japan was with Mr Kono, the Speaker of the Diet, their House of Representatives. He stated that he was not in concurrence with the Japanese government's view to dispatch the Japan Self Defence Force to Iraq, although it was of course sent as a peacekeeping force. It is important to noteâand it was referred to obliquely in the reportâthat opposition members in the parliament in Japan expressed their concern and suggested that such action was ultra vires, in that it is contrary to the Japanese constitution to send forces beyond their borders. There was also some concern for Australia. A view was expressed that our central role has led to or may lead to greater danger from terrorist activity.</para><para>Another significant area that we were able to explore, and one that is very important to our relationship with Japan, was the progress of Japan's economy. As we know, Japan have had extraordinary growth since World War II but have had a very modest decade of growth. I think they may have turned the corner. Certainly, there are indicators that Japan's economy is growing. The last quarter of last year was the seventh consecutive quarter of growth in Japan, and I think that augurs well for their economy and our trade relationship with them.</para><para>The delegation met with the Vice-Governor of Aichi and discussed World Expo 2005, which Aichi will host, and Australia's role in it. There is no doubt that our participation at World Expo 2005 will provide further opportunities for Australia to trade with Japan. In particular, the Australian pavilion will focus upon agribusiness, information and technology, communications, energy, natural resources and food and wine. These are very important industries for us, and they will be on display next year for millions of visitors to see.</para><para>Another important visit was a meeting with the Governor of Kyoto. I have to distance myself from the comments of the member for Hinkler. The Governor of Kyoto impressed upon us the need to ratify the Kyoto protocol; he made that very clear to us. We were also fortunate to attend the Toyota plant in Nagoya, the third largest automobile manufacturer in the world. We got to witness the just-in-time method, which has now been copied by many companies following those great innovations by the Japanese company.</para><para>The visit to the Republic of South Korea was also very interesting. It is a fledgling democracyâit has only had a democratic constitution since 1987âbut it is a powerhouse economy in our region. As Senator Johnston reported last week in the Senate, our visits to POSCO Steel and, later, the Daewoo car factory gave us a stunning exhibition of value adding. Raw mineral iron ore, imported mainly from Australia, being transformed into rolled coil and later, at the car factory, being pressed and forged into car panels and doors was a sight to behold.</para><para>There are certainly great links with South Korea. I think our relationship can only grow. It was a telling moment for us to visit the demilitarized zone. It not only reminded us of that war just beyond 50 years ago, and our participation in it, but also of the fact that there is no reconciliation between those two sovereigntiesâindeed, two parts of one country. We were there to impress upon them that whatever role we can play in assisting them with their dialogue with North Korea we will play, and they certainly respected our view on that. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>26121</page.no><name role="metadata">May, Margaret, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs MAY</name><name.id>83B</name.id><electorate>McPherson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI had the pleasure of joining several colleagues on a bilateral trip to Japan and South Korea from 8 to 19 December last year. The delegation was led by the President of the Senate, the Hon. Paul Calvert, who was a wonderful leader and certainly a great ambassador for our country, particularly given the heavy meeting schedule we had, which involved numerous briefings on security issues with regard to the Korean Peninsula. It was very evident from the many meetings we had that security in this region is critical to the stability and prosperity of the region.</para></talk.start><para>The other members of the delegation were Senator the Hon. Nick Bolkus; the member for Hinkler, Mr Paul Neville; the member for Burke, Mr Brendan O'Connor; Senator David Johnston; and me. The Usher of the Black Rod, Ms Andrea Griffiths, also accompanied us, along with the President's private secretary, Mr Don Morris. I was a late addition to the delegation. Unfortunately, my colleague the member for Hume, Mr Alby Schultz, had a dreadful accident, which has seen him lose the sight in one eye, and he was unable to travel.</para><para>I would like to put on record my special thanks to our ambassadors in both Japan and South KoreaâHis Excellency Mr John McCarthy in Japan and His Excellency Mr Colin Heseltine in South Korea. Both these gentlemen and their staff made our visits extremely informative, challenging and interesting. Their hospitality and patience with briefings were excellent and very much appreciated.</para><para>Both these countries are important trading partners of Australia, with Japan of course having the world's second largest economy. Japan is a country that had amazing growth back in the fifties and sixties, and there are now encouraging economic indicators for the Japanese economy after growth fell sharply in the 1990s. The South Korean economy is currently in reasonably good shape, although in 2003 signs of the economic slowdown had become more evident, as demonstrated by contracting production and an accumulation of inventories amid sluggish domestic demand. South Korea's large domestic economy and diversified export base should provide a measure of protection from potential external turbulence.</para><para>Australia enjoys excellent relations with Japan and South Korea, and both are of fundamental importance to Australia for political, strategic and economic reasons. I had a particular interest in the tourism industry between Japan, South Korea and Australia. Japan is Australia's third largest market for service exports. The number of Japanese visitors to Australia increased to 715,500 for the year to December 2002, a rise of 5.7 per cent. In 2002-03, 173,000 South Korean tourists visited Australia. However, this number is down on the 1997 figure, which saw 230,000 South Korean tourists visit Australia. With a change in South Korea's working conditions which includes an increase in holiday leave, I am extremely hopeful the current figure will climb to the 1997 level in the near future. This growth is very important to my electorate and, indeed, to Gold Coast City. I represent a city that is built on tourism, and it was encouraging in discussions that both South Korean and Japanese people have a great regard for our country and all it offers as a tourist destination.</para><para>There is not enough time today to put on record all my thoughts regarding the trip, nor indeed to put on the record some of the visits we undertook during the trip. Our visit to the Toyota factory, just out of Kyoto, was unbelievable. Our visit included a floor tour of the machining and assembly operationsâa massive operation that appeared to run like clockwork. We visited the POSCO steelworks. We visited General Motors Daewoo and watched another car manufacturing plant in full operation. It was a remarkable experience watching Australia's iron ore being turned into hot-rolled coil steel and then being pressed out into car bonnets and car doors.</para><para>I was personally moved by our visit to Camp Bonifas, the demilitarised zone between North and South Korea. It was here that one could feel the tension between North and South Korea. It was an amazing experience standing in that zoneâa zone that is the most heavily fortified border in the world. Through binoculars, I had a very good view of North Korea. I wonder if people fully understand that South Korea and North Korea are still technically at war.</para><para>Since returning to Australia, a delegation from our own Austrade office in Japan has visited the Gold Coast to have talks with our surf industry representatives. I was not aware that there was a surf in Japan, until my visit to Japan and a meeting with Mr Denis Zolin in Nagoya. I have been instrumental in setting up meetings with our surfboard cluster on the Gold Coast and our surfwear industries. I hope this leads to some profitable export business for our local businesses on the Gold Coast in the not too distant future. This meeting only two weeks ago on the Gold Coast was a direct result of meetings in Japan.</para><para>In summing up, I want to put on the record my thanks to all my delegation colleagues for helping to make this trip so worth while. I believe the visit to Japan and South Korea gave us all a better understanding of the political and economic challenges both countries are facing in the future and it reinforced to each of us just how important a bilateral relationship is with both these countries for security in the region. I commend the report to the House. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>INVASION OF IRAQ ROYAL COMMISSION (RESTORING PUBLIC TRUST IN GOVERNMENT) BILL 2004</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>26123</page.no><id.no>R1995</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>26123</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Organ</inline>.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>26123</page.no><name role="metadata">Organ, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ORGAN</name><name.id>BNL</name.id><electorate>Cunningham</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âBy enacting this <inline ref="R1995">bill</inline>, the government has the opportunity to address the widely held belief that the Prime Minister, members of the government, and the Australian intelligence community misled the Australian people over the reasons for going to war against Iraq in 2003.</para></talk.start><para>The circumstances of this deception are clearly revealed in the <inline font-style="italic">Intelligence on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction</inline> reportâthe Jull reportâhanded down just last week by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD. The committee came to the conclusion that:</para><quote><para>The presentations by the government seemed to suggest [that Iraq possessed] large stockpiles [of chemical and biological weapons]....</para><para>In addition, there appears to be a gap on the matter of immediacy of threat.</para></quote><para>And that goes to the heart of the matter. The Australian people were lied to. There was no immediate threat. There were no large stockpiles of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons of mass destruction. This was a beat-up. As the committee concluded:</para><quote><para>The Committee does not have a complete set of the Australian Intelligence Community assessments.</para><para>The Australian agencies told the Committee they were in possession of the whole picture insofar as they received all there was to receive from partner agencies.</para><para>Other judgements are based on an analysis of what we were given.</para><para>The Australian Intelligence Community assessments are more moderate and cautious that those from partner agencies, particularly those in the United States.</para><para>However, even within their caution, it is arguable that they overstated the degree to which weapons of mass destruction existed.</para></quote><para>There are serious unanswered questions here, and the committee realised this. The chair, in his introduction to the report, stated:</para><quote><para>The Committee's conclusions, therefore, must be qualified. The Committee recommends that a more comprehensive inquiry should be conducted by ... experts into Australia's intelligence sharing and intelligence liaison arrangement.</para></quote><para>The Australian community deserves to know the precise extent to which it was misled over the invasion of Iraq. The Jull report clearly states that various Australian intelligence organisations held intelligence prior to 2003. It also states:</para><quote><para>... no known chemical weapons production ... no specific evidence of resumed biological weapons production ... Iraq does not have nuclear weapons.</para></quote><para>Whereas the Prime Minister told the House on 4 February 2003:</para><quote><para>The Australian government knows that Iraq still has chemical and biological weapons ... Iraq must not be allowed to possess weapons of mass destruction ... it must be disarmed.</para></quote><para>So the question is begging: what weapons? There was no smoking gun and no nuclear reactor, nor were massive chemical or biological weapons pointed at us. Even the government's staunchest advocates would be sure to concede that the reasons for going to war were deficient and flawed. The government's answer is to provide another report and, to make absolutely sure it does not go anywhere, to make sure the full report is presented only to cabinetâthat is, it will be a secret report which the public will not see for 30 years. How convenient!</para><para>My bill is focused on finding out what caused Australia to go to war. Accordingly, the objects of the bill are: firstly, to establish a royal commission to investigate the intelligence advice provided to the Australian government that related to its decision to invade Iraq in 2003 and to continue the occupation of Iraq in 2004; secondly, to expose any misrepresentation, neglect or omission of advice provided to the Australian government by the Australian Public Service or other sources that related to this invasion; and, thirdly, to expose any misrepresentation, neglect or omission in the Commonwealth government's public communication of this intelligence.</para><para>Royal commissions have a long history with regard to espionage, spying and the broader intelligence industryâsuch as the Petrov royal commission of 1954. The Greens' proposed royal commission shall comprise three persons appointed by the Governor-General, each of whom shall be a former judge of the High Court or of a Supreme Court of a state or territory and one of whom shall be appointed to be the chair of the royal commission. Its terms of reference shall be: to determine the nature and extent of the intelligence provided to the Commonwealth government relating to its decision to commit Australian military forces to the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and to continue to occupy Iraq in 2004; to determine the accuracy and independence of this intelligence; to make an assessment of how the Commonwealth government verified this intelligence; and to determine the accuracy with which the Commonwealth government conveyed this intelligence to the public.</para><para>I commend this bill to the House, and call on the government to adopt it.

Quite frankly, I am sick and tired of hearing the misinformation that has been distributed in the community by the Australian Education Union and the New South Wales Teachers Federation about education and schools funding. It is a campaign of misinformation and it is about time it stopped because it is not helping public education in Australia, particularly in New South Wales. We have an excellent system of education in Australia in both the government and non-government schools. As my motion states, we have 3.3 million school students. Students and their parents are entitled to a choice of quality education. Currently, 2.25 million students attend state schools and receive $19.9 billion in public funding, and 1.04 million students attend Catholic and independent schools across Australia and receive a total of $6.2 billion in public funding.</para><para>It has to be remembered that, under the Australian Constitution, state schools are the responsibilities of the state and territory governments, which have the major financial responsibility for them. In fact, if the federal minister for education, Dr Brendan Nelson, wishes to visit a state school, he has to write to the relevant state education minister and seek permission to go onto the premises. It is quite clear that it is a state government responsibility.</para><para>What has annoyed me most is the practice of the Australian Teachers Union and the Teachers Federation to only mention federal funds in their campaigns. They say that the federal government are only distributing a certain amount to government schools, implying that we are providing many more resources to non-government schools than to government schools. This is a totally dishonest campaignâthere is no other word for itâbecause to look at school funding, you must look at the totality of school funding; you must look at what is provided from the federal government directly, and what is provided by the state governments through their responsibilities.</para><para>A newspaper article by Tim Elbra on page 5 of the Central Coast Extra of the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> on 4 March, about the campaign being run by the Teachers Federation and others, chooses selectively to highlight how much is put into government and non-government schools by the federal government. The article states:</para><quote><para>Local private schools have received a massive boost in Federal Government funding over the past three years, while public schools have continued to receive paltry sums ...</para></quote><para>This is totally incorrectâ</para><quote><para>The statistics, a list of estimates from the NSW Teachers Federation, show that since 2001 Central Coast Grammar Schoolâ</para></quote><para>which is one of the premier non-government schools on the Central Coastâ</para><quote><para>funding has been increased by 160.6 per cent, bringing the contribution from the Howard Government to nearly $4 million.</para></quote><para>It is interesting that there is a comment in this article by the New South Wales P&amp;C President, Sharryn Brownlee. I know Sharryn well and I know that she is very dedicated to promoting government education, but I really cannot agree with her comments. She says:</para><quote><para>Isn't that disgraceful? All the taxpayers on the Coast are subsidising that ...</para></quote><para>By that she means parents who are choosing to send their children to non-government schools. I think that is a disgraceful comment in itself. Does that mean that that the taxes of the hardworking Central Coast parents who choose to send their children to non-government, Catholic or many of the independent schools on the Central Coast are no more relevant than the taxes of those parents who choose to send their children to government schools? Why are they not entitled to some government support when they choose to send their children to Green Point Christian College or to one of the Catholic schools on the Central Coast. She goes on to say: </para><quote><para>We do need to have opportunities for people, choices of what school they would like to send their children to. But taxpayers' money is for the community ...</para></quote><para>The fact is that every parent that chooses to send their child to a non-government school saves the taxpayer money. That is an important factor. If every child went to a government school, it would cost the state and federal governments far more than it does today. The article goes on to say:</para><quote><para>The Coast's best performed high school, the selective Gosford High, will receive about $750,000 under these figures.</para></quote><para>That is, those released by the Teachers Federation. They say that the estimate in the year 2000 was that the federal government would spend $504 per student in public primary schools, while $747 would be spent on each public secondary school student. </para><para>As I said earlier, what the Teachers Federation and the Australian Education Union do not mention is the total amount of funding that is provided from the Commonwealth and the state governments. The article said that Gosford High receives $750,000. I have the figures here for all the state government schools in my electorate of Robertson and the fact is that Gosford High School, with 1,062 students, will receive a total of Commonwealth and state funding of $12,304,868 for the 2003 year.</para><para>Looking at some of the figures that I have here, the Brisbane Water Secondary College at Umina with 934 students will receive a total of state and Commonwealth funding of $10,819,758. Compare that with some of the independent schools in my electorate. Green Point College, with 985 studentsâa similar number to that of the Brisbane Water Secondary Collegeâwill receive approximately half the amount of public funding from state and Commonwealth governments as Brisbane Water Secondary College. They will receive $5,228,906. You can compare virtually every government and non-government school in my electorate and in each case the government schools will receive far more than non-government schools. It is a dishonest campaign that is being run. It is one that is damaging the wonderful education system we have in this country, both in government and non-government schools.</para><para>In my own electorate of Robertson, we are very fortunate to have a wonderful public education system with very dedicated teachers, staff and parents; and we have the same situation with the non-government schools. I think that this campaign, which is being run purely for political purposes, is outrageous. Every parent and student who is able to should voice their concerns about this campaign. It really is doing nothing to contribute to the debate about education.</para><para>It is interesting that the Australian Education Union gets up in arms as soon as anyone dares to mention anything about public education. When the Prime Minister made some comments about public education, they were outraged. Why would anyone dare to make any comments about public education? Is it such a sacred cow that we cannot say that we have a good system and that we want to make it better by highlighting some of our concerns? It is a terrible thing when you cannot make any comments about our public education system or you will be criticised. It is important. If my business were losing many thousands of customers each year, I would want to know why. There are many parents who are choosing to move their children from the public education system to the non-government education system. I would be asking: why are those parents making that decision? What has caused them to make that choice? </para><para>It is important to look at how we can make the public education system even better than it is today. Certainly we can always use more resources in the government and non-government sectors, but please do not run a dishonest campaign by highlighting only the direct funding that comes from the Commonwealth. You have to combine the funding that is given directly to the statesâthe billions of dollars in GST revenue that goes directly to the statesâso that they can run the state education system, which is their responsibility. If they had increased their funding by the same level as the Commonwealth, schools would have had far more money. In fact, the New South Wales government increased its education budget by only 0.8 per cent. The Australian government increased its budget by 5.7 per cent. If New South Wales had done that, the state's schools would have had an additional $293 million. The New South Wales Teachers Federation should be criticising the Carr Labor government in New South Wales for its lack of funding of its school education system. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âIs the motion seconded?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Gash, Joanna, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs Gash</name></talker><para>âI second the motion and reserve my right to speak.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>26127</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Brendan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR</name><name.id>00AN3</name.id><electorate>Burke</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to raise some concerns about the motion moved by the member for Robertson. This motion today is not, as the government might like to hope, a debate about public schools versus private schools or about bashing unionsâthe usual mantra from this government. What this motion should allow us to do today is properly consider the allocation of Commonwealth expenditure to all schools to ensure that all Australian children are provided a decent education to allow them an equal opportunity in lifeâand to that extent I thank the member for Robertson for moving the motion. I think it is incumbent upon the Commonwealth government to ensure that students are not penalised because of the differentiation in funding between non-government schools and government schools or, indeed, because of the fact that they come from a low-income family. That is the obligation of an Australian government.</para></talk.start><para>I think that this motion seeks to divide us on where public funding is to be allocatedâwhether it is to be spent on government or non-government schools.

When the government looks at the equation, it seems to forget that there is a whole stream of income going to non-government schools that is not readily available to public schools. I think it is unfair and deceptive for the government not to accept that, when you make a choice to get out of the public school system, there are costs that will be borne because of that choice; and, as a result, there is revenue going directly into many non-government schools. There is also no acknowledgment that government schools are required to provide a high quality education for all comers, including over 40 per cent of students who come from the lowest family income bandâcompared with only 28 per cent in this band for non-government schools. So clearly there is a divide; that is, the families who send their children to non-government schools have less income to provide for fees if they were required to be paid by a school.</para><para>The proposition that the public schools are looking after a greater proportion of children from low-income families is axiomatic. But if the government wants to be taken seriously on this critical issue of education, how can it justify a system that provides the largest increase over the last three years to the most elite schools in the country? The fact is that there is no justification for the likes of Geelong Grammar, which has received government expenditure increases of 240 per cent in the period 2001-04. There is absolutely no justification and that is why the member for Robertson never made reference to it. The King's School received a 195 per cent increase between 2001 and 2004. In the same period, federal funding for the Catholic schools increased by only 25 per cent per student. Funding for government schools increased by only 20 per cent. How can a government devise and then justify a system that would allow the most elite schools in this country to be in receipt of funding increases, over a three-year period, 10 times that of government schools and almost 10 times that of Catholic system schools? There is no justification for this government's policy. It knows it and that is why the mover of this motion failed to make reference to it when it came to that issue.</para><para>The fact is that the Labor Party do not support a system based on looking after the elite. We believe in a needs based system. The Leader of the Opposition said only last month, `I want every school in this country to be a high achieving schoolâgood teachers, parents and students working together. That is why Labor will introduce a needs based funding systemâall schools, government and non-government, reaching a national standard for resources and results. We will not be setting sector against sector, school against school, public against private. We will be bringing all schools up to a decent national standard.' <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>26128</page.no><name role="metadata">Gash, Joanna, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs GASH</name><name.id>AK6</name.id><electorate>Gilmore</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI support this motion by the member for Robertson and I want to acknowledge the tremendous contribution being made by parents, teachers and students in the 72 schools in Gilmore. Together they advance education for all of our children. However, our focus on school education must be about children, not necessarily about teachers, school systems, curricula or even values. While the elements that make up schools are not insignificant, they are only important in proportion to the impact they have on our children and their development into fully participating members of Australian society.</para></talk.start><para>This is fundamental since we are faced with an orchestrated campaign to transfer funds from one sector of schooling to another. The result is that children are affected. Friction between teachers in each system and envy and exclusiveness between families spill over into the relationships that children should be enjoying with each other. Once it was commonplace to see different schools cooperating to stage cultural and sporting events, particularly in regional areas like Gilmore. Many of these activities have now gone by the wayside in the interests of scoring political points, and our children lose out.</para><para>I take an interest in every school in Gilmore regardless of the system it belongs to. Attending special events, openings and presentation evenings are small demonstrations of my support for the work of teachers and their students. My daughter is a teacher in a state school, many of my friends are teachers, and as I move around the electorate I meet many other dedicated and hardworking teachers, all passionate about educating young people. These people represent the true quality of education that exists in our schools. They model values such as tolerance; respect for others, including good manners; striving for achievement; self-discipline; obedience to those in authority; and service to those in need.</para><para>However, there are a small minority of teachers who, having given up the coalface of the classroom, purport to represent the interests of public education. They are encouraged in New South Wales by its Minister for Education and Training, Dr Andrew Refshauge, and his bureaucrats and in this place by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Their campaign deliberately ignores the facts of education funding in this country to accuse the Australian government of favouring independent schools. Their agenda is to rip away money from one-third of Australian students and transfer it to the others. They want to deny all but the very wealthy the right to choose the style of education that best suits their children.</para><para>It is probably good that those who hold these views are not in the classrooms, polluting the minds of children with ideologyâfor, above anything else, those peddling this campaign do not value truth. They say they represent tolerance, but they do not tolerate those with different views to their own. They say they value inclusiveness, but it is only as long as they can determine who is included and on what terms. They say the Australian government gives more to private schools than public schools, without considering the totality of public funding and the origin of the revenue.</para><para>Last year in Gilmore only one non-government school received just $300,000 in capital funding, whereas four state schools received $1.65 million in Commonwealth capital grants. The 12 non-government schools received just over $14 million between them last year, just about equalling the public recurrent contributions to only two of our government high schools in Nowra.</para><para>This government has a proud record in education funding, having introduced the fairest system of fundingâthe socioeconomic status modelâto non-government schools. It replaced Labor's new schools policy, which worked against the establishment of low-fee schools to favour elite schools for the wealthy. At the same time this government has increased direct contributions for state schools by 60 per cent, while giving the states all the GST to ensure their ability to meet the funding requirements of the schools they are responsible for.</para><para>So, why do we have in Gilmore state schools like Ulladulla High and Moss Vale High with hopelessly inadequate facilities, or Berry Primary, being forced to sell off land to raise money for a school hall? It is one more instance of the New South Wales Labor government failing those who elected it and also those who did not. Huge sums of money are being wasted by the bureaucracy, ensuring that increased federal funds never make it to the classrooms of our local schools. By all means, let us debate school funding; but in that process we must have the integrity to practice the values each of us seeks to instil in our children.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>26129</page.no><name role="metadata">Quick, Harry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr QUICK</name><name.id>AV5</name.id><electorate>Franklin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak to the motion moved by the member for Robertson. It is great to have a debate on education. I can support wholeheartedly the first point in the motion:</para></talk.start><para>That this House:</para><para>(1)	acknowledges the outstanding efforts being made by teachers, staff and parents in both government and non-government schools in delivering quality education to Australia's 3.3 million school students;</para><para>As a school teacher for over 20 years and with my daughter Hannah currently teaching in Melbourne, I well know the trials and tribulations of teaching. There is no doubt that the schools in my electorate of Franklin possess dedicated and talented teachers. These schools have supportive staff, with teachers' aides, cleaners, grounds staff and office staff all contributing to their effective management. The volunteer service that parents and friends and other community members provide also gives our schools their heart and soul.</para><para>In Franklin there are 51 public, independent and Catholic schools. Many are suburban, some are rural and three are country district high schools. Many schools in my electorate are also in what are sometimes referred to as disadvantaged or lower socioeconomic areas. Like many members of this place in their own electorates, I make a point of visiting each and every school in my electorate as often as possible, and I am proud of the education that they deliver. As the member for Burke said, funding for schools, public or private, should be needs based. I agree with that, having taught in both school sectors and my children having attended schools in both sectors. It should be about the best education for all children, not just cheap political point scoring by some of those opposite.</para><para>The statement that Australia's 3.3 million school students and their parents are entitled to a choice of quality education is a loaded one. I would much prefer to say that Australia's 3.3 million students are entitled, each and every one of them, to a top-quality education regardless of which school they and their parents choose. The government cannot justify inadequate funding to public schools by simply saying that they are the states' responsibility. Health and housing are also the responsibility of the states, but does that mean the Commonwealth should not fund these areas? Certainly not. The Constitution, in its development, has seen the Commonwealth acquire revenue from the states, in turn agreeing to provide funding in many areas.</para><para>It is ironic but not surprising that something that Gough Whitlam said 35 years ago about education policy in that period is still relevant in the debate today. Gough Whitlam stated:</para><quote><para>Successive Liberal governments and successive ministers responsible for education have, as a matter of policy, minimised the role of the Commonwealth in education. They have resisted the development of new Commonwealth initiatives in educational matters. Liberals are as anxious to slow down the inevitable increase in government expenditure on schools as they are to slow down the inevitable increases in expenditure on hospitals and urban services. Accordingly, both state and federal Liberals assert that schools, hospitals and urban services are state functions.</para><para>They know the best way to restrict government expenditure on any activity is to say that the particular activity is one for the states, which have fewer financial resources than the Commonwealth, and which raise their revenue by indirect rather than direct taxation.</para></quote><para>This is as true today as it was 35 years ago. State governments simply do not have the funding capacity of the Commonwealth. It is totally unrealistic to expect state governments to fund public schools largely unassisted.</para><para>In 2003-04, the state Labor government in Tasmania increased funding to government schools by 6.7 per cent. To put it into perspective, a one per cent increase in state funding of $506 million is $5.06 million. A one per cent increase in Commonwealth funding of $70.5 million is $705,000. The Australian government increase of 5.6 per cent is stingy by comparison. The Australian government should be condemned for not matching the increase in funding provided by the state government.</para><para>Finally, I defend and support the campaign of the Australian Education Union, a union of which I was proud to be a member for the 23 years I was a teacher in both sectors of the education system in Australia across several states. The union has campaigned tirelessly to protect the rights of its members and public schools. The union campaign focuses on the facts. Public secondary schools receive $803 per student compared to the more than $3,000 per student that many private schools receive. One wonders why there is less funding for government schools. Just imagine what could be done with that amount of money per student in a government school. The AEU's federal president said:</para><quote><para>Our campaign is not about pitting student against student.

The vast majority of our schools in both sectorsâpublic and non-governmentâdo an excellent job. Most have outstanding teams of committed, professional and caring teachers. One of the strengths of our schooling in Australia is its diversity. A range of public schools, Catholic and other denominational schools and independent schools all play a vital role in educating and nurturing our children, albeit with slightly different emphases and slightly different approaches.</para></talk.start><para>This government supports the principle of choice in education. Parents have a right to choose the type of school which best reflects the values they teach in the home and which best meets the needs, as they see them, of their children. For 68 per cent of our children, this means education in the public system; for 32 per cent, it means education in the non-government sector. But the fact is that all parents are taxpayers and all have the right to expect some level of supportâdepending partly on the level of needâfor the education of their children. The point is that both systems do an excellent job and they have generally existed harmoniously and worked cooperatively together over the years.</para><para>In that context, it is appalling that in recent years we have seen and currently are seeing the Australian Education Union, some of its affiliates and the Labor Party trying to create divisions between the two schooling sectors to play off one against the other for some cheap short-term political gain. Their methods are equally shameful: misrepresentation, distortion and dishonesty. Trying to argue that the Australian government somehow favours the non-government sector over the public sector or trying to argueâblatantly dishonestlyâthat the federal government is cutting funding from public schools is just wrong. These assertions could not be further from the truth.</para><para>We need to look at the facts. For some, the facts are foreign territory. But these are the facts: firstly, state public schools are the constitutional responsibility of state governments. To argue that they are not is nonsense. To criticise the federal government for not funding state government responsibilities is as ludicrous as criticising the state governments for not funding defence or other federal government responsibilities. State schools are the responsibility of state governments. Secondlyâand this is the critical pointâthe federal government does assist, and does assist considerably, with the funding of those state government responsibilities.</para><para>It does this in two ways. Firstly, it does it indirectly by those bucket loads of money that the federal government gives to the state governments every year to help them with their core funding responsibilities. This year alone the Commonwealth will transfer $54 billion, or $54,000 million, to the states to help them fund their core responsibilitiesâsuch as schools. Around half of state revenue comes indirectly or directly from the Commonwealth. To totally ignore that, as members opposite have just done and as the Australian Education Union does, is a complete distortion. Half of the funding that the states put into schools indirectly comes from grants from the Commonwealth in the first place.</para><para>The second aspect of funding is the direct funding: those directly targeted education top-up grants from the federal government. They have risen by 58 per cent under this government. In addition to that indirect funding this government has increased direct funding to state schools by 58 per cent. The point is this: when you put direct funding and indirect funding together, around half of all funding that states allocate to schools comes from the federal government, yet the largest component of this is totally ignoredâdeliberately ignoredâby those opposite and those in the education unions who argue the other case.</para><para>The third fact is that in the total context of financial resourcesâwhich you must look atâpublic schools, with 68 per cent of students, receive $19.9 billion a year in public taxpayer funding, and non-government schools receive only $6.2 billion for their 32 per cent of students. No private school receives any more than 70 per cent of the funding of a public school with the same number of students. In fact the wealthier schools receive less than 14 per cent. The nonsense that we have heard from people who said that somehow those schools get more is disproven by the facts. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>26132</page.no><name role="metadata">Corcoran, Ann, MP</name><name role="display">Ms CORCORAN</name><name.id>009CW</name.id><electorate>Isaacs</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAustralia has a relatively high number of students in non-government schools, thanks largely to the Catholic Church establishing parish funded schools independent of government funding 150 years ago. In the late 1960s, private schools began to receive government funding, first from state and territory governments and then from the Commonwealth government. In 1974, the then Labor government introduced the general recurrent grants and capital grants programs that we have today. In 2001, the government changed the method used to allocate funds to non-government schools. At the same time, it increased the total pool of funds available to non-government schools and changed the relativities of funding between these non-government schools. The government took a deliberate decision to increase the funding available to the already better off schools faster than the funding on offer to not so well-off schools.</para></talk.start><para>This debate should be about the effectiveness or fairness of the decision taken by this government to alter the basis of funding of non-government schools relative to each other and relative to government schools. This debate is not about whether or not the Commonwealth government should financially support non-government schoolsâit should. Families should have the right to send their children to a school of their choice and to receive a share of public funding based on need in that process. It should be remembered that it was under a Labor government in the 1970s that the substantial work in delivering Commonwealth funding to non-government schools based on need took place. This debate should be about nothing more and nothing less than whether or not the current funding arrangements are making the best use of taxpayers' funds in ensuring that all of our children are getting the very best education we can give them.</para><para>I argue that the current arrangements are definitely not using our scarce taxpayers' funds in the best way. Let us imagine that someone from Mars dropped into Melbourne today and looked around at our schools. He or she would see that all our schools have teachers who are dedicated to their students, that the staff work hard and over long hours to meet the varying demands and needs of their students, that all schools take a broader view of education than just the academic curriculumâthey also drum into their students good social values and practices that these students will take with them into adulthoodâand that many schools offer specialised cultural and religious education.</para><para>The person from Mars would note, however, that some schools have more resources than others, that some schools have more teaching staff per student and that there is a huge difference in the physical facilities available to each school. Some schools have purpose-built computer labs, many playing fields, a few swimming pools, dedicated music facilities, country camps et cetera. Other schools operate out of a few portable classrooms around a bitumen playing area. The difference in resources extends across the range of schools and includes government and non-government schools. If I told this person that the current government had deliberately put into place an arrangement in which the biggest increase in funds went to those schools with the best resources, I would have to forgive my friend for thinking that we had all gone mad.</para><para>Australia can hold its head up high on the international stage when our schools' performance is compared with that of other countries. We are in the top bands for reading and mathematical and scientific literacy. All states and territories perform at or above the OECD average. The bad news is that the gap between the highest and lowest achievers is greater in Australia than in most OECD countries. The relationship between socioeconomic background and achievement is higher in Australia and we have a lower proportion of young people completing year 12 than in comparable countries.

These resources are taxpayers' funds and, more importantly, the brains and talents of all our young people. If we fail to ensure that all our children have the best education we can possibly offer them, we are not promoting economic use of public resources and we are wasting the skills of our children. The current situation is that relatively well-off independent schools pick up an increase of more than 200 per cent in Commonwealth funding, whilst other independent schools get a much smaller increase and government schools get something like 20 per cent. This is not needs based funding; it is a very inefficient and inequitable use of our public resources.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>26133</page.no><name role="metadata">Panopoulos, Sophie, MP</name><name role="display">Ms PANOPOULOS</name><name.id>00AMU</name.id><electorate>Indi</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to support the motion moved by my colleague the member for Robertson. I welcome this opportunity to speak on the motion, particularly to assist in clarifying the misleading statements made by members on the opposite side in relation to school funding, which are unfortunately being used not only to create a wedge in our community but also to perpetuate the deception about what this government is doing. Every parent wants the very best for their child. In the most important area of education, this government has proudly given parents the choice in assessing what is best for their child's needs. That is a tenet that is not recognised by the Australian Labor Party. For each of the 3.3 million students at school in Australia, there is a place at a government school, a non-government school, an independent school or a Catholic school, where they can flourish in a learning environment.</para></talk.start><para>When opponents of the government's approach to school funding see the facts on paper in black and white, they should know that their strident opposition to the funding formulae utilised for both government and non-government schools is misguided. The motion that I support clearly acknowledges the fact that Australia's 2.25 million students who attend state schools receive $19.9 billion in public funding and the fewer 1.04 million students who attend Catholic and independent schools only receive a total of $6.2 billion in public funding. In other wordsâto make it even clearer than black and whiteâstudents attending non-government schools receive much less than those who attend government schools.</para><para>This government strongly believes that all Australian parents, having paid their taxes, deserve to have some of their taxes go to funding and supporting the education of their children, whether they go to a state school or a non-government school. The parents that choose to send their children to non-government schools are actually doing state governments a huge favour. Imagine for one minute the huge cost burden on the state governments if everyone were to withdraw their child from the non-government school that they attended. When the Leader of the Opposition was a relatively erudite thinkerâbefore the world changed and he promised no more crudity on 2 December 2003âhe said that `not every school should be entitled to public funding'. Yet his very own spokeswoman on education, the member for Jagajaga, stated more recently that the Labor Party `accepts that all schools should receive some public funding'.</para><para>On a matter as important as the education of our children, to have these conflicting statements emanating from the Labor Party in the short space of less than six months should be a matter of concern for all parents and all students. The member for Isaacs talked about an imaginary discussion with someone from Mars. Even someone from Mars would see that there is a great deal of confusion, inconsistency and wedge politics taking place in the Labor Party on this very important issue of the education of our next generation. The Labor Party instead should lean on its state parliamentary colleagues to recognise their constitutional responsibility in being the main supporters of state schools and to more adequately fund them. As my very able colleague the member for Macquarie highlighted, almost half of all state funding is derived from Commonwealth funds. At an important time when the Commonwealth has been increasing its funding to government and non-government schools, the states have not come even close to matching that funding. </para><para>At a local level I have been very pleased to announce funding of tens of millions of dollars to government and non-government schools, and I have great confidence that over the course of this year I will continue to make further announcements. When I attended the St Joseph's parish primary Christmas concert to inform the school community of the good news, the very grateful community did express its thanks to the Commonwealth government.

We on this side of the House acknowledge the importance of education for all Australians. We also acknowledge the role that the Commonwealth plays and the need for the Commonwealth and states to work together in delivering quality education to all Australian students: equal access and equal education. Like the member for Robertson, I would like to acknowledge the outstanding effort of teachers and parents in Australian schools. In doing so, I bring to the attention of the House the concern expressed to me by public schools in the Shortland electorate about the Howard government constantly attacking and undermining public schools. </para></talk.start><para>Earlier this month I received a letter from Gorokan High School, on the Central Coast. They refer to the assertion by Mr Howard that they are seen `as a school community with neutral values'. They disagree very strongly with and are truly offended by that statement. They say that their school community upholds the values of democracy and a fair go for all, often under extremely trying circumstances. I feel it is very important to put that on the record. </para><para>I would also put on the record that Belmont High School, a public high school, was very upset when the Prime Minister attacked public schools and teachers earlier this year. They believe that he should be ashamed of himself and that the government should be ashamed too for not standing up for public schools. The principal of Belmont High School strongly lobbied me, criticising the channelling of large sums of money to private schools as advocated by the government, and said that the government should be concentrating on delivering equal education to all Australian students. He told me that Belmont High School has a commitment to instilling strong values in students, and that has been demonstrated by the nationally recognised student welfare program that was conducted at that school. He said that Belmont High School has a real sense of community where everyone is accepted and there are no splinter groups. My advice to the Prime Minister and the members on the other side of this parliament is that, if they truly value public schools, they should make that known to the community as a whole.</para><para>In the Shortland electorate 80 per cent of all students attend public schools. Of the remaining 20 per cent, 14.2 per cent attend Catholic schools. Funding to these schools has suffered under the Howard government as a direct result of its slavish preoccupation with diverting money to elite private schools. I note that over 200104 the largest increase in funding from this Howard government went to the wealthiest schools in the country. Geelong Grammar has received a 240 per cent increase under the Howard governmentâthat hardly represents equityâand The King's School in Sydney has received an increase of 195 per cent. I think that the government stands condemned for its elitist action of directing money to the wealthiest schools in Australia. At the same time under this government, funding to Catholic systemic schools has been increased by only 25 per cent and to public schools by only 20 per cent. </para><para>The government's approach is to blame the states and the state schools for the decline in funding to public schools. The bottom line is that these are figures that the federal government gives to the various sectors. These figures demonstrate very strongly where the Howard government's commitment is. It is not to public schools. It is not to the schools to which the majority of students in the Shortland electorate go. Rather it is to the elite private schools: the Geelong Grammars, the Kings and the schools that the majority of government members attended and now send their children to.

It certainly highlights the commitment that this government has to choice in education, and it also certainly highlights the fact that the members opposite seem to be against the notion of choiceâagainst the notion that parents may choose an education system other than our very fine state school system to send their children to. I have many fine schools in my electorate, both in the state school sector and in the independent and Catholic sectors. They do a great job. Last year, two of those schoolsâNambucca Heads High School and Bishop Druitt Collegeâwere acknowledged with some very fine awards. Nambucca Heads High School was one of 16 schools to receive an outstanding achievement award, and Bishop Druitt College was one of 51 schools nationally to receive a highly commended award. One was a state school, and one was a non-government school. Both of these schools have done great work in improving literacy and numeracy levels and had that as one of their key priorities. They have put together a coordinated strategy, working with students, teachers and parents. The National Awards for Quality Schooling are highly competitive, and it is great to see these two schools in my electorate being so recognised. A $24,000 prize went to Nambucca Heads High School, and an $8,000 prize went to Bishop Druitt Collegeâa great acknowledgment of the great work that they do.</para></talk.start><para>I would also like to mention Willawarrin Public School, a small school tucked away in the upper reaches of the Macleay Valley. Headmaster Peter Wells, the parents and the staff there are doing a great job in making some great initiatives in educationâso much so that the great work they have done was awarded a $2,000 federal government achievement award prize. The work was so good that they actually made a video of what they do at Willawarrin school with regard to literacy and numeracy, and this is being circulated as a model for other schools to use. That is fantastic out at Willawarrin. Just because you are a small school in a regional or rural area does not mean that you cannot contribute to the highest levels of education achievement and provide opportunities for our young children, which is after all the aim of the education system.</para><para>I think that the Australian Education Union's advertising campaign is inaccurate, deceitful and a political stunt. I wish they would put those resources into education rather than into playing politics with the education of our children. They should be working on improving education, not trying to score some political points. They falsely presume that all students going to independent or Catholic schools are from wealthy families. Nothing could be further from the truth. One in five families sending children to private and independent schools is earning less than $20,800 a year. It is certainly not elitist; it is just the people of Australia exercising choice. It also should be noted that almost 50 per cent of high-income earnersâthose earning over $104,000 a yearâsend their children to state schools. So people, regardless of income levels, are choosing between our quality state schools and our Catholic and independent schools. We should not forget the fact that the parents of children at Catholic and independent schools have paid their taxes, so their education needs should also be supported. That support should not be restricted to our fine state schools. The private and independent schools are deserving of support from the taxpayer.</para><para>Recently I welcomed the announcement that the federal government had provided another $362 million to increase funding for Catholic schools. More than 600,000 students are at those Catholic schools. It is great to see funding being channelled into that area. If those parents who send their children to private schools were to suddenly withdraw their willingness to pay feesâto contribute the $3 billion to $4 billion every year that parents of children at Catholic and independent schools payâwhat would it do? Our education system would be in crisis. The state system just could not cope with the flood of students moving over to it.</para><para>Labor's agenda is to run down the independent school sector and promote the state school sector. I think we should be adopting a position of equityâan equitable system for children in state schools and an equitable system for children in Catholic and independent schools. That is what the current federal government arrangement provides. Currently, 68 per cent of students go to state schools and receive 76 per cent of the funding, while 32 per cent of students go to Catholic and independent schools and receive 24 per cent of the funding, with the balance being made up by the parents of those children. We should be supporting choice in education. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>26137</page.no><name role="metadata">Jackson, Sharryn, MP</name><name role="display">Ms JACKSON</name><name.id>00AN2</name.id><electorate>Hasluck</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI sometimes sit in here and think that the quality of our democracy would be enhanced if we listened to each other across the chamber. Today's debate on education funding has clearly and unfortunately demonstrated a lack of willingness to listen to each other and the issues that have been raised on either side. Unfortunately, there is only one part of the honourable member for Robertson's resolution that I can support this afternoon, and that is that part which acknowledges the outstanding efforts being made by teachers, staff and parents in both government and non-government schools in delivering quality education to Australia's 3.3 million school students. As to the rest of his resolution, I cannot endorse the statements that are contained therein.</para></talk.start><para>I think I can genuinely speak for a large number of parents in my electorate when I say that they are sick and tired of the blame game between state and Commonwealth governments with respect to funding some of our essential services, such as health, education and the like. In that respect, it is very difficult to stand here and listen to sides accuse each other of whose responsibility it is or is not. When you look at the hard facts in terms of government funding you see that there is one genuine criticism that can be made of the current federal government's funding model, and I think it is one that honourable members opposite should take on board. Neither I nor anyone in the Labor Party is saying by any stretch that the government should not ensure that education funding gets to schools and students where it is most needed, in both the government sector and the non-government sector. What we have an objection to is the situation where government funding goes to already advantaged independent schools at a disproportionately high level at the expense of other, needier schools.</para><para>I call upon members opposite to raise this issue internally in their own party discussions, because it is very clear to me that it is hard to justify a situation where a very good Catholic college in my electorateâLa Salle College in Midland, which is a systemic Catholic schoolâreceived over the last four-year period of school funding an increase of less than 25 per cent when one of the wealthier schools in Australia, The King's School, which has been used as an example today, received an increase of 195 per cent over that same period. Frankly, there is no justification of need that would warrant such a disproportionate allocation of resources. So I call on the government to examine the SES model, for if it was about ensuring that schoolsâbe they government or non-government schoolsâthat were in need received funding, then the model is not quite working correctly.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âOrder!

As part of Rotary International's centenary, Rotary clubs worldwide have been asked to initiate a project that will be of service and benefit to the community in general. The Rotary Club of Kirra-Currumbin has formed a road safety committee to coordinate this project and set in motion the plan that Australians should stay alive in 2005.</para></talk.start><para>I commend the 15 members of the Rotary Club in my electorate for taking on this challenge.

Over the next 12 months they will build the momentum of awareness towards an accident free day in 2005. Kirra-Currumbin Rotary want to draw on the spirit of all Australians to get behind this goal and have every road user on 23 February 2005 find their way home in good health.

The latest victim wasâin the early hours of yesterday morningâthe Burwood East Primary School in my electorate. These attacks by cowardly individuals always do untold damage to the morale of the school community, let alone the buildings. In the case of Burwood East Primary School, early estimates indicate over $100,000 in damage. The fire destroyed or partly destroyed the sick bay, the teachers' room, the principal's office, the admin office and the LOTE classroom. Recently delivered and unpacked computers in the principal's office were also at risk.</para></talk.start><para>Yesterday, soon after learning of the fire, I called in at the school and met with Principal Maria Atherton. In the true spirit of dedicated teaching professionals, Mrs Atherton was already planning how to ensure that students would still be able to receive the customary high quality of education when they return on Tuesday. From my previous experience with fire damaged schools in the electorate I know that the school communityâparents, teachers and studentsârally together to ensure school life goes on as well as possible, often in very difficult circumstances.</para><para>I welcome the Department of Education and Training's early statements about restoring the school to full operational status as soon as possible. The last thing the school community needs is unnecessary bureaucratic or political delays in getting the building works approved and finalised. In my electorate we remember all too well the two-year delay by the then state education minister, Mary Delahunty, in getting the Blackburn Lake Primary School rebuilt, after promises the school would be rebuilt within nine months. Such delays are unacceptable, and I will be keeping a watchful eye on the restoration work at Burwood East to ensure students and teachers are not further disadvantaged.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Transport: Infrastructure</title><page.no>26139</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>26139</page.no><name role="metadata">Organ, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ORGAN</name><name.id>BNL</name.id><electorate>Cunningham</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âLast Saturday I attended a meeting of the Illawarra Commuters Association in the old technical institute hall at Thirroul railway station.

This comes on top of recent rather vociferous debates over the state of the roads in our regionâsuch as the now closed Lawrence Hargrave Drive, the Princes Highway and Main Road 92âand the issue of just who is responsible for paying for construction, maintenance and necessary upgrades.</para></talk.start><para>At the end of the day, the people of Australia expect government, whether it be local, state or federal, to take care of basic services such as road and railâfrom kerbing and guttering through to divided four-lane highways and electrification of the rail lines.

We need to upgrade the roads into the portâthe roads serving the South Coast and the south-western region of New South Wales.</para><para>We need to complete the Maldon-Dumbarton rail link in order to get trucks off the road and send more freight to the port by rail. The federal government talks of using the AusLink initiative to help support such strategic regional infrastructure upgrades. But we need to do more than talk; we need action, we need initiatives and we need spending. The finances of the New South Wales state Labor government are in a mess. Money must be found to spend on rail and road to ensure that freight and passenger services are maintained and improved.

Unfortunately the wool boom of the 1950s did not extend to many of those soldier settlers who started at a later date. The blocks provided independent living, and there was a great camaraderie of all the people in the Shelford district and throughout rural Victoria. These men struggled for two or three years from humble, early beginnings. They started their small farms with just a garage. There was no running water or television.

Specifically, the funding announcement provides $150,000 to Frankston City Council to extend the Langwarrin partnership initiative. This is an example of the local business community, the BP service station, councillors and community organisations working together to support the youth of our area who tend to congregate around the shopping areas in the absence of any other activities for them to take part in.

The government has, in particular, failed in its family tax benefits system. Instead of offering assistance to Australian families, all the system seems to do is trap families in a cycle of ongoing debt. In Australia today around 56 per cent of all payments made to Australian families are incorrect. This is not because of dishonesty or a failure to provide correct information to familiesâor, for that matter, any lack of professionalism on behalf of the workers at Centrelinkâbut because the government system is flawed and does not meet the needs of ordinary families. Around one-third of payments to families result in a debt being incurred, with the average family debt around the country at around $900. This has been an ongoing problem for many yearsâa problem that the government simply fails to address and fails to fix year after year.</para><para>It is also becoming evident that an increasing number of families are being underpaid, on average, $23 per fortnight. People are now disengaging from, and being forced out of, the system because of a fear of incurring further debt.

That is because of the good economic politics of the Howard government, which have reduced debt, kept interest rates low and reformed industrial relations in Australia. Small business in this country can now get on with business and generate more employment for Australians.

We spent $7 billion on child care from 1996 to 2002âthat is, 70 per cent more than was spent in the last six years under Labor.

There were major tax cuts for older Australians announced in the 2001 budget through the increase in the low-income aged persons rebate. A new system of family tax benefits was introduced from July 2000 which provides benefits of more than $10 billion a year to Australian families. Capital gains tax reforms have been introduced so that individuals are only taxed on half of their capital gains. The company tax rate has been reduced from 36 per cent to 30 per cent. The government introduced a measure to refund excess imputation credits, which is worth about $500 million a year to Australian taxpayers. Wholesale sales tax has been abolished. Fuel excise indexation has been abolished, and the government cut the fuel excise rate in 2001 by 1.5c a litre. Financial institutions duty was abolished in July 2001, at the time delivering savings of $1.2 billion a year to individuals and companies. Other taxes administered by the states and territories, including bed taxes and stamp duties on marketable securities, were abolished as part of a new tax system, and the bank accounts debit tax is scheduled to be abolished by all states and territories by 1 July 2005. So I can say to the member for Kooyong: not only can I give an assurance that we will not be introducing new taxes or introducing increases in existing rates; I can point to a record of tax reduction that is unparalleled by any other government over the last eight years.</para></talk.start></continue></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Workplace Relations: Paid Maternity Leave</title><page.no>26144</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>26144</page.no><name role="metadata">Latham, Mark, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LATHAM</name><name.id>K26</name.id><electorate>Werriwa</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is to the Prime Minister.

The Leader of the Opposition was one of those who sat and cynically tried to stop taxation reform, which had, as an element, billions of dollars of additional help to Australian women, whether they chose to return to the work force, decided to be at home or decided to be at home for a while while their children were young and then re-enter the work force.</para></talk.start><para>The philosophy of this government is not to mandate a particular form of parental behaviour by new mothers but rather to maximise the choice that is available to them.

They would tell the people smugglers that they are opposed to offshore processing, so people can be brought to Australia. Once they get close to Australia they will be able to get in, so the people smugglers will be able to deliver to their clients. The Labor Party oppose the further excision of islands and, interestingly enough, are opposed to turning boats back. In other words, people are not to be sent straight back if they try to come here illegallyâthey are to be landed.

He is a civil engineer and has a very great interest in infrastructure. He has been a fearless advocate for the infrastructure needs of his own particular electorate. We are putting a national transport plan into place in Australia, and this will be to the great benefit of Australians now and in the future both in terms of economic outcomes and, very importantly, better environmental and amenity outcomes.</para></talk.start><para>We need to ensure that our planning in the future breaks away from the ad hoc planning that we have seen too much of in recent decades. To that end, we have certainly progressed a long way with rail. We are now very close to seamless interstate rail networks which link all of our capital cities with rail track that works, which can compete with road and take a great deal of stress off our roads, and do us proud both economically and, as I mentioned a moment ago, in terms of congestion and amenity. Progress with incorporating the designated interstate freight track in New South Wales into the national grid is now advanced to the point where I am quite confident that we can start spending the $872 million we have had on the table for the last two years, from about the time of the budget this year.</para><para>We have actually spent, over and above all of the money that has gone to the states who are the major providers of infrastructure in Australia, some $13 billion over the eight years we have been in government. An example of what that money has achieved is on the Pacific Highwayâof great interest, I know, to many people in this place, and outside it, who use it. In cooperation with the state government, in an initiative which was ours I must say, by declaring that road a RONI we have taken the dual carriageway sections of that vitally important road that links our two great eastern seaboard cities, Sydney and BrisbaneâMelbourne, of course, is not quite on the east coast in the same wayâfrom nine per cent to 32 per cent. Recently, Senator Ian Campbell and I were delighted to announce, on behalf of the government, that we would be committing a further $2 billion in the future. Of that $2 billion, $1.2 billion is for Roads to Recovery. </para><para>Roads to Recovery is an extraordinarily successful program right across Australia which is wholeheartedly embraced by local government and by the people who drive on local roads. It is worth noting, on International Women's Day, that we are indebted to the Country Women's Association who first pointed out a few years ago that local roads were at the top of their agenda at that timeânot so much now, because we have done so much to improve them. This is incredibly important, because roads are all about people in the country being able to access education and services, get the kids to the doctor or to school, or whatever.

I would like to assure the people of New England, in passing, that they have been persistently misled about the new Roads to Recovery program. There is no pea and thimble trick, as the member for New England claims in his newsletter. He claims that Roads to Recovery has been diminished to $840 million. It has not; it is $1.2 billion. He further claims that country motorists are going to pay for it because of the winding down of the fuel sales grant scheme which is supported by the other side. The difference is that, in 2Â½ years, we are going to divert the money into road fundingâbut not into Roads to Recovery. The Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads, Senator Ian Campbell, advised that august journal the <inline font-style="italic">Northern Daily </inline><inline font-style="italic">Leader</inline> of the facts recently. He pointed out very clearly that the FSGS money is being diverted to further roads and infrastructure for the benefit of the same people who currently get the grants. Unlike what the people of New England have been persistently misled to believe, it is a win-win situation all round.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I am asked about alternative policies. Again I am indebted to that august journal the <inline font-style="italic">Northern Daily Leader</inline>, for telling me more about the Leader of the Opposition's policies than Labor's policy platform or policy statements do. When it comes to transport, their policies are a bit like their regional development policies. If I go to the member for Batman's web site and look for his policy prescriptions I find that, as with the Leader of the Opposition, there has been a bit of a vacant space for the last few years. There is nothing there. We really have a dearth of information about what the Labor Party think ought to be done in the area of transport and logisticsâwhich is, after all, nine per cent of the Australian economy. There is no guide to be had. The <inline font-style="italic">Northern Daily Leader</inline> cannot recall that there were any musingsânot in their web sites or their policy statementsâapart from a brief reference to the Roads to Recovery as boondoggle by the Leader of the Opposition. So we have to go to the state Labor parties to see how they manage transport.</para><para>We know how the Bracks government has managed Scoresby. We know now that when we step in to generously help with a bit of state roadâas we did last year with the people of north-east New South Wales and south-east Queensland in that heavily built-up area there, namely the Tugan bypassâand we put money on the table, the two state governments cannot agree. The Premier of Queensland cannot get on the phone to his mate in New South Wales and say, `Listen, Bob: we really need to resolve this problem.' He has to come and say, `We states cannot agree. We want the Commonwealth to intervene to fix it.'</para><para>Last week, we had an even finer example of the state governments, confronted with a mess of their own making on transport policy, trying to reinvent the wheel. I think we are all aware that New South Wales has a bit of a problem in the Sydney basin. It is just a bit of a problem. They are something like billions of dollars behind on the passenger transport network. The whole community is up in arms. They are on the nose, they are in trouble in the polls, so what do they do? While we are ensconced down here, they have a big party out on the M7âthe Western Sydney Orbitalâand they trumpet their marvellous achievements. This is the high-water mark of Sydney's transport solutions as put forward by the Sydney based Labor government. The only problem is: it is a federal government initiative, and we are the only government putting money into it.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Howard Government: Ministerial Code of Conduct</title><page.no>26151</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>26151</page.no><name role="metadata">McMullan, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McMULLAN</name><name.id>5I4</name.id><electorate>Fraser</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is to the Prime Minister, and it relates to his code of conduct and his responsibility to be honest with the Australian people.

There is an ongoing good news story about what this coalition government have been doing in the area of child care. Why today? Because over 760,000 children are using some form of Commonwealth funded child care. That is an increase of 44 per cent since we came into government. That is the increase in the number of children, and there has been a 73 per cent increase in the number of Commonwealth funded child-care places since the coalition came to government in 1996.</para></talk.start><para>The average payment now to Australian families is about $2,000 per family through child-care benefits. I might add there was also the announcement that we made at the end of last year about a further $79.5 million down payment in three critical areas of child careâoutside school hours care, family day care and playgroups. I know the member for McPherson was delighted when she received just under 400 places in outside school hours care. To name a couple of those services, there are those at Elanora, King's and St Vincent's, along with many other services in Queensland and right across Australia.</para><para>The announcement we made at the end of last year was about 10,000 additional places in outside school hours care to meet that critical demand; 2,500 places in family day care, which wiped out all the unmet demandâand, of course, additional places in playgroups. That is just under $80 million on top of the $1.6 billion that we are spending on child care. I quote Robyn Monro Miller, who is here today, from the National Out of School Hours Services Association. She welcomed the news, particularly about outside school hours places, saying:</para><quote><para> ... this is ... a down payment for the future ...</para></quote><para>and that it would `give relief to many families struggling to find affordable care'. This is about playgroups as well, because only 30 per cent of Australian families actually use some type of Commonwealth funded child care, and we recognise the other 70 per cent. That is why a doubling of funding to playgroups is particularly important in giving them a choice. That is an $11 million commitment.</para><para>The member for McPherson asked, `Are there any alternatives?' I have to say the alternative government has been in absolute confusion recently when it comes to child-care policies. In particular, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has been in an absolute spin about child care since the national conference. At the national conference of the ALP back in January, Cassandra Wilkinson of the New South Wales Labor Women's Forum let the cat out of the bag about a secret deal that was done between her and the Deputy Leader of the Oppositionânot so secret, because it was actually published in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>. That was to provide 10 hours of free child care per week for all children below preschool age, plus a guarantee of a free year at preschool.</para><para>Preschools are the responsibility of state governments. Why would you make preschool free for both rich and poor? This is estimated to cost $3 billion; a $3 billion commitment would be required for this particular proposal. But there was a nod and a wink, because they quickly removed it from the agenda. I quote Ms Wilkinson. She said:</para><quote><para>The reality is we low-balled what Jenny thought were reasonable commitments.</para></quote><para>So what is it? Is it $3 billion? Is it $4 billion? Is it $5 billion? Is it $6 billion? How on earth do you intend to pay for your child-care policies? You are either going to cut child-care benefits, increase taxes or go further into debt.

He was out at the end of last week talking about how the structure of the agreement was going to restrict our exports of automobiles. It is a classic case of the Labor Party always looking at the glass being half empty and never looking at the opportunities that are being created and the opportunities that are there to be taken advantage of.</para><para>One of the most telling aspects of this is that if you look at history the Labor Party has never negotiated one of these.

It signed a bilateral agreement with New Zealand, which was negotiated by my predecessor bar one, Doug Anthony, back in the early eighties. Since then, it has been the coalition government that has negotiated all the bilateral agreements that we have entered intoâbilateral agreements which have delivered significant opportunities for the Australian economy. Our government has a very strong track record of pursuing market access opportunities, both multilaterally and bilaterally, whenever they present themselves.

I would remind not only the Leader of the Opposition but also the member for Lilley that the very scheme that the member for Lilley is talking about would not have been possible without tax reform, which he totally opposed from start to finish.</para></talk.start></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Trade: Free Trade Agreement</title><page.no>26155</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>26155</page.no><name role="metadata">Washer, Dr Mal, MP</name><name role="display">Dr WASHER</name><name.id>84F</name.id><electorate>Moore</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Ageing.

That is why he is so concerned to ensure that this government deliversâas it hasâthe best possible health care to the Australian people. Let me say this to the member for Moore: the free trade agreement is a once in a generation opportunity for Australia to link itself to the world's largest and strongest economy. Thanks to the free trade agreement, over time Australia will become part of a domestic economy that is some 300 million people strong. That historic sense of being a small, vulnerable economy in an uncertain world will finally be dispelled thanks to the free trade agreement that this government has negotiated with the American government.</para></talk.start><para>Let me make it very clear that the free trade agreement has not compromised the integrity of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Prices to consumers will not rise, the legislation will not change and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee will remain the gatekeeper to the PBS.

Under the review process, all that can happen is that the PBAC may be asked to look again at a particular application. Cost-effectiveness will remain the criteria, the PBAC will remain the judge and the Australian government will remain sovereign over the operation of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The free trade agreement is a very good deal for the Australian people, but this government has not compromised the integrity of the PBS to get it.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Taxation: Family Payments</title><page.no>26156</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>26156</page.no><name role="metadata">Swan, Wayne, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SWAN</name><name.id>2V5</name.id><electorate>Lilley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question without notice is directed to the Prime Minister and relates to the government's failure to ease the impact of family benefit debt.

The truth is that from time to time any government determines priorities so far as taxation reductions and expenditure are concerned. As I indicated last year, we gave $10 billion of personal tax cuts. When those tax cuts were presented to the parliament, I do not recall the Australian Labor Party voting against them; I recall the Australian Labor Party voting in favour of those tax cuts. I also remind those who sit opposite that we are talking here about the adjustment on an annual basis of people's entitlements to a benefit that is infinitely more generous than any benefit provided by the Australian Labor Party.</para></talk.start><para>The member for Lilley talks as if the adjustment of entitlements at the end of the year is the imposition of some kind of new taxation. We are talking here of the adjustment at the end of the year of people's entitlements. My understanding is that something in the order of 66 per cent of people's entitlements do not require any adjustment or, if they do, they attract a top-up. The others involve an adjustment because, through a combination of circumstances, there has been an overpayment of that benefit. Surely the Australian Labor Party is not suggesting that in relation to that 34 per cent of cases we should simply waive the requirement for some adjustment. There is no system that any government can sustain which simply says that, irrespective of the estimates that are made, whatever is paid cannot be the subject of any adjustment.</para><para>The Labor Party is being completely disingenuous on this issue. If it believed in helping families, it would get out of the way and pass that legislation in the Senate.

I appreciate how much interest he and, I am sure, some of his constituents have in this issue. Obviously a lot of returned service men and women have a particular interest in the future of Changi prison, which, by the way, is still to this day a working prison. The government has made representations to the Singapore government over quite some months now, arguing that whilst we could understand their plans to redevelop Changi prisonâin Singapore they do not have an enormous amount of space for construction of new prisonsâwe would want some of the existing Changi prison, for historic and emotional reasons, to be retained. I have put this, as have other ministers, to the Singapore government on many occasions.</para></talk.start><para>I was very pleased to hear at the weekend that the Singapore government have announced that they will be prepared to preserve some of the key elements of the old Changi prison building. They have announced that they are going to preserve a 180-metre stretch of the prison wall and also two corner turrets. A lot of returned service men and women have said that they would like the main gate to be preserved, for understandable reasons. Apparently the Singapore government's decision includes the relocation of the main gate from inside the prison to the stretch of the outside wall which is going to be retained.</para><para>These components of Changi prison will be preserved as a national monument of Singapore. Australians visiting Singapore will clearly be able to visit the preserved wall and the gates, even though they will still be a component of the external wall of a working prison. I know there will be many Australiansâthose who were interred there during the Second World War and, of course, their familiesâwho will be delighted that the Singapore government has responded so positively and also, if I could say so, so sensitively to the requests that we and people like the RSL and other veterans have made from Australia. I think it is an illustration of the strength of our relationship with Singapore and an illustration too of their sensitivity to the values and culture of Australia and the things that are important to us. I think all members on both sides of the House would agree that we very much appreciate what the Singapore government has done.</para><para>Some may argue that the whole of the original prison should be preserved. Whilst on the one hand I can understand that, on the other hand it has to be remembered that this is a working prison and it does need to be rehabilitated and renovated. As I have been inside it myself, I can well and truly understand that. I was there as a visitor; my father spent a little longer there, but in my case I have only managed to visit. I make the point that I think what they are doing is good and sensitive, and I am sure all members of the House will join me in this expression of appreciation to the Singapore government.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Taxation: Family Payments</title><page.no>26157</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>26157</page.no><name role="metadata">Swan, Wayne, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SWAN</name><name.id>2V5</name.id><electorate>Lilley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question without notice is directed again to the Prime Minister.

I can confirm that the government spends about $2 billion more a year on family assistance than did the former government. I can confirm that family tax benefit part B is specifically for families where parents exercise the choice of having one parent staying at home while children are young. I can also confirm that as part of taxation reform, which was opposed by the member for Lilley and all of those who sit beside him on the opposition benches, we cut effective marginal tax rates. I can confirm that families are getting record assistance and are able to keep more of each dollar they earn.

But let me remind the House that, if the opposition had had its way, this system would never have been introduced.

That is what stopped the great wave, it has got nothing to do with, as the Government would put it, their so-called offshore Pacific Solution.</para></quote><para>The foreign minister should not be quite so disingenuous.</para></speech></debate><petition.group><petition.groupinfo><title>PETITIONS</title><page.no>26160</page.no></petition.groupinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">The Clerk</name><name role="display">The Clerk</name></talker><para>âPetitions have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate ministers:</para></talk.start></interjection><petition><petitioninfo><title>Medicare: Bulk-Billing</title><page.no>26160</page.no><no.signed>1228</no.signed><name.ids><name.id>DT4</name.id></name.ids><names><name>Mr Crean</name></names></petitioninfo><para>To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament:</para><para>The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House:</para><para>	That under proposed changes to Medicare, families earning more than $32,300 a year will miss out on bulk billing, and doctors will increase their fees for visits that are no longer bulk billed;</para><para>	That the rate of bulk billing by GPs has plummeted under John Howard;</para><para>	That more than 10 million fewer GP visits were bulk billed last year compared to when John Howard came to office;</para><para>	That the average out-of-pocket cost to see a GP who does not bulk bill has gone up since 1996;</para><para>	That public hospitals are now under greater pressure because people are finding it harder to see bulk billing doctors.</para><para>We therefore pray that the House takes urgent steps to restore bulk billing by general practitioners and reject John Howard's plan to end universal bulk billing so all Australians have access to the health care they need and deserve.</para><presenter><no.signed>1228</no.signed><talk.start><talker><name role="display">Mr Crean</name><name.id>DT4</name.id></talker><para>Mr Crean (from 1,228 citizens)</para></talk.start></presenter></petition><petition><petitioninfo><title>Medicare: Bulk-Billing</title><page.no>26161</page.no><no.signed>105</no.signed><name.ids><name.id>83N</name.id></name.ids><names><name>Ms Hall</name></names></petitioninfo><para>To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament:</para><para>The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House:</para><para>	That the rate of bulk billing by GPs has fallen by over 15% in Shortland Electorate since 2000 and is now in serious decline;</para><para>	That this year, 7.7 million fewer GP visits were bulk billed than in 1996;</para><para>	That the average out-of-pocket cost to see a GP who does not bulk bill has gone up by 51% since 1996;</para><para>	That public hospitals are now under greater pressure because people are finding it harder to see bulk billing doctors.</para><para>We therefore pray that the House takes urgent steps to restore bulk billing by general practitioners so that all Australians have access to the health care they need.</para><presenter><no.signed>105</no.signed><talk.start><talker><name role="display">Ms Hall</name><name.id>83N</name.id></talker><para>Ms Hall (from 105 citizens)</para></talk.start></presenter></petition><petition><petitioninfo><title>Medicare: Reform</title><page.no>26161</page.no><no.signed>176</no.signed><name.ids><name.id>83K</name.id></name.ids><names><name>Ms Roxon</name></names></petitioninfo><para>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled:</para><para>The petition of the undersigned shows that we reject the Howard Government's proposed changes to Medicare.

International Women's Day is one day of the year when we get to celebrate all of the roles women can playâin the workplace, in the home raising children, in the community as volunteers and leaders, on the sporting field, in academia, in the arts and in many other fields of endeavour.</para><para>As we celebrate International Women's Day this year, I would like to acknowledge that this year marks 20 years since the introduction of the Sex Discrimination Act. As part of my comments I want to pay tribute to a great Australian woman, former Senator Susan Ryan. She was not just a great parliamentarian and a great Australian woman but also a leading light for women within the Labor Party. I think her work should be acknowledged not just today but this year when we celebrate the 20-year anniversary of the Sex Discrimination Act.</para><para>The motion we are speaking on today gives us the opportunity to acknowledge that, although our legislative rights might have been progressed, there are many growing practical barriers preventing full participation of women in all walks of life in the community. Violence, poverty and marginalisation are preventing many women from having a healthy, safe and independent capacity to participate in our society. Unfortunately, many of these problems are increasing rather than reducing, as we might expect.</para><para>Some of my colleagues who will be speaking after me will raise different aspects of this matter but I would like to quickly touch on a few aspects. We have seen a number of major changes during the period of this government's term in office, one of which is that the pay gap between men and women has become much greater. The average difference in income capacity between men and women across our community is $300 a week, which is more than $15,000 a year. Women are being paid much less than men, have not achieved equal pay in many areas of the community and are not participating in equal numbers in many industries and different sectors of our community. This has an immediate impact on the economic capacity of women. It also has a long-term impact on the way women are able to save for their future, their retirement incomes, their children's education or their own retrainingâif they want to return to the work force after they have had some time out to bring up children. I think we need to acknowledge the pressures this is continuing to put many women under.</para><para>We still have no national paid maternity leave scheme which the Prime Minister was so dismissive of in question time today. I do not think anybody on this side of the House thinks that the introduction of paid maternity leave will deliver every single benefit that women have been fighting for over a long period of time, but we do think that it is one critical aspect of making sure that women have the right to spend time with their young children and that their jobs will be there when they want to return to work. The government is aware of this and has been sitting on the report of its work and family task force from as long ago as the middle of 2002.</para><para>The Prime Minister gave a speech a couple of years agoâI am not sure how many people in this House heard itâin which he said he thought we lived in a post-feminist age where women were pretty much equal in everything that mattered. Unfortunately, just touching on some of those issues, we can see that women are not equal in a lot of areas that matter. I am concerned that a lot of areas of big policy change that this government is interested in are going to make things worse for women.</para><para>One of the most important areas is health services. Women rely on Medicare services twice as much as men over the course of their lives. Any cost increases in this areaânot to mention the costs of educationâwill have a disproportionate impact on women. I would hate to live in a world where we go back to the situation where parents have to choose whether to educate their sons or daughters because they cannot afford to do both. Nowhere is the lack of equality more obvious than in the area of violence. This latest affront comes from the government's indefinite postponement of a very important campaign that was going to be run to send a message to the community and help raise awareness that, without respect, you cannot have a relationship and that, if you do not educate young men that violence against women is not the answer, then we will see the growing incidence of violence continue.</para><para>With the restrictions of time I will not be able to cover a range of very disappointing facts found in the government's report under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. Suffice to say that, after many years of delay, the government was unable to fill in all of the information, as other countries around the world did, because we do not collect statistics on how these issues affect women. I think that is a sad thing for us to note on International Women's Day.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AMR</name.id><name role="metadata">King, Catherine, MP</name><name role="display">Ms King</name></talker><para>âI second the motion and reserve my right to speak.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>26166</page.no><name role="metadata">May, Margaret, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs MAY</name><name.id>83B</name.id><electorate>McPherson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt is a pleasure to join my colleagues today in recognising International Women's Day. However, let us not forget that this is not just about a day for women to celebrate with a great lunch or dinner. It is a day for reflection on the achievements and milestones women have reached over centuries, it is a day to remember that the struggle for fairness and equity for women around the globe is still not over, it is a day to think about those millions of women in developing countriesâhungry women with little or no resourcesâwho struggle daily to feed their families.</para></talk.start><para>Today is a day for reflection but it is also a day to think about the development of policies for the future. It is an international action day for all women right around the globe to look to the future in the fight against discrimination againstwomen, whether that be at home, with domestic violence and rapeâone of the greatest human rights challenges of our timeâdiscrimination in the workplace; more friendly workplace environments, with more flexibility to enable women to work and raise a family; politics and policy matters involving women and family; and international peace and social progress.</para><para>Women have much to offer. The United Nations believes that human rights and fundamental freedoms require the active participation, equality and development of women. Today we can reflect on the struggle for equality, peace and development and use our influence to unite women around the globe in common goals.</para><para>Women have achieved much in our own country but some would sayâand I would agreeânot enough. There is always more to be done in achieving equality and fairness. I would like people to stop and think about those women around the globe who have achieved very little because of conflict or social policy that does not recognise women as individuals, because of disease and natural disasters, because of ignorance on cultural and religious grounds and because of a lack of educationâthey have not been given the opportunity to learn. In so many countries women are second-class citizens with no rights, living in communities or countries where they have no equal footing with men. They are just baby factories with no access even to proper health care.</para><para>How did we end up with an International Women's Day? Where did it all begin and why? The day had humble beginnings around the world. In 1857 women working in clothing and textile factories in New York City staged a protest against inhumane working conditions and low wages. The police attacked these women and dispersed them. Two years later these women formed their first labour union to try to protect themselves and gain some basic rights in the workplace. In 1908, 15,000 women marched through New York City demanding shorter working hours, better pay, voting rights and an end to child labour. From this march, the Socialist Party of America designated the last Sunday in February for the observance of National Women's Day. The first ever National Women's Day was celebrated in the United States on 28 February 1909.</para><para>And so we have reached where we are today. But we still have a long way to go so that all women, no matter where they live, enjoy the same human rights that we enjoy in this country. The theme for this year's International Women's Day is `Women and HIV-AIDS'. HIV-AIDS is a growing and disastrous problem for women around the globe and seems to go hand-in-hand with poverty. There are 1.3 billion people living in abject poverty, and 70 per cent of those people are women and many are HIV-positive. Even though these women are the poorest and most marginalised women in the world, they are still charged with the responsibility of raising children, with little or no access to health care or paid employment. These women live with the day-to-day struggle of survival.</para><para>I believe that women hold the key to addressing the worldwide issue of poverty and disease. Women legislators around the world can work together to ensure that policies and programs to assist these women in developing countries get the green light. They need to be funded and supported by our governments. We have the ability to ensure that our country continues to stay involved with programs that will help these women to climb out of the desperate situations they find themselves in. It is about education programs, it is about health and nutrition programs, and it is about family planning. It is about breaking down barriers in so many countries where women are never given the opportunity to break the poverty cycle. In short, their basic human rights are ignored.</para><para>However, not all is doom and gloom. As women we have a lot to celebrate todayâthe achievements and sacrifices of so many in the past that have given us what we have today. But I say to my colleagues in the House today that we must continue to fight for the rights of all women around the globe; we must never forget that the struggles we have been through are only just beginning for so many others. I commend the motion to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>26168</page.no><name role="metadata">King, Catherine, MP</name><name role="display">Ms KING</name><name.id>00AMR</name.id><electorate>Ballarat</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âInternational Women's Day offers women around the world the opportunity to reflect on progress in the area of women's rights and to demand the removal of barriers that stop all women from being able to fully participate in our society. As the member for Ballarat, it affords me the opportunity to reflect on the many issues faced by the women I come across in my day-to-day working life. I am constantly amazed at the resilience and courage of ordinary women who achieve extraordinary things despite the barriers that are still presented to themâbarriers that, in my area, centre on health and employment.</para></talk.start><para>Women are the biggest users of Medicare. In the crucial child-bearing and child-rearing years between 20 and 45, women use twice as many Medicare services as men. In my electorate, there are simply not enough doctors to adequately service the population. The shortage of doctors, coupled with the reduction of access to bulk-billing, has the potential to compromise the health of women in my electorate. I do not think it is too much to ask that women in my electorate have access to affordable and accessible health care, yet the government has shown itself incapable of any action.</para><para>The disturbing revelations of the past week about alleged sexual assaults by rugby league players in New South Wales and Victoria have highlighted a serious problem in the attitude of some men towards women in our society. But even more disturbing is that the focus of much of the commentary in the media and by sporting bodies has been on the reputation of rugby and its players. Where are our sporting heroes talking about the impact on women of such alleged assaults?</para><para>In my community, in the past eight months alone the Ballarat Centre Against Sexual Assault had 188 new referrals of women accessing their counselling and advocacy services. There are currently 240 women service users on their books. There have been 37 call-outs for their crisis service for recent victims of sexual assault. These are all women in my district.</para><para>The women's movement campaigned long and hard for violence against women to be regarded as a crime, regardless of the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim. In this context, it is a damning indictment of the government that, a week before the launch of the groundbreaking `No respect, no relationship' campaign, a group of four men from the Liberal Party, including the Prime Minister's own principal private secretary, pulled the campaign. Women cannot fight this battle on their own. We need real men to speak out against sexual assault and violence. The Prime Minister should immediately release these ads.</para><para>It has been almost 30 years since the International Year of Women, and today it is significant to celebrate the achievements of working women. Equal pay for equal work, affirmative action policies and antidiscrimination policies have all made it possible for women to engage in the work force. However, the reality for women in my electorate is that it is becoming increasingly difficult to do so. It is all very well to enact laws and policies encouraging women to enter the paid work force, but this does not make sense if it is not supported by infrastructure that actually allows them to do so. How can women access employment if they are unable to access affordable child care? How can women achieve equal pay if they are not offered paid maternity leave? The reality for many women that I talk to in my role as a federal member is that their lives are severely impacted by lack of access to child care and by work environments that do not support families.</para><para>And what of women who are trying to deal with their inability to access and sustain employment by studying while their children are young? What of mature aged women who are working hard to earn a degree so that they can get a well-paid job when their children become independent? One constituent that I have spoken to recently is doing just thatâstudying off-campus so that she will have access to employment when her children have grown up. She has just been informed that her HECS fees are going to increase by 25 per cent and she is seriously questioning whether or not to go on with her degree. These are just some of the barriers facing women in my electorate.</para><para>I acknowledge the great gains that have been made; I remember the women who have come before usâthe suffragettes who fought for the vote, who made it possible for me, as a woman, to stand in this place. But when I look around this place I wonder why half the people here are not women. I think of the barriers, both visible and invisible, that serve to keep women out of this House. The continued battle to get a child-care centre in this place has been the worst and most blatant example of `Yes, Minister' policies that I have ever come across.</para><para>So today, International Women's Day, I celebrate the courage, tenacity and selflessness of the ordinary women in my electorate who are doing extraordinary work. I acknowledge the women who manage to work despite their lack of access to child care and paid maternity leave, the women who manage to study despite the increasing costs of education and the women who manage the health of their families despite the lack of doctors. I acknowledge my constituents who face barriers not only as women but as women with disabilities. I acknowledge the strength of the survivors of sexual assault and violence, the overwhelming majority of whom are women. For all these women, not only in my electorate but across Australia, we acknowledge today as International Women's Day.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>26169</page.no><name role="metadata">Washer, Dr Mal, MP</name><name role="display">Dr WASHER</name><name.id>84F</name.id><electorate>Moore</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWomen's equality has come a long way since International Women's Day was marked for the first time on 19 March 1911. On that date, more than a million men and women attended rallies in several European countries, demanding that women be given the right to vote, the right to work and the right to hold public office. That day was an important day for women around the world, as their struggle for equality and fairness began to take shape as an organised and well-orchestrated campaign. Today, 8 March 2004, is no less important as we look back at what has been achieved and look to a future of continued improvements for women, based on the solid foundations of the past.</para></talk.start><para>Throughout history, and long before women's rights and women's suffrage became issues, women were playing their part in the development of Australia. These women were largely unrecognised, but they were true pioneers who carved out a life for themselves and their families in difficult conditions. Individual names stand outâwomen such as Grace Bussell, who in 1876 at the age of 16 plunged into the surf on her horse to snatch a number of women and children from certain death after the ship the SS<inline font-style="italic"> Georgette</inline> broke up in rough seas. The Western Australian town of Busselton is named after her.</para><para>In the political arena, Western Australian women are up amongst the firsts. Edith Cowan was elected to the Legislative Assembly of WA in 1921, becoming the first woman parliamentarian in Australia. In 1943 another Western Australian woman, Dorothy Tangney, was elected to the Senate. She and Dame Enid Lyons, who was elected to the House of Representatives in the same year, became Australia's first women Commonwealth parliamentarians. In more recent times, the member for Fremantle, the Hon. Carmen Lawrence, became Australia's first woman Premier when she became Premier of Western Australia in 1990.</para><para>In the field of medicine, there are two FionasâStanley and Wood. Professor Fiona Stanley is the founding director of the Telethon Institute for Child Health Research, which was established in Perth in 1990. She was national Australian of the Year for 2003. Dr Fiona Wood made headlines in 2002 when she and her team treated badly burned Bali victims at the Royal Perth Hospital with spray-on skin, her own medical breakthrough that is revolutionising burns treatment. She is head of the Royal Perth Hospital burns unit, the mother of six children and Western Australian of the Year for 2004.</para><para>But the majority of working women carry on their daily lives in relative anonymity. While they are not heroes or trailblazers in the public eye, they play a crucial part in the economic lives of their families and the community. In Australia today, 44 per cent of the work force is made up of women. They play an integral and necessary part in Australia's economic fortunes. Women are also the bearers and primary carers of children, and it is in juggling these two things that we have possibly the biggest challenge to equality and fairness for women. Much has been done to assist women and their families in combining these two roles, but there is always room for improvement.</para><para>We must continue to encourage family friendly workplaces and flexible working arrangements. However, it is important not to impose legislation that puts such an impost on employers that they would avoid employing women at all. We must increase even further the number of day care places available for our children. Good, affordable child care is an essential element in providing women with the opportunity to enter or remain in the work force and one that the government will continue to address.</para><para>We have a situation in Australia today where girls are surging ahead of boys in academic achievements at school and where young women are flocking to universities to pursue further education. We need to encourage these women to take their places in the work force and develop ongoing careers in the fields of science, politics and business. However, staying on a designated career path is often more difficult for women, as their working lives are interrupted to have children and they generally become the custodial parent in the event of a marital breakdown. These factors create a significant barrier to equality in employment for women, and that is something we must continue to address, both for the fulfilment and wellbeing of women and for the future prosperity of the nation. I commend this motion to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>26171</page.no><name role="metadata">Plibersek, Tanya, MP</name><name role="display">Ms PLIBERSEK</name><name.id>83M</name.id><electorate>Sydney</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe member for Moore has pointed out, on International Women's Day, that we have a world of achievement and success to celebrate as women. But there is also a world of disadvantage, discrimination and violence that we need to acknowledge today of all days. I want to speak briefly about experiences in three countries. I first want to turn to what has been happening in Baghdad. Janet Albrechtsen said in a column not so long ago that feminists were very wrong not to be lauding the successes of the occupying forces in Baghdad and commented on how much easier things are for women in Iraq at the moment. I want to draw the attention of the House to a report by Human Rights Watch, entitled <inline font-style="italic">Climate of fear:</inline><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">sexual violence and </inline><inline font-style="italic">abduction of women and girls in </inline><inline font-style="italic">Baghdad</inline>,<inline font-style="italic"></inline>which was published in July 2003.</para></talk.start><para>This report demonstrates that there has been a significant increase in the number of sexual assaults and abductions in Baghdad since the occupying forces took over. The report says there has been a marked failure of the occupying power to protect women and girls from violence and redress it when it occurs. This has both immediate and long-term negative consequences. Girls fear that reporting sexual violence may provoke honour killings and social stigmatisationâor, indeed, forced marriage. Iraq, like a number of other countries, has laws saying that if the perpetrator of the violence will marry the victim afterwards then the crime cannot be prosecuted. So forced marriage, and then continued sexual violence within the marriage, can be a result of reporting.</para><para>There are a number of absolutely tragic and compelling case studies within this report, but what is most striking about it is that it seems everyone agrees that there has been a sharp increase in cases of sexual violence since the war. This is partly because of the dramatic reduction in the number of trained police. A lot of them were sacked by the provisional authority because they were too close to the Baath Party. Of course you should not have people who have perpetrated serious crimes in the police force, but that has meant that there is no-one to investigate or prosecute the crimes. There are cases reported in this study of girls as young as nine being abducted and sexually assaulted and then not being able to receive any treatment. The forensic institute in Baghdad is not prepared to treat them, and police are not prepared to pursue or prosecute criminals. In some cases these girls are being taken to American doctors, but it is the tiny minority of people who come to the attention of those authorities.</para><para>In an international context, I also wanted to mention an Australian woman who is doing amazing work in Addis Ababa in Ethiopia. Dr Catherine Hamlin, aged 79, is an Australian gynaecologist who has spent the last 44 years in Addis Ababa working on something called obstetric fistulas. As at the last report, she has helped 24,000 women. This condition occurs when a teenage girl cannot deliver a baby properly because the baby is too big for her pelvis. After several days of labour without access to a doctor, the baby dies and the girl is left with a hole between her bladder and vagina or, sometimes, rectum. The result is that urine and sometimes faeces drip constantly down her legs and, in some cases, she is left lame from nerve damage. Women with fistulas are obviously incontinent. They stink and they leave a trail of urine behind them. They are often abandoned by their husbands or other people living in the village.</para><para>The author of a report in the <inline font-style="italic">New York Times</inline> speaks of a girl who was sold into slavery at the age of eight. She was raped by her master at 12 and sent out into the bush at 13 to deliver the baby on her own. After a long labour, she delivered the dead baby by herself but suffered crippling internal injuries, including a fistula. She crawled back to her village, but the baby's father did not want anything to do with her anymore because of the smell. He put her in a hut with the door removed, hoping that the hyenas would kill her during the night. She fought off the hyenas and crawled for a day to reach an American missionary, who took her to the fistula hospital run by Dr Hamlin, where the fistula was repaired. This young woman later became a nurses aide in the hospital. That goes to show what a difference just one person can make. On International Women's Day we should acknowledge not just the work of women like Dr Hamlin but also the millions and millions of women around the world who rely on people like Dr Hamlin to make their lives bearable.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>26172</page.no><name role="metadata">Ley, Sussan, MP</name><name role="display">Ms LEY</name><name.id>00AMN</name.id><electorate>Farrer</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âToday, women of the world celebrate International Women's Day. The United Nations General Assembly, composed of delegates from every member state, celebrates International Women's Day to recognise that peace and social progress require the active participation and equality of women and to acknowledge the contribution of women to international peace and security. The UN has identified this year's theme as `Women and HIV-AIDS'. Australia is well represented at the international level on women's issues, including this one. This is an occasion to review how far women have come in their struggle for equality, peace and development, to celebrate their achievements and, certainly, to acknowledge how far we still have to go, particularly in the developing nations of the world.</para></talk.start><para>Over the past 50 years, the most progress has been achieved in securing political rights for womenâthe right to vote and to be elected. Today there are only a few countries where women cannot vote or run for public office. But only 24 women have been elected as a head of state or government in this century; only 14.1 per cent of representatives elected to parliaments around the world are women; and of the 189 highest ranking diplomats in the United Nations, only 11 are women. Almost no women served on the military staff of UN peacekeeping forces between 1957 and 1979. In 1993, women made up two per cent of the military contingent of peacekeeping forces. Throughout the history of UN peacekeeping, there have only been two women in top decision-making positions. Obviously that is a record that most women in this place would like to improve.</para><para>This morning I launched Women's History Month at King O'Malley's pub in Civic on behalf of the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women, Senator the Hon. Kay Patterson. This year the theme celebrated the role of Australian women publicans, a role that offered women the opportunity to play such a central part in Australia's social and recreational history. My message for Women's History Month is that, while it is good to look across the Australian and world stages and see the great things women have done, the place to really start this search is within your own familyâfor people to study their mothers, grandmothers, maiden aunts and other ancestors, and to learn and record their stories before those stories slip away.</para><para>I want to take a moment to acknowledge rural women. We are small in number and we do require the support of our urban sisters, recognising that we have much more in common than we realise. There are some inspirational women in country areas. They work side by side with their husbands in hard manual work. One such womanâone of my farming constituentsâbattling a medical condition, spent hours a day during the last drought pulling dead and dying sheep out of the mud around the farm waterholes. Women do most of the cooking and cleaning and have primary responsibility for the children. They manage the family finances, itinerary and happiness. They work alone hour after hour, day after day. It is difficult for them to find the time to visit friends and family, who are usually a car trip away. During the recent drought, these women managed the pain of their husbands facing financial crisis and the anxiety of their childrenâand they managed it alone. As their families seemed to be falling apart, they had no choice but to be the ones to hold it all together.</para><para>Now that women in general do have choice, they think carefully about their options and the experiences they see around themâthat they observed in their own families, where so many of their mothers entered paid work but were offered no relief on the home front. Modern workplaces still tend to be built around a regime of men working and women doing the household choresâor most of them at least. That is changing. This government has done so much in terms of family tax benefit, child-care assistance, maternity allowances, immunisation support and policies to promote family friendly workplaces.</para><para>These are the issues that most concern women of today. They are not fighting the same fight their mothers and grandmothers did, but in many ways this has made life harder, not easier. It is where we are as a society and it is the right place to be, but the challenges are significant. We need women in parliament, in boardrooms, in fields of science, in the military and in the exploration of space. But we need them no less in hospitals, schools, roadside diners, shops and farms. We need women working together with men to come up with answers, but we must move away from the adversarial `men against women' arguments.</para><para>While we are talking about adversaries, my profound wish is that we cease using women's issues to play politics in this place. Women will always be represented in all political parties. They will always have strong, passionate contributions to make to the debate, and they will not necessarily be right or wrong. The opposition has made much of the government's campaign against violence in relationships and our supposed indefinite postponement of the campaign. As a current member of the ministerial committee on government communications, I can assure members opposite that this was never the case. Precisely because this issue is so important, we have to get the messages right. If this means revising the materials, so be it. The resources have not been wasted. The campaign will go ahead, and it will be a strong campaign.</para><para>Mothers know the feeling when we survey the domestic chaos of our lives and have to walk out to work, and it is not a good feelingâwe feel like unsuccessful parents, homemakers and employees. But we are moving ahead, and we have much support from the policies of the government. And, as my colleague the member for McPherson said, we must spare a thought for women of developing countries who have so little. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Jenkins)</inline>âOrder!

As the Minister for Health and Ageing said in question time, this is a once in a generation opportunity for our country. It is in the long-term interests of our country. The free trade agreement is all about jobs. It is all about opportunity and prosperity for our fellow Australians. I do not know what the opposition does not understand about that. Free trade equals jobs, opportunity and prosperity for our country. The historic deal negotiated by the Minister for Trade in February this year will provide tremendous opportunities for Australian exporters. As the federal member for Ryan, I am particularly pleased to represent my constituents and the business people in my electorate who are very export oriented and who are focused on winning export opportunities for their companies, because this agreement translates into jobs and into prosperity for employees and people in the electorate generally.</para><para>Australia's export sector is a significant contributor to Australia's economic growth and job creation. Some 1.8 million Australians are employed by exporters of goods and services, and last year trade contributed $147 billion to our economy. The Australia-US free trade agreement is, indeed, a historic trade deal that forms stronger ties between our economy and the world's largest, most dynamic and most innovative economy. According to the OECD, world trade in goods and services in 2002 amounted to $US8,114.4 billion. The World Trade Organisation estimates that the world trade in goods and services in 2002 was $US7,840 billion. The IMF calculates that world exports were $US7,876 billion in 2002 and that they would reach almost $US9,000 billion in 2003. By comparison, according to the OECD, at current prices and exchange rates, Australia's GDP in 2003 was $US508.2 billion. The corresponding estimate from the IMF was some $US493.4 billion. These figures represent the massive difference in the two economies and, correspondingly, the massive opportunities that are presented to Australians in business, trade and commerce.</para><para>International trade and commerce play an important role in strengthening bilateral relations between countries. The US is Australia's most important economic partner and our most important security ally. By strengthening our relationship with the US through this free trade agreement, Australia is also increasing its bond with the world's most powerful economy. The Australia-US free trade agreement builds on our relationships with Singapore and Thailand, with whom we negotiated free trade agreements last year. As all members of the parliament would know, we also have framework agreements with Japan and China. We are putting pressure on our trading partners in the region to increase the pace of their reform agendas so that they too are not left behind. This is good for our community, our country and the people that we represent collectively throughout Australia.</para><para>With a market of 300-plus million people in the US, this economy offers enormous opportunities for those of us in Australia that are in business or in trade. How could it not be the case that a smaller economy would benefit from dealing in trade and business with the world's largest economy? It defies commonsense that those sitting opposite would seek to put barriers in front of us to prevent us from concluding this agreement.

I have great respect for the member for Ryan, but I suspect the Prime Minister or the Minister for Trade has prevailed upon the member for Ryan to move such a superficial and cynical motion before he even saw the agreement. Paragraph (1) of the motion `acknowledges the importance and value of international trade and commerce in strengthening bilateral relations between countries'. This is little more than a motherhood statement which could easily have come from a year 9 or year 10 commerce textbook. How can this House, or anyone, automatically recognise, as reflected in paragraph (2) of the motion, `the enormous economic benefits to Australia of the recently negotiated Free Trade Agreement between Australia and the United States of America' when so few of us have had an opportunity to finish reading, let alone analysing, the 1,100 pages that make up the entire agreement? With great respect, I presume the member for Ryan has read the agreement, which was published on the Internet only a few days ago. Notice of this motion was given by the member of Ryan on 17 February 2004, and one cannot be blamed for being cynical about the way such an important issue is being handled by the government. The member gave notice of this motion calling on the House to automatically give unqualified support for an agreement that he had not even seen. Is it any wonder so many people have stopped believing the government when they talk about this agreement?</para></talk.start><para>The Australian people have every reason to be cynical, and we have every reason to be cautious. We will be cautious about the agreement and support it only when we are certain that it is in Australia's interest. But it is hard to believe that, in a US election year, President Bush would want to give very much to Australia at the expense of the United States.</para><para>One would have to be arrogantly irresponsible to ignore the serious concerns about the FTA being raised in the media every day. It seems to be a strange type of free trade deal that asks Australians to accept the demise of Australia's sugar industry. Equality of opportunity for all Australians is absent in this deal. The large amounts of taxpayers' dollars the government will now have to throw at the sugarcane farmers are testament to that. Many Australians are rightly asking: is this a free trade agreement or just a trade agreement? Let me reiterate.

Federal Labor leader, Mark Latham, came to my electorate a little over a month ago to listen to many of my constituents in Five Dock, including a local pharmacist, who shared these concerns. Labor has said that it will not support a trade deal with the US that in any way undermines the PBS, but the government refuses to rule out possible increased costs to Australian taxpayers who subsidise the PBS.</para><para>We will also need confirmation that the FTA will not delay the introduction of generic drugs to the market. Any delay in the introduction of generic drugs could also lead to an increase in the cost of the PBS. Now that the full details of the FTA are being examined, there are reports that some of these serious concerns have now been confirmed.

It is a sensible approach; it is the only approach. This FTA is far too complex and far too important to be forced on the Australian people and the Australian parliament in the highly charged political atmosphere we currently have in Australia and in the United States as both countries face federal elections this year. That is why the opposition announced, on 27 January 2004, that it would refer the trade deal to a Senate select committee to assess whether the deal is in Australia's national interest. The US Congress is allowed three months to scrutinise the trade deal. It is only fair and reasonable that the Australian parliament be given a similar opportunity. The Australian people deserve nothing less.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>26176</page.no><name role="metadata">Hunt, Gregory, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HUNT</name><name.id>00AMV</name.id><electorate>Flinders</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to wholeheartedly support not only the motion moved by the honourable member for Ryan but also the United States-Australia free trade agreement. I do so for three very simple reasons which will have an impact on families in towns throughout my electorateâtowns like Somerville, Hastings, Rosebud and Dromanaâand in rural areas such as Glen Alvie and Lang Lang. Those three reasons are simple. One, it is about jobs; two, it is about income; and three, above all else, it is about living standards. The member for Rankin seems to be amused at these ideas, because what the opposition has done is to stand squarely in the face of an agreement which offers hope and opportunity for Australia.</para></talk.start><para>There is an extraordinary historical parallel here. In 1957, Australia completed negotiation of the Japan-Australia trade agreement. That agreement set up much of Australia's prosperity during the latter half of the 20th century, yet that agreement met heavy opposition from the Australian Labor Partyâwith extraordinary parallels between the arguments used then and those that are being used now. Yet Australians throughout Australia would find it ludicrous to look back on that Japan-Australia trade agreement and imagine that it would be opposed, withdrawn or cut up or that anyone would believe that it would, in some way, cause hardship to Australia. Trade is trade. It involves an exchange of goods and services in both directions. We make no apology for that. We believe in that. We believe in Australian consumers being able to get goods at lower prices, and we believe in Australian exporters having access to global markets. In agriculture alone, we export roughly five times what we import, and that is a good thing. There are some imports that we do have to getâthat is the nature of trade, and we make no apologies for that.</para><para>There are three conclusions to be drawn from the Australian Labor Party's position in relation to the free trade agreement. First, they say `no new jobs' in the auto sector. They say `no new jobs' in relation to our lamb and sheep producers. They say `no new jobs' in horticulture. That is their position. The second conclusion is that it is ludicrous logic. This is a deal which helps dairy, beef, steel, wine and many other producers, but not sugar. That is true, absolutely. It does not do a thing for sugar producers. The Labor Party say that, because it does not help sugar producers, they will say no to jobs in dairy, beef, steel, wine, manufacturingâany of those sectors. That takes an extraordinary leap of logic and a certain mean-spiritedness which is breathtaking in its scope. The third conclusion is a simple one. The Leader of the Opposition and the member for Rankin will reverse their position. Make no mistake: what they are involved in now is a game. At the end of the day, they will pass this. If they do not then they will stand condemned. I have no doubts about the prediction that the Australian Labor Partyâthe opposition, the alternative governmentâat the end of the day, by the force of logic, by the economic benefit, by the impact for ordinary Australians, will pass this agreement.</para><para>The Labor Party can make all the noise that they want to and pretend that they are against this FTA. If that is the case, that is fine; they can oppose it. We will be happy to be judged on the benefits that this brings to Australia. But, at the end of the day, what they are doing now is a fraud. They know it; we know it. What are the benefits? The benefits are simple. In manufacturing, there will be duty-free access, from day one, for over 97 per cent of Australia's manufacturing exports to the United States. In addition to that, there will be duty-free access for more than 66 per cent of our agricultural productsâwith tariffs going to zero from day oneâand an additional nine per cent over a short period of time. So, in a short period of time, three-quarters of our agricultural products will be tariff free.</para><para>What is the alternative? The alternative is very simple. The alternative is to do nothing; and if we do nothing, nothing will happen. It is a wonderful policy. The Labor Party are saying that they would forgo the benefits to make the point that something which brings benefits to a multiplicity of sectors may not bring them to every sectorâthat is absolutely true. But at the end of the day this free trade agreement is about jobs and living standards. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>26177</page.no><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Dr EMERSON</name><name.id>83V</name.id><electorate>Rankin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI will see if I can lift the tone of the debate here after the contribution of the member for Flinders, who observed, `Trade is trade; it involves an exchange of goods and services.' Well done, member for Flinders! It reminds me of a member of parliament back in the 1970s who observed that traditionally most of Australia's imports come from overseas. Let us see if we can do a little bit better than that.</para></talk.start><para>The member for Flinders also asserted that Labor are claiming that there will be no new jobs in the auto industry from this trade deal. In any such assertion, if we had made one, we would rely on the Centre for International Economics, the government's preferred economic modeller, which actually forecast that in the auto industry there would be a contraction in the production of automobiles and components. So the member for Flinders ought to have a look at the government's own report before ascribing that assertion to Labor when in fact it was made by the government's preferred modeller.</para><para>The government members pledged their support for this free trade agreement before seeing it. Notice of this motion was given on 17 February, well before the 1,100-page document even arrived. When the Prime Minister and the Minister for Trade said, `Take us on trust', the government members of course did that, as they always do. They accepted the free trade deal as a matter of blind faith. But they should come to understand and appreciate that you cannot trust the Prime Minister or the trade ministerâthe worst trade minister in Australia's history.</para><para>The trade minister anticipated this debate in question time today, boasting that Labor never negotiated a preferential bilateral trade deal. For once in his life, the minister was right: we did not negotiate a preferential bilateral trade deal. We have never negotiated a preferential bilateral trade deal, and the reason is that we support non-discriminatory, non-preferential trade deals. Labor in government negotiated the opening up of markets in Japan, China and Korea for commodities such as beef and wool, but we did it on a non-discriminatory basis. We said to those countries, `We'll take our chances in the global competitive race,' and that is what happened. Those countries did open up their markets to those commodities, to the great benefit of rural Australia. Labor support multilateral trade negotiationsânot a word from the member for Flinders on multilateral trade negotiations.</para><para>Through the free trade agreement, the government has signalled to our multilateral trade negotiators and, more importantly, to other multilateral trade negotiators with whom we are currently negotiating that it considers that no extra access for sugar is acceptable in the multilateral trade negotiations in the WTO Doha round. It has signalled that because that is the deal that the Australian government has struck with the US administration in the trade agreement. The Australian government is signalling loud and clear that it is acceptable for there to be no progress on sugar; it is signalling that it is acceptable for there to be long delays in access for beef; and it is signalling that it is acceptable for price triggers to be put in place to protect American agriculture from Australian exportsâprice triggers that apply to well over 20 commodities. When government members supported this motion, they were unaware of it, but it has not affected their thinking at all because they are acting with blind faith in this government.</para><para>Government MPs have signed up to a trade deal with the United States that puts at risk the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and severely restricts access for Australia's textile and clothing industries through very restrictive rules of originâagain, to which the members opposite are completely oblivious and completely indifferent. Members opposite, if they have any interest in the textile and clothing industries in this country, should be concerned that the rules of origin mean that we will not enjoy the access to the US market that was claimed by this government before we saw the 1,100 pages of the free trade agreement. It allows the US to lift protection for other agricultural products. And so it goes on.</para><para>We simply do not know if this deal is in Australia's national interest. The smartest thing to do would be to ask the Productivity Commission to do an objective analysis. Instead the government is putting it out to tender, and we know what the problems will be there: it will set the assumptions for the tenderers, and no doubt the government's preferred economic modeller will be selected to get the predetermined results it wants, which will convince no-one. Certainly, we want to know whether this trade deal is in Australia's national interest. That should be the test. The Productivity Commission should do that workâobjectively, fairly and honestly. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>26178</page.no><name role="metadata">Cobb, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JOHN COBB</name><name.id>00AN1</name.id><electorate>Parkes</electorate><party>NATS</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would like to congratulate the member for Ryan on moving this motion. I would also very much like to congratulate our Minister for Trade, Mark Vaile, on having done something that no-one elseâcertainly, not from an Australian point of viewâhas been able to do in the past: crack the biggest world market that exists. We are talking about a market that is one-third of the world's gross domestic product. It is the biggest market anywhere. Even China's economy, for all the talk about it, is only one-eighth the size of the American economy.</para></talk.start><para>What does the free trade agreement with the United States do? The members opposite seem to have trouble getting through some very simple basics. There are huge gains for manufacturing, as you have just heard from my colleague the member for Flinders, not the least of which are in the automobile industry. The agreement also enables Australian firms to be involved in US government procurement, a market worth $200 billion. Never before have Australian companies had the opportunity to bid for US government goods and services.</para><para>For an electorate like mine, totally revolving around exports, this is something that had to happen. Whether those exports are horticulture, lamb, beef, dairy or forest products, this agreement has allowed us into a market that we basically had no entree into. All this talk about what a bad deal this is obviously comes from people with absolutely no knowledge of trade and absolutely no knowledge of the fact that Australia did not have too much to lose on any deal that it might have done. I have to point out something to those who cannot get this through their heads: we just heard the member for Rankin taking the high moral ground on multilateral trade deals, saying that we have to talk free trade around the world or not at all, but that is not much good to somebody who is an exporter and who is waiting to increase their access to other markets, and specifically the best market in the world, right now.</para><para>Before he starts criticising the person who is obviously the best trade minister we have had, the member for Rankin needs to pay attention to the multiplying effect on Australian trade around the world that has occurred over the last six years. What he needs to pay attention to is what our Minister for Trade, Mark Vaile, has done in recent years. The minister has got off the high moral ground and got very practical. This is not just about using bilateral one-on-one trade deals. As you have heard, we have done them with Singapore, Taiwan and other countries, but the fact is that we now use every lever available to us. We have taken the US to the WTO disputes committee, and we have won. We have done the same with Korea. You have to do those things. You have to get off the high moral ground, get practical and help exporters in places like the electorate of Parkes. To us, it is absolutely essential.</para><para>I have to comment on the fact that recently people like the member for Rankin and a lot of the members opposite have said, `You have not read the fine print. Do you realise that the US can put a hold on things if there is an enormous price drop in some of the agricultural commodities mentioned?' What country would not want to make sure that nobody can dump product in their country and that there is a safeguard there if an enormous price fall occurs? We would do it. Any country would do that. The difference is the Americans have such high protection against every countryâincluding Australiaâthat they have a long way to go. We have very little protection. You cannot get it through the heads of those opposite that really we had very little to lose in this deal and an awful lot to gainâand we have.</para><para>Regarding the beef industry, the opposition are talking about the agreement as though the beef industry has not gained. We have only once since quotas existed filled a quota, and that was only because Japan shut its doors because of the threat of mad cow disease. This deal will allow Australia's beef industry to expand at a considerable rate and still not meet that beef quota in the next 15 to 18 years. It does not matter. When you look at sheep meat and wool, you see that within four years there will be no problems for them at all. Horticulture and the wine industry have an awful lot to gain in a very short time. The opposition need to open their eyes, wake up and learn what trade means. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>26180</page.no><name role="metadata">Vamvakinou, Maria, MP</name><name role="display">Ms VAMVAKINOU</name><name.id>00AMT</name.id><electorate>Calwell</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am one of the millions of Australians who have not yet managed to read the 1,100 pages of the document known as the proposed free trade agreement. Most Australians never will get the opportunity to read it, so I guess it is incumbent on us as parliamentary representatives to speak up on their behalf. In my case, I want to raise some concerns on behalf of my constituents, as we and they try to understand the impact that a deal negotiated on the other side of the Atlantic will have on the daily lives of ordinary Australiansâin particular those living in my constituency.</para></talk.start><para>The government promotes the free trade agreement as the best thing to happen to Australia since sliced bread. From the Prime Minister down, government ministers urge that we all support this deal unequivocally, the suggestion being that if the Labor opposition do not pass this free trade agreement we will in some way be unpatriotic or, as Minister Downer quite foolishly asserted last week, anti-American.</para><para>The role of the opposition in this parliament is to apply maximum scrutiny. Precisely because the free trade agreement is a significant event, in our national interest we cannot take the proposals on good faith alone. To do so would be to abrogate our responsibility and let the Australian people down. The government may not be happy with this, but we live in a democracy and that is how things work in a democracy. I can understand that the government is eager for Labor to pass its free trade agreement but, while I agree that we are presented with an important opportunity, I am also mindful that this agreement was forged in an election year for both the Howard government and the Bush administration. As a result, we have every reason to be concerned about the politics surrounding the fine print.</para><para>The Prime Minister wants his 15 minutes of fame, and good luck to him. But he will have to wait for the outcome of the Senate inquiry, because only through an inquiry can we get the answers to the many questions that are now emerging around the free trade agreement and what it means for Australia's agriculture, for its manufacturing sector, for pharmaceutical benefits, for the car industry, for the film industry and so onâthe list goes on. The ABS 2001 census notes that my electorate of Calwell has 15,000 people working in textile, footwear and clothing factories, as well as in car, plastics and chemical manufacturing. These industries will rely heavily on a free trade agreement that is free and fair, one that allows them to continue to operate competitively so that they can continue to be successful and provide jobs for the thousands of workers and their families who live in Calwell. Workers, trade unions and economic analysts are concerned, for example, that the $2 billion per year increase in imports of US manufactured goods could lead to Australian job losses. Although in my electorate the Ford motor company has cautiously welcomed the agreement, there is concern about Australian markets being swamped by US cars. I am sure my Ford factory workers want to know what that may mean for their jobs and their futures.</para><para>What does the free trade agreement mean for Lanes Biscuits in Coolaroo, whose competitive exports may be penalised as a result of the proposed increase in sugar surcharges? What does the free trade agreement mean for Yakka, a 70-year-old icon based in Broadmeadows, already under pressure from reduced tariffs? It and other clothing and footwear companies may have to compete with a flood of American imports on an unequal footing, given that the detail of the agreement shows that the US has won special rules on textiles, making it harder for local TCF exporters to enter the US market.</para><para>What do we make of the Prime Minister stating that tariffs will be phased out, while the US trade representative says they will go `immediately'? Whom are we to believe or trust on this vital issue? I can tell you that my constituents expect their government to protect their interests and to protect their jobs. They expect a government to act in the national interest, ensuring that Australian industries are protected against unfairness and unlevel playing fields.</para><para>We do recognise the enormous economic potential for Australia that could come from linking into the world's biggest economy, and we appreciate our relationship with the US. But we should be mindful that it is not a special relationship. The Prime Minister might see it as such, but we cannot define our national interest in the narrow context of the Prime Minister's friendship with President Bush. Each responsible national leader realises that their nation's interests must be first and foremost. To the United States, the Australian free trade agreement is but one of many FTAs it will negotiate. The US negotiates overwhelmingly and primarily in its interest, and so it should. Australia must do the same. Certainly the Labor opposition will insist on nothing less than this. To grab a deal simply for the sake of having one is a `something is better then nothing' approach which may have negative consequences down the track after all the dust has settled.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para> (Mr Jenkins)âOrder!

I think the government may be a little bit confused about what it wants to do with roads and road funding and, in fact, about what AusLink is about. I think most people would understand that there are three levels of funding for roads: the national system, which the federal government fundsâand has done for many years; the state system; and the local system. While the government may be confused about this, people in the street are not. They understand the three different levels at which they are funded.</para></talk.start><para>AusLink will detail the government's long-term plans in relation to funding for road and rail infrastructure. However, I do not think we need to wait until May to find out exactly what AusLink has in store for most Australians. It is already clear from statements made by the government that many communities, like those in the electorate of Oxley, will be let down. I want to explain why that is the case. It is widely known that under the Constitution the Commonwealth government has no specific responsibility for roads. I acknowledge that. Nevertheless, road funding has been an important part of the federal government's responsibilities for many years. The Commonwealth accounts for about one-fifth of all government road-related expenditure and so exerts some influence over the level and disposition of funding. The centrepiece of Commonwealth road funding is the national highway. I want to make a big point of that. The centrepiece of the responsibility of the federal government is the national highway systemâand in my electorate of Oxley that is as true as it is anywhere else. One of the most important roads in Queensland is the Ipswich Motorway. It is an important part of the national highway system, as well as being a major road that services south-east Queenslandâand specifically south-west Brisbane and Ipswich. I will return to the issue of that specific motorway in a moment.</para><para>It was the Whitlam government that first assumed full financial responsibility for the national highway, back in 1974. Since that time the national highway has expanded, but the Commonwealth still retains full responsibility for that system. This, however, appears certain to change under this government and under AusLink. The federal Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads, Senator Ian Campbell, has confirmed recently that the government is not prepared to accept full responsibility for the funding of the national road system. Of course, you have to ask yourself, `If the government's not prepared to fund it, then who will be responsible for our national federal highway system?' Funding for this system, the senator says, should be a shared responsibility. This is unacceptable. Shared responsibility is terminology for, `We are going to cherry pick. We will pick what we will share and we will pick what we will not share.' That is unacceptable. I want to reaffirm here my 100 per cent support for responsibility for the construction and maintenance of the national highway network staying with the Commonwealth. That should be the responsibility of the federal government.</para><para>The people of Oxley know all too well what AusLink will mean for the Ipswich Motorway. It is that first little wedgeâand it is not even little; it is a big wedgeâwhich will mean that we will not get the funding we need in our area for our roads. A detailed look at national funding for highways since the Howard government came into power reveals a very interesting trend. That trend is that since election nothing has changed. Funding has not changed. It has remained static. In fact, it has gone down a tiny little bitâby an amount that is not really worth noting. But, in real dollar terms over those eight years, that means there has been a substantial decrease in the amount of money that actually goes into our national highway system. So when people today look at the national highway system and say that it has gone to rack and ruin, it is no wonder that it has, because the reality is that the federal government has not met its full responsibilities. So, while we now know what its policy is in writingâthat it no longer feels it should be responsibleâit has already been implementing that policy for many years.</para><para>No real increase in funding to the national highway system since the Howard government claimed power has meant that the maintenance and construction costs for the roads in that system have blown out today, making it a much more expensive operation to run. The government intends to shift some of its responsibilities to fund the national highway. In the 2002-03 financial year, 45 per cent of Commonwealth road funding was devoted to the national highway system, with all those funds going towards maintenance and construction. Are we expected to believe that the government is going to commit more money? Under AusLink they are saying that it is about more money and about committing more dollars but, judging by everything I have read about AusLink and the national road transport plan, it is actually about shifting responsibility. It is not about delivering better outcomes; it is about making other people take up the slack from this government.</para><para>So, if no more money is expected to flow into the national highway system, where does that leave the residents of Oxley and south-east Queensland? What about the Ipswich Motorway? I will tell you where it leaves them: exactly where they have been left by this government for the last six yearsânowhere. For the last six years the government has obfuscated. It has done absolutely everything it could to avoid its responsibilities. It has not made one commitment or provided one bit of real funding to upgrade the Ipswich Motorway. There have been bits and pieces here and thereâin particular the $66 million, about which I have always said, `If this government provides the funding we need for the road, I will congratulate it.' It is okay to say, `Thanks very much for the $66 million for emergency repairs and emergency maintenance.' That is fine, but what about the real work of maintaining this road and doing a proper job? The people of south-east Queensland, including the people of Oxley and the people of the Liberal seat of Blair, drive on that road almost every dayâif not every day. They know the dramas and hassles of that and they know how dangerous that road is, and they want to see it fixed.</para><para>That leads me to several other issues I want to raise. One in particular is safety. I want to make it clear on the public record that upgrading this road is not an and/or thingâthis is not a choice between this road and some other road; this is a safety issue. The road needs to be upgraded for safety reasons. It is not just about capacity and it is not just about traffic flows; it is about how safe that road is for the mums and dads that travel along it every day. Right now it is one of Australia's worst and most dangerous roads. It is killing our economy and it is hurting peopleâit is causing accidents every day. That is the first issue I want to note.</para><para>The second issue is the issue of responsibility for the road. It has always been the responsibility of the federal government to fund that road. That is a federal national highway system road. While we can share responsibilities in terms of how we put it together, it has always been very clear that the states have the peopleâthe engineers in the department, who actually determine how to fix itâand the Commonwealth funds it. There has never been a debate about that, but the Commonwealth government now says that it does not like the umpire. It does not like the decisions of the state Labor government, so it is not going to fund it. It says, `Find us some other solution. Keep finding solutions until we find an answer.' Of course, when somebody does not want to hear an answer, you are never going to find anything that satisfies them. I now know why for so many years the government has refused to be happy with any outcomes of the state government: because it was never going to pay for that road in the first place.</para><para>The idea of other roadsâand I am talking about alternative roadsâis one that is very much confused in this whole debate, but it is something I want to talk about. This road, the Ipswich Motorway, needs to be fixed as a stand-alone project, regardless of how many alternatives and other roads we construct or pay for. I think that is the beauty of thisâthe fact that it is really simple: let's fix the Ipswich Motorway. Let us upgrade it to six lanes and do a proper job. Then let us talk about other roads. Or we can do it at the same timeâit does not worry me: we can chew gum and walk and breathe all at the same time. That is okay. But this government obviously seems to have problems with that. It can only deal with one issue at a time.</para><para>And of course there is the issue of politics. The government and government members, particularly the member for Blair, have made a really big deal about the issue of timing: `We cannot fix this road, because it will disrupt traffic.' If you really sit down and think about what he means when he says that, what is he saying? Is he saying that we cannot fix any road because it will disrupt traffic? That, of course, is just silly. The reality is that there will be traffic disruptions and there will be delays, but if we do not do something nowâif we just walk away and say, `Well, it's too hard,'âwe reach a point when the road will cease to operate; it will cease to be an effective road. So this argument of the government's about how long it will take and all the rest of it is really a silly oneâand again it is just about playing for time.</para><para>Who decides what the road will look like is caught up in the same old tired politics. It does not matter what you do in putting together community consultation and spending millions of dollars on consultations with engineers and on reports that are 1,000 pages tall. The reports are three feet tall but, after having spent two years doing all that work consulting people and looking at the best possible options, a government member turns around and says, `Well, that's not good enough, because I reckon'âa personal opinionâ`that is not the option we should go for; we should go for some other option that is completely untested.' Two years of work and community consultation and $4 million of expenditure are swept aside by one government member, the member for Blair, saying that in his view we should just go somewhere else. That is just a ludicrous proposition, but these are the sorts of arguments that are being put forward here.</para><para>I did not want to make this into a political issue, but unfortunately it has turned into one because the government refuses to accept its responsibilities. We are talking about a road in the national highway system, and the federal government should pay for it. I am deeply disturbed about the AusLink proposals, because what they do is almost guarantee that there will be no government funding for vital roads in Queenslandâparticularly the Ipswich Motorway.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Roads: Scoresby Freeway</title><page.no>26184</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>26184</page.no><name role="metadata">Smith, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANTHONY SMITH</name><name.id>00APG</name.id><electorate>Casey</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn this grievance debate, it is fitting that I follow the member for Oxley and his discussion on roads, because this afternoon I grieve for the situation regarding the failure to construct the Scoresby and Eastern Freeway in Melbourne's outer east and for the way in which the community there has been let down, abandoned and deceived by the Bracks government in Victoria, with the full support and agreement of those oppositeâor, at best, their acquiescence. For those in the Australian community who feel that more needs to be done to improve the level of trust in institutions and to strengthen the fabric of our democracy and that more needs to be done if leaders and politicians are to regain what has been lost in public confidence, there is no greater example of why this is the case than the sorry tale of the Scoresby Freeway and Labor's cynical and dishonest actions in that regard. There is no greater example in recent political memory of a breach of public trust than the breathtaking way in which the people of Melbourne's outer east and Yarra Valley were pledged and promised a toll-free freeway before the last state election, only to see that pledge and that promise dumped and ignored after the election. The Bracks Labor government's actions have not only plumbed a new low-water mark for broken promises; more importantly, they provide a graphic early warning not just to the people of Melbourne's eastern suburbs but to all Australians about the true value of Labor's word on any subject, the lengths to which Labor, state or federal, will go to win votes and the equal speed with which they will then callously act to betray any trust given to them.</para></talk.start><para>In the leadup to the state election in Victoria in November 2002, Steve Bracks not only reaffirmed his solemn pledge to build a toll-free freeway and deliberately made it a central feature of his campaign but also went a step further: he made a personal pledge to each and every family in the outer-east region community. He made that personal commitment precisely because he acknowledged there was voter doubt over Labor's record on road funding. He made that personal promise and pledge to override and eliminate any doubt that might exist in the public mind. He did it in order to ensure that every voter in the outer east and in the Yarra Valley knew that Labor would honour its word. He sent a letter to every household in that community in the dying days of the election campaign. In that letter he made this statement:</para><quote><para>Labor will build the Scoresby Freeway on time and on budget. These are not just election time promises, they are my firm commitments to you and your family and they will be honoured.</para></quote><para>That was a personal commitment, above party politics; it was a personal undertaking; it was a contract between Steve Bracks and each and every resident. It was an attempt by Steve Bracks to say, `Of all the promises the Labor Party has ever made, I promise you that this one will be delivered on time and in full.' He could not have been any more definite. He could not have elevated the importance of the promise and the importance of that toll-free freeway any further. He could not have constructed a bigger stack of Bibles upon which to swear his word. It was a pledge of such unmistakable clarity givenâand repeated over and over againâwith such force that, happily for Bob Hawke and Paul Keating, it even eclipses their most infamous promises about no child living in poverty and l-a-w tax cuts.</para><para>That is why this issue is so relevant to the Australian community in the leadup to the next election. Often before a federal election the public wonder what an opposition might be like in government. This time noone need wonder; they need only look at the actions of Bracks Labor to know what the actions of Latham Labor would be. They have an early release and an early take on what federal Labor's approach would be.</para><para>Every Labor promise, every Labor pledge and every Labor commitment must now be viewed through the prism of the Scoresby Freeway. Every Labor pledge is a Scoresby pledge. The fact that Labor will break faith on their most solemn and concrete of promises in the area of roads means they will do it on any policy in any and every area of government. If the Victorian Labor leader will deceive the people of Melbourne so blatantly, so too will the federal Labor leader across the country. If the Victorian Labor leader will happily break a cast-iron pledge and betray the trust of the community by tearing up the unequivocal pledges he signs his very name to, so too will the Leader of the Opposition in the federal parliament. It means there is not a promise that Labor are prepared to make that they are not prepared to break. More than that, it shows that federal Labor will make big promises, with their hands on their hearts, in the leadup to the next election in the full knowledge that they will never be delivered. It means federal Labor's promises on health, on education, on anything, must be treated as Scoresby promisesâretractable pledges offered before an election, ready to be snatched back afterwards should Labor ever be elected.</para><para>The public are entitled to this view not just because of the actions of the Bracks government, which are a preview of what would come and an early warning system for what would identically occur across Australia, but also because this federal Labor leader and the previous failed incumbent, the member for Hotham, had backed Bracks and his dishonest backdown on Scoresby with deafening, accepting and compliant silence. Feeble excuses about the issue now being none of their businessâdesperate attempts to dismiss the issue as purely a state concernâdefy reality and the facts. The federal government is a partner to a signed contract to jointly fund the construction of a toll-free freeway. But, more than that, prior to the last federal election federal Labor made precisely the same pledgeâthat if elected they would fund half of the construction of the Scoresby Freeway on the condition there would be no tolls.</para><para>In October 2001, just on the eve of the federal election, the then and now shadow Treasurer, the member for Hotham, and the then and now shadow minister for transport, the member for Batman, released Labor's roads policy under the heading `Labor delivers the total Scoresby solution' and made a feature of the fact that their policy was an example of how federal and state Labor could work together for ordinary Australians. Given federal Labor also pledged its support for a toll-free freeway and sought to make a virtue of its superior and influential relationship with the Bracks government, you would have thought that it would have at least expressed a level of opposition or disappointment when the Bracks government betrayed the people of Melbourne. But, no, there was not a word when Bracks made his announcement on April 14 last year; there was not a word all of last yearâjust silence. Federal Labor's so-called total Scoresby solution has been total Scoresby silence, total acquiescence and total weakness. In the 11 months since that Bracks backdown, the member for Hotham and former Leader of the Opposition has, to the best of anyone's research, not uttered a single word on this subject, let alone a condemnation of his state colleagues. There is no evidence anywhere that he has ever actually uttered the word `Scoresby'. Ditto for the member for Batman, who has only recently broken his silence after 10 months of mute collaboration with state Labor. But even now he will not pledge to be part of building a toll-free road.</para><para>The residents of the outer east and the Yarra Valley have learned the value of federal Labor's word and the priority Labor place on their needs. It is quite simple. In a choice between standing up for the residents of Melbourne or covering up for the Bracks government, they have happily chosen the latter. In a choice between vigorously opposing deceit on the part of the Bracks government or weakly condoning it, again they have chosen the latter. The new Leader of the Opposition has had a lot to say on a lot of subjects, including public trust in institutions and democracy in parliament, and no doubt he will have more to say in the leadup to the federal election, but the people of Melbourne will know and be reminded, as will the people across Australia, that his words, his pledges and probably even his signed lettersâlike those of Mr Bracks on every subject, be it roads, health or educationâcan go straight in the Bracks file marked `promises ready to be broken'.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Victoria: Nursing Homes</title><page.no>26186</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>26186</page.no><name role="metadata">Burke, Anna, MP</name><name role="display">Ms BURKE</name><name.id>83S</name.id><electorate>Chisholm</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise today to express my dismay and disappointment with the Victorian state member for Warrandyte, Mr Phil Honeywood. Mr Honeywood crept into the Victorian parliament at 2 a.m. last Thursday night to express his outrage at a decision of the Victorian planning minister to invoke section 20(4) of the Planning and Environment Act 1987. He claims the minister's decision is a shock and has been adopted without consultation with council or the local community. The only shock is that this local member is so out of touch with his community that he does not realise the significance of this decisionâa decision which has the backing of the local council and which is being heralded by the entire Chinese community in Victoria as a lifesaver. The member for Warrandyte, who used to have ministerial responsibility for multiculturalism, should be more attuned to the needs of the ethnic community and, more importantly, to the large numbers of Chinese who live in his seat.</para></talk.start><para>The decision will allow the development of the first Chinese specific nursing home in Victoriaâthe `on luck' nursing home, a much-needed facility for this growing and ageing community. In my electorate of Chisholm alone there is a large and growing Chinese community, which is well serviced by the Chinese Community Social Services Centre Inc. The centre has been in existence for 11 years and has provided an excellent range of services to the Chinese community in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne. The centre currently provides a comprehensive community aged care service, which includes an extensive home and community care package and 50 community aged care packages. This work and research conducted by the CCSSCI has demonstrated an underutilisation of mainstream nursing homes by the Chinese community and an emerging need for an ethno-specific home to cater to the growing Chinese community in Victoria. Put simply, the Chinese within the community find mainstream nursing homes too foreign for them. There are massive language, cultural and dietary problems with going into these nursing homes, so fundamentally they do not take up places in them.</para><para>According to the 1996 census, there were 5,657 Chinese-speaking people over the age of 65 in metropolitan Melbourne. The Chinese Community Social Services Centre has estimated this number will increase significantly, with the influx of aged migrants from mainland China, to around 8,000. In accordance with the Commonwealth government standard of 40 nursing home beds per 1,000 people aged 70 plus, there is a need for 322 beds to be designated to Chinese-speaking elderly citizens.</para><para>On the federal government's operational benchmark for aged care, the figures of the Department of Human Services reveal that Victoria is more than 5,000 beds short. The department's bed census for March 2001 demonstrates that, in the catchment area for Chisholm, patients who have been assessed for nursing home care are waiting for an average of 28 days in hospital for a nursing home bed, with 20 per cent waiting in excess of 71 days. The Chinese Community Social Services Centre currently offers extensive services to the Chinese community, and much of its work is now focused on the needs of the elderly in the community, as this is a growing area of demand. The centre is finding that many frail elderly people are remaining in their homes past the point where they can be adequately cared for, as they find mainstream services too alienating for their needs.</para><para>The centre has now been awarded 60 high-care aged care bed licences and $1.1 million in capital funding to assist with building the first ethno-specific Chinese home in Victoria. The nursing home will cater for all Chinese speakers regardless of country of origin and will be a not-for-profit establishment. The facility will cater for all of the Chinese community and will ensure there are provisions for concessional beds and assisted residents. The Chinese Community Social Services Centre and the Chinese community have now launched a major fundraising effort to help find the additional money needed to make this long-held dream a reality. Two people in particular on the centre's board need special thanks and praise for their tireless efforts in making this vision a reality: Fred Cheu and Kim Chua. Their work in securing federal funding and bed licences, their fundraising drive and their tenacity to have the state minister accommodate the building of their home on a piece of land they had purchased prior to legislation changing should be praised by the member for Warrandyte in Victoria, not condemned.</para><para>I want to put on record my thanks to the Victorian Minister for Planning for her sensible decision in this area and let her know this is a very welcome decision to the Chinese community, particularly those in my seat of Chisholm and within the Chinese Community Social Services Centre, which operates in Box Hill in my area. The member for Warrandyte in Victoria should stand condemned for not knowing what is going on in his own backyard and for not assisting these people, who are in a crisis situation. He should be thanking the government for overturning what could have been a perilous situation for them had they not been able to build on a piece of land they had bought. Instead we will now see a much-needed ethno-specific nursing home going ahead.</para><para>On the issue of aged care, while I do welcome and have welcomed the government's support for the `on luck' nursing home, I want to know what it has to say to the 600 residents at Inala village in East Burwood. Whilst this nursing home is outside my electorate, there are many families in my electorate who have loved ones living at Inala. The member for Deakin has a lot to say about roads, but what does he have to say about aged care? What has he sought from the minister to assist the 600 residents of this Salvation Army home slated for sale? Many of the residents are retired Salvation Army officers who have lived on a pittance during their lives of service to others and have had, until now, a home in retirement as part of their conditions. With the sale of Inala this will be lost.</para><para>The staff of Inala and Salvation Army officers locally have come under some flack for this decision. This is unfair and unwarranted. The culprit here is the federal government, which has failed to address the crisis in aged care, which has failed to answer the Salvos' pleas for financial assistance, which has failed to appropriately fund aged care and which has done nothing to assist the frail and elderly of Inala. A buyer for Inala will be hard to find, as it is a large and old facility which needs significant upgrades. These upgrades will be needed just to bring it into compliance. It is a place with not only a low- and high-care facility but also many independent living units. What is the government doing to assist these residents and their families who are living with constant uncertainty about their futures? It is all right to come in here and talk about roads, but what is the federal government doing about a most important issue in our areaâaged care? I am constantly contacted by families and friends of residents in Inala who are coping with loved ones who are already old and, in some cases, a bit confused. This has just created a greater uncertainty in their lives and needs to be dealt with urgently.</para><para>The issue of ageing has been put in the spotlight with the Treasurer's recent pronouncement that demography is destiny. Apparently he received quite a deal of praise in his party room for his speech in this area. What I would like to know is: where is the real reform in this area? Where is some genuine hope for people going into retirement? What is the Treasurer doing now to ensure that people who are younger than me are actually earning enough for their retirement? There was nothing in his speech to say that he was going to be encouraging people to save sensibly for retirement. What was his great advice? Work till you drop. Some people might want to do that, but people who have been in physically demanding work all their lives probably cannot do that and, furthermore, might want to sit down and rest for a while.</para><para>It is all well and good for the Treasurer to keep talking about the 55-year-old executive who might want to work on parttime after having decided that they do not want to retire completely. There are not that many 55-year-old executives out there. Actually, the majority of executives I know do not make it to 55 while still in the work force. The majority I have dealt with were made redundant well and truly by the time they were 50 and have been very frustrated in looking for work since that time. They know all too well that age discrimination is rife in the work force.</para><para>When I was at the Finance Sector Union prior to coming to this place, I was dealing constantly with men, particularly men aged 40-plus, who had been made redundant and were looking around for work. Sadly, a lot of them decided that their next big enterprise would be to open a franchise. I do not know if anybody noticed, as I did, that there was a plethora of cheesecake shops opening up all over the place. Redundant bank workers thought that a franchise was going to be their way to go. Sadly, a lot of these failed because they were not given assistance or guidance in how to run a small business; they had been working in big banks in big institutions. They did not know how to adapt to small business. The Treasurer's speech did nothing to assist them or others to find work.</para><para>A wonderful organisation called 45-Plus has just been advised that it will no longer receive federal funding. This group has been assisting workers aged 45-plus back into the work force. Workers aged 45-plus are invisible. They do not receive Centrelink payments, predominantly because they are still living on their redundancy payouts or their partners are in part-time work. 45-Plus is a wonderful organisation which has received state government fundingâit is grateful to the state government for the fundingâbut its federal funding has been cut and it will not be able to service its programs.

All small businesses in this country should listen very carefully to the following information, which is a compilation of Labor Party policy, a compilation of the facts of what Labor would do if it were elected to government. All small businesses listening to any one of these policies will understand the havoc it would wreak on their business and, consequently, the havoc it would wreak on Australia.</para></talk.start><para>Labor has continually opposed the coalition's industrial relations program, which has provided more flexibility and choice in individual workplaces. Under this program we have the most outstanding economy in the developed world, inflation has been kept under control and productivity and real wages have increased. When I have spoken to people in the electorate, I have found that they are very happy. If we return to a union controlled award system, which existed in the 1970s, God help Australia. This is what the ALP national platform proposes.</para><para>Labor proposes to abolish Australian workplace agreements, which are very popular, and the Employment Advocate and plans to restore the role of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. We all know how ineffective that commission was. Mark Latham, in an address to the ALP conference in January this year, indicated that that would be Labor's policy. Small businesses listening to this broadcast this afternoon will be alarmed to know that Labor will allow unlimited strike action without secret ballots, drastically reducing workplace productivity. That is also in the ALP national platform.</para><para>Labor would provide a right of entry for trade union officials into workplaces, regardless of whether they employ union membersâ imagine trade union officials knocking on the door of any small business, even if it is in the back street area of a city or town, whether or not union members are employedâfor the purposes of communication, organisation, recruitment and assistance to workers. And we all know what that means.</para><para>Labor would legislate the rights of union delegates in the workplace, including the right to reasonable time off to consult with other workers and participate in the affairs of the union, and the right to trade union education and access to appropriate facilities, including to disseminate relevant trade union information, including by email.</para><para>Labor wants to formalise arrangements for casual workâI encourage small businesses to listen very carefully to this particular policyâby attaching holiday and sick pay benefits and giving casual workers the right to demand hours of work that suit them. What would this country come to if casual workers, who are already paid a loading, double dip, according to the Labor Party, and get holiday and sick pay? This policy would force businesses to pay casual workers their existing higher wages plus the benefits that come with full-time jobs. That was announced by Craig Emerson in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> on 28 January this year.</para><para>Labor wants to give workers on maternity leave the right to come back to work part time for up to five years after the birth of a child. If you are a manager responsible for running the business efficiently and profitably, how would you cope with that? What cost would that impose on a small business?</para><para>Labor would remove the protection that businesses have from secondary boycotts under the Trade Practices Actâlandmark legislation enacted by this government which has markedly improved the figures on time lost due to strikesâand has voted against legislation that would enable the ACCC to seek compensation on behalf of innocent third-party small businesses affected by union action. This kind of action can drive innocent third parties out of business. Labor wants to return to the bad old days where a business, which has nothing to do with the original dispute, can be driven out of business and not be able to seek compensation. That is wrong and unfair.</para><para>Labor has refused to support legislation to remove unfair dismissal laws for small business and has voted against it 39 times. Labor will bring the Australian waterfront back under the control of the unions, which does not surprise me. We all know what that might mean. The Australian waterfront is now world competitive. The unions said that it never would be, but it now is. Labor wants to go back to the bad old daysâwe all know what they wereâwhich would have an enormous negative effect on the Australian economy and on exporters' incomes.</para><para>Labor refuses to rule out requiring businesses to pay for some or all of its promised 14 weeks paid maternity leave. Labor refuses to support reforms from the Cole royal commission to stop lawlessness, rorts and intimidation in the building and construction industry. Labor would use its procurement policies in governmentâand I could not believe this when I first heard it come out of the ALP national conferenceâto favour companies taking a positive approach to the rights of trade unions. Goodness me! Do we all understand what that means?</para><para>Comments from Mark Latham indicate that Labor would support legislation to regulate independent contractors and, in most cases, deem them to be employees even though they are independent contractors. Labor has gleefully announcedâand this is what is behind all of thisâthat it is now back in partnership with the trade union movement. There is nothing wrong with being back in partnership with the trade union movement, but when the trade union movement as a body outside this parliament runs the Australian Labor Party for the benefit of the trade union movement itself and not of the country that development becomes of extraordinary concern. I think there are some serious questions that need to be faced up to and some serious decisions from small businesses required as to how they feel about all of this.</para><para>On top of that, just to make the lives of small business people a little harderâbecause the Labor Party would not want small business to be doing well as that might benefit employees!âLabor is going to put up taxes.

In the state of Victoria in the year 2002-03, there were 39,758,000 PBS prescriptions filled. In the electorate of Scullin in the same financial year, there were 1,002,929. That is roughly an average of 10 scrips for every woman, man and child in the electorate of Scullin. It is in the context of those figures that I grieve today for the future of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Over the last few years I have often thought that one would grieve for the future of the PBS simply on the basis of the pressures that are on that scheme, including from the introduction of new and costly drugs and those arising from the inability of the government to see its way clear to supply the level of resources needed so that people in the community do not incur increasing levels of co-payments for those drugs.</para></talk.start><para>Any member that knows their electorate well would have had the same experience that I had in my local pharmacy of being in a queue behind a mother who, after taking the dispensed drugs to the counter to pay for them, realised that she could not afford the total cost because a couple of her kids were sick and there were two or three prescriptions that she had to purchase. This mother had to come to a decision about what she would forgo, whether it was filling a prescription for one child and not the other or forgoing something else in the weekly budget. These are crucial decisions that confront Australian families.</para><para>The Pharmaceutical Benefits Schemeâwhich for nearly a 50-year period has supplied drugs to Australian families, making them accessible on a cost-effective basisâhas been a very successful public policy. Yes, over the last decade or so governments of both persuasions have had to tinker with the scheme to ensure that we can still have drugs that produce a proper outcome for health issues listed and that we do so in an affordable way. As in so many other areas of public policy, a decision has been made that that will be done on a cost sharing basisâthat is, based on what the government put forward to support the scheme and what they think the community can put forward, with safety nets for those that are more disadvantaged or receiving benefits. The other thing that has been very important for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, because of the price controls that we have in place and because of the way governments have administered the scheme, is that some of that cost has been shared by the pharmaceutical companies themselvesâbecause it is clear that they do not get the same prices in the Australian market as they can get overseas.</para><para>My grievance today concerning the future of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is even greater because of the pressure that the US free trade agreement could potentially place on that scheme. In answer to a question today, the Minister for Health and Ageing talked about the free trade agreement being a once in a generation opportunityâthat we would now become part of a domestic economy with 300 million people, that we really needed to get there, and that the PBAC would continue to be the gatekeeper for the PBS.</para><para>Let us look at that large market of those 300 million people. If we think about what they have to pay for those drugs, that should start to ring alarm bells for anybody who wishes to look at the way this agreement might impact on Australian public policy. Take some of the more well-known drugs. For example, the wholesale price in Australia for Lipitor, which is for cholesterol, is $49.95, while the wholesale price in the USA is $89.50âa 79 per cent differential. For a drug like Losec, for stomach ulcers, the wholesale price in Australia is $39.12, while in America it is $102.66âa 162 per cent difference. There are a host of othersâfor example Ventolin, where the difference between the US price and the Australian price is 274 per cent.</para><para>Whilst there are assurances that the free trade agreement should not affect the way in which those pricing arrangements are made, it is part of continuing pressure by the pharmaceutical manufacturers to try to get through the PBS, to try to weaken the government's control over the pricing mechanism. I mentioned Losec. It contains omeprazole, which also has a generic drug form. One of the things about the free trade agreement is that the American manufacturers are concerned about the way in which we have been able to shape policies that give generic manufacturers a flying start so that they can get into the market very soon after patents expire.</para><para>This piece of policy to enable us to benefit from generic manufacturers was not developed overnight. Australia carefully went through a process which gave balances to the manufacturers who had the original patents in exchange for allowing a greater freedom towards the end of the patent life to allow these generic mechanisms. It started back in Labor years with the factor F scheme, which was about balancing the control we had through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme against the legitimate needs of the pharmaceutical manufacturers to have certainty when they were developing products for a domestic market and about encouraging those manufacturers to become exporters. But, at the end of the day, the fear we should have and the need for us to look closely at what the detail of this free trade agreement means for pharmaceuticals come from the fact that we are still a net importer of drugs.</para><para>In debate some time ago I quoted from an Industries Assistance Commission's report back in 1986. Of course, the Industries Assistance Commission were the precursor to the Productivity Commission. When they did their report into the pharmaceutical industry, they said:</para><quote><para>The pharmaceutical industry cannot be reviewed on the same basis as the majority of the Commission's industry specific reports. In most industry inquiries the primary focus is on tariffs or direct financial assistance to the industry. In this inquiry these issues are dominated by Government involvement in support of consumers, public health considerations and other social policy objectives.</para></quote><para>That in a nutshell is my concernâthat pharmaceuticals and the way in which we control them under our policy through the PBS has been tied up in the free trade agreement, which is by its title a trade agreement. There has been a lot of debate about what we have given away. There are attempts at assurances by senior ministers in this place at question time. I hope that I do not sound too churlish when I keep saying that the devil is still in the detail. There is an independent review mechanism that forms part of the 1,100-page document behind the FTA. But there is no detail of the way in which that review mechanism will operate. As was mentioned earlier in the discussions about this free trade agreement, Professor Stephen Duckett, who knows something about health economics, asked whether this is a third bite of the cherry for the pharmaceutical manufacturers.</para><para>There is talk about the process being transparent but then at the same time there is talk that it will continue to be behind closed doors. In opinion pieces there has been a lot of discussion about what the free trade agreement in toto should achieve. I understand that there will be pluses and minuses, but I believe that we have made a mistake in not protecting the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme from the free trade agreement. It is about Australia's national interests. It is about Australia's sovereignty. As John Hewson mentioned in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> last month, the Americans were in fact talking about Australia's sovereignty being significantly reduced or eliminated in areas such as the PBS. That is of great concern. When senior commentators like Alan Ramsey can come to conclusions like he did in an article on Saturday, that `most obvious is the trashing that would occur to our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme'â <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Multiculturalism</title><page.no>26193</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>26193</page.no><name role="metadata">Ciobo, Steven, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CIOBO</name><name.id>00AN0</name.id><electorate>Moncrieff</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI often reflect that my immediate family is a typical example of what makes Australia the nation that it is. I have an Italian father, who immigrated to Australia with his family as a refugee shortly after the Second World War. My mother, born in North Queensland, had an English father and an Australian mother. My wife, Astra, was born an American and now enjoys dual citizenship. My family is but one small example of the heritage of this great nation. It is a heritage that has delivered peace, stability and relatively good fortune to all Australians, whether they were born on our shores or chose Australia as their new home.</para></talk.start><para>Accompanying and accommodating our collective heritage is our uniquely developed Australian ethos. Commentators have coined a lexicon that embraces this ethos. Australian values shown in phrases such as `a fair go', `a fair crack of the whip' and `underdog supporters' are examples. As a cultural identity it is sometimes hard to define. However, it is quintessentially Australian to believe in a tolerant, open society. Australians have striven for a pluralist society for decades. It is a reflection of our past as a nation and an acceptance that Australians are very comfortable with cultural enclaves. Indeed, we hold a special place in our collective heart for the Chinatowns as well as for Lygon Street, Sunnybank, Footscray and Altona, to name only a few. As a nation, we have embraced yum cha, baklava, goulash and kebabs as alternatives to barbecued snags or meat pies.</para><para>For decades immigrants to Australia have recognised the promise of this countryâthe promise to provide a clean canvas for immigrants with the only consideration required being a commitment to being Australian. The best summary I could provide is encapsulated in the chorus of <inline font-style="italic">We Are Australian</inline>:</para><quote><para>We are one, but we are many;</para><para>And from all the lands on earth we come.</para><para>We share a dream, and sing with one voice,</para><para>I am, you are, we are Australian.</para></quote><para>Since those words were released to the Australian public, we have absorbed them. They best define our national insightâthe recognition that even though we may dress differently, eat different food or worship a different deity we are bound together by the dream of ensuring this nation remains a liberal democracy which provides reward for effort, a helping hand and, above all, a fair go.</para><para>My grievance today is that this commitment is being eroded. It is my observation that multicultural Australia is being hijacked by political correctness. The consequence of this hijacking has been the growing social divide we now witness occurring in our nation's cities. Slowly replacing our historical commitment to cultural diversity and an overarching uniformity of values are increasingly prevalent examples of the pursuit of value diversity. The social engineers of the political left reject historical Australia as fake multiculturalism. They view cultural diversity and value uniformity as only the half-measure. The Labor Party's commitment is to not only a culturally diverse but also a value diverse Australia.</para><para>Examples of the social upheaval caused through the adoption and promotion of a value diverse Australia include the frightening crime wave of pack-rapes that we have seen in Sydney's western suburbs. These were base crimes committed against Western women, perpetrated by criminals with a value set which dictates that Western girls are easy or are viewed as being sexually promiscuous. In the face of these crimes, the debate about cultural values in Australia became hot. Those on the political left sought to have the crime viewed as being no different to any other rape. Advocates for the left asserted that the moral turpitude of these crimes was no different to any other. The victims' factual accounts of racist slurs and race related verbal abuse highlighted that these crimes were not run-of-the-mill. These were crimes committed by individuals who showed no remorse for their actions. According to them, after all, the victims deserved it and were treated as they should have been.</para><para>The columnist Janet Albrechtsen appropriately and accurately classified these crimes and the value set that lay behind them as being a consequence of values diversity. She accurately highlighted the problems we see appearing in Australia because of this value diversity. Predictably, the politically correct pilloried her for daring to raise the issue. I expect certain elements to respond to this debate in a similar way. The current Leader of the Opposition, the member for Werriwa, used this chamber to publicly assail her, describing her in the most repugnant wayâespecially given the subject matterâas a `skanky ho'. The Labor Party and the political left may wish to see a world through the eyes of moral and cultural relativism. The promotion of values in which, for example, women are second-class citizens, Jews are morally corrupt or Western democracies are to be attacked and slain is offensive to the Australian character, to our heritage and, of course, to all Australians.</para><para>Recent comments by Australia's leading Muslim cleric, Sheikh Hilali, that the terrorist attacks of September 11 were God's work, intimations that he supported suicide bombers and support for a jihad against the West are all offensive. These comments, although disputed by the mufti as being translation errors, demonstrate a clear disdain for the pluralism from which Australia has grown and to which so many immigrants have contributed. Recent comments by the Australian Federation of Islamic Councils indicate recognition of the damage done to Australia's social fabric by such disgusting remarks. Of primary concern to me and to many of my constituents, however, is the knowledge that such views are at best often excused as being a cultural difference or at worst actively promoted and supported as some kind of ridiculous testament to our cultural maturity.</para><para>This nation is founded on cultural diversity and value uniformity. Australians, whatever their origin, recognise the strength of this bedrock and join together to assert this principle. It is a principle that should require of immigrants a demonstrated commitment. Our immigration policy favours those with English language skillsâthose who are seeking assimilation into Australia, witnessed not through their dress, their food or their god but through their values. The politically correct may have ensured that the term `assimilation' has become a profanity. However, it is not enough for immigrants to simply alter their geography. It is our values that must be adopted, not only our freedoms. Immigration policy should require a commitment to a pluralistic Australiaâan adherence to a `fair go'. Failure to demonstrate this commitment should result in expulsion.</para><para>The political left may, predictably, level the charge that I am the ghost of Enoch Powell. They are wrong. Enoch Powell was a racist. I revel in my family's history. I celebrate our nation's history and the great contribution virtually all immigrants have made and continue to make to Australia. I reject Powell's vision of nationhood. I do, however, find wisdom in one statement. Powell once argued that the nation is lived largely in the mind. This is the commitment that is sought. Australians are generous of spirit. We do not mind what your background is as long as you accept ours. Our nation should live in each of our minds through our commitment to garnering strength through cultural diversity, through testifying to our unity with the belief that all are equal and the belief in equality of opportunity and through being willing to give a hand-up. We are our own nation. Our cultural identity flows from our multicultural base; but let there be no mistake: it is not defined purely by it.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment: Sustainable Development</title><page.no>26195</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>26195</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MARTIN FERGUSON</name><name.id>LS4</name.id><electorate>Batman</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise today in the grievance debate to bring to the attention of the House the deplorable attitude of the Howard government in its lack of commitment to doing something about our citiesânot just our capital cities but also our provincial cities. In doing so, I remind the House that in 1996, on coming to government, the Howard government saw fit to abolish the highly successful and effective Building Better Cities program. Perhaps the member for Moncrieff, in raising issues about cities, should have some regard to the fact that his own government has no commitment to doing anything to overcome the problems that exist in our cities in the 21st century. I find that rather strange in such a highly urbanised society where more than 87 per cent of Australians live in our cities and suburbs. To me, it is unacceptable that the government can wash its hands of responsibility for urban development, but I dare say it is not surprising. The Prime Minister, as we appreciate, has no forward agenda and no original ideas or even simple requests about what the government might do in the rest of this term orâdare we think about itâpotentially after the re-election of the Howard government at the next election.</para></talk.start><para>Surely the 21st century could be about a debate on policies and where we go as a nation. In that context, I think it is also important that we dwell on a bit of history about our national commitment and willingness to accept some responsibility for urban development. That brings to mind the performance of the Whitlam government and its real, national commitment through the Department of Urban and Regional Development to do something about the planning and development of our cities. Unfortunately, that department was abolished by the Fraser conservative government on coming to office in 1975.</para><para>In comparison, I argue that Labor in government has recognised the vital need for a national strategy for our cities. Australia's last prime minister on the Labor side had a vision of urban development beyond the 1950sâwhich is the Howard government vision. With the assistance of Brian Howe, the then Prime Minister Paul Keating introduced a very successful Better Cities program. I note that Brian Howe was my predecessor in the seat of Batman. This program was so successful that it generated at least 60,000 jobs and supported an additional $3.7 billion worth of investment from the private sector and other levels of government. Infrastructure investments, as many suburbs and cities appreciate, helped to develop and renew key areas of our major cities, including the corridors connecting economic gateways to cities, population growth areas and areas of concentrated disadvantage. Some of these areas of concentrated disadvantage create the circumstances which lead to crime, which was touched on by the member for Moncrieff. Maybe it is time that we accepted it as the responsibility of the federal government to actually do something in our cities to overcome those disadvantages, which, in the end, contribute to issues on the crime front.</para><para>The Better Cities program was importantly underpinned by a paradigm that sought to improve prosperity, sustainability and `livability'. It featured, and rightfully so, area based strategies in capital cities and regional centres and promoted a concept of smart growth. In the 21st century, a nation such as Australia ought to be about smart growth. But the greatest achievement of the Better Cities program was its groundbreaking partnership approach between the federal, state, territory and local governments. Powerful and effective intergovernmental agreements between the Commonwealth and state and territory governments facilitated very effective urban development partnerships. Such partnerships are now impossible for the Commonwealth government to negotiate, because of their obsession with blaming the states for their own policy ineptitude. Unfortunately, all that good work by Labor in government came to a complete standstill in 1996.</para><para>Better Cities proved that effective partnerships with the states and territories provide fantastic growth and development outcomes and, in doing so, created a larger economic cake with associated employment implications. But unfortunately we find today a tired and divided government that is not able to achieve important reforms on the issue of urban development such as those the Keating government was able to achieve in the early 1990s and a Latham government will achieve after the next Commonwealth election.</para><para>We all must accept that our cities are major drivers of economic growthânot just our capital cities but also our provincial cities, such as Townsville, Ballarat, Bendigo and Broome, to name a few. At this time, some of these cities are also inefficient in their operation, in their use of energy and water and in the production of waste at every levelâresidential, commercial and industrial. They use a lot of energy and water and produce a lot of waste to create wealth. We cannot make Australia more sustainable unless we make our cities more sustainable. But the report cardâand it is an interesting oneâshows that the Howard government has failed to get involved. It has failed to work out solutions to the problems that confront Australia due to its high degree of urbanisation. It has failed to articulate any urban development policy and it has failed to develop a relationship with the state and territory governments that will address some of the problems facing our urban centres.</para><para>Of course, at the centre of policy development on this issue, as with all issues, is the issue of leadership. For the Commonwealth government to be involved in the sustainable urban development debate requires leadership. Whilst the Prime Minister remains in office and the business school of exploitation, in the form of the Deputy Prime Minister, continues in office, we can be guaranteed that we will see no leadership on the front of urban development and no willingness to work with state and local governments to overcome some of our urban problems in the capital and provincial cities.</para><para>Leadership will identify that sustainable cities require a significant reduction in greenhouse pollutionâsomething in which the Commonwealth government has a significant role to play. Leadership will identify urban planning and design as an important element in enhancing the sustainability of our cities. The Better Cities Program played a strong role in research and development of urban planning and design but its demise and the Howard government's anti-state and anti-territory stance has ended any Commonwealth role in the vital aspect of sustainable urban development. Leadership will also recognise the importance of congested roads, air pollution and overcrowded public transport.</para><para>Addressing these issues requires an all-of-govern-ment approach, a willingness to actually work together at the local, state and federal government levels to bring together a partnership to tackle these huge challenges. The problem is that the current government removes itself from this equation, this debate, and says the Commonwealth has no role to play in the public transport debate. This is another example of a lack of commitment by the Howard government to solving some of our problems of urban congestion in both provincial and capital cities.</para><para>I contend that urban public transport was a key part of the Better Cities approach under Labor. It was a mature, modern, honest acknowledgement that the Commonwealth government could not ignore the role of public transport in addressing the challenges of urban development. I therefore find it strange that the current government's proposal on AusLink rules out any participation by the Howard government in overcoming the challenges of urban development, in terms of the use of public transport and associated congestion. Surely a modern land transport plan for Australia in the 21st century would confront some of these challenges.</para><para>I remind the House that Labor not only had the Better Cities program but also put in place federal transport legislation that allowed a funding framework for urban transport infrastructure. The framework is there; you do not need AusLink or a new land transport plan. The Howard government, rather than using that framework, said it would be unconstitutional for it to be involved in public transport. That is complete and utter rubbish. It is a deliberate attempt by the Howard government to escape its responsibility for a better cities or liveable cities agenda. The legislation is still in place and unamended. The Minister for Transport and Regional Services should read the legislation, accept the Commonwealth's role and do something about it. In the face of all the evidence showing the benefits, both environmental and social, of an efficient public transport network, the will to do something should not be hard to muster, but the Howard government continues to pass the buck and deny responsibility.</para><para>The opposition understands the need for leadership on these issues and will not back away from its commitment to do something about it. Congestion is a cost to the economy, to business and to our environment. I believe that any government going to the next election should propose that one of the key issues for discussion is Commonwealth involvement in our capital and provincial cities. We need a plan that requires consultation between local, state and federal governments to do something on a Better Cities front. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment: Kyoto Protocol</title><page.no>26198</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>26198</page.no><name role="metadata">Neville, Paul, MP</name><name role="display">Mr NEVILLE</name><name.id>KV5</name.id><electorate>Hinkler</electorate><party>NATS</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âEight thousand, eight hundred and seventy-oneâaccording to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, that is how many Gladstone area jobs will be affected if an ALP government were to ratify the Kyoto protocol in its present form. Members know full well my feelings about Australia signing the Kyoto protocol and my absolute astonishment that the ALP is peddling this pap in the industrial city of Gladstone. Gladstone is a real boom town which draws people with the prospect of employment and an enviable lifestyle, but let us be clear on one thing: industry is the basis of this attraction and it is industry which will provide a future for the people of the Gladstone region. Gladstone's strengthâits very essenceâis its ability to provide cheap coal fired power, and that is what generates the types of industries which make it one of Queensland's fastest growing regions. It is also a major exporter of Central Queensland coal. This argument comes down to peopleâyoung Australians and their families seeking to provide a future for themselvesâyet the ALP seeks to deny these families their future.</para></talk.start><para>The opposition leader recently visited Gladstone on the pretence of going on a listening tour. I hope the local community was listening hard to him because the message was clear: the ALP will ratify the Kyoto treaty and will be the mastermind of industry closures and job losses. The Leader of the Opposition, when asked about his thoughts on signing the Kyoto protocol, was quoted in the <inline font-style="italic">Gladstone Observer</inline> on 28 February:</para><quote><para>We don't see it that way, we take climate change as an important issue ... it can actually be good for the national economy and that's the way we are approaching that issue.</para></quote><para>No facts, no evidence, no consideration of the impacts on jobs and no mention of the targets Australia is already meeting; just a self-serving grab for the Green vote in our southern capitals. One of his predecessors, the member for Brand, used a similar line when in Gladstone, saying that the ALP would sign the Kyoto protocol and negotiate special arrangements for Gladstone. We all know that international treaties and protocols do not work that way, and it is insulting that he should even suggest it. If anything, over time they tend to become tougher, not easier.</para><para>The ALP is so desperate to appeal to the common man that the rhetoric seems to change daily to suit the audience. Just last week, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage highlighted the Leader of the Opposition's two-faced approach to Kyoto. During the Cunningham by-election two years ago, the current Leader of the Opposition told voters in very definite terms, `You would be endorsing a Green candidate who wants to reduce greenhouse gases by 60 per cent, which would wipe out whole industries and cause the closure of BHP and the Illawarra.' In the same radio interview, he said that reducing greenhouse gases by 60 per cent was an extremist policyâa policy which, I might add, the ALP now promotes. So he believes Kyoto would be a bad thing for the people of the Illawarra but just fine for the 40,000 or so people in the greater Gladstone region. Clearly, the man does not know about achieving sustainable economic growth in regional areas.</para><para>As member for Hinkler, I have maintained a strong line on Kyoto. I will not allow Green populism to threaten Queensland Alumina Ltd, the world's largest alumina refinery, or weaken Boyne Smelters Ltd, our largest smelter and the third largest in the world; I will not let Queensland's largest cement manufacturer, QCL, waste away; and I will not say to Orica, the Gladstone Port Authority and NRG Gladstone Power Station, `Sorry, you might be efficient, but you can't compete on the world stage because of the Kyoto arrangements.' Would a responsible government turn its back on these job-generating industries without considering all possible options when it comes to fulfilling its environmental obligations? Clearly, the answer is no. A responsible government would balance its environmental duties with jobs growth, and that is what we are doing. I have a rather interesting ally in this debate: the Queensland Labor Premier, Peter Beattie. Mr Beattie is on the record saying that Kyoto would hurt Queensland. Challenged by a reporter who said, `That's what John Howard was arguing as well,' Mr Beattie replied, `Yeah, sure, it's true. I mean, I'm just telling the truth.' It is a great relief to see the Queensland Premier telling the truth.</para><para>The mayors of both the Gladstone and Calliope shires said as much in the opening comments of the <inline font-style="italic">Sustainability report for the Gladstone region</inline>, which was produced in 2001. Gladstone city mayor Peter Corones was concerned that the report be used to:</para><quote><para>... address the growing need to manage our activities, to reduce the impact on the environment, enhance our present and future way of living and boost our economic viability. </para></quote><para>Calliope shire mayor George Creed noted:</para><quote><para>The Gladstone region is a key development area in Queensland's future and I believe it will show the rest of the world how to combine industrial development with environmental sustainability and quality of life.</para></quote><para>I believe that too. </para><para>Let me outline what the government has already achieved in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. We have cut emissions from our own operations by 11.2 per cent since 1997-98, and we have set reduction targets in the same time frame as Kyoto. We have made significant inroads into meeting these targetsânamely, reaching levels equivalent to 108 per cent of 1990 levels. We have committed $1 billion to combating global warming since 1996, and we are the first country to establish a national greenhouse agency. We have also entered into a climate action partnership with the USAâI would like to see the ALP achieve that, especially given the way the Leader of the Opposition talks about the American Presidentâand we have commenced bilateral cooperation with Japan to address global warming issues. </para><para>The wisdom of that approach is backed by professor of international economics, Warwick McKibbin, who said in 2002:</para><quote><para>By any calculation, the sum of the future costs to Australia of ratifying Kyoto far outweigh the sum of the future costs of not ratifying. More importantly there is a great deal of uncertainty about the extent of these costs. Even our most optimistic assumptions support the government's decision about the long term costs of ratification. </para></quote><para>I will put it bluntly: ratifying Kyoto in its present form would tell investors that Australia is prepared to expose itself to costs that would not be faced by competing economies. In other words, Gladstone and Central Queensland would lose their edge. Our so-called emerging competitors would not have the same constraints. In short, we would be exporting jobs. </para><para>Similar words were used by Brian Fisher, the executive director of the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, in a 2002 interview when he said that electricity costs in the $8 billion industry could jump by as much as 50 per cent by 2015, making aluminium production uncompetitive in comparison to countries with cheaper power supplies. He said:</para><quote><para>One can't imagine a company like Alcoa wanting to put a smelter into Australia if the energy price is one-third to one-half higher.</para></quote><para>He went on to say:</para><quote><para>If you look at Australia's aluminium industry, it's principally based on coal-fired power ... so any set of policies that were to drive up electricity charges would have a significant impact on aluminium producers' competitiveness.</para></quote><para>Aluminium and alumina are now Australia's fifth largest export commodity. They made up four per cent of Australia's total exports in 2002-03, valued at $4.1 billion, yet the Leader of the Opposition would put this at risk. As a side bar to this debate, I would like to highlight the duplicity of the Leader of the Opposition in his one-to-one meeting with Gladstone's mayor last month. Councillor Corones argued that a fast growing local government area should attract a percentage of any government funding given to large, employment-generating enterprises within that locality, with the idea that it would help local authorities provide public infrastructure and amenities. The Leader of the Opposition reportedly listened to his ideas but, consistent with having a different message for each audience, did not tell Councillor Corones that in 1995 he had said: </para><quote><para>Use should be made of the ... ABS census index of relative socioeconomic disadvantage for each local government area in Australia ... it is a great step forward for more equitable allocations of government resources.</para></quote><para>By his thinking Gladstone, with its average income of $36,146, would miss out on vital funding because it is well above the state average and the national average. I am no environmental vandal.

Consequently, Labor not only supports the Strategic Investment Program but supports this bill.</para></talk.start><para>I want to say a few words of congratulation for two particular industries within the overall textile, clothing and footwear sector. The leather industry has been highly successful, employing more than 3,000 people Australia wide. Not only that, it is a major regional employer. It has an annual turnover of more than $730 million and over the years has experienced the smallest reduction in employment in the textile clothing and footwear sectorâa reduction of only three per cent during the 1990s. Moreover, leather accounts for 35 per cent of total textile, clothing and footwear exports, so it certainly deserves the accolades of this parliament as a highly successful industry within the TCF sector. So too does the technical textile industry, which employs more than 10,000 people nationwide and has an annual turnover of $1.7 billion. The success of these two industries confirms the fact that high-value textile, clothing and footwear industries have a very strong future in this country.</para><para>The imperative in the 21st century for Australian industry is to innovate or perish, and these are two of the more innovative industries not only within the TCF sector but nationally. It is for these reasons that it makes good sense to improve the eligibility and access of these two industries to the TCF Strategic Investment Program within the government's overall plan for the textile, clothing and footwear industries. We are concerned, nevertheless, that the government lacks commitment to these high-value industries, as evidenced by the announcements it has made in recent times in respect of the future assistance arrangements for the textile, clothing and footwear industries. In preparing a submission that was made available to the Productivity Commission, we argued that there should be an increased emphasis on high-value activities and, within that, on those activities that embody both a strong knowledge content and a strong skills content. The government has made some progress in that direction, but we certainly do feel that the government should be intensifying its efforts in relation to those industries that have such a good future, such as the leather and technical textile industries and other parts of the textile, clothing and footwear sector. The best and strongest form of protection available to Australia's textile, clothing and footwear industries is the knowledge content and skills content of the goods that we produce. If we are able to embody in these industries and in the products that they produce a high level of knowledge, new ideas, innovation and skills, then that will assure us of our place in the world in terms of producing, selling locally and exporting high-value textile, clothing and footwear items.</para><para>It is for that reason that we support this bill. I note that the effect of the bill is to increase the accessibility of these two industries to the existing TCF Strategic Investment Program rather than the new one. Nevertheless, we think that it is a good move for the next couple of years, and that is why we support this particular piece of legislation. I know that my colleagues, including the member for Bass, will have a number of remarks to make subsequently about the future direction of the TCF industries in this country. The member for Bass has a strong and healthy industry that she wants to see maintained and expanded within her own electorate. Similarly, other Labor members will have comments to make in respect of their own areas. I know that the member for Ballarat is champing at the bit to join in the debate, as are a number of other membersâthe members for McMillan, Corio, Burke and Braddon amongst others. So there will be a procession of Labor members speaking on this important bill.</para><para>While I am contributing to the debate, I want to make this point: the government has very recently announced that it is going to have a marvellous free trade agreement with the United States. Of course, we know the agreement will not result in free trade at all, but it would have been quite understandable for the textile, clothing and footwear industries of Australia to feel pretty excited, having learned that there was going to be a free trade agreement with the United States and therefore having presumed that they would get access to the United States marketâa market that was tariff free and free of other protection. Sadly, the devil is in the detail. While government members were celebrating the announcement of a free trade agreement with the United Statesâsigning up to it because it had `free trade agreement' on the front, which was enough for themâthey did not actually look at the fine print, because they did not have the fine print. That arrived only last week in 1,100 pages.</para><para>There is certainly a basis for concern about the rules of origin for textile, clothing and footwear exports from Australia to the United States. There is a provision, as I understand it, called `yarn forward'. There have been lots of yarns in the parliament today, but this is a particularly important yarn. The yarn forward arrangements effectively mean that Australian textiles and clothing may not be able to enjoy any improved access into the United States, because of a requirement that the yarn be produced not overseas but here in Australia. I further understand that by and large the producers of textiles and clothing in Australia do not use yarn that is produced in Australia; they import it. This is one of the pitfalls of these so-called free trade agreements: they may sound good in theory, but when you get to examining what they really mean in practical terms you may well be confronted with a situation where there is no significant improved access for our textile, clothing and footwear industries into the United States at all. That would be a great pity, but not a great surprise.</para><para>Continuing my remarks briefly on the trade deal, that is why there are Senate inquiries being established. That is why the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties will be examining this deal. Certainly Labor members, as opposed to coalition members, will be interested in the detail, because often in these trade deals the devil is in the detail, as we have found in relation to pharmaceutical benefits and as we have found in relation to the triggers that now existâand were not understood to exist at the time the deal was announcedâin respect of more than 20 agricultural products. These price triggers effectively mean that under the agreement the United States would be able to restrict access to Australian agricultural exports. Some of these details are proving the basis for serious concern about the net benefits of this trade deal. We want, as a consequence of the Senate inquiries and associated with them, the government to agree to have the Productivity Commission examine this agreement quite independently, because it is all very well for the government to say it is going out to tender, but of course the winning tenderer may be put in a position of feeling that they need to give the advice that the government wants to hear. And we certainly know what advice the government wants to hear in relation to this trade deal with the United States.</para><para>Returning to the issue of the textile, clothing and footwear industries, too often the prospects of these industries are talked down in Australia. It is certainly the case that the high-value textile, clothing and footwear industries have a good future in this country. By necessity, that future will be one that is based on skills development and new ideas as expressed through research, development and innovation. By way of example, I recall going to Tasmania and having a look at some of the local textile, clothing and footwear operations, including a small operation producing weatherproof jackets for people who might fall off yachts. These yachting jackets have a very high value and are able to survive in the international marketplace because although they are expensive they have all the bells and whistlesâliterallyâthat other imported ones do not. I suppose if you have enough money to pay for a $250,000 yacht you are probably prepared to pay $200 or $300 for a jacket, rather than $80. Good on the people of Tasmania who have come up with these ideas and have been able to survive quite well in the international marketplace. They have had the ideas and they have then converted them into a very high value product that falls within the category of textiles, clothing and footwear. There are other similar examples of where TCF industries in Australia can do well.</para><para>There are examples of adding value and new ideas in the area of just-in-time inventory arrangements as well. There are suppliers in this country who can compete successfully against China, for example, because an order is received electronically from a major retailer as soon as an item is purchased from the shelf. The order is placed and is then filled within 24 hours. As a consequence, the order is a garment of the right size and colour, delivered within 24 hours. China simply cannot compete with that, even though labour costs are so much lower in China.</para><para>That is a quite striking example, I think, of how Australian TCF industries can compete against stiff competition from China and other countries of East Asia, but the way that we should not be competing is through the race to the bottomâby competing on wage costs against the countries of East Asia. That is where the government has been driving Australian industry for eight years now. It is most unfortunate. It is a race that we should never have entered. It is a race that we should never want to win, because we will never succeed in competing on wage costs against the countries of East Asia. When a government develops a strategy for the textile, clothing and footwear industriesâor for any other industryâbased on wage cost competition, it is doomed to fail. All it means is that it will drive down the wages and working conditions of working Australians. Instead of driving down wages and working conditions in this race to the bottom, the alternative path, which is the Labor path, is the race to the topâof high wages and high skills. That is the future for Australia: high wages and high skills in products and services that embody a high level of innovation. There is a fundamental difference for Australian industry between the path that the coalition has chosenâthe low road to low skills and low wagesâand the path along which Labor will take manufacturing in this country. The path we have chosen is the high road to high skills and high wages.</para><para>We support this bill. We certainly do have concerns about the government's approach to the textile, clothing and footwear industries. We think it is short-sighted. We do not think it should be based on wage cost competition with East Asia. We think the government ought to switch paths and go from the low road to Labor's high road, but I do not have any confidence at all that this government will do that. As a consequence, I have to conclude with a heavy heart that that is not going to happen. Therefore the best way of achieving the high road to high skills and high wages is to elect a Latham Labor government in the second half of this year, when the Prime Minister finally has the nerve to call a federal election.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>26205</page.no><name role="metadata">Billson, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BILLSON</name><name.id>1K6</name.id><electorate>Dunkley</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI cannot comment on the heaviness or otherwise of the member for Rankin's heart. From all accounts, it is a goodâalthough at times a misguidedâheart. Perhaps the member for Rankin's heart is ruling his head here: he would like to say horrible things about the Howard government and its support for the textile, clothing and footwear industry, but he cannot really find any evidence to do that and so, it is fair to say, he has resorted to his heavy heart as the only foundation for finding something critical to sayâbecause the facts just do not bear out anything. His head is telling him that the pathway that the Howard government has pursued in supporting industries such as the textile, clothing and footwear industry and the motor vehicle assembly and components industry has been so positive, and that, in fact, today's <inline ref="R1983">Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Investment Program Amendment Bill 2004</inline> is part of something worth celebrating.</para></talk.start><para>We are celebrating a success story in two particular streams of the textile, clothing and footwear industry today. We are having to bring about some legislative changes to take account of the great innovation and leadership and the wonderful commitment to productivity, quality and vitality in the textile, clothing and footwear industry in two particular streams. None of this can explain a heavy heart or give credence to what the member for Rankin has been saying.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83V</name.id><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>1K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Billson, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BILLSON</name></talker><para>âNo amount of heckling from the member for Rankinâas I share with him complimentary comments about his heartâwill take away from the fact that this is actually a good time and a positive time. It is a time when we should be optimistic about the future, because we are celebrating the actual performance delivered through the actual support and the real programs of industry assistance put in place by the Howard government, as distinct from the member for Rankin's rhetoric as he clutches at images of his heavy heart.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In the electorate of Dunkley alone, $1.25 million of industry assistance has been delivered to the textile, clothing and footwear industry and the car component industry. That is real, meaningful assistance. I had a conversation with the managing director of Australian Arrow, a significant car component manufacturer. He is someone who can point to government industry policy as an example of how the Howard government has supported his enterprise. His great challenge at the moment is to try to find around 30 qualified electronics engineers to support the upscaling of production activities at the Frankston North-Carrum Downs industrial facility of Australian Arrow. What a nice problem to have. Down in my part of the world, it is more a question of heavy wallets than heavy hearts, because one of the barriers to him recruiting people with the skills that are needed to support the industry revitalisation overseen by the Howard government is the concern about having to pay tolls to get to work. That is an example of the Howard government having led, supported and nurtured a particular industry, which is now impeded only by the Bracks government's decision to impose tolls on the Scoresby Freeway. Now that is a cause for a heavy heart, and I see the member for Rankin going out to weep and seek counselling on the horrible things that are happening in Victoria because of the Bracks government, despite the positivity and optimism that the textile, clothing and footwear industryâjust coming back to the point of the billâand the car industry are receiving because of the support of the Howard government.</para><para>As I said, $1.25 million of industry assistance has been delivered to the Dunkley electorate, and this bill looks at front-end loading some of the industry assistance available for two particular streams of the textile, clothing and footwear program. The bill amends the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Investment Program to provide an alternative cap on certain grants available under the TCF Strategic Investment Program, with respect to the remaining two years of that particular program. What we are looking at here today, for those who are interested in this industry, are two particular streams: one is the leather areaâthe leather segment of the textile, clothing and footwear industryâand the other is the technical textile stream of the industry. For those who are not familiar with the technical textile stream of the TCF industry, it involves non-fabric, non-garment activitiesâgeotechnical membranes used by landscape gardeners, for instance. For the benefit of the members at the tableâthe member for Lindsay and the member for Bassâit may even involve things like the semipermeable fabrics that you find in nappies, drawing the moisture away from the buttcheeks of our younger citizens. It may involve examples of air filtration fabrics used in industry. These are probably not the areas of the textile clothing and footwear industries that immediately come to mind, but they include very important production and commercial applications of textile technologies across a whole range of domestic uses. Road manufacturingâthe membranes that are put down to construct roadsâis an example of the kind of industry segment that we are celebrating here today.</para><para>What the industry have been able to achieve is international competitiveness, a robustness in their industry segment and an encouragement to government to support their work in moving forward with what they have already been able to achieve today. Mr Deputy Speaker Hawker, you would have noted from the Productivity Commission report that the leather industry and the technical textile industry have made submissions to the Productivity Commission, as we were looking at tariff and industry assistance arrangements for the TCF industry going forward. They have advised that they are doing pretty well, that the five per cent tariff level is around what they are working with at the moment, that there has been a far more modest loss of employment in their segments of the industry and that, in fact, there has been a growth in terms of turnover. This bill does not seek to slow up the international competitiveness that those two streams have been able to achieve but to support it.</para><para>Under the current arrangements there is a cap on the kind of productivity enhancement assistance they are able to attract. With this bill, we are proposing to remove that cap and replace it with a value-adding cap that has greater regard to the actual turnover of the business as distinct from the value add achieved within the business. To some people that might sound a little confusing, but it is simply replacing the five per cent value added cap which limits type 3 grants at the moment. For instance, if you and I, Mr Deputy Speaker, were running a business creating fabric for road-manufacturing purposes, we might have a $30 million turnover and it might cost us $20 million to produce that turnover. The value add, the $10 million, would represent the basis on which the five per cent cap would be applied. That is a quintessentially Australian characteristic of this industry support program.</para><para>Because those industries are reasonably competitive now, we are moving to front-end load the assistance that is available. So, rather than have a five per cent cap on just the value add component of their production, we are moving out to the WTO-compliant five per cent cap on their overall turnover. So, going back to the example I provided where the five per cent cap would apply to the $10 million turnover, the new five per cent cap will apply to the $30 million turnover. As you can see, that opens up great opportunities for the leather segment and the technical textile segment to gain a greater share of the available grant funding in the current round of the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Investment Program Scheme.</para><para>In return for that, because those streams of the TCF industry are world competitive, are leading the way and are demonstrating their success and their ability to be productive and to export, in the second tranche of the TCF Strategic Investment Program Scheme they will not have a specific provision for their requirements; if they are seeking further industry assistance they will have to apply through the more mainstream government industry assistance programs. So we are celebrating tonight a success story, a success story where these two streams within the TCF industry have advanced their interests and their global competitiveness to support export opportunities, productivity and product innovation to the point where more help is wanted now on that value-adding taskâapplying the new tools they have acquired and implementing the insights they have gained from research and development. We are saying, `Let's put those funds on the table now with a more generous cap to support the momentum they already have in place.' I am optimistic that will drive forward greater activity in those segments in line with their submission to the Productivity Commission and set them up to be internationally competitive. They can then move into the general industry assistance programs that the government offers.</para><para>An example from the Dunkley electorate of a company that has benefited from these broader programs is the Bata shoes people, who have brought in new technology for their boot-manufacturing activities in Mornington. There was a significant amount of assistance to help that local manufacturer to be internationally competitive. They are now getting into some retailing from those premises, which is great to see. They are being quite constructive and positive in their outlook. Another local TCF industry I would like to mention is Hysport International. They have been around for more than 30 years, operating out of the Dunkley electorate. They are currently in premises in Hartnett Drive in Seaford. They manufacture knitwear for Australia, some of it very distinctiveâyou might remember the big A for Australia and some bright yellow clothes that looked a little like something a traffic policeman would wear. They were manufacturing that years ago when it was very much in vogue. They have used sophisticated machinery and some of the finest fibres available to produce high-quality garments. There is one thing for sure with their current range, the Emaroo Australia range: you will not get lost in them! They are very brightly coloured statements about Australia, picking up some of the colours of our landscape and environment to provide internationally attractive knitwear using sophisticated CAD/CAM design and manufacturing technology, by which almost the whole garment can be produced. They are leading the way; that is an example of what we are looking for from the textile, clothing and footwear industryânothing like the race to the bottom on wages that the member for Rankin was talking about. This is a high-tech outfit and an example of the kind of industry innovation that is being supported by the government through its strategic investment program in the textile, clothing and footwear industry.</para><para>A not-so-positive note relates to the ongoing development of the pool of talent to nurture and develop this high-value, high-quality, high-innovation industry that we are seeking to support through the government's industry assistance programs. The Elizabeth Murdoch College in Langwarrin has invested some effort to build up networks in the fashion design industry to offer opportunities for students in the Dunkley electorate. They have a clothing design and production capability that we were hopeful of supporting through the skills cluster program that is overseen by ANTA, the Australian National Training Authority. We hoped to work with those existing business relationships within the sector to support students to pursue niche marketing opportunities in our region. Through student engagement and the successes to dateâreflected by the college's teaching commitment in the field and by some of the relationships that have been established between the Melbourne college of fashion and retailersâwe were hopeful of seeing a new generation of fashion designers for whom excellence and innovation were valued and nurtured. We hoped to expand that to a cluster of secondary colleges in the Dunkley area and possibly look to extend some of the state government's VCAL work into industry-specific qualifications.</para><para>Sadly, for reasons I do not understand and I certainly do not agree with, the state government did not recommend this proposal as part of the ANTA funding rounds. That is something that is unclear to me. I will give the state government the benefit of the doubt and say that the reason for this project not getting the support that it deserves is unclear to me. I would like to think that maybe they did not understand the significance of it, but we will keep battling away to make sure that we have the talent pool, the software and the people with the innovative and creative ideas that can drive forward a level of quality and international excellence that the government is trying to support with its textile, clothing and footwear industry packages.</para><para>I commend the bill to the House. It is pleasing to hear that the Labor Party are not planning to oppose it. I guess the question is: how could they? It is a good news story that is actually providing more immediate support for streams within the TCF industry that are doing a great job. It is front-ending that supportâit is bulking it up so that the assistance is there nowâby putting in a more generous cap. It is basically working in partnership with the leather industry and the technical textiles industry to make sure they can keep doing some of the fantastic things they have already done to date and can build on that strong foundation for the future.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Hawker, David (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Hawker)</inline>âOrder!

I am pleased to be following, on our side, the shadow minister for workplace relations in speaking on the <inline ref="R1983">Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Investment Program Amendment Bill 2004</inline>. The bill establishes an alternative cap for certain grants to enable leather and technical textile businesses to access additional funding for the final two years of the strategic investment program. The government is proposing these amendments in the context of an underspend in the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Investment Program. The textile, clothing and footwear industry is an important employer in my district and the SIP has been beneficial in allowing many employers to improve their processes, develop high-quality new products and access new markets. Labor therefore is, rightly, supporting this bill and the enhancement of the SIP, particularly to the leather and technical textile sectors.</para></talk.start><para>But the government's changes to the SIP also come on the back of the government's inaction and now irrational and hasty tariff cuts, which will mean that thousands of jobs will be lost around Australia. The bill comes on the back of a lack of any strategic policy coming from the government as to how to support innovation in the future for the textile, clothing and footwear sector and on the back of policies that have seen the demise of research investment by the private sector in particular. The recent Productivity Commission review into TCF assistance did not adequately look at the social impact of any further reductions in tariffs, nor did it seriously look at trade barriers imposed by other countries in relation to textiles, clothing and footwear.</para><para>In my own electorate, according to the Productivity Commission review of TCF assistance, TCF employment is around 556 people. The government may not care much about the jobs of 556 workers in regional Victoria, but I do. Since the government was elected in 1996, we have lost 748 textile, clothing and footwear jobs in my electorate. We lost 12 more only a few months ago with the closure of a factory in Daylesford. In 1996, textile, clothing and footwear employment represented 9.8 per cent of total manufacturing employment. In 2001 that number was down to just one per cent. I would like to say that the 748 workers who lost their jobs from the TCF industry found employment in other sectors of manufacturing, but it is just not the case. I see these men and women pretty constantly as they battle with Centrelinkâif they have joined the large number of people in my electorate who, as mature aged unemployed, have not found workâor as they battle for job security in part-time, casual and insecure employment.</para><para>It is somewhat of a bitter irony to me that the Treasurer and Prime Minister are encouraging older workers to stay engaged in the paid work force longer. These TCF workers would have been desperate to do so if only they could have. Many of the older people whom the Treasurer is exhorting to stay in paid work are the same people who not so long ago were the workers who were subjected to large-scale retrenchments within the TCF sector. Many found themselves being retrenched before they wanted to leave work and many have faced dismal prospects of regaining work. There have been 748 in my electorate since 1996. We need to have a serious look at the impact of further tariff reductions and the lack of investment in assisting the TCF industry develop new markets, research new processes and develop new products. We need to have a serious look at the impact on jobs in regional communities, on regional communities themselves and on the Australian economy as a whole. The government's decision to further reduce TCF tariffs is a sell-out of the 556 workers in my district who are still employed in this sector.</para><para>Labor has a very different position in relation to the TCF sector to that of the government. The government seems happy to preside over its demise and it has given up on it as a major industry in this country. We on this side of the House are not prepared to just give up on the hundreds of workers still employed in this sector. We support investment in innovation and research in the TCF sector and we are supporting this bill as a result. There is no doubt that the sector is set to face a tough time. But, rather than washing our hands of the TCF sector, we want to actively fight to save it. I do not believe in reducing tariffs because of ideology. If that sort of decision is to be taken then it must be because it is good policy, not because of ideology. The case that was made by the Productivity Commission, on which the government has based its decision to reduce tariffs for the TCF industry, was a poor one indeed. We would hold TCF tariffs at current levels pending an independent review to be undertaken by a new Labor government. Labor will not be supporting the government in legislating for tariff reductions in 2010.</para><para>In 1996 the Howard government abolished Labor's Labour Adjustment Program for the TCF industry. They have now belatedly put up a new labour adjustment program or, as they call it, the Structural Adjustment Fund, as part of the post-2005 assistance package to this sector. This labour adjustment program is $50 million over 10 years. Frankly, if we are going to actually actively revive the TCF industry in this country, $50 million over 10 years is not going to be enough. Labor will reinstitute a proper labour adjustment program with a more appropriate level of funding. It will be a non-means-tested program to assist TCF workers in vocational training and in finding new employment.</para><para>The textile, clothing and footwear industries have always been important in Ballarat's economy. TCF workers have a proud history in Ballarat. Like many other communities, we have faced substantial closures over the last 10 to 20 years, but many industries have hung in there. TCF industries know that they work in a competitive environment, but they have developed niche products, gone after new markets and improved their production processes. Companies in Ballarat such as Hilton Fabrics and Creswick Woollen Mills employ up to 100 people each, with small and medium firms such as Comfy Garments and Bulace Dyeing employing smaller numbers. We also, of course, have the fantastic shoe manufacturers Oliver and Rivers within my electorate.</para><para>With the huge changes that this sector has undergone, the industries in my electorate have had to constantly innovate. They have established themselves in new markets and developed new products which are becoming recognised across Australia for their high quality. Creswick Woollen Mills, as an example, sell their products internationally. Comfy Garments have specialised in developing comfy, high-quality, easy-to-wear garments for older people, particularly those in nursing homes, and have been recognised locally through the Ballarat Business Awards.</para><para>The city of Ballarat has estimated that the combined production output and wage expenditure of the TCF sector in Ballarat and the region is around $68.4 million. In a regional economy such as mine, $68.4 million is a huge amount. The TCF industries contribute not only directly to the local economy via employment but also to other industries such as freight and small engineering. TCF workers' wages also boost the local economy through their purchase of local goods and services. None of those things seems to have been factored into the Productivity Commission's report. The TCF companies in my electorate have invested significantly in the industry, and I would again in this place like to highlight the case of Oliver Footwear, which was included in the City of Ballarat's submission to the Productivity Commission last year.</para><para>The Oliver Footwear company retains its commitment to footwear manufacture in Ballarat, where it has been operating for over 100 years. Innovation in product research and development to address the needs and demands of a tough workplace safety environment has been a central part of the company's philosophy. Its innovation in manufacturing technology and business systems has been reflected by a more than $7 million investment in new capital. Today, Oliver Footwear is one of Australia's largest producers of industrial and safety footwear, and it is a company committed to working at world's best practice in all dimensions. Its $7 million capital investment has included the installation of a new 30-station DESMA German polyurethane injection-moulding machine, complementing its original 24-station moulder and leading to the release of the Oliver GRIPthane range of safety and recreational footwear. The investment also saw the commissioning in late 1999 of a new MAIN Group dual density nitrile rubber-moulding machine for the Oliver SOFT<inline font-style="italic">trac</inline> range of safety footwear. </para><para>Complementing these major capital investment items has been the incorporation of significant robotic process applications, the streamlining of materials management and production flows, and a just-in-time manufacturing strategy. Complementing the manufacturing and process improvement investments has been the addition of expanded warehousing capacity. Oliver Footwear has invested significantly in the electronic commerce and information technology areas. Oliver Footwear is manufactured to Australian standard AS/NZ 2210.2, while individual footwear products are continuously benchmarked against other recognised international industry and performance tests. Oliver Footwear is an accredited quality endorsed company, accredited to the Australian and International Quality Standard ISO 9002. These are just the sorts of innovations we should be supporting in this country and within this sector. Oliver Footwear is a shining example of what you can do with a thriving TCF industry and what you can do with employment in regional Victoria.</para><para>Labor supports the continuation of the strategic investment program at its current levels. We also consider that the SIP should be reconfigured to give greater reward for innovation in product design, production and delivery and that it should use a more flexible definition of innovation, concentrating on areas that will boost the competitiveness of existing TCF operations. I am afraid that, from what we have seen of the SIP at the moment, it looks like a little more of the sameâa bit of a salvage package as the industry goes into declineârather than actually trying to boost the industry and move it into the future. Labor is committed to pursuing improved market access for Australian TCF exports. In relation to the US free trade agreement, Labor is very concerned that the yarn forward rule and the rule of origin will destroy access to US markets. Labor also committed at our national conference to the establishment of a permanent TCF industry council. The council would focus on increasing innovation, developing export strategies to ensure value-adding exports, and creating employment in the TCF sector.</para><para>I see in my electorate the innovation that is being undertaken by many of the smaller firms, and we should certainly support it and encourage investment in innovation. There is a strong future for the TCF industries within Australia. It is important that we support the innovation of these industries as they restructure. It is important that we support TCF industries, not just for the products that they produce but also for the employment they offer in regional cities such as my own. Many TCF industries are located within regional and rural centres, close to the raw materials that they utilise for their production. This industry has had a strong history in this country. We are proud producers of textiles, clothing and footwear and we should be doing everything we can to ensure that this industry not only survives but thrives in our regional areas.</para><para>It is also important to recognise that the sector is changing, that it has invested significantly in innovation and that we should continue to support that innovation. Labor sees a strong future for the textile, clothing and footwear industries. I see a strong future for the textile, clothing and footwear industries in my electorate, but it will only happen if we actively support them. Labor stands proud and ready to support them. From what we have heard and seen in relation to tariff cuts, we now know that the Liberal and National parties are not prepared to do so and have written off the sector and the jobs of thousands of workers who are employed in the textile, clothing and industries across this country.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>26212</page.no><name role="metadata">Tuckey, Wilson, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TUCKEY</name><name.id>SJ4</name.id><electorate>O'Connor</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThat was quite an amazing speech to listen to for those who have the benefit, as I do, of consulting history in this place. It was prior to my attending this parliament, but I have read of the Whitlam government taking a flat 25 per cent off all tariffs in Australia andâas they did in those daysârevaluing the Australian dollar at the same time, which was a form of a double whammy. I was in this place when the Hawke government cut tariffs across the board by amounts of up to 75 per cent. One can measure that against this legislationâthe <inline ref="R1983">Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Investment Program Amendment Bill 2004</inline>âand the associated arrangements.</para></talk.start><para>Contrary to the member for Ballarat's promises to her constituents, the promises in the legislation today are of tariff protection for the TCF industries until 2015. I personally believe that time frame is probably longer than is to the benefit of that industry. The Labor Party's promise, as promoted by the member for Ballarat, is that everything will be supported until they have an independent review, if they win government. In her own words, having told the people of her electorate that she and the opposition are in a position to guarantee the industry's longevity, it is going to beâshould they vote Laborâsubject to an independent review. But this legislation covers all the options until 2015 with no further review and no further undermining of the process. It is a legal structure that maintains certain levels of tariff protection and, I think more importantly, under the SIP delivers incentives for business to become more efficient in what is a very difficult environment.</para><para>Anybody who, as I do, visits the major retailers of Australia, such as the Big Ws, the Kmarts and the others, has to be astounded by: (a) how inexpensive ordinary clothing is today; (b) the quality; and (c) notwithstanding some recognisable Australian brands, the fact that when you get to the little ticket it says, `Made in China.' That may be attributed to Chinese workers who do not oppose high levels of efficiency, notwithstanding their wage levels. Chinese workers are creating products which, when delivered to Australia bearing a 17.5 per cent dutyâas clothing and finished textiles doâare amazingly inexpensive. For a wife having to buy clothing for one, two, three or maybe four children, that is a great help. It is the opportunity to see your children well clothed at very low pricesâprices that are much lower in real terms than and very competitive in nominal terms with prices of 20 years ago.</para><para>When we start to measure the businesses that must be sustained in Australia, the first testâand I think this was referred to at the ALP conference by Premier Carrâhas to be how much we are going to levy ordinary Australian workers. Ordinary Australian wage-earners are propping up a particular industry whose work force and/or management will not seek to be as competitive as possible. In the global clothing and footwear industry, there is a competitive environment emerging where wages are low, the work ethic is high and the work force does not have a Luddite attitude of not wanting the latest in technology associated with their efforts. All of these things come together. Then we ask whether there is a role in textile, clothing and footwear for the Australian manufacturing industry. Of course there is.</para><para>With regard to quality products, R.M. Williams sells a pair of elastic-sided boots for possibly three or four times the retail price of a similar product that, for all intents and purposes, looks as good. Why? Because it has outstanding design, it has targeted a niche market and people see it as a quality product. Interestingly enough, on a related topic, we have an American company trying to steal and register the generic brand name of ugh boots, which I do not think anybody in the world would dispute was an Australian invention and one which caught the popular imagination because of its convenience and quality. That is a product where we are still competitive around the world, because we do a good job of making it and it is innovative and different. So the test is not whether something should survive based on the will of government. That is a yesterday concept, and it will not work.</para><para>Amongst the Liberals, I am a member of the Modest Members Association, which recognises the late Bert Kelly. As the only person who bought the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> in the town of Carnarvon many years ago, I remember reading Bert's modest member contribution with great interest at a time when the rest of Australia was telling him he was a radical no-hoper who wanted to destroy all our manufacturing industries. Bert, of course, was proved right. In that process, I have given plenty of consideration to what tariffs have done to industry. We know very well what they do: they create complacency and inefficiency which eventually come back to haunt you because, notwithstanding the particular level of protection, someone eventually underbids you anyway.</para><para>The roaring success of the Australian car industry in recent times, which all started with the Hawke government, has seen a reduction in tariff protection. The industry have had to bite the bullet, and they found solutions. They modernised, they identified their market opportunities and, with the implementation of the free trade agreement with America, they will be competitive in niche markets in that country. America no longer have many motor cars over thereâif anyâthat have rear wheel drive, which delivers quite a few attractions to people who particularly like a more sporty vehicle et cetera. And we have them.</para><para>It is interesting to note, as we are now exporting the Monaroâwhich I think will be sold over there as a Pontiacâthat it is the American unions who are protesting. This behemoth of a manufacturing operation, with all the one-time benefits of mass production and massive throughputs of single models, is suddenly worried about competition from Australia. I find this quite remarkable when we hear some of the bleatings from the opposition benches: `The end of the world is near! We are going to sign a free trade agreement with America and everyone will lose their job.' Half the resident community of the electorate of the shadow minister for agriculture and fisheries relies on the car industry, and he keeps telling them that the end of the world is coming. And over there in America the unions are saying: `We are scared stiff of the Australians. You can only bring in 18,000 Monaros.' Why? If they are such an expensive productâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>849</name.id><name role="metadata">Sidebottom, Sid, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Sidebottom</name></talker><para>âThe free trade agreementâshe's a beauty, isn't she?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>SJ4</name.id><name role="metadata">Tuckey, Wilson, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TUCKEY</name></talker><para>âThere you go. I think there are great opportunities for Australia, considering the Americans' love affair with trucks, as they call themâand they are admittedly trucks. They will be attracted to our types of utilities, which give that extra bit of comfort with many of the aspects of a bigger ute. They are not the other type of four-cylinder ute that we have. That is getting a little way from this legislation, but the same point is to be made.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The Whitlam government and the Hawke government learnt that tariff protection helped nobody. It did not help the consumer and it certainly did not help industry. We have seen a steady reduction of tariffs in the car industry, for instance. Tariffs have been coming downâI think from 45 per cent, which I have recorded somewhere here in my notesâto 15 per cent currently, with more cuts predicted. Every stage of that reduction was protested and fought by the industry. And, every time it happened, their sales increased. Now, of course, there are 800,000 to 900,000 sales per annum. This has done wonders for that industry. Very senior representatives of the major manufacturers of the world come out to Australia to find out how we do things. In a real Australian manner we eventually found out how to operate in a less protected environment. In the case of textiles, clothing and footwearâand let me say that the government is conscious of the regional aspects of some of these industries in sustaining people in those areasâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>849</name.id><name role="metadata">Sidebottom, Sid, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Sidebottom</name></talker><para>âThank heavens!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>SJ4</name.id><name role="metadata">Tuckey, Wilson, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TUCKEY</name></talker><para>âOf course, the member who just interjected saw the collapse of the pulp industry in Burnie because, unfortunately, on that occasionânotwithstanding the claims of the member for Ballaratâthere was another imperative. The government of the day, the Hawke government, thought it more important to be re-elected than to sustain the forest products industry in Burnie by allowing the building of a new pulp mill down there. It was going to `pollute all of Bass Strait'. They would have had to put a lot of logs through it to achieve that outcome. I made a note as I was listening to the member for Ballarat. She was so concerned about regional industry. Of course, that became totally expendable for the Labor Party when it came to the forest industry, because that was a bit different. It attracted Green preferences, if you put your foot fairly and squarely on it.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Not only was the industry a good employer but it in itself needed no protection from a tariff regime or a quota regime. It could stand on its own two feet. But we have a pretty simple approach to forest health and forest production these days: we just leave it all to stand there until it burns down. I find this rather remarkable. But it is just another example of how regional communities have suffered from the politics of the leafy suburbs. When one talks of integrityâwhich gets a bit of a mention in this place from time to timeâI am proud to say that, throughout my role in representing the forest products industry, I stood very strongly by the argument that the industry had a right to exist and that it was a major contributor to our economy. A similar argument is now arising when it comes to the water that flows down the Murray River.</para><para>The reality is that, in a modern world, industry will only prosper if it is competitive. It can be quite tragic for people from time to time to be confronted by that fact. They think that government can save them, but history tells us that government never has. You can keep pouring money into certain industries, but eventually they still collapse. The employment in TCF and other areas declined the most during the period of high-tariff protection. Eventually other countries and their workers got into it.</para><para>We have had a speaker from Victoria, which is not surprising. I did note with interestâand this is a matter of considerable concernâthat Victoria has slightly less than half of Australia's TCF work force but that, since 1996, under the Bracks government it has had 90 per cent of industrial disputes. We are advised that when Geelong Wool Combingâanother aspect of TCFâwas recently forced to close, with the loss of 100 jobs, it was claimed that the union resistance to new workplace practices, which were accepted in New South Wales at a similar plant, was the major reason that the company could not continue. It just gave up and closed down. It is a very strange aspect of union representation of workers today that they seem more interested in redundancy than in continued employment. I find that quite remarkable.</para><para>It is also interesting to me that the Whitlam government and later the Hawke government placed such a heavy emphasis on tariff reductions, virtually applying them as a blunt instrument across the board, without the selective approach of the Howard government, which has been quite tough on tariff reductions. For instance, the motor industry could handle it. In the more sensitive industries with a regional background and basis, the government has been selective. Typically, all of the responses of the two Labor governments in recent history were across-the-board cutsâa blunt instrument. Of course, it was the only solution those governments had to discipline the work force, because their union associates would not tolerate reform of the operation of the industrial relations scene. That would have been better because it would have generated efficiencies and at the same time would have allowed them to be selective in their tariffs, relative to the improvement that was available within certain industries.</para><para>My contribution today can be summarised simply by saying that the government has put down a program. The member for Ballarat said we needed a strategy. I reckon a strategy out to 2015 is not too bad. That is what we are talking about today: a strategy that gives continuing protection of 17Â½ per cent to 2010âa lower levelâand that will still be five per cent in 2015. More importantly, this legislation authorises a $600 million package to give incentives and, I might add, some $50 million worth of restructuring and retraining opportunities. But it is primarily to finance people to use the latest technology to make them competitive with the clothing and footwear industries in low-wage countries that are now the major source that we Australians use today.</para><para>In my closing remarks let me say that I am also reminded that the leather industry, which is particularly recognised here, frightened the Americans so much that they took WTO action against our people because of some relatively minor assistance that was available here through an export credits arrangement. We had to change it. So, again, those who have grasped the nettle, the workers who have gone along with their employers, do not need to be frightened of the rest of the world. I think these initiatives will assist them in that regard.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>26215</page.no><name role="metadata">Sidebottom, Sid, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SIDEBOTTOM</name><name.id>849</name.id><electorate>Braddon</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe <inline ref="R1983">Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Investment Program Amendment Bill 2004</inline> before us today establishes an alternative cap for certain grants to enable leather and technical textile businesses to access additional funding for the final two years of the Strategic Investment Program, or SIP as it is better known, 2003-04 to 2004-05. The alternative cap enables those businesses to match the total value of their grants for plant and equipment, new and used, and research and development, with a grant for value adding. The government is proposing these amendments because there is currently an underspend in the TCF Strategic Investment Program. We on this side support this bill. Indeed, we on this side totally support the textile, clothing and footwear industry.</para></talk.start><para>It always gives me great pleasure to be able to comment on an important industry, not just Australia wide but most importantly in my electorate of Braddon on the north-west coast of Tasmania. Some 460 people are directly employed in the TCF industry at Ulster Tascot, which is in east Devonport; Australian Weaving Mills in Devonport; and, less publicised, the Tasmanian Clothing Company, which is located in Don Road in Devonport. In total in Tasmania around 1,500 people are directly employed in the TCF industry. So whatever happens in the TCF industry is taken very seriously in my neck of the woods. Indeed, there are some good-news stories about the TCF industry. Anything that this government can do to support the industry in the short term, and most especially in the long term, we will support.</para><para>The Labor Party and a future Latham Labor government also have a strategy to assist the TCF industry. If the government is prepared to take it on board, so be it. If not, then we will go our way to support this very important industry. I acknowledge, as have many members in this House, that the TCF industries have gone through a tremendous period of change, particularly through the eighties and nineties. Many people lost their jobs. Many of those people struggled to find alternative employment. Those businesses and sectors of the industry that have survived have done so because they were able to do it smartlyâthey were able to make important decisions about their futureâand governments of all persuasions attempted to support those changes.</para><para>As the previous speaker, the member for O'Connor, saidâand I do not generally agree with most things that he saysâwe did have an industry that was, in relative terms, inefficient. Some painful decisions were made, unfortunately with painful consequences for the industry. Those who work in the industry and those segments of the industry that survive today do so because they do things smartly. The industry have a highly efficient and effective work force, but we need to finetune this to support their futures in terms of research and development, innovation and the way they go about doing their business. I must say that the businesses in my electorate that I just mentioned do it well. They are proud of their tradition in the TCF industry and do not ask for handouts. All they ask for is support so that they can make strategic decisions for the benefit of their workers and their community and for the long-term benefit of their industry. So there are things that we have in common with the government in supporting this industry and there are areas in which we would go further.</para><para>I would like to say one thing before I talk about these important companies in my own electorate. The member for O'Connor said that the Labor Party's intention is to review tariffs before the tariff reduction of 2015. In fact, we are suggesting that before any tariff changes are made in the future we should have a review of tariffs per se. And that is not just a review of tariffs and their effects in Australia; we should be reviewing our so-called competitors and their tariff and non-tariff regimes so that we can look at what may be loosely dubbed not only free trade but fair trade. I do not want the member for O'Connor's comments to be taken out of their historical context for our party. We want review. We want review not just of what happens in Australia but also what happens to our competitors. That is what we want. It is not a matter of introducing or reducing tariffs before 2015. I think he was being very mischievous on these matters, as he often is.</para><para>I would like to tell three good-news stories in relation to the TCF industry in my electorate and then look at what Labor proposes for the future. The first I would like to mention is one that generally does not get much publicity in my electorate but which is a really dynamic, hardworking, expanding business: the Tasmanian Clothing Company in Don Road in Devonport. This is run by Eunice and Graeme Davis. It started off with this man's passion for basketballâsomething we share, actuallyâand his plan, purely and simply, to make some decent uniforms for his basketball team. Being an innovative Braddonite, like others we have, he set out to do this. One of his greatest problems, of course, was to try and find somebody who could supply him with fabrics and particularly someone who would dye a sufficient quantity for him to make the uniforms. This was in the early eighties. He found someone after six months and set up a business in the sunroom in the front of his house with three machines and the kitchen table as the cutting tableâand, of course, the bedrooms just filled up with fabric.</para><para>The business gradually developed. He got a good name for the product he made and moved out of home, which most businesses try to do, in time. He expanded the businessâso much so that, as developments occurred in the business, he made his way in 1990 to the current site at Don Road in Devonport. By that stage he had dabbled with developing the manufacturing side in Launceston, but returned to Devonport to continue the name of the Tasmanian Clothing Company. He then introduced embroidery machines, commenced his own screen-printing and became a one-stop shop. So you could go in, look at fabric, decide on design, and decide on embroidery design if need be, and it would be made there for you. In the meantime, he had developed a very loyal, stable, dedicated and efficient work force, so all the drivers were there. In fact, in 1995, the company won the Devonport Chamber of Commerce and Industry Business Achiever Award.</para><para>More recently, the company has been approached to produce sample polo shirts for the American golf market, which looks like being a lucrative extension to the company, and also to look at thermal wear from merino wool. This, too, is in production. They have also outfitted competitors in the Targa Tasmania car rally, TAFE Tasmania, and the Subaru safari car rally and provided the walk-out outfits for the Tasmanian AFL team. As I said, they manufacture heaps of school wear for 95 schools. They produce uniforms, promotional wear, tracksuits, aprons, rugby tops and high visibility wear. So that is the Tasmanian Clothing Company. It started off as an idea for basketball and ended up as a major employer of 26 people and hoping to expand even more.</para><para>Talking about expansion, Australian Weaving Mills in Devonport is an example of an industry that cameâand still comesâunder great competition, but has managed to weave its way into the future and is able to survive. It evolved through a series of mergers during the eighties and nineties, which saw four formerly independent towel manufacturers come together in one large mill in Devonport. The company currently supplies towels and bed linen to retail and institutional customers. One of the offsets of this in research and development is that through a local computer manufacturer and software developer, Phoenix Computers of Ulverstone, they were able to develop a complete stocktake ability for retail purposes. When the retail sales come through from their major retailers, they are automatically clocked, if you like, with the computer in the Australian Weaving Mills and the stock is immediately replaced. That has been one of the innovations that this company has been able to put into action.</para><para>AWM's core business involves selling towels, with annual sales of $37 million per annum, 95 per cent of which stem from local manufacture. It also has a bed linen business, sales of which total $8 million. Its total business equates to sales of $45 million per annum. The company employs 275 people in total, with 250 of those based in Devonport in my electorate. It has spent $8.6 million in investment over the last three years. It deals with 110 companies locally, within a 20-kilometre radius. To tell you how much the towel industry has faced competition and restructuring, in 1985 there were nine towel mills in Australia; now there are only two. So it is a fairly cutthroat business. Australian Weaving Mills made a detailed submission to the Productivity Commission inquiry on the post-2005 TCFL industries assistance plan. In that submission, they made some pertinent comments about tariffs. I would like to quickly comment on those before moving on to Ulster Tascot. The AWM submission said:</para><quote><para>The subsequent reality however, is that the restructuring pressures imposed on the industry by the ongoing tariff reductions through to June 2000 were much more severe than anyone had expected. This pressure was compounded by the introduction of GST, which manufacturers were forced to absorb and which has more recently been impacted on by the strengthening $A.</para></quote><para>The submission goes on to say:</para><quote><para>AWM believes therefore that the previously legislated tariff reduction should not necessarily be tacitly taken as read. Rather the Company holds the view that the commitment should be reviewed in the light of the current circumstances.</para></quote><para>Further, it says:</para><quote><para>The scheduled tariff cut in 2005 will tend to undermine the positive efforts AWM has made to date. The currently legislated reduction from 25% to 17Â½% is substantial and will cause major disruption. To ensure the Company can move forward with future expenditure plans with reasonable confidence, tariffs should be held at their current rate or, in a worst case scenario at the legislated 2005 rate until at least 2015.</para></quote><para>`Hooray,' they would say. In line with the comments I made about the mischievous comments by the member for O'Connor regarding Labor's attitude to tariff review, they go on to say:</para><quote><para>Any further tariff reductions beyond those currently envisaged in 2005 should not be legislated, rather they should be examined and their appropriateness adjudged at the time of the mid term review which should take account of action taken by other countries to reduce their trade barriers to accord with our more open market. This could be done by conducting a streamlined industry review at that time (ie focussing solely on trade barriers) to determine the nature (path/extent) of further tariff reductions if any, for the period 2010 to 2015.</para></quote><para>So they too support the idea of ongoing review of our tariff competitors, unlike the assessment that the member for O'Connor tended to put on our approach to review.</para><para>Finally, I would like to mention Ulster Tascot, which is located in East Devonport, the home of <inline font-style="italic">Spirit of Tasmania</inline> I,<inline font-style="italic"> II</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">III</inline>. Ulster Tascot is one of Australia's two specialist woven carpet manufacturers and produces high quality woven carpet for the Australian and international commercial carpet markets. The company focuses on wool-rich products for the hospitality sector, including five-star hotels, casinos, theatre complexes, airport lounges and concession areas. The company employs around 220 people and achieves sales of around $20 million per annum from its East Devonport, Tasmania, manufacturing plant, with approximately 20 per cent of its turnover being generated from export sales.</para><para>It went through a lean time until the late 1980s when a management team put together a proposal to buy out the former company, which was part of the Guthrie group of companies. In 1996 the new management structure embarked on a program of capital investment, market focus and more dedicated export development, as this approach was seen as vital to secure the future of the company and its long-serving employees in Devonport. The investment in new plant allowed Tascot Templeton to revitalise its product range and target the high end of the hospitality market, which it has done. Indeed, it secured the important refurbishment contract for Changi Airport in the late 1990s. Tascot's re-emergence through the 1990s was also noticed internationally. In 2001, Ulster Carpets, one of the world's largest woven carpet manufacturers, acquired Tascot Templeton Carpets and subsequently renamed it Ulster Tascot. This acquisition is in the process of taking the company to its new development stage.</para><para>On tariffs, the company has this to say:</para><quote><para>Tariff reductions to date, have had the desired effect of opening our markets to competition and encouraging manufacturers to produce quality products at world competitive prices. However, if we further reduce tariffs while our international competitors stand still on their barrier assistance and industry support measures, we are simply throwing away our industry bargaining position.</para><para>Whilst Ulster Tascot understand that the 2005 tariff reduction is legislated it would recommend that any further changes should be the subject of an industry tariff review.</para></quote><para>In terms of regional issues they say:</para><quote><para>Specific consideration should be given to address the unique circumstances of regionally based employers, without which we would see a risk of further regional manufacturing closures with an accompanied displacement of employees who are not readily absorbed with alternative employment in their local community.</para></quote><para>We, on this side of the House, take note of those comments and the comments of other segments of the TCF industry. That is why we will hold TCF tariffs at current levels, pending a reviewâwhich I have mentioned several timesâto be undertaken by a new Labor government. This does not mean we will wind back the clock or reverse tariffs; it is about sensible policy. Labor does not believe in reducing tariffs because of ideology; it believes in it because it must be good policy. They should only be reduced to encourage greater innovation, exports and competitiveness. As I said earlier, Labor believes that we should have a review and that the review should take into account the tariff and non-tariff assistance that goes to our competitors.</para><para>Labor would also reintroduce a labour adjustment program, which was abolished in 1996, for the TCF industry. The Howard government has now belatedly put up a new labour adjustment program, which it calls a structural adjustment fund, as part of its post-2005 assistance package. This LAP is for $50 million over 10 years, but it is not enough. Labor will reinstitute a proper LAP with a more appropriate level of funding. It will be a non-means-tested program to assist TCF workers in improving their English and language skills, in vocational training and in finding new employment.</para><para>Labor is also committed to pursuing improved market access for Australian TCF exports and, in relation to the US FTA, Labor is very concerned that the yarn forward rule, already mentioned by other speakers on this side, and the rule of origin will destroy access to US markets. Labor supports a new SIP for the TCF industry, but we need to see the detail of what the government is proposing before we make a decision on whether to support further the government's legislation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>26219</page.no><name role="metadata">Panopoulos, Sophie, MP</name><name role="display">Ms PANOPOULOS</name><name.id>00AMU</name.id><electorate>Indi</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise in support of the <inline ref="R1983">Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Investment Program Amendment Bill 2004</inline>.

I was present when the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, Mr Macfarlane, announced in November last year that there would be ongoing funding certainty for the TCF industryâwhich included the establishment of a $50 million scheme to assist local workers in regional areas and a $50 million import credit scheme to help local manufacturers build competitive product rangesâand I was keen to inform our local communities of the importance of this funding boost. That boost was very well received within the electorate of Indi.</para><para>In the context of discussing the bill, it would be remiss of me not to mention tariff protection, as other speakers have done so before me. When Labor was in government, tariffs were ruthlessly cut every year. They were cut by an average of three per cent a year, falling from 55 per cent to 25 per cent in 10 years. Under this government, there have been no annual cuts; rather, there have been five-yearly reductions with unprecedented and historic assistanceâmost recently $747 million to help the industry adjust and grow stronger. </para><para>Recently, Phil Cleary recounted that, after he had been elected as the Independent member for Wills in 1992, union leaders George Campbell and Anna Booth were seated in a cabinet room pleading with then Treasurer Keating to introduce a pause in tariff cuts. In true Keating arrogance, he was totally unmoved. Unlike the Howard government, the then Labor government refused to slow the rate of tariff cuts for the benefit of workers in these industries and to provide the opportunity for firms in those industries to find the room and the time to adjust to changing circumstances.</para><para>Only sustainable businesses can deliver employees secure employment. The SIP package that we have been discussing this afternoon provides certainty and innovation for the industry. The generous TCF assistance package equates to government support worth $13,000 per employee in the industry. When the current Leader of the Opposition was in a position to speak his mindâthat is, before he transmogrified into the stunt double of his Labor hero, the former member for Werriwa, Gough Whitlamâhe readily acknowledged: </para><quote><para>Tariffs and other forms of protection are the economic equivalent of racism. They encourage Australians to think poorly of people from other countries and to believe that we would be better off isolated from the rest of the world. If the Labor movement is willing to discriminate against other nations on economic grounds then what credibility do we have in arguing against social discrimination?</para></quote><para>Whilst the industry barely survived the harsh cuts of the 1990s under Labor, the approach of the Howard government has been markedly different. For instance, the combination of direct assistance and a gradual phase-in of lower tariffs allows firms in the industry to strengthen their businesses. The recently announced TCF package is aimed at providing firms within the industry with the opportunity to invest and to increase their market share, particularly in the area of exports. Tariffs of course do impose substantial costs on consumers and taxpayers, and existing TCF tariffs cost consumers up to $1 billion a year. Whilst the tariff debate can at times be emotive, it is important to point out that a tariff in itself does not create and does not protect a single job.</para><para>The additional transitional measure contained in the provisions of this bill is to allow a value-adding cap for technical textile and leather firms in the final two years of the SIP package. Essentially, this means that firms in these categories will be able to match the whole value of their approved grants for both new and used plant equipment and research and development in the final two years of the funding scheme with a value-adding grant.</para><para>Without doubt, the Howard government has been the TCF industry's greatest friend. Gone are the days of ruthless and unforgiving tariff cuts which bled the TCF industry dry under successive Labor governments. The pause in tariffs in 2000 and again in 2005 for five-year periods has given the industry the certainty, the light at the end of the tunnel and the resolve to move forward and become competitive in the global marketplace.</para><para>In the context of debating this bill, I would like to point out that the TCF industry has been often incorrectly referred to as a sunset industry, which conveys nothing of the resilience and diligence of the sector's work force, their employers and the businesses they represent. Amidst all the doom and gloom perpetuated at times by the union within that industry, there are many excellent signs, particularly in my area of north-east Victoria. Recent figures confirm that exports have risen by over 100 per cent in the industry. There are challenges that face many industries in Australia and, at a local level, in my electorate of Indi. But the one thing that binds the TCF sector and the wider community together is that we are all very proud of an industry that has united, employed and provided many people in north-east Victoria and many people within different generations of the one family with sustained and stable employment.</para><para>I am pleased to say that the industry is undergoing something of a renaissance, and in the north-east we have great reason to feel very proud of the achievements of our local textile firms. Take Bruck Textiles, for instance, where over 500 people are employed, accounting for more than 10 per cent of the rural city of Wangaratta's work force. The work and vision of the CEO, Mr Alan Williamson, in steering Bruck through difficult times is to be commended, and Bruck's commitment to the Wangaratta community cannot be overstated. In Bruck Textiles, Wangaratta and north-east Victoria can clearly see an Australian success story. It is a wholly Australian-owned company, and it is the largest man-made fibre weaver in the Southern Hemisphere. As we all know, since its inception in 1946 in Wangaratta, Bruck has contributed an enormous amount to the municipality of Wangaratta and the region. It is a company that will be in Wangaratta for a long time because it is innovative in its management and its manufacturing and it is keen and prepared to move into the future to promote its market share and to continue to provide jobs for the people of Wangaratta and the region. That is why Bruck's CEO Alan Williamson welcomed the $747 million package and said, `It's a good news story for the industry and it's a good catalyst for Bruck to continue to grow into one of the world's most advanced textile mills.'</para><para>At this point, it may be appropriate to remind the previous speaker, the member for BraddonâI am so sorry that he is not in the chamber at this timeâthat Ulster Carpets, a firm within his electorate, also commended the government for its policy in the area. In a media release in November last year the president of the Carpet Institute of Australia and Managing Director of Ulster Carpets, Mr Charles Szakiel, said that as a result of the government's decision, the carpet industry is looking positively to the future, while at the same time not underestimating the challenges that lie ahead. The continuation of assistance designed to encourage investment and innovation is a very positive outcome that will help the industry to continue its journey towards becoming more internationally competitive in a low tariff environment.</para><para>Bruck's export markets, along the same lines as many other firms within the industry, now encompass Great Britain, Europe, the US, New Zealand and the Asia-Pacific. Exports account for approximately 25 per cent of total production. Recently Bruck Textiles benefited from a significant contract with the federal government to be the supplier of cloth for Defence Force combat clothing under a two-year standing offer, with options to allow extensions for up to six years. To be selected for this significant contract, Bruck had to establish that its cloth products were competitively priced, used locally produced raw material and clearly satisfied Defence specifications.</para><para>I also want to mention another firm within my electorate, Australian Country Spinners. Its CEO, Brian Van Rooyen, stated that the announcement to extend the Strategic Investment Program was particularly good news for the clothing and apparel industry and acknowledged that the tariff debate was not the be-all and end-all of the matter. He stated, `The tariff change doesn't really affect us as we've had a five per cent tariff rate for some time, but the financial incentives offered are very welcome.' Australian Country Spinners is yet another success story in Wangaratta. Not only has it accelerated its production of skeins of wool to supply the ever growing and renewed craft of knitting and crotchetingâsomething I am pleased to have learnt from local craft groupsâbut it has also played a key role in keeping the local tradition of textiles alive and well in north-east Victoria. So much for all the doomsaying talk from the Labor Party regarding the future of the industry. What has occurred at Australian Country Spinners is that the Wangaratta plant has undergone significant expansion and growth in the past few years. It has actually increased its work force by some 10 per cent and is now exporting into China.</para><para>Whilst the federal government gets on with the job of providing direct, targeted financial assistance to the TCF industry, unfortunately and very sadly, the same cannot be said for the Victorian state government. In Victoria, the most junior minister in the Bracks government is the Minister for Manufacturing and Export, Mr Tim Holding. His claim to fame seems to be his own allocation of a $3.2 million slush fund for trade missions. Somewhat curiously, Minister Holding aimed to frighten and scare the industry and the workers in the lead-up to the government's response to the Productivity Commission review. He should be more aware that the decisions made in relation to tariffs are not directly related to his stream of government, nor are they directly aligned to his responsibilities as state minister. The policy areas of trade, tariffs and protectionism have always been the domain of the federal government, and it is the federal government that make decisions relating to tariffs particularly. Therefore, I have been slightly bemused by the sudden interest he has shown in the issue, when there are far larger issues confronting industry in Victoria. For instance, in the last year new capital investment in the Victorian manufacturing sector has fallen some eight per centâto its lowest level since 1991-92âat a time when the national manufacturing sector's contribution to GDP has grown by almost 16 per cent. If the state minister actually cared about assisting not only the TCF industry but other industries in Victoria, he would act in areas where the government has jurisdiction and where business has shown it is disadvantaged in competing interstate and internationallyânamely, in payroll tax reform, in WorkCover premiums and in insurance premiums.</para><para>New capital investment in Victoria has fallen to $1.2 billionâ10 per cent lower than it was in 1998-99, the last year before the current Premier of Victoria gained power. But far more important to workers' security is the fact that under the Bracks Labor government 21,000 Victorian jobs were lost in manufacturing in the year to May 2002. These are jobs directly applicable to the portfolio responsibilities of the state minister for manufacturing. Very unfortunately the state government's silence on this gives little hope to the people in north-east Victoria, rural Victoria and metropolitan Victoria that the state government is concerned with being proactive and doing something about it.</para><para>If the facts were not so damning in Victoria regarding industrial relations and manufacturing industry policy, we might put these policy failures down to an oversight. However, the only export record in manufacturing that the Victorian government seems to have is an unparalleled record for exporting Victorian jobs. We can draw our own conclusions on this, but I am not afraid of stating that, unlike the Victorian government, the federal government has made a huge, significant and historic investment in the TCF sector, and it will not put that investment at risk. The scare campaign entered into by the union and the state minister is truly irresponsible and totally debunked by reality, as businesses and employees in the industry know all too well.</para><para>Under the Labor Partyâand it is the party that has glorified the myth of supporting the battler and the workerâthe TCF industry has fought and struggled day by day merely to survive. Workers in the industry lost their jobs and whole regions suffered economic depression. But the Strategic Investment Program provided by this government is the largest single program that has ever been offered, and it has been enthusiastically taken up by the TCF sector. I am delighted that Minister Macfarlane has continued to enhance and provide support to the TCF industry. The program is, very importantly, focused on encouraging investment and innovation, which is needed for the industry to continue to become competitive and to grow.</para><para>As a local member with interests in and knowledge of the aspirations of employees within the TCF industry in my electorate, I look forward to working with them and with local TCF firms to see how I can best assist in utilising the direct financial support that this government is offering. The assistance provided to the industry through the pausing of tariffs and the investment of more funds into the sector will enable the industry to operate with clarity and certainty in the reduced tariff era, something that the industry never dreamt of being able to enjoy under the previous two Labor administrations. Whilst this bill is geared toward the leather and technical textile firms within the TCF sector, the additional support to these specific areas will make a great difference in helping firms adjust to the tariff adjustment scheme and, very importantly, will provide peace of mind to workers and their families who rely on the employment of firms within the industry. Therefore I commend this bill to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>26223</page.no><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JENKINS</name><name.id>HH4</name.id><electorate>Scullin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe <inline ref="R1983">Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Investment Program Amendment Bill 2004</inline> amends the primary act to provide an alternative cap on certain grants under the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Investment Program in respect of TCF variations for the 2003-04 and 2004-05 income years. It is a transitional arrangement dealing with matters announced at the time when the government put in place its direction for beyond 2005. This debate has given the opportunity for members to more widely canvass issues to do with the TCF industry, and it has been an interesting debate. Many of the contributors have come in because of the regional impact that TCF industries have on their electorates.</para></talk.start><para>I regret that the past two speakers from the government back benches have tended to use their contributions to make a dramatic rewrite of history. Certainly both the Whitlam government and the Hawke-Keating governments had a history of tariff reductions in these industries. Some could categorise it as chequered, but I believeâas you would understand, Mr Deputy Speaker Priceâthat the way in which the Hawke and Keating governments have been fitted up in this debate is rather sad. The indication that decisions to reduce tariffs during those years were made in the context of not understanding the outcomes and regional impacts that they would lead to is completely wrong. The honourable member for O'Connor especially, who was around at the time, knows better. Those speeches even forced me to review some of my comments along the way.</para><para>In the context of these types of debates about tariff reduction, most people would know that the group that I have proudly been a part of within the Labor caucus is a group that has often been critical even of Labor governments about tariff reductions but has always entered into the debates to ensure that, if there were purists who thought tariff reductions would achieve things, policies were developed around those tariff reductions that indicated an awareness of and an empathy for the regional differences that we see. Especially under John Button when he had responsibility for industry, tariff reductions in the textile, clothing and footwear industryâalong with the motor vehicle industry and the steel industryâwere made in the context of a plan that understood the dramatic effects that such decisions would have on regions and on the workers that would be displaced by those decisions. For honourable members to come in here and not recognise the nature of the decisions that were made during the 1990s is very sad.</para><para>If we look at the nature of the industry, we have seen over that decade a reduction in the numbers employed from something like 120,000 down to 60,000. These are vast numbers in total and a significant loss of employment. Looking at the regions, in the north-eastern region of Melbourneâthe municipalities of Darebin, Whittlesea, Banyule and NillumbikâI think that in that similar period, over the decade of the nineties through to the early 21st century, there was a reduction in the numbers employed in TCF industries of something like 7,000âfrom about 17,000 jobs, it went down to 10,000 jobs. Most of the people who lost their jobs were from non-English speaking backgroundsâthey were people who had migrated to Australia in the post Second World War migration surge, found employment and were very industrious in those industriesâand the vast majority were women. The simple fact is that, even with the assistance that has been made available to them, many of those people have not returned to employment. Those are the facts.</para><para>That is one of the outcomes that we have to understand. When we step back and look at these matters as part of a pure trade equation and when, in blind faith, those who worship at the altar of free trade say that we should just move forward to zero tariffs, we have to understand that, in the context of the Australian community, that has a variety of effects, especially in terms of regional impact. These are the things that policies, whether they be SIP or other assistance packages, have to recognise. We have to recognise the nature of the industry. We have to recognise that within it are many small to medium-sized enterprises. They cannot be cut out of these types of assistance packages because they do not achieve benchmarks or have the appropriate turnover.</para><para>That should be recognised in any of the ways we assist enterprises that are going forward, because there has been a dramatic change: when I talk about the number of people employed in the sector having halved over the 1990sâthe last decade of the 20th centuryâif we look at the nature of the jobs, we see how dramatic the change has been. The Minister for Science, the honourable member for Gippsland, was here earlier. I can remember the very first time that, as a young lad, I went out campaigning with my father during a state election campaign in the Latrobe Valley. With the Labor candidate, we visited a small shed in a small country town in the Latrobe Valley, where something like 20 women were busy behind sewing machines manufacturing ladies nightwear. This was out in a small regional centre. Those types of enterprises characterised the way in which TCF industries were conducted before these dramatic reforms.</para><para>In going forward, we have seen dramatic innovation. We have seen people doing things in a much smarter way. We have seen enterprises having a better knowledge of the markets they are trying to enter. The TCF industries have remained strong in Australia in 2004 because enterprising people, with skilled work forces, have been able to find their way through the maze that is the very competitive global market and have been able to protect specialist domestic markets. The honourable member for Braddon in his contribution to this debate talked about a local industry in Braddon that had started off with a niche market providing uniforms and had now developed. He also talked about the way in which this involves not only the enterprises themselves but those who supply services. He talked about some computer people, again in Braddon, who had been able to get a kick along because of their involvement in supplying services to this clothing manufacturer. That is the way in which this industry is developing. It is characteristic of this industry. We have seen many business concerns enter into competitive export markets. That is to be applauded.</para><para>The honourable member for O'Connor mentioned, by way of an aside in the rather wide-ranging contribution that he made to the debate, a leather manufacturer that got the full brunt of the WTO, when the United States administration took them to the WTO. That leather manufacturer was actually Howe Leather in the electorate of Scullin. Interestingly, it is not involved in clothing leather; it is involved in providing leather to the automotive industry. It actually had a kick along from the car plants and the assistance that was available through that. But its crime was to provide automotive leathers to United States manufacturers for top range motor vehicles. It achieved something like four per cent of the market, and that was seen as a crime that was so dramatic it was going to affect the local domestic producers in the United States. The full efforts of the US administration were brought to bear, and on a couple of occasions the Australian government and Howe Leather were dragged through the WTO process in the name of free trade.</para><para>When I have been defending my position that we should be all about fair trade, people have often used, to combat my position about fair trade, the definition that the Americans invented about free trade when they dragged us through the WTO. I still hold that, at the end of the day if we just take this purist nature of free trade, it is about tariffs and tariff protections, without looking at the whole host of other non-tariff barriers, the other matters that aboundâwhether they be the use of child labour, slave labour, environmental degradation and things that our domestic producers have to contend with that overseas competitors do notâTCF industries will not move forward. These are the aspects that we really have to look at. In the context of this debate, where we are discussing an element of the assistance that is given to TCF industries so they can see their way forward and set themselves up to prepare for the years 2005 and beyond, Labor stand here to say that there really needs to be a fair dinkum investigation of all those matters that are involved in the way in which the global competitive market operates in these industries.</para><para>We are told that everything has been fixed up with the US free trade agreement and, because we have this large market opening up to us in the United States, the barriers are to be reduced. We then get the documents, look at the fine detail and find out what will actually be happening. The government said at the time the deal appeared to be done: </para><quote><para>... tariffs on textiles, some footwear and a handful of other items will be phased out ...</para></quote><para>When we look at the full text, we see that what we were not told was that the United States had won special rules that make entry into the US harder for textiles that are produced offshore and are then manufactured. As an aside to this debate: these are the types of things that, when we look at the US free trade agreement, we really have to look at in detail, because that has to be factored into the way it affects Australian manufacturers. I have an example from a local manufacturer involved in the manufacture of sleeping bags. He was concerned about the way the tariff operated on materials but did not flow through to him as a manufacturer. The other concern he had was the lack of protection of intellectual property. In fact, this firm found that, even though it was able to supply new models of sleeping bags with different thermal qualitiesâit was quite an interesting niche market and the company came to have pretty good relationships with major retailersâwithin the season overseas manufacturers were copying its product. There was no protection for the developments they made of their products or for the intellectual property involved in the product. Labor believes that the way in which things like the filching of intellectual property affects our manufacturers should be investigated.</para><para>The other aspect of this debate, and I have touched upon it, is the difficulties found by people who, through the restructure, have lost their jobs. I have described the background and nature of the people in my local area and have said that they are predominantly first generation migrants who have been fortunate enough in their time in Australia to be associated with the one type of industry. They are now being asked to retrain and go into other concerns. This requires a lot of effort and a lot of government assistance. That is not something we can walk away from. In modern times people are likely to have a change of career on two or three occasions. These people will need a great deal of assistance to tackle the retraining involved, and they deserve it. For these people, the idea of working through to the age of 65 or 70 is pie in the sky unless they get assistance. We have to understand that there is not a `one size fits all' way to assist people in the work force who are going through change or who have come out of the work force and are looking for a change of direction. These are important aspects that need to be dealt with. We need to do everything in our power to ensure that those people, do not pay the price for some other success that we are supposedly seeing because we have embarked upon this route of free trade.</para><para>This is an important sector. The achievements that can be made in bilateral agreements are not as great as those that can perhaps be achieved through multilateral agreements. If we look at those countries involved in the bulk and major turnover areas of the TCF industries, many of them are developing countries and are outside the scope of the likely countries Australia is going to have bilateral agreements with. We should not, by going down the path of having bilateral agreements with a number of countries, turn our backs on the continuing work that has to be done in the multilateral forums. That is why, in these particular industries, it is very important with the multilateral forums to look at the issues of labour standards and environmental standards and the way in which they can give a free kick to some of our competitors. It is most important that we do not turn our backs on it.</para><para>The last matter I wish to cover is something I touched on earlier. It involves the development of the present position that this government has in relation to the SIP. There have been a number of concerns raised with me by smaller businessesâsometimes these were medium businesses but because of disappearing work forces they have become smaller, but that is not the issueâthat have created niche markets for themselves and are in there competing. One, for instance, is the sole remaining manufacturer of children's footwear. The people that continue at that company have said that one of the things that frustrated them was that, in the past, the SIP has really been aimed at larger concerns. They felt they were really cut out of eligibility for the SIP and did not have the ability to work up proper proposals under the SIP, but they still had to deal with the same types of tariff drops.</para><para>The thing they did suggest, and one of the things they found most useful to them because of their size, was assistance with marketing programs so that they could actually get out and make sure that people knew they existedâso that people knew, for instance, that there was an existing manufacturer of children's footwear. As I understand it, in the past that has not been permissible. I am not sure, from my reading of it, whether anything in this bill means that that has changed. There is talk of ancillary things that are eligible for SIP, but I am not sure that that is possible. I think that is something that is worthwhile. This is an example of a small company that really has changed its direction. It has made sure that it has developed a product to cater for something that is not being catered for by other domestic manufacturers. It is worthy of our continuing support to ensure that it goes forward. I think that everybody on both sides of the House has agreed that there are many TCF concerns that are innovative, successful and deserving of our support. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>26227</page.no><name role="metadata">McArthur, Stewart, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McARTHUR</name><name.id>VH4</name.id><electorate>Corangamite</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe <inline ref="R1983">Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Investment Program Amendment Bill 2004</inline> brings to a conclusion the long tariff debate. Hopefully, the members of the opposition will finally agree to the levels of tariff that the government has proposed, and the strategic investment program will assist in reaching this final conclusion. I acknowledge the member for Scullin for his thoughtful remarks on the whole tariff debate. He has moved light-years from his former position. I know that the member for Scullin, in his earlier considerations, would have been of a high-tariff disposition, and acknowledge that the member for Scullin has seen, at the coalface, the great number of jobs that have been lost in the TCF industries in his electorate. I concede the point that the vast number of total jobs lost is quite disturbing in terms of the human impact. A number of those industries did decline and finally went out of existence. He makes the comment that the Hawke and Keating governments were very up front in tariff reductions. I concede that point. But he did say that they had a chequered history in bringing about tariff reductions. That is because, on the odd occasion, they wavered from the truth when it suited the political wind.</para></talk.start><para>I also notice in the House the member for Corio. He is a man of great knowledge on tariff reduction because he advised Senator Button on the way in which to approach tariffs in the car industry and the TCF industriesâI am sorry that the member for Corio is leaving the chamber; it is unusual that he does not interject and misrepresent me on this matterâand it should be on the public record that the member for Corio was an advocate for lower tariffs, to be fair to him, in his time as adviser to Senator Button. We now see the good outcomes of these lower tariff regimes in the car industry and the TCF industries. So the member for Corio leaves in good spirit, knowing that the member for Corangamite has won this battle and that we do have lower tariff regimes in the car industry and the TCF industries.</para><para>The member for Scullin quite rightly makes some comment on Howe Leather. Howe Leather, having done a good job in penetrating the US market, was then somewhat assailed by the US administration, under the WTO, on unfair practice. I do concede the point of the member for Scullin that, Howe Leather having done a good job, the might of the US administration, using the WTO laws, was able to bring about an unfair trading proposition. That is as I understand it from Howe Leather.</para><para>In terms of the tariff debate, I report, as I did in October, that a delegation from the City of Geelong, led by the mayor and other senior people from the TCF industries, came to put a proposition to Minister Macfarlane. They were very well received by Minister Macfarlane. Those people put the argument that the TCF industries in Geelong would be greatly affected by the lower tariff regime. Obviously, I did not agree with that general principle, but I carefully understood the difficulties facing the TCF industry in Geelong, in the seat of Scullin and in some of those other regional areas in which the TCF industries are major employers.</para><para>The local firms that were part of the delegation included the Australian Bluey Company, which is just a small company led by Mr Peter Howard. They have 18 workers, are competing in a niche market and are doing their best to remain profitable. I wish them well. I hope they can continue to produce their niche product. They sell their Bluey jackets to companies in short order and they are of high quality. They have done well. Godfrey Hirst, the carpet manufacturer, employing 1,200 personnel in Geelong, has again done remarkably well against international competition, from New Zealand and elsewhere. As to Candy Footwear, I was most disappointed that the pressure on the footwear industry was such that that company was forced to close. I was full of admiration for their innovative approaches and the way in which they handled their people. It was a great disappointment to all of us in Geelong that Candy Footwear closed. Melba Industries, who I have not seen in recent times, have done a good job re-establishing themselves in Geelong. Hopefully, they have been seeking export markets. They are at the stage, as I understand it, of being profitable.

MP</name><name role="display">Mr McARTHUR</name></talker><para>âThe table demonstrates the reduction of TCF tariffs in various areas. The key part of this reduction is that the reduction will be complete by 2015. Even the shadow minister at the table could understand that that is almost 10 years awayâor 10 years and a bitâso there is plenty of time for a number of these TCF industries to make the adjustments and cope with the obvious changes that some TCF reductions could bring about.</para></talk.start></continue><para>If you look at the clothing and finished textiles area, it has a high labour content. It had a 25 per cent tariff in 2000. It will have a 17 per cent tariff in 2005, and by 2015âlike all the other itemsâit will be down to five per cent. There is a similar regime for cotton: 15 per cent in 2000, 10 per cent in 2005 and down to five per cent in 2010. Then you have carpet, which was 15 per cent in 2000, will be 10 per cent in 2005 and will go down to five per cent. Footwear is now 15 per cent and will go down to five per cent. Footwear parts will go from 10 per cent down to five per cent. The key issue is that by 2015 all TCF items will be almost at the international position of five per cent tariffs.</para><para>The bill before the House allows for this 10-year adjustment to bring about some help to those firms and employees who have been participating in the TCF industries. As I said on the previous occasion I spoke on this, the difficulty facing the TCF industries, which the member for Scullin and the member for Corio fully understand, is that the textile industry here in Australia, with its high labour content, is competing with low-wage countries. It is approximately $20 an hour in Australia for all-up costs, and that is competing with some of the low-wage countries where it is $1.50 an hour. It is very difficultâdisregarding the tariff regimeâfor those companies in Australia to compete in regard to high-labour-content goods such as shirts, running shoes and other such items, which move around the world of the low-wage countries.</para><para>Obviously, the third important factor is the exchange rates. The appreciating dollar has not been helpful to the farmers but it has made a difference to the importers of yarn and material. The changing exchange rate can have a much greater impact than the tariff regime. That has been debated, and I think even those people in the TCF industries understand quite clearly that in the longer run the tariff regimeâbe it 40 per cent, 200 per cent or 15 per centâis of less significance than the exchange rates, which have had such an impact on the exporting industries, such as mining and agriculture, over the last three months, especially in relation to the US dollar.</para><para>Given that scenario, as I said in my opening remarks this is the final chapter of a tariff debate which has been ongoing over the past 40 years. I make the observation that in the car industry the reduction in tariffs has been a major boost to that now competitive industry. The industry is now competitive; it employs 54,000 people and has sold a record 820,000 units here in Australia. The four major car-manufacturing assembly plants are now moving towards profitability. Their innovation, technology and quality is well beyond what we would have envisaged some 10 years ago. I suggest that the reduction in tariffs has been a contributing factor to the competitive nature of the car industry worldwide.</para><para>We can look at the SIP scheme and the government's announcement last year that there would be $747 million worth of assistance to the TCF industry over the next 10 years. The government will set up a program of 10 years duration, putting approximately $74 million each year into the industry to assist it. The grants will be investment grants of a capital nature: research and development grants, matching value added grants, grants for second-hand equipment, and special miscellaneous grants for restructuring in TCF-dependent communitiesâparticularly in Geelong and the regional communities of Bendigo, Wangaratta and Ballarat. The government has taken a human and compassionate view of the changes that are taking place in the TCF industries and has tried to bring about some of this targeted assistance to those industries to ensure that these quite massive changes in one or two of the industries can be handled in a fairly reasonable manner.</para><para>The SIP scheme, as it has come to be known, is designed to assist with significant investment to improve operating efficiencies and lower inventory costs. That is obviously relevant to the TCF industry, and if we can do those things then we can compete, in some of these industries, with the rest of the world. In support of the SIP scheme, a submission was made to the Productivity Commission was made by the Technical Textile and Nonwoven Association, and what they had to say is interesting. They talked about the important role innovation plays in sustaining a globally competitive industry. This specifically referred to skill development and the generation of new ideas through research. They understood that for any of the TCF industries to be competitive they would need to develop research and competitive skills. They also said:</para><quote><para>SIP has been a considerable incentive and catalyst for the purchase of capital equipment and parallel research and development activities in a quest to develop new productsâ</para></quote><para>and to enhance existing products and improve production processes. So it is important that the capital component of some of these more capitally intensive industries relative to the human input has been encouraged by the SIP scheme. In addition, the TCFL strategic plan, released in June 2002, had this to say:</para><quote><para>Australia has a leading role already in this sector due to a range of performance and lifestyle based new products. This is also the supply chain which has the most potential for the export of both products and intellectual property.</para></quote><para>So you can see that even some of the people in the TCF industries have been looking forward rather than backward, and that is a most encouraging approach. We talked about Howe Leather in earlier remarks. The Association of Leather Industries had this to say to the Productivity Commission:</para><quote><para>The SIP scheme has been fundamental to the development of the leather industry ... with the appropriate nurturing a significant world class industry will develop.</para></quote><para>They also said:</para><quote><para>The leather industry's export performance and the investment planned over the remainder of the SIP scheme indicates that new leather capacity is replacing outdated capabilities designed to satisfy a largely domestic manufacturing base of clients.</para></quote><para>The industry supports the tariff pause and the SIP, arguing that they have provided:</para><quote><para>... a conducive environment for industry strategies:</para><para>- investment</para><para>- innovation</para><para>- export ...</para></quote><para>So there we have it. The leather industry has been a leader in bringing about a changeâso much so that it raised the ire of the American leather industry because it proved that it was so good. With some strategic investmentânot too muchâwe can help some of these programs.</para><para>As I have said, the bill relates to the Strategic Investment Program covering the financial years 2003-04 and 2004-05. It proposes special assistance for a set period of time so that the industries might have a greater opportunity to compete internationally beyond 2005. In line with the rules of the WTO, the overall assistance to an individual firm is limited to five per cent of its total sales of eligible products in the previous 12 months. I think the scheme is acting responsibly in helping some of those industriesâand I note that the member at the table, the member for Hunter, who made a good contribution earlier in the evening, understands some of these things, although he might not agree with them. The important thing provided by the SIP is investment grants for plant and equipment so that those firms facing the greatest adjustment difficulties because of tariff and other issues will get some assistance in an attempt to handle these changing times. As I have said on a number of occasions, it is not the tariff argument that is the key; it is the changing environment both here in Australia and internationally that the TCF industries have to handle.</para><para>The government challenges the opposition and the spokesperson at the table to tell us their position on industry assistance. Why do they want to have a review of the Strategic Investment Program? Why don't they accept it as it now stands? The money will be available. As usual, the Labor Party want to have two bob each way. They want to say that they are in favour of tariff reductions. The member for Scullin has said that he is now converted to that. I am not sure where the member for Braddon is sitting. He might be half in favour and half notâwe are not sure about that. The government have put forward a clear program. The program is designed such that, by 2015, tariffs in the TCF industries will be of the order of five per cent. The government will cushion the industry through to that time with an investment of over $700 million, and there will be a program that everyone in the industry will understand. It will be targeted to those companies who are making the proper decisions, investing wisely and attempting to compete in the industries.</para><para>I hope that the opposition will support this program in the longer termâeven those members like the member for Braddon and the member for Scullin, who have some very difficult problems in their own electorates. In the longer term, Australia needs to be world competitive and needs to make sure that, in matters relating to the WTO and the free trade agreement with America, it has its own backyard in order and can say that it does not protect any of the industries here in Australia. At the moment, we cannot say that with absolute certainty because there still remain elements of protection in the automobile industry and the TCF industries. Hopefully, by 2015 we will have reached a conclusion on this major debate in Australia. Hopefully, we will be internationally competitive, we will not have a tariff barrier and we can approach other countries on the issue of free trade in an honest and forthright manner so that we can competeâand those industries that remain will be innovative, producing items that they can sell on the world market and developing a niche market. I commend the Minister for Trade for the way in which he sorted through these propositions. I commend the bill and the general philosophic thrust behind the proposition put forward by the government.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>26232</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Brendan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR</name><name.id>00AN3</name.id><electorate>Burke</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe <inline ref="R1983">Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Investment Program Amendment Bill 2004</inline> is limited in its benefits for the industries to which it refers. The purpose of this bill is to provide an alternative value-adding cap for the leather and technical textile firms in the final two years of the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Investment Program, known as SIP. For that reason, the Labor Party supports the bill. To all intents and purposes, the bill is of benefit to the industry. It is a rearrangement of the moneys that have been targeted for the industries to cope with the changes that are occurring and, indeed, to anticipate the adverse effects of the tariff cuts announced by the Productivity Commission last year, which were embraced by the Howard government later that year, in order to commence the further tariff cut from 1 January 2005.</para></talk.start><para>I have to say that that is where the government and the opposition have a fundamental difference. We are not of the view that the tariff cut that has been recommended by the Productivity Commission should occur without a proper review. I think it is really important for the member for Corangamite, the member for Indi and every other member on the other side of the chamber who contributed to this debate to be well aware and understand that tariff cuts are not an end unto themselves. There should be no belief by any member of the chamber that tariff cuts in themselves are a good thing. The Labor Party's position to have a review before considering such a cut is therefore a preferred option in this area. It is important to note, however, that the government has commented on the need to cut tariffs. Indeed, it has asserted the view that tariff cuts in almost all circumstances would provide innovation, flexibility and productivity. That is not always the case. There is no point cutting tariffs to attempt to make an industry innovative and more flexible if it leads to fundamental job losses without improvements to those other dimensions of the industry. I think a review will provide an opportunity for us to properly assess whether a tariff cut would be of benefit to the textile, clothing and footwear industries.</para><para>I think it might have been in 1987 that the TCF industry plan was announced by the then minister, Minister Button. That became known as the Button plan. Those cuts commenced some time thereafter. Whilst it has been lauded by members on both sides of this chamber since that time, there is no doubt there were some adverse effects on many communities in this country as a result of those tariff cuts. Whilst it is probably fair to say that the proposed cuts that commenced in the late 1980s and early 1990s did bring about efficiencies and indeed brought about the industry's focus on innovation and technological change in many instances, that did not always look after those employees who found themselves on the scrap heap as a result of those tariff cuts. It is fair to say that the tariff cuts proposed for 1 January 2005 are in no way comparable to those which occurred 15 years or more ago, but in hindsight there should have been a broader assessment about how and when tariff cuts should have taken placeâif indeed at all.</para><para>I am mindful that in private members' business this afternoon we celebrated International Women's Day. It is therefore important for us to reflect upon the many thousands of women workers in these industries who would be affected by a tariff cut commencing 1 January 2005. They are the lowest paid workers in this country and, unfortunately, in many instances, are less likely to find gainful and full employment than others in this country. So when we look at assessing the benefits to an industry or industries by bringing about tariff cuts, we should also look at those adverse consequences and then see whether we can balance them and whether it would be a net gain or net loss to the nation if we were to go down the path of tariff cuts. If we were to choose the path of tariff cuts then it seems to me that we have to have very concrete proposals to support those employees who would be sacked, who would lose their jobs as a result of the cuts in tariffs.</para><para>The structural adjustment fund, as it is now calledâwhich is, I suppose, a limited version of Labor's Labour Adjustment Program in the early 1990sâis just not enough. Some $50 million over 10 years is not going to be enough to provide for the skills and support that will be needed by those employees who lose their jobs as a result of tariff cuts or indeed as a result of competing in global markets. I would certainly suggest that, in considering a review, the government should consider more appropriate means of support for skill acquisition and other ways to provide vocational training in finding new employment so that they can continue to be productive citizens of this country. It seems to me to be ludicrous that we will have a policy that will reduce employment levels in this country in given industries which will then have those retrenched employees on social security benefits, not being adequately looked after.</para><para>This government and earlier Labor governments have not always assessed the net adverse costs that occur as a result of structural change against the benefits that arise. So there has to be some dispassionate analysis to measure the gains and the costs. I do not think that has been done to date. In this debate government members have stood up and argued that tariff cuts are good for this country and so should commence from 1 January 2005, without putting to us any evidential material why it is deemed to be a good thing. I do not think there has been any evidence put by this government this eveningâor indeed before todayâto illustrate where the benefits will eventuate. In all of the speeches from government members this evening, not one government member has provided decent evidence to suggest that tariff cuts will lead to a better country or increased employment or that they will lead to saving industries. That has not been put forward. All that has been put forward are assertions that tariff cuts are good and that we must therefore continue down that path. I do not think that is always the case, and therefore it is incumbent on those who advocate change to provide answers as to why change would be a good thing. That has not been done to date.</para><para>Only last Friday the Prime Minister visited the sugar seats, as they are called, in North Queensland. I think it was quite right, too, to see the Prime Minister go to those electorates where those in the sugar industry feel so badly let down by this government, which has frozen them out of any of the components of the free trade agreement between Australia and the United States being proposed by this government. It is only reasonable that the Prime Minister would front up and speak with these people.</para><para>However, I have yet to see the Prime Minister sit down with workers in the clothing trade or workers in the textile industry, except for maybe at his brother's company. I think his brother's company was the only company where the government provided all of the redundancy payments to the employees. National Textiles, I think it was called. The only company ever to be provided with a full government payout on redundancies was that of the Prime Minister's brother. Leaving that aside, I do not think he has spent a moment with outworkers in the clothing industry, talking to those womenâpredominantly migrant womenâabout concerns he might have for them if they lose their jobs as a result of his proposed tariff cut on 1 January 2005. I have not seen the Prime Minister show any regard for those employees. It compares unfavourably, I have to say, with his reflex to immediately travel to the sugar seats in northern Queensland, such as Hinkler and other electorates, to talk to the sugar industry representativesâas I think he should have. I do not recall an occasion on which he has spoken to the lowest paid women workers of this countryâoutworkers in the clothing and textile industries. I think it is a shame and that the Prime Minister should consider it.</para><para>If he were to do that and if the frontbench members responsible for those areas were also to visit the lowest paid workers in this country more often, whilst I might not agree with them I might believe that the motives behind some of the proposed tariff cuts were genuine and that they were looking out for the employees of those industries. I have to say, given the industrial relations agenda of this government, given its anti-worker rhetoric, it is very hard for me to consider that it has any sympathy whatsoever for the now 70,000 employees who work in these industries. As the member for Scullin indicated, in a 15-year time frame or thereabouts there has been a loss of about 50,000âif not nearly 60,000âemployees from these industries. That has occurred for a variety of reasons. However, I think it is time to take stock. It is time to accept that tariff cuts are not an end in themselves. I think it is time that, as this government considers how to assist the sugar industry, it looks to review the way in which it deals with the TCF industries and looks after the many employers and employees that reside in my electorate of Burke and in the new electorate of Gorton, in which I am now endorsed as the Labor candidate. In those areas there are many thousands of employees working in these industries, and I am most concerned that their voices are not being heard.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>26234</page.no><name role="metadata">Organ, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ORGAN</name><name.id>BNL</name.id><electorate>Cunningham</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to support the <inline ref="R1983">Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Investment Program Amendment Bill 2004</inline>. However, that support is limited. In November 2003 the government announced a $747 million assistance package for the textile, clothing and footwear industries. This announcement followed the release of the Productivity Commission's final report, entitled <inline font-style="italic">Review of T</inline><inline font-style="italic">CF a</inline><inline font-style="italic">ssistance</inline>, in July 2003. Within that report, we find that some 4.6 per cent of total TCF employment in New South Wales is located in the Illawarra region. In the past that percentage was larger, with many postwar migrants to the Illawarra and to my seat of Cunninghamâespecially womenâfinding employment within the sector in the decades from the 1950s through to the 1980s. I know thatâmy mother, my sister, my wife and many friends and family worked in the industry during that period, for firms such as King Gee, Fidels, Bulli Spinners and Bruck.</para></talk.start><para>Unfortunately, the number of clothing factories in the Illawarra has been greatly reduced since the late 1980s, due largely to the reduction in the tariff protection regime and the swamping of local markets by cheaper, overseas manufactured material. As part of last year's assistance package the government announced tariff reductions and the extension of the current TCF Strategic Investment Program, the SIP, beyond 2005. This new package, as we have heard from previous speakers, will include $747 million over the next 10 years and a five-year tariff pause from 2005. It will, according to the government, provide assistance for firms and workers in the TCF industry and allow time for the industry to adjust to a lower tariff environment. It will, for example, provide just $50 million for a 10-year structural adjustment program to assist displaced workers and $600 million to provide two types of grant supporting investment and innovation in the post-2005 SIP.</para><para>The textile, footwear and clothing sector is a $9 billion industry. It won this $747 million assistance package to cushion the blow of substantial job losses that will stem from the new tariff cuts. Federal cabinet decided to cut tariffs on most TCF products to five per cent in 2010, except for clothing and some finished textiles, which will retain tariffs of 10 per cent until 2015. The tariff cuts are expected to accelerate the number of jobs lost Australia wide in the 60,000-strong TCF work force, much of which is based in NSW and Victoria. Tariffs in the TCF sector are already legislated to fall in 2005, from 25 per cent to 17.5 per cent for clothing and finished textiles, from 15 per cent to 10 per cent for carpets and footwear, and from 10 per cent to five per cent for sleeping-bags, table linen and footwear parts. The new assistance scheme will effectively halve the value of assistance under the existing Strategic Investment Program, which provided $678 million over a five-year period.</para><para>It is quite clear that the government has largely chosen to turn its back on the industry, to wind it down. Comments made by a government adviser last year and quoted in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review </inline>provide insight into the government's perspective on the future of the industry. This must cause workers in the sector some alarm. Speaking about the TCF industry, the government adviser said:</para><quote><para>As with cars, the government's aim is to withdraw from the sector by 2015, and to have the industry standing on its own ... We have to accept ... that even if we maintained tariff protection, job losses in the traditional areas of this sector will continue to fall.</para></quote><para>On 12 August last year I met a delegation of TCF workers in my Parliament House office. They were quite clear about the impact of the government's agenda on their industry, on present and future job prospects, on the present skills shortages and on declining work conditions due to deunionisation. The Secretary of the Victorian branch of the Textile Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia, Ms Michele O'Neil, recently stated that the new plan will result in major job losses. She said, `The government is slashing assistance to the TCF sector and John Howard is turning his back on the low paid and rural and regional workers.' She then said, `The effect of this decision, which is clearly flawed and ideologically driven, is that we are likely to see a further 30,000 jobs lost by 2010.'</para><para>Ms O'Neil said that modelling by the Productivity Commission had shown that the net cost of the present assistance to taxpayers was about 75c a year to every Australian. She went on, `We say that for the cost of a mobile phone call the government is making a decision to decimate an industry which employs tens of thousands of vulnerable workers.' And where are the replacement jobs? Where will these people find new and continuing employment, especially those mature workers who have acquired decades' worth of specialised skills in the industryâskills which may not necessarily be easily transferred?</para><para>As the name suggests, the textile, clothing and footwear industry is centred upon the manufacture of soft materials, particularly clothing and furnishings. The Productivity Commission described the activities of the TCF industry as including the:</para><quote><para>... early stage processing of leather and natural fibres; the production of textiles; the transformation of leather, yarns and textiles into clothing and footwear, carpets and other fabric products for the home and office; and `technical' textiles such as shade cloth, medical and sanitary products, filtration products and insulation materials.</para></quote><para>The Australian TCF sector contains 5,000 firms at present that generate a turnover of $9 billion. In the last decade the Australian TCF industry has undergone massive change. Specifically, jobs have been shed at an enormous rate, with imports increasing solidly and exports now making up over $1 billion worth of the sector's activity. The Textile Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia, the TCFUA, argues that the vast majority of job losses in the industry were jobs previously held by women. The TCFUA points out, `Since 1985, female jobs have fallen from 67,000 to 30,000 in 2002, with male jobs falling at a much slower level from 37,000 to 30,000 in the same period.' The fact that many of these workers are also older and from a non-English-speaking background contributes to their difficulty of finding new employment. The Productivity Commission estimates that there are 25,000 additional jobs in the TCF sector comprising outworkers who mainly produce clothing. From this summary, it is clear that the TCF sector in Australia has undergone massive and recent change and that many of the employees who work in the industry work from home in unregulated conditions.</para><para>Globally, the TCF industry has also changed. In essence, there has been an expansion of employment in Asia with a corresponding decrease of employment in the more industrially advanced countries, particularly in Europe, North America and Oceania, as well as in Africa. The International Labour Organisation estimates that worldwide there were around 30 million TCF employees in 2000. Perhaps not surprisingly, growth in Asian TCF employment correlates with the exceptionally low wage costs of less than US70c per hour that countries such as Indonesia, Bangladesh and China can offer.</para><para>Given that labour costs are cited as accounting for 60 per cent of clothing production costs, it is unsurprising that capital has relocated from the developed countries to the developing countries. It is clear that the global TCF industry has responded to competitive pressure by relocating to parts of the world where it can minimise its production costs. Since Australia is not one of these ultra low labour cost countries, it is expected that further reduction in the domestic industry will occur. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade states that tariffs on textiles, some footwear and `a handful of other items' will be phased out by 2015. This is despite the thousands of jobs already lost in the textile, clothing and footwear industry.</para><para>The rolling reductions in tariffs for the TCF industry began under the Hawke Labor government. The search for higher profits has resulted in many Australian based companies moving all or part of their production offshore and relying increasingly on employees working in their homes. The Greens do not assume that all companies using clothing and textile outworkers intend to exploit these employees, but there is no shortage of evidence of gross exploitation of many outworkers in this country. This happens because large corporations put a distance between themselves and the workers who produce the goods they sell.</para><para>It is not possible any longer for corporations to claim ignorance of the poor working conditions, unsafe hours of work and appallingly low rates of pay that TCF workers endure. Their circumstances have been exposed by numerous parliamentary inquiries at federal and state levels for more than a decade now. There are estimated to be 330,000 home based workers in Australia alone. Most TCF outworkers are women who have migrated to Australia from non-English-speaking countries.</para><para>A study of Victorian home based workers conducted by Christina Cregan of the University of Melbourne's Department of Management in 2001 found that the average pay rate was a mere $3.60 an hour, although some people were paid less than $1 an hour for piecework. This compares with the federal minimum hourly rate of $11.80. The women surveyed worked from three to 19 hours a day, and 62 per cent of them worked seven days a week. In many cases, their families relied on their income to meet essential expenses and their partners and children helped to complete their work. There were reports of home workers being paid $3 for an item of clothing that later retailed for $50 or even $100. These are not even subsistence wages, and it is outrageous that such a system is allowed to operate in this country.</para><para>Outworkers are not some incidental part of the TCF industry in Australia. In 1996 the Senate Economics References Committee report concluded that:</para><quote><para>Outworking is now so prevalent that it is not just a characteristic of the industry, the entire industry is structured around it.</para></quote><para>The TCF Union estimates that up to three-quarters of companies in the industry in Victoria have the majority of their production performed in private homes. Research conducted by the union revealed that, in a number of cases, companies employing around six factory workers each employed over 200 outworkers.</para><para>The government's latest tariff decision is likely to further entrench outworkers as the core work force in the industry by making it more difficult for Australian based companies to compete with imports. The latest round of tariff reductions comes into effect on 1 January 2005. Tariffs for all segments of the textiles, clothing and footwear industry will be reduced to five per cent by 2015.</para><para>In addition, the government has halved the amount of financial assistance to the industry under the strategic investment program, providing, as I said earlier, $747 million over 10 years, compared with the current level of $678 million over five years. This is an industry that plays an important role in the lives of many regional communities and it has lost one-third of its work force in the past 10 years. The loss of TCF jobs in the Illawarra over the last few decades has been especially noticeable. The land upon which those factories were once located has almost invariably been turned into residential housing estates, thereby reducing forever the amount of employment-generating lands in electorates such as Cunningham, making it all the more difficult for the creation of long-term sustainable job opportunities into the future. One Victorian study has found that one-third of TCF workers who lost jobs as a result of restructuring were never employed again. Many others end up in marginal jobs or itinerant work. This is a dreadful loss of skills for the nation and a tragedy for the people involved. This is the social and economic context in which the parliament is considering this bill.</para><para>The member for Indi, in an earlier speech, presented a view of the TCF industry which made me question whether she was in fact talking about the Australian industry. She told us: </para><quote><para>... the Howard government has been the TCF industry's greatest friend.</para></quote><para>The workers I have spoken to do not see it that way. The member for Indi also told us that a tariff:</para><quote><para>... does not create and does not protect a single job ...</para></quote><para>and that this package will provide:</para><quote><para>... certainty and innovation for the industry.</para></quote><para>These comments do not equate with the information provided to me or with the view of workers and unions. These assertions are not guaranteed and nor is the future of the industry. The Productivity Commission report from last year clearly stated the inevitably of more firm closures. It concluded in one of its key points:</para><quote><para>... there is little that can or ... should be done to stop further adjustment out of labour intensive standardised TCF production in Australia. Rather, the policy focus should be on facilitating and supporting the adjustment process.</para></quote><para>The Greens are opposed to the withdrawal of government support to this sector. The exploitation of workers throughout the globe should not be condoned by our nation and we should not bow to international pressures with regard to the decline of workers' rights and conditions in the name of so-called trade liberalisation. We support the assistance of workers in this sector, not their betrayal. In summary, I will not vote against this bill as it will pledge some support to the industry. However, the Greens do not support the path that this government is treading with regard to this sector.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>26238</page.no><name role="metadata">Zahra, Christian, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ZAHRA</name><name.id>84H</name.id><electorate>McMillan</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWith regard to the <inline ref="R1983">Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Investment Program Amendment Bill 2004</inline>, when talking about the textile, clothing and footwear industry it is important not to lose track of the most important thing about the textile, clothing and footwear industry in Australia: the people who work in it. They are a pretty remarkable bunch of people in my experience. We are fortunate in the Latrobe Valley to have been home to the textile, clothing and footwear sector for a long time. We have seen a number of these important employers in our region close over the course of the last 10 years in particular. This has had an enormous impact on the Latrobe Valley. In talking about that impact today, it is important that we do not consider the industry in just a negative context. We should understand and recognise how important this industry has been to Australiaâto our cultural identity and in providing opportunities for people from a wide range of backgrounds. So often these people have come to Australia as new migrants.</para></talk.start><para>In the Latrobe Valley, I used to ride past the Kaiser clothing factory on my way to school. The factory used to employ a couple of hundred people. Those people had a good, reliable income and were able to provide for their families. They worked hard, produced a good product and were able to make a great contribution to the life of the Latrobe Valley. The same could be said of a number of other important textile, clothing and footwear employers across the Latrobe Valley district. We had a similar mill in Churchill. In Moe, we have only recently seen the sad closure of Rocklea Spinning Mills, which was a yarn producer that operated in Moe for quite some time. In each of those closures a lot has been lost in terms of the work opportunities that the textile, clothing and footwear industry has provided in our district.</para><para>In my contribution today, I want to talk about how important the work that those people did was to the Latrobe Valley and how important that industry was in our region. It has often been said that the Latrobe Valley is a place where people were practising multiculturalism long before it became a term that was commonly used by people in Australian parliaments. The situation was made a lot easier for migrants coming to the Latrobe Valley all those years ago when people had the opportunity to work in industries which were important to our district, like the textile, clothing and footwear industry.</para><para>A short while ago, some people that I had caught up with went for a tour with me to Trades Hall in Victoria, where they had an open day. We met a woman there who had written a song about the Latrobe Valley and working in a clothing factory. She had moved from the Latrobe Valley some 15 or 20 years ago, but she always remembers that as a defining experience in her working life. This is an important part of what the textile, clothing and footwear industry has meant to people. It is an industry which has brought people together. People from different parts of the world have been able to come together, make great friendships and develop great relationships. Often they have been able to use the textile, clothing and footwear industry as their entry into the work force.</para><para>In talking about the textile, clothing and footwear sector today, it is important to recognise its historical significance to so many people in Australia and the important role it has played in defining Australian working life. We have been saddened in the electorate of McMillan to have seen so many textile, clothing and footwear jobs lost over the last 10 years. The last decade has been a hard time for us in the Latrobe Valley, as you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, being a fellow Victorian. Often, as has been mentioned by previous speakers, the people who have lost their jobs in the textile, clothing and footwear sector have been unable to get jobs elsewhere. So often the people who lost their jobs in this sector lived in country districts, because it is an industry which is heavily based around rural and regional areas. Often they were people who did not have any formal qualifications beyond their technical trade, and we need to be conscious of this when we make policy determinations in this area. We need to have regard for the human impact of the decisions that we make here in this parliament.</para><para>Like you, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, I have always been very strong on the idea of value adding. It is so important that we value add to our natural resources and that we are not just content to produce the raw commodities and export them overseas. Australia's history is a story of how we have had great natural advantages in terms of the raw product here in Australia but we have been too content to ship it away and have someone else process it and add the value to it. For too long, people have not been prepared to have a fair dinkum look at the textile, clothing and footwear industry. A lot of people mistakenly have the view that the textile, clothing and footwear industry is an old industry without a future. It is certainly true to say that it is an industry which has been around for a long time in the Australian context, but to describe it as an old, crumbling and dying industry which does not have a future at all is inaccurate and has too often characterised commentary in relation to this important industry sector. </para><para>People often have the wrong idea about manufacturing in this country. They talk about manufacturing as being part of the old economy. I would say that those people who use those words to describe manufacturing in Australia have not been to a factory recently. You only need to go to one of the many factories in my electorate to see first hand why it is that manufacturingâand in particular the new manufacturing plants which have been built in the last 10 years in Australiaâis an enormous part of our country's future. </para><para>National Foods at Morwell has built a new factory in the last six or seven years, and it is a great example of modern manufacturing. People who are employed there need to be very highly skilled in order to conduct their work. It used to be that you needed a fair bit of brawn to work in a dairy factory, a fair bit of muscle to be able to carry it off, as people here who might have visited them years ago would appreciate. Nowadays, it is heavily automated and a high amount of technical expertise is required by people to work in those areas. You only need to look at the Bonlac Foods factory in Darnhum, West Gippsland, which employs a large number of people. A large number of jobs are associated with new manufacturing, which is a great part of the future in West Gippsland and other country districts when we talk about the manufacturing base in those regions. So value adding is important. It is important when we talk about the future of manufacturingâand we appreciate that it does have a high-tech future; it does have a positive future for Australiaâthat we do not forget about the textile, clothing and footwear sector. </para><para>We were all very pleased when the government introduced the TCF Strategic Investment Program years ago because we thought that finally something was being done by the government to address this important issue. The concern that I had at the time, and which other people expressed as well, was that there did not seem to be much of an underlying strategy associated with this program, even though it was called the strategic investment program. It was all about basing the amount of government support on applications which were received from individual companies. In this way, it departed from a range of industry initiatives which had been introduced by Commonwealth governments over the years, which aimed to strategically position an industry for the future. </para><para>My concern at the timeâand I still have this concernâwas that the government missed an historic opportunity to reposition the textile, clothing and footwear industry in Australia. Instead, it set up a scheme whereby the people who received the benefits were those people who spent the investment dollar in their businesses or industries and then applied. Whether or not it was a good decision was never considered a part of the government criteria for providing that support. I have got some concerns in relation to that general approach being taken by governments, whether state or federal, but I think in this particular initiative it has proved not to be a great success.</para><para>The one thing about the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Investment Program is that it was a good program inasmuch as it was the only program going. I think this is how many people in the industry felt. It was the only show in town. It was the only opportunity for people to have any access at all to any sort of government program to support their industry through change and transition. I think that orientation of the program has been a weakness, and the amount of time it takes the federal government to process people's claims in relation to this program has been a weakness as well.</para><para>We have seen the situation, as I mentioned before, where Rocklea Spinning Mills in my electorate has closed over the last several months. Nearly 200 people had been employed in that mill over the years and they are now out of work. This has had an effect on the town. It has had an effect on all of the Latrobe Valley. People are still getting over the closure of that mill. In the end, after it had been whittled down and after some uncertainty in relation to its future, I think 60 or so people were put out of work by that final decision of the voluntary administrator and the receiver-manager to shut the mill down</para><para>The concern that I had after speaking to the people involved at both ends of the administration of that company was that this program set up by the government in relation to the textile, clothing and footwear industry was not really much help to that company during this process. I understand that it is the government's position that they have never received a claim from that company in relation to this program. I understand from speaking to the people involved that that is not correct. I think the situation at Rocklea Spinning Mills says a lot about what has happened with this government program. How is it that we can have an effective program when we have a situation where people are going broke? Either they are unable to access this money that is made available from the Commonwealth or it is not in a form of assistance which is useful to those companies going into receivership or voluntary administration.</para><para>I say to the government: if we are going to make money available to this industry, if we are going to make money available to any industry, we have to make sure that we provide it in a form that is actually going to be useful to their enterprises and to their businesses and that we deliver it in a way that ensures it is going to act as something that supports their work and creates opportunities and jobs for people, rather than letting it be something which is either too hard to access or is not available for those types of initiatives that people want to take up.</para><para>So we have had a difficult time in relation to the textile, clothing and footwear sector in recent years in and around my electoral district and across the Gippsland region more generally. A lot of people who have worked in the textile, clothing and footwear sector have been unable to get jobs elsewhere. They have been confronted with being out of jobs that they have in some cases been in for 15 or 20 years, or even longer. A lot of people in those circumstances, in our district at least, have been unable to find another job in the same type of areaânot necessarily in the textile, clothing and footwear sector but in other manufacturing industries. At the same time as we have seen the changes that have taken place in the textile clothing and footwear sector, there has been a big change in the industry profile which has existed in many of those country districts where the textile clothing and footwear sector has been based. So, when people have been put out of jobs in that area, they have been confronted with unemployment. Unemployment in these circumstances often leads to long-term unemployment and to a situation where people struggle in their lives and are unable to provide for their families in the way that they want to.</para><para>I think that when we think about these things in the parliament we have to have regard for handling the transition. We have to ensure that we provide support for people who lose their jobs in these circumstances, and we have to ensure that people are paid their entitlements when there is a voluntary administrator or a receiver-manager appointed, as in the case of Rocklea Spinning Mills. It is my understanding that we are pretty close to having new people take over the management and operation of Rocklea Spinning Mills in Moe. I say to those people that we are really looking forward to having them in our district. We hope that they are good employers and that they are able to contribute to our district and make sure that job opportunities are created so that people are given opportunities to get work in our district. It will be an initiative which will be very much welcomed by the people of Moe in particular and by the people of the Latrobe Valley more generally.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>9V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Pyne, Chris, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Pyne</name></talker><para>âA great town.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>84H</name.id><name role="metadata">Zahra, Christian, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ZAHRA</name></talker><para>âThe member opposite is rightâMoe is a great town. It is a great community and it is a place which has a lot going for it. I noticed in a newspaper article written by Stuart Rintoul in relation to a famous defence barrister, Colin Lovett, that he made a reference to the rural slum of Moe. It was a very offensive thing for him to write and I think that people really need to have regard for what they say in these types of articles. I take what the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Family and Community Services opposite has said in the way that I think it was intendedâas a sincere comment on a great town and on a good group of people. I think that anyone who reads comments like that in relation to certain areas and has to put up with that type of judgment being made about those areas appreciates that there are titles attributed to country districts or to certain areas like the northern suburbs or the western suburbs of Melbourne which are often unfair. They are really much more a reflection on the people who make those comments than a proper reflection of the communities that are described.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Getting back to the subject of the bill we are discussing and in relation to places like Moe, when there are closures and when we see the loss of employment, it does really give people a kick in the guts. It is important that the government has regard for the effect that that has on people and it is important that we are able to create alternative employment where possible and that we are able to provide for work force retraining where people are put out of their jobs. Given what all the research tells us is the case in relation to the textile, clothing and footwear sectorâwhen people lose jobs they are often unable to find work againâwe need to be particularly sensitive to what happens within this industry as we go through change and as we go through a period where it is likely that we will see the continued transformation of the textile, clothing and footwear sector.</para><para>To those people who like to make comments in relation to the textile, clothing and footwear sector, I say: have an open mind about it. Have regard to the fact that often people do not think before they use the types of monikers that people attribute to certain industriesâwhere people say, `We've got an old industry here and that's just the end of it.' What we have to have regard for here is what the truth is in relation to the industry. We have to make sure that when people talk about manufacturing they understand that the textile, clothing and footwear industry is an important part of manufacturing. When people consider the future of manufacturing, which is a big part of the future of Australia, they need to have regard for the fact that the textile, clothing and footwear sector will be a big part of that positive future that Australia can look forward toânew manufacturing and continued jobs growth in that new manufacturing sector.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>26242</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Gavan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR</name><name.id>WU5</name.id><electorate>Corio</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThank you, Mr Deputy Speaker.

Indeed I listened with particular interest to the contribution of the member for Corangamite. Down in the Geelong region the member for Corangamite is known as `Captain Zero' for his advocacy of zero tariffs for the Australian car industry. It would be of little comfort to textile workers in Geelong to hear his contribution to this debate tonight, in which he claimed success and a vindication of the government's policy to reduce tariffs even further without review.</para></talk.start></continue><para>There is a major distinction between the policies advocated by the member for Corangamite and those advocated by Labor with regard to this industry. It is simply this: we will, in government, in a short period of time, initiate a review of the textile, clothing and footwear industry and further tariff reductions. We will do that simply because we hold the view that this particular industry has undertaken significant restructuring in recent years. We owe it to this industry, the workers in it and the communities that support it to conduct a review of what is happening with regard to the textile industries of other countries and with regard to some of the practices that are entrenched in many of the countries we seek to export toâpractices that are substantial barriers to our country's gaining access to those markets.</para><para>The member for Corangamite seeks to deny Geelong TCF industries the opportunity offered by Labor to carry out such a review before 2005âa review not only of what has gone on in the Australian industry in response to a changed international environment and altered domestic circumstances such as significant increases in the exchange rate but also, as I said, of the practices in other countries where there are substantial barriers to textile, clothing and footwear firms in Australia that have done the right thing over the last 20 years. Having restructured their enterprises, innovated, allocated resources to research and development and invested in capital equipment, they still face significant barriers to entry into those particular markets.</para><para>The impacts of adjustment have been substantial in the Geelong region.

This is the drive by the two supermarket chainsâColes and Woolworthsâto place pharmacies within their supermarkets. To my mind, this is another step in the centralisation of power and control by this duopoly. It will see the removal for all time of suburban chemist shops and the wonderful service they provide to their many customers. I am old enough to remember the local butcher shop, the local bakery, the local men's barber and the local and thriving corner store. In many suburbs, they have disappeared from the main street location and are now found only in those monstrous shopping complexes which blight our suburbs.</para></talk.start><para>Never satisfied with consuming and eliminating competitors in these areas, the supermarket chains are now into the service station sector, and before long our local service stationâthe one that still changes your tyres, washes your windscreen and checks your oilâwill likewise be a thing of the past. Liquor outlets also highlight the power of the duopoly and their seemingly insatiable appetite for expansion. Woolworths is reportedly looking to buy hotels to control even more of the liquor market.</para><para>Now this duopoly has the gall to start a secret and underhand campaign by lobbying the state ministers responsible for state pharmacy regulations to change the rules so that they can have pharmacies in their supermarket chains. Mr Roger Corbett, the CEO of Woolworths, makes reference to a pharmacy without a pharmacist. That is an oxymoron. It is like having a surgery without a surgeon, a general practice without a general practitioner, a dental surgery without a dentist and Woolworths without fresh food. At present, we have a local pharmacy with a local pharmacist providing services to the local community. Under Woolworths's `100 pharmacies plan', you would have a national grocer with no pharmacist, providing no pharmacy services.</para><para>The local pharmacist is a fundamental aspect of the local Australian community. The dispensing of prescription medicines can be undertaken only by a pharmacist. On average, prescription dispensing accounts for some 60 per cent of pharmacy turnover. In addition, schedule 2 and schedule 3 products can only be sold with a pharmacist in attendance. If Woolworths is allowed a pharmacy within its supermarkets, there would be pressure on what products were stocked, how restricted stock could be marketed and what services could be provided. It is a clear warning that the service and standards the community enjoys with its community pharmacist will change dramatically under the Woolworths corporate pharmacist regime.</para><para>Coles Myer have a similar strategy. A quick analysis of documents leaked to me provides a useful insight into their thinking. Coles Myer research values the chemist goods market in 2002-03 at almost $A7.2 billion. What worries me most about this duopoly is that they are following US experiences where the role of the pharmacist is radically defined as:</para><quote><para>The pharmacist is becoming more of a counsellor to consumers, driving sales in many other categories at store level. The relationship between pharmacist and consumer can help bond the customer to the store.</para></quote><para>And the definition continues:</para><quote><para>Pharmacists can help promote the higher margin private label products by explaining to consumers the benefits of the store brand, its cost savings and the quality of the product.</para></quote><para>The duopoly plan begs the question: what services would a supermarket pharmacy provide? Supermarkets are most unlikely to provide all those extra services such as home medication reviews, asthma counselling, baby health services, diabetes programs or even home delivery. Allowing supermarkets to own pharmacies would reduce competition and lead to the same market dominance over pharmacy business that the major chains have over food.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Veterans: Burleigh RSL</title><title>McPherson Electorate: Robina Lions Club</title><page.no>26245</page.no></subdebateinfo><title>McPherson Electorate: Robina Lions Club</title><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>26245</page.no><name role="metadata">May, Margaret, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs MAY</name><name.id>83B</name.id><electorate>McPherson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âEarlier this year I had the pleasure of attending the 65th anniversary celebrations of the Burleigh RSLâand what a celebration.

Nevertheless, the boys know they only have to give the office a ring and a new flag will be delivered personally or sent on by my staff.</para><para>I would like to put on the record today a little bit about the history of the club. The Burleigh RSL received its charter on 3rd January 1939, but I understand the original ANZACs were hard at work in the Burleigh region many years before that event ever occurred. Anzac Day services were organised as far back as 1935. During the Second World War, the Burleigh ANZACs carried on the tradition of commemorating our war dead. Burleigh was a small seaside village and the club was struggling to survive towards the end of the 1940s, so they recruited some of the younger 2nd AIF boys to ensure the club's continuance. In 1953 the members, under the presidency of Mr Kevin Snee from the 2nd AIF, who is still a current member, acquired a state government grant of land and built a community hall on 6th Avenue, Burleigh, which was completed in 1956 and still stands today as a testament to those original ANZACs and to new Anzacs. During the 1950s and 1960s, the RSL hall was the hub of social activities in the local district. Up until the hall was built, the members met at the old Burleigh Heads Hotel on the esplanade. The new hall proved to be a great home and today serves its veteran community very well.</para><para>The current members deserve to be congratulated for the way in which the hall is managed and maintained. It is a delightful meeting placeâfull of memories, artefacts and a camaraderie that I have never felt in another club. It is well utilised by the members and local community organisations. In fact, it is used every day of the week. Membership has certainly seesawed over the years but, when the Australia Remembers program was introduced in 1994, there was renewed interest in the club and, in particular, in Anzac Day. With this program came a resurgence of membership and an Anzac Day service that is held every year at the memorial park, which is attended by over 5,000 local residents. My own participation each year is something very special to me and it is a wonderful sight each year to see the crowds grow with support from the local community.</para><para>The Anzac spirit is alive and well in Burleigh Heads, and the Burleigh subbranch makes a point of reaching out into the community through the local schools and involving both young and old in remembering our war veterans. I would like to say a special thank you to Mr Ken McNaught, Mr Chris Keating and Mr Ben Shuster, who have each made me feel very much part of the club over the years. These three gentlemen and all the club members deserve full credit for their work in our local community and their dedication and commitment to the Anzac spirit.</para><para>I would also tonight like to pay tribute to Robina Lions Club on the occasion of their 15th anniversary. Robina Lions is very special to me personally as I am a member of this particular club. Charter president Toula Singer compiled a special anniversary booklet celebrating this special milestone, and her continued support and encouragement of the club is certainly to be commended. In the few short years I have known this lady and her husband, Ray, I have never ceased to be amazed at the work they undertake in our local community. Robina Lions received its charter on 18 February 1989, with nine female and 15 male members. Over the years, membership has increased and decreased but the commitment to the Lions code of ethics and the strong belief and work that has gone into the local community and local projects has never dimmed. The commemoration booklet is a wonderful history of achievement for this small but hardworking club. As Toula herself said, compiling the booklet was a labour of love. Toula was the first female Lions Club president in Queenslandâshe was certainly a pioneer for women in Lions. Lions International has worldwide respect; it is a wonderful service organisation and one I am proud to be a member of, particularly of Robina Lions. I would like to take this opportunity of wishing all Robina Lions another rewarding and successful 15 years.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Howard Government: Performance</title><page.no>26246</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>26246</page.no><name role="metadata">Sawford, Rod, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SAWFORD</name><name.id>3J4</name.id><electorate>Port Adelaide</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn 1979, in both my home state of South Australia and nationally, courtesy of two conservative governments, egalitarianism and much of the fair go for all Australians disappeared from the lexicon of Australian politics.

Howard and Fraser of course were the stewards of the economic trifecta leading up to the 1983 federal election: 10 per cent interest rates, 10 per cent inflation and 10 per cent unemployment. The Prime Minister's recent attack on the lack of values in government schools was designed to drive a wedge between Labor and the non-government school systems. The Prime Minister's recent announcement of $362 million-plus to Catholic education appears to have more wedge than intrinsic worth as its motivation. I do not oppose public funding for private schools. The only provision is that it be nonpartisan and fair. If the current amount of dollars for private schools is justified, and I think it is, then public funds should be doubled. But the Prime Minister is partisan.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>9V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Pyne, Chris, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âI warn the member for Sturt!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sawford, Rod, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SAWFORD</name></talker><para>âHe hates `public' and that is the nub of the current problem. Even a cursory look at the Prime Minister's stewardship in his current position, and in his former life as federal Treasurer to the Fraser government, shows overwhelming and irrefutable evidence of his hatred for all things public.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In 1977, when the current Prime Minister was federal Treasurer, the public school share of Commonwealth funding was around 63 per cent, with private schools 37 per cent. That is what a responsible non-partisan federal government would do today. If the federal government can ignore endowments, assets and fees, why does it take into account state government funding? Consistency was no attribute of the government between 1977 and 1983. Under Treasurer Howard's appalling stewardship, public education's share of Commonwealth funding fell from 63 per cent to 46 per cent from 1977 to 1983âa simply amazing kick in the guts for public education. And of course electoral cynicism was never far away.</para><para>After initially reducing funding for public education from 1977 to 1979 Howard actually increased funding back to its original 1977 level for the 1980 federal election. That was the first and only time the current Prime Minister was involved with increasing funding for public education. But, as I indicated before, it did not last. During the Hawke-Keating years the government funding for public education at least stabilised with the public-private share being 45-55. However, on resuming power in 1996, the Prime Minister was at it again, crucifying public education with no subtlety whatsoever. He has taken the 45-55 public-private ratio of funding education to 33-67 in just eight years. In other words, he has more than totally reversed the public and private share of education in this nation, from the 63 per cent public to 37 per cent private ratio in 1977âwhich is the nonpartisan correct ratioâto the 33 per cent public and 67 per cent private ratio now. It is not the right of a federal government to favour one system over the other; it should fund both on equitable terms. It should be fair and square, not partisan.</para><para>Although the Prime Minister appears to have gotten away with this amazing reversal, there will be a day of judgement for him and his government. There always is. The Prime Minister's obsession against anything public got him into huge difficulties when, as Treasurer post 1980, he lost total control of the economy, resulting in the trifecta of doom in 1983. But it is not only education; the Prime Minister's attitude is exactly the same with regard to health and communications. In 1987 the current Prime Minister said: </para><quote><para>Bulk-billing will not be permitted for anyone except pensioners and the disadvantaged. Doctors will be free to charge whatever fees they choose.</para></quote><para>In 1995 he turned that statement on its head when, for electoral purposes, only he stated:</para><quote><para>We're not going to contemplate altering the universality of Medicare. I mean, that is fundamental, and we're also going to keep bulkbilling ...</para></quote><para>He also said:</para><quote><para>We absolutely guarantee the retention of Medicare.

There is no denying that situation. The wider electorate is sick of the blame game being played between the state and federal governments. Muhammed Ali made an interesting statement many years ago that sums up the current Prime Minister. He said that the man who views the world at 60 the same as he did at 30 has wasted 30 years of his life. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Macarthur Electorate: Hume Highway Upgrade</title><page.no>26248</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>26248</page.no><name role="metadata">Farmer, Patrick, MP</name><name role="display">Mr FARMER</name><name.id>00AMO</name.id><electorate>Macarthur</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAt Federation 102 years ago, there was a very clear line drawn between the responsibilities of state and federal governments. In terms of roads, the federal government was given responsibility for the national highway which was to join the capital cities. The state governments were responsible for the major arterial roads between towns within the states. We have a population of 20 million and, of those people, only 10 million pay taxes. Those taxes pay for all of the infrastructure in this wide land. Compare us to Britain, where you have something like 130 taxpayers for every mile of national highway. In Australia, we have just 13.</para></talk.start><para>In the last week, the NRMA launched a campaign to have the national highway linking Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane upgraded to a four-lane highway. The NRMA urges that this is fair because around 80 per cent of Australia's population lives on the eastern seaboard between these three cities. Whilst this would be nice, it would cost tens of billions of dollars. It is for this reason that the only financially responsible way to do it is to stage the work. This work has to be prioritised across the entire network, including in areas like my electorate of Macarthur, which the Hume Highway runs through. That is what the Minister for Transport and Regional Services is doing and I fully support this approach.</para><para>Twenty years of population growth has seen the Macarthur electorate change from a few small suburbs to a satellite city in its own right, sprawled either side of the Hume Highway. For decades, the state government has approved new suburb after new suburb adjacent to the highway, with no regard for any employment base. Today, local jobs are scarce and this has forced more people from Macarthur to travel on the highway to work each day. Each day, the Hume Highway gives tens of thousands of commuters who live in my electorate access to their jobs in the inner city and the CBD of Sydney.</para><para>While I understand the need for a third lane to ease traffic congestion, people need to understand the real problem with this roadâthat is, it is congested during peak hours as everybody tries to get to and from work. Delays are common during the mornings and afternoons, when it can take up to two hours to get into the city. As a person who travels the road regularly, I know that you can make a trip from Campbelltown to North Sydney in 50 minutes outside of peak hours. It is hard to argue that we should spend $500 million in taxpayer funds installing an extra lane that will be used for only a few hours a day.</para><para>We need to cut to the heart of the issue. What we need to do is stop people having to leave the area to work. What we can do for those people who simply have to leave the area for work is to get them to leave the car at home. Once we have done that, if there is still a need for an extra lane, it will be time to start lobbying. But, until then, we need to take a longer term, strategic approach to fixing the real problem. By creating more local jobs, we will immediately get rid of cars from the Hume Highway. As the employment base grows, year after year, fewer and fewer people will need to travel on the highway. It might seem simplistic, but it cuts to the heart of the issue.</para><para>I refuse to sit by and continue to let people in my area spend up to four hours each day commuting to and from home unless they absolutely have to. We need to provide more local jobs as well as better services to those who absolutely have to commute. To do this, we need to improve our rail system so that it actually delivers an efficient, safe and clean service. When this happens, more and more people will use it and we can take more cars off the road. I do not blame the people of Macarthur for preferring to sit in the car for up to two hours when you consider that Bob Carr has run the train system into the ground. Anybody in this House representing a seat in Sydney is all too familiar with the headlines of the last few weeks: `Train chaos', `Carr drives commuters off the rails' and `Rail in crisis'. Train commuters now face daily rolling stoppages and hour-long delays due to the Labor government's mismanagement. Add this to the ever-increasing fares and you have a system that simply is not appealing.</para><para>I have started lobbying Bob Carr to improve the rail systemâto meet the current demand for better and more drivers on the system and to deal with other short-term issues like securityâso that rail commuters do not have to walk away from the system and take their cars to work. But he also needs to look at the long-term issue of getting more and more people onto the trains. He needs to introduce express trains from Campbelltownâ<inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Trade: Ugh Boots</title><page.no>26249</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>26249</page.no><name role="metadata">Jackson, Sharryn, MP</name><name role="display">Ms JACKSON</name><name.id>00AN2</name.id><electorate>Hasluck</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe issue I will address tonight is one that presents a choice for the Howard governmentâthat is, to back either corporate America or Australian small business. I have previously advised the House that a US company, Deckers Outdoors Corporation, is demanding, with the threat of legal action, that Australian manufacturers and distributors of ugh boots immediately cease and forever refrain from advertising, promoting, marketing, distributing and/or offering for sale their goods by reference to the word `ugh' or any other name incorporating the word `ugh' or its alternative spellings `ugg' and `ug'. Potentially hundreds of Australian small businesses and families now face hardship through loss of distribution outlets and sales, despite having traded using the word `ugh' for decades.</para></talk.start><para>The families whose livelihoods depend on the ugh boot industry do not expect the government to fight their fight for them or have the solution handed to them on a platter. These people are the kind who know that you rarely get something for nothing. They are not standing back and letting things happen to themâfar from it. They have united to form a national association called the Australian Sheepskin Association. The ASA have already established a fighting fund to cover the legal fees which have and will be incurred. My office has been in contact with the ASA. They have recently received their first legal bill for $12,000 and they expect another for $2,000 this week.</para><para>These people are real Aussie battlers who are not going to back down from a fight. The ASA is doing its part and it is about time this government weighed in with its support. Unfortunately, it looks like the government is quite happy to give way to the US corporation. I have written to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, the Hon. Ian Macfarlane, regarding this issue. I finally received a response last Wednesday from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, the member for Leichhardt. Prior to this letter, the closest I got to a reply was a media report that quoted a spokesperson for the minister, who said it was inappropriate to intervene in what was `a private legal matter'. The parliamentary secretary echoed this position.</para><para>Two matters that both he and the minister failed to address are as follows. Firstly, how and why did IP Australia allow the relevant generic terms to be trade marked in the first place? Secondly, what assistance packages, if any, may be available to the small businesses concerned? If the government is so ineffective in supporting this Aussie industry in these circumstances then, frankly, the fears held by some industries about the impact of the US-Australia free trade agreement on them are valid. Or is it the case with this government that it will support particular industries and/or and hang the rest?</para><para>What makes many Australians angry is that Deckers' actions are driven by profit, not principle. Deckers' share price was worth less than $US4 a year ago. They now trade at the $US26 mark. Net sales and net earnings for the most recent quarter increased by 39 per cent and 81 per cent respectively. For the full year, sales increased 22 per cent to $121 million. Net earnings rose 465 per cent to $9.2 million. Deckers' own web site states the growth was driven in large part by sales of the company's Ugg product line of sheepskin boots. Sales of the Ugg line in 2003 jumped 55 per cent from the previous year to total $37 million. It is worth noting that Deckers has been able to generate these profits while Australian companies have been trading using the word `ugh'. There is no reason to presumeâexcept perhaps for the vagaries of the fashion sceneâthat Deckers will not continue to make similar profits in the future. The issue is that they want to make much, much more while ugh boots are fashionable, at the cost of our own home-grown industry.</para><para>The government should not be prepared to have yet another Australian icon go the way of so many others before them. The production of ugh boots provides employment for thousands of Australian families. It is simply not right that a US company that wants to increase its profit margin by a few more million dollars can destroy their very livelihoods. While the Howard government seems quite happy to wash its hands of this matter, I will not. I will continue to work with constituents like Bruce and Bronwyn McDougall, whose business `Uggs-N-Rugs' is located in my electorate, to raise awareness and funds to keep `uggs' an Australian icon.</para><para>Finally, I would like to conclude by saying to the Minister for Industry, Trade and Resources that if he will not officially support this campaign I would encourage him to make a personal donation. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Victoria: Australian Labor Party</title><page.no>26250</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>26250</page.no><name role="metadata">Barresi, Phillip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BARRESI</name><name.id>ZJ6</name.id><electorate>Deakin</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise tonight to speak about the tangled web woven by the Labor Party in Victoria. Victorian communities are suffering as the Bracks government and their federal Labor representatives allow their union cousins to run roughshod over the employers, employees and people of Victoria. Because of their weak stance, local small business operators are left to foot the bill.</para></talk.start><para>Let us not understate the magnitude of this issue: Victoria is in turmoil and it is because of militant unions and a do-nothing state government. Last week, the federal Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations drew the House's attention to the Australian Services Union dispute and its impact within the electricity sector. It is all very well for Mr Bracks to come out and declare war on the unions. However, the war started long ago and is not being assisted by the federal ALP, and I might add that the war is on the verge of being lost.</para><para>I raise this question: who is running the state of Victoria? What sort of government allows the cutting of essential services from small business, and what sort of alternative federal government expects innocent, hardworking small business owners to cop the wrath of such dissidents? A headline in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline> newspaper claimed: `Union bans biting hard'. These bans are not just biting hard; they have gnawed and chewed at our state's industrial relations performance and they have caused the lay-off of workers and severe disruption to the customers of innocent employers.</para><para>All this is happening while federal Labor watches the destruction from the sidelines. No wonder this is happeningâafter all, according to the member for Rankin, the shadow IR minister, the Labor Party and the unions are in partnership once again. Let us look at who the ALP is in partnership with. Businesses in the East Burwood shopping centre were crippled two weeks ago when the Australian Services Union used militant and appalling tactics in an attempt to prove a point. Following a power blackout at the East Burwood shopping centre, workers from the electricity supply company attended the site to repair a fault. However, due to work bans, the workers were prevented from turning the power back on. In that time 32 small businesses, a Kmart and a Coles were forced onto a backup power supply. In the interim, businesses lost stock, including: the butcher and charcoal chicken shop, who lost about $4,000 each; the ice-cream shop, which saw $1,500 just melt away; and the fruit shop, which estimates a loss of about $5,000. They are small business operators.</para><para>This centre, which employs over 300 people, was left without power for over 24 hours. It took until the following afternoon for the state government to threaten the use of essential services powers. The state Minister for Energy, Industries and Resources, Theo Theophanous, should have done this the minute the ASU threat was made. He should have put his union affiliations aside for the sake of small business and the livelihood of Victorians. He should have forced the ASU to turn the power back on. Instead, we saw a government pussyfoot around an issue of vital importance.</para><para>The Bracks government are not the only ALP representatives to sit on their hands in the face of union strongarm tactics. The member for Chisholm, who is all too happy to speak on issues in my electorate, has been strangely silent on this dispute. That is little wonder either, with the affiliation of the member for Chisholm, Anna Burke, to the ASU obviously hampering her fulfillment of her duty to her constituents. Fortunately for these traders and the nearby residents, at the next election they will be part of the Deakin electorate. Their wellbeing will not be sacrificed in the name of union mateship. It really is a shame when old union loyalties take priority over responsible community representation. If the member for Chisholm and her Victorian colleagues in this House are willing to silently allow industrial action to cost small businesses in their electorates, what silence can we expect when it affects the broader national community? I would imagine it would be deafening silence.</para><para>It is not only the member for Chisholm who is chained to the interests of the ASU. Since 1996, this union has pumped over $1,565,000 into the coffers of the Labor Party. The members on the opposite side of this House, and the entire ALP organisation, are shackled to the interests of the union movement. We should not underestimate the danger. The stability of our economy is under threat if the federal ALP wins office at the next election. Not only would there be nine ALP union-controlled governments in Australia, but Labor would go down a dangerous path, as surmised in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>, which states:</para><quote><para>... Labor ... intends to reregulate sections of the economy, including the labour market.

Its purpose is to ensure that a former employee does not receive a higher net payment than they would have received if they are still employed. Weekly incapacity payments for retired employees are reduced by the notional amount to maintain appropriate incentives for workers to return to work and minimise reliance on the social security scheme following the cessation of employment.</para><para>(3)	520. </para><para>(4)	The notional superannuation contribution is not an accrued benefit.</para><para>(5)	There has been one formal application for an act of grace payment in relation to the superannuation formula in the previous 12 month period.

I am expecting the Department to report to me by mid-year. </para><para>(8)	The intent of the SRC Act is that all employees injured at work should, from 45 weeks of injury and regardless of whether they retire, receive weekly incapacity payments at 70% of their pre-injury normal weekly earnings. This is intended to promote rehabilitation and return-to-work and minimise reliance on the social security system. The Review of the SRC Act is considering a range of issues including any consequences or outcomes which were unintended when the legislation was enacted.</para><para>(9)	The issues surrounding the treatment of superannuation under the SRC Act did not come to light until after passage of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation (Other Legislative Amendments) Act 2001.</para><para>(10)	The SRC Act provides income replacement for Commonwealth employees who retire as a result of their incapacity. It does not define eligibility for parenting allowance payment. Nonetheless the Government is concerned to ensure that the interaction between workers' compensation and social security payments results in fair and equitable treatment. Eligibility for parenting payment is strictly defined to ensure that benefits are distributed equitably, that appropriate incentives to work are maintained and that there is no double counting of benefits.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>National Security: Terrorism</title><page.no>26258</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2964)</subtitle><id.no>2964</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>26258</page.no><name role="metadata">McClelland, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McClelland</name><name.id>JK6</name.id><electorate>Barton</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 10 February 2004:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Did Australia participate in the drafting of the model counter-terrorism provisions by the Nasonini Implementation Expert Working Group; if so, who represented Australia on the Working Group.</para><para>(2)	Were the model provisions (a) considered and (b) approved by the Australian Government at a ministerial level; if so, (i) when and (ii) by which Minister(s).</para><para>(3)	If the model provisions were not approved at ministerial level, were they approved at any level of the Australian Government; if so, (a) when and (b) at what level.</para><para>(4)	Have any countries requested in-country drafting assistance; if so, (a) when and (b) to which countries has Australia provided in-country drafting assistance.</para><para>(5)	Does the Government expect to be asked to provide such assistance in future.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>26258</page.no><name role="metadata">Downer, Alexander, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Downer</name><name.id>4G4</name.id><electorate>Mayo</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Foreign Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Yes.
