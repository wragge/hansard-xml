This is typical of the very shallow and irresponsible approach that Labor have taken in relation to aged care, because all they are doing is responding to media speculation. Labor clearly have no ideas of their own. They are clearly still paralysed in terms of policy making in aged care. Ten years on from the damning Professor Gregory report—an indictment on Labor—they still do not have any ideas in aged care. Even now they do not know if they are coming or going. Apparently today in a press release the member for Perth said, `Mark Latham recently made it clear that Labor will not be supporting the extension of bonds to high-level care.' That is apparently news to other Labor members. It has been reported that Senator Michael Forshaw gave a keynote address on behalf of the ALP in Cairns recently and he said he would not rule bonds in or out. So what is it? What is Labor's policy on aged care?</para></talk.start><para>This gives me an opportunity to remind members of the House that, under the Howard government, there have been record levels of aged care funding, from $3 billion in 1996 to $6 billion today.

I am pleased to say that the government's Tough on Drugs policy seems to be working. We have had a 23 per cent reduction in the number of people using illicit drugs since 1998; we have had a 60 per cent reduction in the number of heroin users; and, most importantly, deaths from drug overdoses have fallen from over 1,100 to under 400—thanks, at least in part, to the government's Tough on Drugs policy. </para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4T4</name.id><name role="metadata">Melham, Daryl, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Melham</name></talker><para>—Oh, rubbish!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>EZ5</name.id><name role="display">Mr ABBOTT</name></talker><para>—Unfortunately, as the interjection indicates, not everyone supports those policies.

It would be very interesting to ascertain how many spot checks were undertaken when Labor was in government and in charge of aged care. Under Labor, there was no accreditation system that set national legislated benchmarks for care. This government introduced an accreditation system. For the first time, we had an accreditation system that was a quality assurance system across all 3,000 aged care facilities funded by the federal government. This accreditation system is a framework of quality assessment and quality assurance and includes a complaints resolution scheme, a commissioner for complaints, and a series of reviews, audits and spot checks.</para></talk.start><para>I appreciate that the member for Perth spends his nights trawling through the accreditation agency's web site trying to find on the public record instances of poor care or instances that might have escaped the immediate attention of the accreditation agency.

In response to him, I note that the Australian Labor Party platform will give union bosses access to businesses throughout Australia, even when there are no union members of those businesses. This is a platform that will give union bosses a foot in the door and an eye on the books of every business in Australia, even without union members being present. We know that this is binding on the Australian Labor Party because the Leader of the Opposition has told us that the federal platform is binding on every member of the Australian Labor Party.</para></talk.start><para>I noted recently that the national secretary of the Maritime Union of Australia, Paddy Crumlin, was quoted as saying that the union `needs to be political in order to be industrial'. We saw the antics of the MUA in the past, which almost turned one of the largest and most strategic industries in Australia into a small business. The Labor Party's platform would do that for every industry in Australia. This is a platform which is indeed a political one—a platform written by the big union bosses for the big union bosses and, of course, paid for by the $40 million worth of donations from the unions to the Australian Labor Party. This comes at a time when just 17 per cent of workers in the private sector in Australia are members of a union. The Secretary of the ACTU, Mr Greg Combet, also speaking at the MUA conference recently, noted that the voting profile of union members was not much different from that of the general population—about 40 per cent voting Labor. He went on to say that this was a far cry from the overwhelming support Labor had enjoyed in previous generations. Of course, he is right. What we have here is a platform which is written by narrow sectional interests with political agendas. The union bosses will be given rights over ordinary workers in Australia, and the union bosses will be given rights over businesses both great and small.</para><para>This is not just hollow rhetoric coming from the government, because what we have seen in Western Australia is precisely this platform having been enacted by the Labor Gallop government. In South Australia, the Rann Labor government wants to enact the same platform. In Western Australia, the right of entry can be exercised by not only an authorised person but also a union official. So you can be the small mum and dad business operating from home with no union employees with the prospect of somebody coming and knocking on the door and saying, `I am representing the union. I want to enter your business. I want to look at the books.' That is what the Labor Party is proposing for business in Australia. No wonder the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review </inline>editorial today commented:</para><quote><para>Business is rightly worried that Labor's electoral prospects are rising at a time when it is becoming increasingly beholden to its union paymasters—which have donated $40 million to the party since 1996 ...</para></quote><para>Business is right to be worried. In the words of the small business organisation in Western Australia, business is afraid—very afraid—of the Labor Party. These are plans written by union bosses for union bosses. They will give unionists the right of entry into every business in Australia. This is just further proof that Labor is bad for business, bad for workers, bad for jobs and would be bad for Australia.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission</title><page.no>27546</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>27546</page.no><name role="metadata">Latham, Mark, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LATHAM</name><name.id>K26</name.id><electorate>Werriwa</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Prime Minister.

This is a blow for Australia's 1.1 million small businesses. Since 1984, employers with fewer than 15 employees had previously been exempt. But until Friday's decision, a small business needing to make redundant a minimum wage employee of four years service was required to provide about $1,340 to that employee. After the decision on Friday, that has gone up to nearly $5,000. If it is a qualified tradesperson, they will receive over $8,200 in severance pay, and that is about $6,000 more than prior to Friday's decision. So it is a significant increase and a significant cost burden on more than half a million small businesses that are employing other Australians. </para><para>Why has this come about?

Let us have a look at the Labor Party's policies now. Ask yourself how it is going to affect small business to have a policy from the Labor Party that is going to push casual employees into permanent part-time employment. It means that employers are going to have to look at a range of different entitlements for their employees, such as sick leave and long service leave, and, of course, it means a pay cut for the casual workers. We know that the Labor Party wants to introduce a national payroll tax to pay for its employee entitlements legislation—another disincentive for small business to employ more people, and more red tape for small business.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations talked about the right of entry and the fact that the union movement and their mates can now have unqualified access to every small business in the country, even if they have not got union members working there, in order to interview them. Under the Labor Party's industrial relations policy, every employer has to give to an employee coming back from maternity leave an entitlement to part-time work rather than full-time work. The Labor Party does not understand the implications that has in regional and remote Australia. For example, in a small accounting firm or a small workshop with two skilled employees, if one goes off on maternity leave, what is the employer going to do if they have to offer that person part-time work instead of full-time work when they come back?</para><para>It is quite clear where the Labor Party is heading. The Labor Party is heading in the direction of closing down small business employment—that is, employment that represents three million jobs in Australia. It is the engine room of the Australian economy, and the Labor Party, through its workplace relations policies, is unapologetically closing down small business employment. This is another example of the Labor Party and the unions working in a partnership. But it is not a partnership. It has a real impact on jobs, it has a real impact on the economy and it has a huge impact on small business.</para></answer></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DISTINGUISHED VISITORS</title><type>Distinguished Visitors</type><page.no>27548</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>27548</page.no><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate>PO</electorate><party>N/A</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon the Hon.

It has taken a long time to think up a question, but I would advise that further work be done by the member for Kingston in relation to the matter. In administering those laws, my view is that taxpayers have an obligation to comply and the tax office has an obligation to comply. Why do I say that?

You see, it is a dual track strategy. We have figured this out. For public consumption purposes, the Leader of the Opposition says he is going to be positive.

The ADF is plainly playing key roles in advancing Australia's and Iraq's national interests—and, I would think, the interests of peace loving people everywhere—through its involvement in Iraq at the moment. For example, the security detail is enabling the Australian Representative Office to perform vital representative work of a commercial and political nature in the Coalition Provisional Authority and, indeed, among new Iraqi leaders. The ADF is providing vital support for coalition and Iraqi efforts to stabilise Iraq against terror threats—and think of the very important work that is being carried out by our air traffic control operators over there, for example, and also through the training for the new Iraqi army.</para></talk.start><para>I think the broader point should also be made that they are making a very valuable contribution to the broader war against terrorism in the Middle East through the activities of the HMAS<inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Melbourne</inline>, the P3 Orions and the various staff in the region. Iraqi leadership is overwhelmingly positive about Australia's role. They tell us and our representatives that they appreciate what we are doing. They offer their thanks.

Quite frankly, to pull out straight after Madrid, with the job not done, is nothing less than a slap in the face for the Iraqi people. It also sends a message to terrorists that we can be intimidated and that we will change course if they behave in certain ways.</para><para>I am asked about alternative views.

But at the very least, in terms of what is happening in the world today, he fails to understand in these remarks how Australia's ADF presence overseas in Iraq, East Timor and the Solomon Islands is vital to Australia's national security. These matters of national security are, quite frankly, far too important for policy on the run. The Leader of the Opposition shows inexperience, weakness and a poor understanding of Australia's interests and society. I note with some interest that the Leader of the Opposition has a flyer that has been distributed in quite a few electorates. It says:</para><quote><para>Mark Latham: A New Style of Leader. </para></quote><para>I am quoting:</para><quote><para>It's a shame, but some politicians seem reluctant to talk to real people, but I want to hear your views, not from advisers or pollsters—</para></quote><para>or shadow cabinets—</para><quote><para>but straight from you.</para></quote><para>The Leader of the Opposition says he will not be poll driven—and in this case he probably was not, because if he had been poll driven, if he had gone out there before the event, he would have established that the Australian people feel the job should be finished. However, very interestingly—and I am indebted to a Nationals staffer who was in Sydney last weekend and was quick enough to realise he was being polled—it appears that the Labor Party went out after this decision to establish, by polling, what the Australian people thought about it, to clean up after the mess. Anyway, our staffer was quick enough, when he was rung on the weekend by ANOP, to grab a pen and paper and take down the questions as they were asked. There are about three pages of them. It was very long. They had all the routine questions about how you vote and what you think of the various leaders around the place, but then Labor's pollsters got to the real topic that they wanted to test, and our staffer was asked if he agreed or disagreed with the following statements.

Today the Australian Bureau of Statistics released the international trade in goods and services figures for the month of February. They showed a $154 million improvement on the January figures, with a balance in deficit of $1.716 billion. That was an improvement of around $742 million on the December figures.</para></talk.start><para>There was a substantial fall in imports, driven by an 11 per cent fall in the import of consumption goods, and there was a fall in exports, although of a lower dimension. The export of travel services rose strongly in the month of February, no doubt the result of good tourism policy here in Australia, and rural exports were quite reasonable—certainly higher than they have been over the course of the last year. But in relation to other areas, including minerals, exports were down. What that probably shows is that demand is slowing in the Australian economy. Imports of consumption goods were down. There was also a reduction in imports of capital goods, but they vary enormously with the importation of civil aircraft.</para><para>The Australian Bureau of Statistics today also released building approvals figures. Dwelling approvals rose 3.2 per cent, but that was determined largely by the fact that in one state in particular, New South Wales, medium-density approvals went through in the month, and the medium-density increases in approvals were consequently up 16.9 per cent. That is a notoriously volatile series. What the figures do show is that private sector house approvals fell by 3.1 per cent, which is the fifth consecutive monthly fall, and approvals are now 11.3 per cent lower than they were in September 2003. That confirms a slowing in the Australian housing market, which I have been commenting on for some time. The government are not concerned by slowing in the housing market. It is our view that the housing market has grown very strongly for a period of time. If the housing market were to plateau in terms of prices, that would be in the longer term interests of the Australian economy.</para><para>I will finish with this observation: in terms of economic management, it has been a difficult period over the last five years. We have had a US recession, the worst drought in Australian history, the outbreak of SARS, September 11 and a war in Iraq. Most countries of the developed world have been in recession, and Australia almost alone has been able to weather those difficulties. But I want to underline again that economic management in difficult periods is very important—there is no room for error. It takes dedicated commitment of purpose. Economic management is not done by having air-bubble thoughts, putting them up and then airbrushing them away as we move on to the next issue. It is not done by taking the latest fad from a computer download. Economic policy requires constant, determined purpose to make sure that the future of Australians, which depends on strong economic management, is looked after. That has been the hallmark of this government—discipline and commitment in relation to economic management—and it will continue to be the hallmark of this government.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Family Services: Stronger Families and Communities</title><page.no>27554</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>27554</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Byrne, Michelle, MP</name><name role="display">Ms O'BYRNE</name><name.id>84S</name.id><electorate>Bass</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Prime Minister.

It offers fully trained and certified security personnel, it is right next door to the exclusive Four Seasons restaurant, and—as a further inducement to tenants—Manhattan Tower offers discount tickets to all of its tenants for plays, comedy shows and sporting events. At Centenary House they would not even give you a ticket to question time without a further donation to the Labor Party, yet you get all this at Manhattan Tower for just $773. You can rent space on the 23rd floor of Manhattan Tower for $773, which is well under the $871 which the Labor Party is getting from the poor, fleeced Australian taxpayer.

We can spend a good deal of time during this debate debating the merits or otherwise of Australia's military commitment as part of the coalition of the willing just over 12 months ago in Iraq. On behalf of the government I say that we remain steadfast in our view that that was the right decision, taken in the long-term national interests of this country, and a decision that has contributed, in my view, to already some very significant improvements, including the decision of the Gaddafi regime in Libya to give up its weapons of mass destruction.</para><para>What I am asking the House to do in relation to this motion is a very simple thing: to put aside for a moment whether or not you supported the commitment to Iraq and to ask yourself whether the continuation of the deployment of these forces in and around Iraq until their task is completed is in the long-term best interests of Australia, because that is our proposition. I invite those who sit opposite, including the Leader of the Opposition, who strongly opposed our commitment to Iraq, to accept that it is possible, in good conscience and with great consistency, to have been an opponent of the commitment to Iraq but equally to believe that the Australian Defence Force personnel should stay there until their job is done.</para><para>The world faces, at the present time, a unique challenge to its safety, its stability and its security. The threat of terrorism is unlike any other threat the world has seen. This is not the threat of invading armies poised on borders, ready to roll over those borders and to capture civilian populations and devastate towns, cities and villages; this is a different kind of threat, and it is a threat that requires a different kind of response.</para><para>If the world at the present time trembles and shows any kind of equivocation in the face of the threat posed by terrorism, I believe that the world—of which Australia is inextricably a part—will pay a very heavy price in the future. The decision we take on how we deport ourselves over the months ahead will go very much to the reputation and standing of this country in the councils of the world. If we choose to cut and run, if we choose to abandon our friends, if we choose to give the wrong signal to the terrorists, that will not only make the world a less safe place but also damage the reputation of this country around the world.</para><para>It has always been the Australian way to stay there, to go the distance, to see it through and to do what is right in the long-term interests of this country and the interests of the people with whom we have aligned ourselves. We currently have something in the order of 850 Defence Force personnel in and around Iraq. They are carrying out a series of duties. We have a security detachment which is protecting the headquarters element of our presence in Iraq; we have military trainers; we have coalition provisional authority staff; we have air traffic controllers at Baghdad Airport; we have C130s stationed in Qatar; we have a headquarters and a headquarters liaison in Kuwait; we have the HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Stuart</inline>, which is performing valuable duties in the gulf; and we have P3C Orions, which are carrying out very necessary surveillance duties.</para><para>People may well argue that that is not a large number and ask: what would it matter if we pulled our 835 out? It would matter a great deal because we would be the very first to unconditionally break ranks if we pulled our people out. We have to understand that the Leader of the Opposition's policy is that those forces should come out on 30 June if that is when the handover occurs. It may in practice only be possible for a Labor government to implement that in order to bring them home by Christmas because by definition we are not going to have an election until towards the end of the year. But in reality what the Leader of the Opposition is arguing is that we should bring them home on 30 June if that is when the transfer occurs.</para><para>What I put to the House is that that is a greater retreat from our obligations than proposed by any other government. Even the socialist government of Spain acknowledges that if there is a new UN resolution then they might well allow their 1,300 troops to stay in Iraq under that resolution. What the Leader of the Opposition is therefore proposing is a measure of retreat that would take us beyond any of the other 35 countries that comprise the coalition forces that are in Iraq.</para><para>The saga which has overtaken this debate over the past week has indeed been very strange. A week ago my understanding of the opposition's policy was that articulated very consistently by the member for Griffith. That policy basically was that if they were to win the next election they would get advice—they would talk to DFAT; they would talk to Defence—and they would basically then make up their mind based on that advice as to what they were going to do, obviously having a preference for bringing the troops home as soon as possible.</para><para>But at no stage did I imagine that the opposition was going to place an arbitrary date on the withdrawal of those troops—that is, until last Tuesday morning when the Leader of the Opposition changed the policy. I do not know why: perhaps he was a bit seduced by the two opinion polls in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> last Tuesday morning; I do not know. Maybe he will give us the benefit—maybe it his deep-seated, latent anti-Americanism. I do not know what it is. But—whatever the explanation—we had, after a bit of questioning, the assertion by the Leader of the Opposition that they were going to come home by Christmas. As a result he completely altered the whole complexion of this debate.</para><para>I could understand the Labor Party maintaining its opposition to our original involvement. But I had been beguiled by the member for Griffith into believing that despite their reservations about what we had done last year their argument was, `You may have been wrong to go in but now you're there you've got to stay there until you finish the job.' That was basically what the member for Griffith said. When he wrote to me on 17 November last year he said that we should send more trainers to help the Iraqi army and to help the Iraqi police. I actually agreed with him and we have sent some more trainers and there are some more going by way of rotation in May. Yet according to the policy of the Leader of the Opposition those people who go in May have to be withdrawn on 30 June, if in fact the handover takes place on 30 June.</para><para>I thought that was the policy. That policy is a cut and run policy. It says, `We're going to bring them out as soon as we get elected—and that will be by Christmas—irrespective of the impact on the Americans, irrespective of the impact on the Iraqis, irrespective of the impact on our other allies.' That policy takes him further away from not only us—I can understand that—but the Labour Prime Minister of Great Britain, Tony Blair; the Democrat candidate in the United States, John Kerry; the Leader of the British Conservative Party, Michael Howard; and indeed further, as I said a moment ago, than the socialist government which has just been elected in Spain.</para><para>His excuses then began to change. He said originally, `I want them all out by Christmas.' By Thursday, he was implying that on the way home they should go to Afghanistan, despite the fact that our task there—according to all the military advice we had in relation to Afghanistan—had been completed. Let me say to the House that our forces were withdrawn from Afghanistan on military advice—on the advice of the Chief of the Defence Force—that their task had been completed.</para><para>But that lasted for a day because by Friday these forces, these 850 personnel, were needed not in Iraq, not in Afghanistan, but for the defence of Australia—despite the fact that we have in Australia 51,000 ADF personnel looking after the defence of this country and despite the fact that even on the most pessimistic scenario in the conventional sense this country does not face any military threat. In making that remark and in invoking the expression `the defence of Australia' in the context of the war against terrorism the Leader of the Opposition betrayed a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of the challenge that this country faces. The war against terrorism is a war that overwhelmingly will be won through diplomatic, strategic and intelligence operations. Military operations are part of it. And you will do more damage in the war against terrorism if you betray a nervousness in the face of terrorists than you will by having 950 people out of Australia.</para><para>The real message that will come from what the Leader of the Opposition has suggested, if he was allowed to implement it, will be that terrorist intimidation will bring the results the terrorists want. The terrorists want division among free people. The terrorists want governments and oppositions and leaders and political groupings around the world to react to what the terrorists do. This is the worst time in the world for this country to cut and run. This is the worst time in the world for this country to be divided from its traditional friends and allies.</para><para>Like or dislike our alliance with the United States, like or dislike the current administrations in the United States or in the United Kingdom, the reality stands that it is a very dangerous time to be giving the impression that we are no longer rock solid with our traditional allies and friends. This is a time for this country to send a clear and unambiguous signal to the rest of the world that we are united not only with our allies in the coalition of the willing but we are united with our allies in our region in the fight against terrorism. The proposition that in some way—with 51,000 Defence Force personnel in Australia and given the character of the war against terrorism—we needed these 850 for the defence of Australia and that in some way I, as Prime Minister, was endangering the security of this country by having those 850 personnel in Iraq was absolutely and fundamentally absurd.</para><para>If he wanted to be consistent, why didn't he say we had to bring home our 450 from East Timor? Why didn't we have to bring home our 500 from Solomon Islands? But then, by Saturday, the situation had changed again. By Saturday his office was briefing the press that really he did not mean the lot; he meant only those inside the borders of Iraq. He has not actually said that himself, I do not think—maybe he has and I have missed it—but that is what was being briefed to the media. Then of course we have the member for Lyons's version, which is what I might call the Spanish-Australian Labor version—that is, if you get a UN resolution, if you get a blue-helmet operation, then the member for Lyons thinks that Australia should be part of that operation.</para><para>It represents a very sorry saga of not only policy on the run but also policy confusion, and, worst of all, a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of the threat this country faces. It is not a traditional military threat. The signals you send by your action, by your indecision, by your reacting to events which are designed to divide and confound the free nations of the world, if they are the wrong signals, will do great long-term damage to this country. We have an obligation—I state it in broad political, moral and strategic terms—as a nation, having gone into Iraq, to finish the job. It is as simple as that, and that was a proposition that was put to me, dare I say eloquently, by the member for Griffith. He put it with passion. He put it with a great economy of words. He put it very deliberately. He said, `I don't agree with what you've done, but I think, having done it, you've got to make sure that you finish the task.'</para><para>That has always, in my view, been the Australian way. It has never been the Australian way to cut and run. It has never been the Australian way to take the easy option. It has never been the Australian way to look as though you are influenced by or intimidated by the actions of terrorists. The world did change forever on September 11, and this country had a terrible reminder of how the world changed on September 11 with the events of 12 October 2002 in Bali. The world changed somewhat further again with the attack which occurred in Madrid, because what that showed was the determination of a terrorist group, again, to wreak civilian havoc and murder on the mainland of Europe. It is still not precisely known who was responsible for that attack, although the strong suspicion must be that it was the work of Islamic extremists and people who undoubtedly have some association with al-Qaeda. As to their motives and the causation—the events leading up to that attack—unless you can get into the minds of the terrorists, it is not possible to know.</para><para>But this we do know, and that is that the terrorists who committed that attack and those who are their allies around the world are watching how the world reacts. If the world reacts wrongly, if the world shows confusion and disarray, if the world looks as though it can be knocked off course and be diverted from its resolve in fighting terrorism, not only will those terrorists have murdered almost 200 Spanish citizens but they will have sown a degree of confusion and disorder within the political ranks of the free world. That is why this is not the time to look as though you are influenced by what occurred in Spain, whether that is your motive or not. This is a time to say to the people responsible for that: `We stand shoulder to shoulder with our allies. We stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of Iraq. Although as a nation we differed and quarrelled as to whether we should be in Iraq, we believe that having gone into Iraq we're going to stand there and we're going to finish the job.' That is what this motion is about; it is about sending that signal and demonstrating that.</para><para>It is also an opportunity for this House, in expressing support for this motion, to recognise the many things that have been done by this government—most of them, let me say, readily and immediately with the support of the opposition—since September 11 to strengthen our defence forces, to strengthen the Australian Federal Police and to strengthen our intelligence services. We have more than doubled the provision for our intelligence services. When the latest recruitment by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation is completed, the capacity of that organisation will be at a higher level than it was at the height of the Cold War. We have almost doubled the capacity of the Australian Federal Police. We have put more resources into the Australian Defence Force. All of these things have been necessary, and may I say again that the great bulk of them have enjoyed—and I record my gratitude for this—bipartisan support. That is why I find it distressing, in the national interest—</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Opposition members interjecting</inline>—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

I say to those who sit opposite that, in a way, the view of another group of people as to whether or not bipartisanship is a good thing is more important than my view or the view of the Leader of the Opposition, and that is the view of the Australian people. The Australian people expect a level of bipartisanship in relation to certain matters.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I am not asking for a moment the Australian Labor Party to alter its view about our deployment to Iraq, but I am asking the Australian Labor Party even at this late hour to reconsider the commitment, if the Labor Party wins the next election, to bring our forces home by Christmas. We will have an election sometime towards the end of this year. The Australian people will make their decision. If the Labor Party wins, obviously the Labor Party can then choose to do as a government what it likes, but I am asking it, in the name and the standing of this country at the present time, to reconsider its position. It is one thing to oppose our deployment to Iraq; it is another thing to try and prevent this country doing the job and seeing it through to the end, which has always been the Australian way.</para><para>Can I say to the Leader of the Opposition again—and this was what I said to him a week ago when he first announced this rather strange and capricious policy—that I think he should reconsider and that, if he did reconsider, he would show a strength of leadership and he would show a longer view, a broader view and a view that would capture the support of the Australian people. You do not have to agree with the government on the coalition of the willing in Iraq to agree with the government that the Australians should stay there and finish the job.</para><para>People opposing what we did in Iraq would support the troops finishing the job. What I am asking the Leader of the Opposition to do today is to consider the implications and consider the impact on the standing and reputation of this country. Out of today, we could send to the rest of the world, and very particularly to our 34 coalition allies, a united message that—notwithstanding the fact that the opposition and the government disagreed with each other over the original deployment—we do not disagree, particularly in the wake of Madrid, about the need to stay and finish the job.</para><para>If we were to cut and run, if we were to take the advice of the Leader of the Opposition, which is to pull our troops out on 30 June, we would not only let down the reputation of this country—and that would be the saddest thing of all—but also let down the Iraqi people. We would let down our allies and friends at the worst possible time in the worldwide struggle against terrorism and, worst of all in the immediate context, we would send the wrong signal to the terrorists not only in Iraq but around the world.</para><para>I simply conclude by saying that this motion is about sending a message not only to the Australian people but to the world that it is never the Australian way to cut and run, it is never the Australian way to look as though you might have been intimidated by terrorists, it is never the Australian way to allow our foreign policy to be influenced by terrorists and it will never be the Australian way to let down our close friends and allies.

This is a debate motivated not by Australia's best national interests but, as ever, by the Liberal Party's political interests. For political reasons, the government is now planning to hold our troops in Iraq longer than they need to be there—longer than the government said that they would be there.</para><para>This is a desperate government looking for a political issue, and now it wants to extend the deployment in Iraq indefinitely. This is the government that found it so easy to rush into the war in Iraq saying there were weapons of mass destruction, which in fact did not exist. Now it is a government that is saying it does not know how to get out of Iraq—a government that is committing itself to an indefinite deployment. This is a shameful exercise in party politics instead of the best interests of our troops. It is a shameful exercise in party politics instead of our best national security interests.</para><para>I say these things because the government and the Prime Minister have said them. As recently as two days ago on the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday </inline>program, the Prime Minister outlined a timetable for the withdrawal of the air traffic controllers in Iraq. He said they would be out by May or June. He was asked by Laurie Oakes:</para><quote><para>But - but a third of our contingent could be out by May or June?</para></quote><para>The Prime Minister answered:</para><quote><para>Well, the air traffic controllers could be.</para></quote><para>In his language: cut and run for the air traffic controllers in May or June. What is more—talk about cutting and running—this is what the defence minister, Senator Hill, said in January of this year:</para><quote><para>We expect all requirements to be met in about May or June this year and at that point our air traffic control contingent can look forward to rejoining their families in Australia.</para></quote><para>No ifs or buts and no talk about cutting and running. This was the defence minister, Senator Hill, in January setting a time line for the withdrawal of the air traffic controllers from Baghdad. How can the government move motions against time lines when it has been a government consistently setting time lines for withdrawal out of Iraq?</para><para>Have you ever seen a greater public policy inconsistency than a Prime Minister on a Sunday saying the air traffic controllers are out in May or June and then coming into the House of Representatives on a Monday and putting forward a motion saying time lines are inappropriate? You will never find a greater piece of public policy inconsistency, double standard or rank hypocrisy than a Prime Minister on a Sunday saying, `Look, here is my timetable for getting the air traffic controllers out. It's May or June,' and then coming into the House the following day with a motion that says, `Time lines like that are totally inappropriate. There will be no arbitrary time lines.' What is more, a day later he is here moving the proposition in the House.</para><para>This is a government that has set time lines in the past. There was Senator Hill not only setting the time line for the troops but talking about the joy of the troops as they would rejoin their families in Australia. Now it is a government reneging on the commitment to the troops. It was `build up the expectations for the air traffic controllers, who will be home rejoining their families in May or June'. Now it is a government that wants its members to vote in the House to say there will be no arbitrary time lines. The members opposite should have a bit of compassion for the air traffic controllers. They should honour the word of Senator Hill in January, honour the word and the commitment to rejoin the air traffic controllers with their families and vote down the Prime Minister's hypocritical proposition two days later that we should not have any time lines for the withdrawal of troops from Iraq.</para><para>This is a government reneging on its commitments. It is chopping and changing on defence policy. It had a time line for the air traffic controllers in January, and that time line goes out the window just two days later in the House of Representatives. A government that is chopping and changing with defence policy is a government that does not deserve the trust and confidence of the Australian people. If it cannot make up its mind about something as basic as time lines for the withdrawal of troops out of Iraq, it does not deserve to be in government—it does not deserve to be running the defence policy of this country. You would not see a greater inconsistency anywhere in the management of public policy.</para><para>But it gets worse. If you think that is bad—if you think it is bad to have a time line on Sunday and move a motion against it on Tuesday—then think of what the Prime Minister had to say to the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> magazine on 11 February last year. He was asked by the journalist:</para><quote><para>So our forces would be in and out [of Iraq] fairly quickly?</para></quote><para>The Prime Minister replied:</para><quote><para>Oh, yes, very much so. If there is a final Australian military commitment, it will be of a scale that I've mentioned, and we would see it being of a quite short, specific, duration. I don't see any increase. I don't see any peacekeeping.</para></quote><para>So the journalist, just wanting to get a bit of clarity from the man of the short, specific duration, asked:</para><quote><para>What time frame do you have in mind?</para></quote><para>The Prime Minister replied:</para><quote><para>A very short period of commitment. But I won't try to put weeks and months on it. It will be short.</para></quote><para>There is the Prime Minister of the short time line—the Prime Minister of the short time line for the air traffic controllers last Sunday, and the Prime Minister of the short time line in his interview with the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> magazine in February 2003. Then of course, to back up the short time line for withdrawal out of Iraq, in May 2003 in New York, in the United States itself, the Prime Minister was asked about our commitment in Iraq:</para><quote><para>Do you see it as months or years ...</para></quote><para>He replied:</para><quote><para>Well I certainly don't see it as years.</para></quote><para>Committing, again, to months—the short, specific time line of the Australian Prime Minister.</para><para>But it goes beyond the Prime Minister. If you want some time lines, do not look just at the Prime Minister; go to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. This is what Alexander Downer had to say in March 2003:</para><quote><para>Well the Australian military will continue to make a contribution where it usefully can at the level of the three services and once the war is finished there'll be of course no further contribution for them to make ...</para></quote><para>Not even a time line but rather `no further contribution for them to make'.

There was no military role planned in April 2003. They were not there to cut or run. Then the foreign minister in September 2003 said:</para><quote><para>... we made it clear to the Americans right at the outset, early this year before the war began, that whilst we would make a contribution to the war ... we weren't intending to stay on there for any period of time.</para></quote><para>Not even a short, specific duration; no period of time. Then the foreign minister said the Americans understood that. So much for damaging the alliance by having a disagreement with the United States! The government says months not years and the foreign minister says the United States understands that, but when Labor says months not years the government is trying to make out there is some crisis brewing in Australian-American relations—again the double standard and the hypocrisy of the Howard administration, which has had time lines in place and now, for politically opportunistic reasons, is throwing those time lines right out the window.</para><para>All Labor are doing in moving this amendment and upholding our policy is holding the government to its initial timetable. When the Prime Minister said `months not years', we thought he meant it. It is a pretty simple proposition: when the Prime Minister said `months not years' in May 2003, we thought that is what he meant—a short, specific duration: months not years. That is what Labor are saying now. This is a government that is chopping and changing for political reasons, and I wonder what could have changed the Prime Minister's mind. What could have changed his mind in the last couple of days? What could have changed his mind since that very clear commitment in May 2003? I wonder if the Prime Minister had a bit of politics in mind. I wonder if he had in mind a withdrawal from Iraq. </para><para><inline font-style="italic">Honourable members interjecting</inline><inline font-style="italic">—</inline></para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>K26</name.id><name role="metadata">Latham, Mark, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LATHAM</name></talker><para>—No?

Am I being too cynical? Am I being too sceptical about this man to say that he might have possibly had that in mind? And the thing that has changed his mind in the last couple of days is that his little political tactic has come off the rails. That is why all his time lines—all his short, specific durations: months not years; get the air traffic controllers out—have gone out the window.</para></talk.start></continue><para>He has lost his parade and he has lost his policy in the election campaign. That, quite frankly, is the basic reason why this Prime Minister always changes his mind: it is always for political opportunity and always for trying to put false arguments out about the Australian Labor Party. He says that withdrawal is a sign of weakness, but he never applied that to himself. When he said two days ago that the air traffic controllers were coming out in May or June, was that a sign of weakness? No. This is the double standard and hypocrisy of a Prime Minister who will say one thing on the Sunday and move a motion against it on the Tuesday. Was it weak to say months not years? Not according to the Prime Minister. Was it weak to say the air traffic controllers would be out in a time line of May or June? This is the hypocrisy of a Prime Minister who will say or do anything for political reasons. He has lost his parade and now he has lost his policy. The time line policy of the Howard administration has gone straight out the window.</para><para>The weak and ineffective thing to do in the war against terror was to engage in the folly of the Iraq war in the first place. It is time to judge this government's policies by its outcome. This is the government that said the primary purpose for going to war in Iraq was to find the weapons of mass destruction. Remember the weapons of mass destruction? Internationally everyone is looking for them, but they know they ain't finding them—and Senator Hill said as much last week. None of the weapons of mass destruction was used in the war itself and none has been found since. Young Australians were sent to war for the wrong purpose. They were sent to war under a false doctrine—the doctrine of pre-emption. As it turns out, there was nothing to pre-empt in Iraq. There were no weapons of mass destruction.</para><para>We heard the warnings by the minister for health before the war when he said that this conflict would make Australia a bigger target. Since the war, we know that the truth of that proposition is now widely recognised by the Australian people. This was going to be the big neoconservative production to make the world safer. But they could not find the weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Their doctrine of pre-emption exploded like a cigar in their own face. The `axis of evil' rhetoric has been conveniently forgotten about, but, unhappily for the Australian people, there is now a recognition that the minister for health was right that the war in Iraq would make Australia a more dangerous place and would increase the risk level in this country. So let us judge the government's Iraq policy on the results.</para><para>The third, final and perhaps even most damaging result is that the conflict in Iraq diverted time and resources from the real task. The real task in the war against terror is targeting the terrorists themselves: breaking up their networks in Afghanistan and north Pakistan, catching bin Laden and countering JI in South-East Asia—not waging wars for weapons of mass destruction that do not exist, not waging wars against nation-states but actually targeting the terrorists themselves. The Prime Minister, in his contribution, said something that on this side of the House we found quite surprising. It was his assertion, and it was the first time he has ever said it—what advice has he received and when did he receive the advice?—that the task in the war against terror is now completed in Afghanistan. Where did that assertion come from? Internationally there is a recognition that the war against terror is still very much alive in Afghanistan and on its boundaries. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83T</name.id><name role="metadata">Rudd, Kevin, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Member for Griffith, I do not discourage people from supporting their leader, but I will not tolerate interjections.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>K26</name.id><name role="metadata">Latham, Mark, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LATHAM</name></talker><para>—But here is the Prime Minister, in his political moment in the House, coming up for the first time with his assertion that the task has been completed in Afghanistan. Most international experts and most international opinion will say that that is not right. In fact, there is more work to be done, and if this government had not diverted time and resources from the real task the work in Afghanistan could be done more comprehensively—that is, breaking up the networks in Afghanistan and north Pakistan, catching bin Laden and, in our part of the world, countering JI in South-East Asia.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Twelve months ago, Labor opposed the war in Iraq, and it is hardly surprising, given the government's policy failures—failure after failure after failure—that we have not changed our mind one little bit. In fact, the situation for Australia has grown worse. The level of danger has increased as a result of our involvement in the Iraq war. So the choice for the Australian people is simple. The Howard government had a policy of foreign adventurism for a purpose that was not true, for weapons of mass destruction that did not exist, and now, to top it off, it wants an indefinite deployment in Iraq. It has changed its line, it has got rid of the time lines and it now wants an indefinite deployment in Iraq.</para><para>Labor's policy has a different set of priorities. Our policy has as its priority the defence of Australia and targeting the terrorists in the war against terror. That is the way in which Labor want to use the defence resources of this nation. We want our troops involved either in the defence of Australia or in the war against terror—not tied up in the defence of another country. For Labor it is always the defence of Australia first—it is always Labor that is putting the defence of Australia first. It is hardly surprising that Labor—having opposed the war in the first place and having had our critique of the war confirmed by subsequent events—want our troops back here. It is hardly surprising, given that background. The Prime Minister can quote all the politicians in the world who actually supported the war, but for a political party that opposed it, in all the circumstances it is hardly surprising that we want our troops back here.</para><para>The end of Australia's role as an occupying power at the end of June obviously provides the opportunity. At the end of June, Iraq will have a new sovereign government that is ready to govern. As the shadow minister for foreign affairs, the member for Griffith, said in November:</para><quote><para>The early establishment of an interim Iraqi government would also provide Australia with an appropriate exit strategy from its current formal responsibilities as an Occupying Power ... At present we do not have such an exit strategy.</para></quote><para>That is what the member for Griffith said in November. Now Australia does have such a strategy; it is Labor's strategy—our intention to have the troops home by Christmas. We opposed the war for the right reasons, and now we want our troops home for the right reasons as well.</para><para>Quite frankly, we are used to the critics. It is the same old faces, the same old names and the same old voices that criticised us for opposing the war in the first place that are now opposing our intention to have the troops home by Christmas. We have heard it all before and we are not deterred, because the last time they said these things, time after time as the conflict in Iraq unfolded, they were wrong. And it does not give Labor any joy to say that we were right. There is not any joy in saying that we were right in the circumstances, because resources and time have been diverted from the war against terror, and Australia has become a more dangerous place, and young Australians were sent to war for a purpose that was not true. It does not give us any joy at all to say that those things have come to pass. So too it does not deter us for a moment from the convictions we have now. Defence policy is about choices, and the government is always saying that Australia is overstretched. </para><para>The Prime Minister himself has said that UN peacekeepers in Iraq are inappropriate. I think his words were, `It's not Australia's cup of tea.' He is always recognising that we are overstretched internationally. It is appropriate to withdraw our troops from Iraq at the end of the year under the time line and the scenario that the Labor Party have pointed to. This has always been Labor's intention following the election of a Labor government. We have consistently said that we want our troops home as soon as possible. When we said we wanted them home as soon as possible, we meant it—especially given the advent of a new Iraqi government. This is very much a commonsense approach that makes a choice and basically says we are going to put the defence of Australia and the war against terror ahead of the priorities of the coalition government.</para><para>We heard the Prime Minister say earlier on that we cannot have a timetable to get out of Iraq because he is worried about what al-Qaeda might think. Prime Minister, we are never going to hand our policy over to al-Qaeda. We are not going to hand our sovereign policy and commitments over to al-Qaeda. The logical extension of the Prime Minister's argument is that, if he makes Australian policy according to what al-Qaeda thinks, we will have an indefinite deployment in Iraq; there will never be a time in which the Australian troops can come home. The Prime Minister is handing over the sovereign policy of this country to what al-Qaeda thinks. On that reasoning, he will never find a time on his politically convenient schedule to bring the Australian troops home. </para><para>Labor will never surrender to that type of reasoning. Labor will never surrender the sovereign policy-making of this country to al-Qaeda and what they may or may not think. We are not going to go down the Prime Minister's path. We are going to do the right thing and put up a different strategy to the Howard government—a strategy that says that we do not need the doctrine of pre-emption; we need to target the terrorist networks themselves. We want to build up Australia's self-reliance. We believe in the American alliance. We founded it during World War II under the great Labor Prime Minister John Curtin. We want to be an equal partner with the United States, not a deputy sheriff. We want our troops here to protect us against potential threats on our own soil, in our own region. That is Labor's commitment to self-reliance within the terms and conditions of the American alliance.</para><para>So, too, a Labor government would never take its eye off the neighbourhood. If this government in 1996 had not taken its eye off the Pacific, it could have been anticipating events—worries and insecurities in our own part of the world. Instead of cobbling together rescue packages six or seven years later, it should have been anticipating events—it should have been going to the Pacific forum; it should have been working with PNG and the Solomons well before the problems reached a head. A Labor government always had a proud record of engaging in the neighbourhood, engaging in the region, and we will do that again when next in government.</para><para>A Labor government also wants a department of homeland security—a one-stop shop. They trot this stuff out that we are anti-American. Here we are learning from the American model—a department of homeland security in a federated nation, a one-stop shop where you can get national security coordination between the national government and the states and territories. We also want to upgrade our airport and port security. I have been to airports at Devonport and Burnie where they have 70,000 to 80,000 passenger movements a year but no screening devices for passengers or their luggage. We do not want reviews of port security; we want action. We want a government that takes action for the benefit of the Australian people, instead of an endless supply of reviews and reports.</para><para>When it comes to national security, you cannot trust the Howard government. It is more interested in its own security of tenure than the security of the Australian people. At the end of these debates, the Tories always puff themselves up and say, `We are Tories. You've got to trust us with national security.' When has that ever been true in Australian history? It was not true during World War II; it was not true during Vietnam; it was not true during the Iraq war. You cannot trust them at any turn, at any opportunity, when it comes to the best national security of our great nation. </para><para>This is a government that will always put party politics ahead of policy. This is a government that had time line after time line to take the Australian troops out of Iraq that were there for a short, specific duration, but that went straight out the window the moment the Prime Minister could sniff what he thought was a political opportunity. It is a government that sets time lines and then abandons them a couple of days later. Labor's approach is entirely reasonable. It is the approach that was set out in November, the approach that we have stuck to since the conflict ended last year. There are precedents for these things, precedents for withdrawals. The government did it itself out of Afghanistan in 2002. It happened out of Somalia under the last Labor government in the mid-1990s. </para><para>If the government itself can have withdrawals out of Afghanistan and have time lines initially in Iraq, there is no objection to a Labor government coming in and saying `Unlike the Prime Minister, when we said months not years, we meant it.' I urge the House to support the amendment that I have moved. It is in our best national security interests. You cannot trust this government when it comes to our security. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Is the amendment seconded?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>PG6</name.id><name role="metadata">Macklin, Jenny, MP</name><name role="display">Ms Macklin</name></talker><para>—I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—The original question was that the motion be agreed to.

Furthermore, to indicate that that will, more than anything else, frustrate the leadership of terrorism and Osama bin Laden is even more amazing. That is the only take on the remarks made by the Leader of the Opposition. They stand in stark contrast to what happened during the Second World War and its aftermath when, it is fair to say, the leadership of the Labor Party and the coalition in those times understood full well the importance to the national security of Australia of being prepared to engage in far-flung places both during the time of conflict and after.</para></talk.start><para>I follow that by making the observation that I have never heard such contorted logic as that which allows the Leader of the Opposition to say that, because we are indicating that in May or June or thereabouts this year the Australian air traffic controllers we have deployed in Iraq might be able to come home, that that is somehow confirmation of our hypocrisy. It is no such thing. It is confirmation of our fundamental position that we stay until the job is done. When the job is done, we can withdraw. If the Iraqis are by that time able to run Baghdad International, then we will have completed our task in that regard.</para><para>To paint the absurd opposite proposition: if they are not ready, if they need another month or two months or three months, should we then withdraw and leave Baghdad International without the air traffic controllers they need to operate so that people can get in and out, so that you can deliver the humanitarian aid, so that you can participate in the rebuilding of commercial ties and the economy of the place and the government of the place? What an absurdity! The very point that the Leader of the Opposition holds up as proof, somehow, of our lack of good faith, intellect and integrity on this—as an example of our hypocrisy—is in fact an illustration of the very point that the Prime Minister has been making, which is that we are not quitters. We logically stay until the job is done and then we pull back.</para><para>But I wanted to firstly come today to the role that civilian Australians are undertaking in Iraq as they go about the task of helping that country rebuild in every way. We have people over there helping to feed the people of Iraq. We have people over there seeking to help to rehabilitate agriculture in Iraq. We have people there rebuilding Iraq's oil industry infrastructure—the very basis of its economy—repairing electricity substations, providing communications services, providing humanitarian aid and assistance and helping the Iraqis to design and construct new, better and more democratic governmental institutions. These people are playing a vitally important role which, as I indicated in question time, is appreciated by the very great bulk, I believe, of the people of Iraq and certainly its leadership.</para><para>It also ought to be noted, when we talk about our friends and allies, that we are building on a 50-year-old relationship between Australians and Iraqis and the Middle East more generally. That, in particular, can be illustrated by the very important relationship that has evolved between Australia's wheat growers and the people of that part of the world. The Australian Wheat Board has built a relationship that transcends normal commercial relationships. I was reminded of this last week, when members of the Iraqi Grains Board were out here. They were glad to be here; they were appreciative of what we do. They were plainly appreciative of the long-term and very sincere relationship that exists between the peoples of our two countries. The fact is that generations of Australian farmers have helped to feed generations of Iraqis, through thick and thin and through all the troubled times that Iraq has been through. It is quite a special relationship. And it is that special relationship that saw the government able to choose Trevor Flugge, a former chairman of the Wheat Board, to head the team of agriculture and food security advisers that we sent to Iraq in April last year.</para><para>The basis of that special relationship is that Iraqis and other people in the Middle East see the Wheat Board as representing Australian qualities: we are honest traders, we deliver what we say we will do, we stand by our word, we are fair dinkum and we do not let people down. I think Labor's ill thought through policy puts this special relationship at risk. And it is ill thought through—it is chaotic; it was policy making on the run. Indeed, I suspect that it was more accidental than carefully planned and thought through. It says to the people of Iraq and the Middle East that Australians will not necessarily stay the course, that we will not necessarily keep our word. Of course, the truth—and it has to be faced in these circumstances—is that, if we remove our defence forces from Iraq, our civilians will almost certainly have to follow. Iraq is not yet a safe place. It will not magically become a safe place at some arbitrary line in the middle of this year. That is not going to happen. And the work of our diplomats, our aid agencies and other civilians will not come to an end at that point either; that work will need to continue. We cannot say with certainty just when it will end.</para><para>Going back to the comments I made at the opening of my remarks about the leader of the party that prides itself on being very internationalist, I think there are some very important lessons from history. In the First World War we learnt, I think, that disengagement after the conflict in Europe was a very serious disaster. What it produced was an absolute cauldron of trouble in Germany, which became a breeding ground for great social ills, both domestically and of a sort that was ultimately exported. The parallels are obvious in the sense that, if we were to withdraw before the job is completed in Iraq, it too would become a cauldron that might foment very dark and evil forces which could subsequently be exported.</para><para>Briefly continuing the history lesson: after the Second World War, having learnt the lesson of the First World War, what did the Americans and the Allies—the Australians—do? They did not walk home after VE Day or VP Day; they remained engaged. They provided the force, the diplomatic backup, the economic support and the social support to rebuild and make Europe safe again, both for people in Europe and those in other parts of the world that would have been put at risk. We can think of the Marshall Plan, for which the Americans deserve a lot of credit, and the role we played alongside the Americans in Japan, and extrapolate out of that; we are aware of how much more unsatisfactory a place the world would have been if the Americans and the Allies had not done that. Let me pose this rhetorical question: if we stopped to think about this, how would we react if the Americans were now to say: `We're going to disregard the lessons of history. We're not going to do what we did after the Second World War. We're actually going to withdraw from the Middle East now'? What would our reaction be? We would condemn them—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>PG6</name.id><name role="metadata">Macklin, Jenny, MP</name><name role="display">Ms Macklin</name></talker><para>—Then why did you leave Afghanistan?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

So how can it be that we would then engage in the extraordinary hypocrisy of acknowledging that others should remain engaged until the job was done yet saying that we will walk away before it is done? That is not an option for Australians. It is not a road we can go down.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I think the Leader of the Opposition fell into this by mistake.

The Australian people say that we should stay the course. They are right. And when you make a mistake in politics, the thing a leader does is learn from that mistake and correct it. I plead with the Leader of the Opposition in the national interest and in the international interest to correct that mistake, to back off and to acknowledge that there is a better way to do this, and that is to stay the course.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>27571</page.no><name role="metadata">Macklin, Jenny, MP</name><name role="display">Ms MACKLIN</name><name.id>PG6</name.id><electorate>Jagajaga</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Deputy Prime Minister talks about leaving Iraq, which is of course exactly what this government did in Afghanistan. I do not know why it was all right in Afghanistan but it is not all right to apply exactly the same policy in Iraq. The motion that we are debating today and, most importantly, the amendment that has been moved by the Leader of the Opposition ask the parliament to express its continued support for and confidence in the troops who are still in Iraq—and of course we all do exactly that.</para></talk.start><para>We very much appreciate the work that each and every person is contributing. We do understand, as best we can from so far away, the risks that they take, and we certainly give thanks that there have been no Australian casualties in Iraq. Our troops in Iraq know that they have our full support. They do not need this government playing politics with this issue. They know that both sides of parliament and all the people of Australia both support their work and are very proud of what they do. The government sent them to do a job, and we know they are doing it to the very best of their ability.</para><para>But where the government and the opposition disagree is on when we decide that the job is done. What we have from the Prime Minister today is a very clear understanding that this government wants this to be left open ended. The Prime Minister wants it to be left completely open ended. By contrast, Labor argues that Australia needs a clear exit strategy from our military involvement in Iraq. A clear exit strategy—a very clear timetable for withdrawal—is, in our view, the very wisest approach.</para><para>The Australian parliament should not support an open-ended commitment to troops in Iraq, and that is why we will not be supporting the second part of this motion. The second part of the motion actually contradicts what the government has been saying and doing. It exposes the continuing inconsistency of this government on the involvement of troops in Iraq. The Prime Minister should not be moving a motion that locks our troops into staying in Iraq indefinitely. This motion means that our troops must stay in Iraq regardless of the threats that might be posed in the future to Australia's security. I want to quote something the Prime Minister said back in October 2002. He said:</para><quote><para>... we're not going to commit to any future military involvement anywhere in the world, beyond our capacity. People should understand this, that we have a responsibility or potential responsibilities immediately on our doorstep and I'm very conscious that we don't overstretch ourselves, no matter what the circumstances are.</para></quote><para>Yet that is exactly what the second part of this motion effectively does. The Prime Minister had it right in October 2002, but of course he has done a complete flip—a complete reverse of that position—and he is now saying that our troops must stay in Iraq indefinitely.</para><para>Back in February 2003 the Prime Minister promised that Australia's military commitment in Iraq would be of—and we have heard quite a bit of this repeated over and over from that side of the House—`a quite short, specific duration'. But is that what this motion that we are debating today says? No, of course it does not say that. It says it will be of a long, unspecified duration. Of course we all know that the Prime Minister is doing this because he needs a political distraction—and, unfortunately, he is prepared to use our troops as pretty cheap pawns in his political games. That is really what this is all about.</para><para>By contrast, what you have from the Australian Labor Party is a very responsible approach: to set a very clear exit strategy from our military involvement in Iraq—and the Leader of the Opposition has set that out. Surprisingly, this is actually the same strategy that this government used in relation to the deployment of our troops to Afghanistan. Australia deployed SAS troops in the war against terror in Afghanistan, and the Prime Minister withdrew those troops after the new government in Afghanistan was put in place. Does anyone here think that everything has been resolved and that peace has returned completely in Afghanistan and that there is no need for any further help in Afghanistan when it comes to reconstruction? No-one would suggest that. No-one would suggest that the reconstruction of Afghanistan is completed, but our troops came home when the new government was put in place.</para><para>That is exactly what the Labor Party is arguing in relation to Iraq. The Prime Minister cannot accuse Labor's exit strategy as representing `cutting and running' unless he is prepared to admit that that is exactly what the government did in Afghanistan. After the new government is in place in Iraq—and we expect that to be some time around the middle of the year—Australia's efforts must be to continue to provide humanitarian assistance and economic reconstruction assistance to the Iraqi people. That is what we are committed to do. It is a policy that recognises that rebuilding a country is best undertaken by civilians. That is who should be helping after the end of the war.</para><para>In fact, the government used to support this position. No less than Senator Hill said that the `rebuilding of Iraq will be essentially a civilian task'—a civilian task, according to the Minister for Defence—and will be predominantly through a `contribution provided by the private sector'. That is the view of the current defence minister. Of course that is not politically expedient anymore, so that is not the view of this government. But Labor fully support that view and that is why we believe we can set a goal of having our troops home by Christmas.</para><para>When the Prime Minister says that no arbitrary time should be set for withdrawal from Iraq, he is effectively committing our troops indefinitely-. Back in May 2003 the Prime Minister said that our commitment should be for months, not years. It has already been a year, and through this motion the Prime Minister wants it to go on and on—with no time line, no idea whatsoever when it might come to a close. Labor's position, by contrast, is that withdrawal of our troops from Iraq has to be clear. We have always said that this should take place as soon as practicable once our responsibilities as an occupying power in Iraq have been discharged. The handover of power from the Coalition Provisional Authority to an interim Iraqi government in the middle of the year is of course a critical milestone in this respect. Labor recognise that some Australian military personnel in Iraq are protecting Australian officials working in our representative office in Baghdad. While it is our intention to withdraw our troops, we will consult the Chief of the Defence Force and Foreign Affairs and Trade diplomatic security experts on the likely security needs of these officers at the appropriate time.</para><para>This debate on Australian troop commitments occurs at the same time that the war on terror continues. This debate about our commitment in Iraq has to be able to be undertaken in a much more sensible way than that demonstrated by certain members opposite—especially the member for Parramatta most recently, when he descended into outrageous accusations about Labor's so-called support of al-Qaeda because of our commitment to withdraw the troops from Iraq. It is time we have a sensible debate on this issue so we are able to hold different points of view about the war in Iraq without members of the government descending into making these ridiculous accusations and questioning our commitment to fighting the war against terror.</para><para>This government knows full well that the Labor Party is a very strong supporter of the efforts of not only the government but other governments in the war against terror. We know how critical this is in our region. But Labor's policy is to make sure that our priorities are all about Australia's security—the ongoing war against terror, maintaining the security and stability of our immediate region and, most importantly, the protection of Australians both at home and overseas. We will make the decision to withdraw and deploy Australian defence forces overseas on the basis of these priorities—not according to politically motivated motions that lock our troops into staying in Iraq indefinitely. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>27573</page.no><name role="metadata">Costello, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr COSTELLO</name><name.id>CT4</name.id><electorate>Higgins</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to support this motion in its entirety—particularly the second part, which seems to be the only part which the opposition disagrees with. Let me make it clear that I fully agree with the first part and, from the debate which has taken place, so too apparently does the opposition. The opposition, however, seeks to remove the second part and substitute words of its own. What is that that the opposition opposes in that second part of the motion? Why is it that the opposition cannot bring itself to support these words:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this House:</para><para>...	...	...</para><para>(2)	is of the opinion that no elements of this contingent of Australian Defence Force personnel should be withdrawn until their respective tasks have been completed and that no arbitrary times should be set for such withdrawal.</para></motion><para>Those are the words which the opposition does not support. It does not support the proposition that the force should not be withdrawn until the task has been completed, and it does not support the proposition that there should be no arbitrary time set for withdrawal—and when one sees what the opposition has moved in its place, that is quite apparent, because the opposition says in the proposal it is putting to the House that it believes that the intention of the government should be to return forces to Australia by the end of 2004. Firstly, that is setting the proposition that the troops come home before the job is finished and, secondly, it is setting the proposition that a time limit be placed on the time by which those troops should be brought back.</para><para>How does this disagreement arise between the government and the opposition? We know that the Labor Party opposed Australia's commitment as part of the coalition of the willing to Iraq. We know that the Labor Party believed that Australian troops should not be in Iraq. But once those Australian troops had been deployed and once the evil, tyrannical regime of Saddam Hussein had been overthrown, we expected that there would be agreement between both sides of politics on the proposition that Australia would contribute to the reconstruction of Iraq. Indeed, we thought that if there was criticism the criticism was that Australian troops were not doing enough. The shadow minister for foreign affairs, the member for Griffith, took it upon himself to write to the government urging a greater commitment. So the Labor Party position was, regardless of whether or not the troops should have been there in the first place, that they had a role in the reconstruction of Iraq. For my own part, I believe that Australian troops should have been there. I believe that the world is a better place because the evil dictator Saddam Hussein is no longer running Iraq, and I believe that we can always hold our heads proud because of the way in which Australia and Australian troops contributed to that task.</para><para>There things would have stayed had it not been for an extraordinary interview which the member for Werriwa, the Leader of the Opposition, gave on 23 March of this year—that is, Tuesday of last week. He was being interviewed by Mike Carlton, and he said:</para><quote><para>... our intention is to ensure that once the responsibility is discharged—and that is at the time of the handover to the new sovereign government in Iraq—then Australian troops will come back under a Labor government.</para></quote><para>I ask the House to listen to this carefully. Mike Carlton asked:</para><quote><para>And you would hope they would be home by Christmas?</para></quote><para>The Leader of the Opposition replied:</para><quote><para>Yes, if that timetable of midyear is adhered to then that would be the case. If a federal election is held this year, say the election was in September and there was a change in government, we would be hoping to have them back by Christmas, certainly.</para></quote><para>Did you notice how he interposed an election into his answer? The precondition of bringing the troops home by Christmas was an election. That was not put to him by Mr Carlton; it was interposed directly by him. It was put in deliberately, I believe, so that he could say that a vote for the Labor Party was a vote to bring troops home by Christmas. That is the proposition and that is the way he put it. And he put it quite deliberately. He no doubt put it deliberately because he believed that it would be a vote-winner. The vote-winner would be, on a populist basis: `Vote for me and I will bring the troops home.' He was the one who volunteered the word `election'. Nobody had been talking about an election until he interposed it. At first I thought that it was an error which he would soon correct, but he came into this parliament on the Thursday thereafter and he reinforced the issue. He said:</para><quote><para>Our intention is to have our troops home by Christmas if a Labor government is elected in September.</para></quote><para>Who made this a political issue? The Leader of the Opposition. Who sought to gain votes on it? The Leader of the Opposition. Who sought to tie in the bringing home of the troops as an election issue? The Leader of the Opposition.</para><para>I still cannot fathom why, other than populist politics, he decided to take this role. If I were to speculate, I would speculate along these lines: growing up at the knee of Gough Whitlam, believing that the 1972 election was the most significant election in Australian history, and believing that it led to troops coming home from Vietnam, he needed his own troop withdrawal so that Werriwa of today could match the Werriwa of 1972 and so that he too could have his own little troop withdrawal and match what he believes to be the greatness of former Prime Minister Whitlam. It was always the position of the Left after Vietnam—they were always looking for another Vietnam. There used to be the slogan that the Left had: `Vietnam, Palestine—one struggle, one fight'. They were always looking for the new issue that they could go out and campaign on.</para><para>This poor man's Gough Whitlam had to find some troops that he could possibly withdraw. What reason does he give? He gives this reason: they are needed to defend Australia. That is what he says; that is why they have to come home. Let us just go through the troop commitment that we have: 85 troops guarding the Australian representative office, a 150 Hercules contingent doing airlift support, air traffic controllers in Baghdad, Army trainers in the new Iraqi army, and HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Melbourne</inline>. Every Australian troop is important to Australia, but can it seriously be put to this House that the fact that we have a security detail or a Hercules airlift, or the fact that we have some 50 Army trainers, has weakened the defence of continental Australia? Can it seriously be put that until those troops are brought home, continental defence in Australia is somehow undermined?</para><para>We have a deployment of 450 in East Timor. We have a deployment of 500 in the Solomons. We have managed to do that whilst we have had a commitment in Iraq. As for bringing the <inline font-style="italic">Melbourne</inline> back, we know that the Labor Party does not even believe that it should be engaged in guarding the northern waters, because it believes that a coastguard should be doing that. What the <inline font-style="italic">Melbourne</inline> would actually do when it came back in the defence of continental Australia is an open question. It is complete nonsense to say that they have to be brought back to guard continental Australia. </para><para>Why shouldn't they come back? They should not come back because the job is not finished. That is the reason they should not come back. Why leave early when the job is not done? And, more importantly, why leave early when you run the risk of giving entirely the wrong signal to terrorist forces who would take comfort from such a proposition? One needs to understand the nature of terrorism. Terrorism is not about conventional army doctrines. It is not about invasion and occupation. It is about instilling terror in a domestic population for a political end. Terrorism is the ultimate political act—deadly but political. It takes comfort if the political act induces a change of policy. That is where terrorism takes political comfort. That is how terrorism wins. </para><para>We should not send a message, in the aftermath of Madrid, that could in any way give terrorism comfort. In fact, the message should be to the contrary. It should be this: Australia does not bow to terrorism; there is no point in engaging in terrorism against Australia because, far from weakening the resolve of this country, it merely strengthens the resolve of this country. Now is not the time to bring them out, because the job is not finished. The time is not now to give the wrong signal, because the signal will be misunderstood. The time now is to redouble our efforts in the reconstruction of Iraq, to make Iraq a safer place and a better place, and to engage in reconstruction like we did in Japan after the Second World War, so that we can embrace a new Iraq and the world can be a safer place. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS</title><type>Personal Explanations</type><page.no>27575</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>27575</page.no><name role="metadata">Latham, Mark, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LATHAM</name><name.id>K26</name.id><electorate>Werriwa</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

These qualities are demonstrated beyond doubt when we see the ADF on deployment, whether that be in Bougainville, the Solomons, East Timor, Afghanistan or Iraq. We oppose the war in Iraq, but we support to the hilt our men and women in uniform, who are doing difficult and dangerous work for Australia and difficult and dangerous work for Iraq—which is why we have always said we wanted them home as soon as was safely possible. Our soldiers, our sailors and our airmen are normal Australians like the rest of us. They have mums and dads, husbands and wives, families and friends and they are managing the daily difficulty of long-term separation from loved ones. One thing that is for certain is that all Australians should be proud of their achievements in writing their chapter in the century-long proud history of the Australian Defence Force.</para></talk.start><para>This debate is not about whether or not the parliament supports our troops in Iraq. It has never been about that, and the Prime Minister knows it. It is just plain wrong for this Prime Minister to try to make political capital out this, making our troops the meat in the political sandwich through the construction of this motion. We are all grown-ups here; we all know that that is exactly what the Prime Minister is on about and that that is the political purpose in framing the motion in the way in which he has framed it.</para><para>This government has had an interesting record when it comes to the question of its commitment to the humanitarian interests of the Iraqi people. International humanitarian law is pretty straightforward about this. It is outlined in the fourth Geneva convention, which was born of the experiences of World War II. It says that, if you are an invading force, you assume defined responsibilities in the country in question until such time as a government in that country has been re-established. These are defined as the responsibilities of an occupying power.</para><para>So what happened straight after the war? The Prime Minister was eventually badgered into saying on 17 April:</para><quote><para>We have the obligation of an occupying power under the Geneva Convention.</para></quote><para>Following that, we had ministers slipping and sliding out of that responsibility. Who was it who said on 27 October:</para><quote><para>The issue of whether Australia is an occupying power is open for debate.</para></quote><para>It was the Minister for Defence. Who was it who said in September 2003 that Australia does not bear the full burden of meeting the obligations of an occupying power? It was the Minister for Foreign Affairs. What we had, in the months following the Prime Minister's statement in April, was ministers of this government slipping and sliding out from their responsibilities under the fourth Geneva Convention. And what would we do without the foreign minister? Who was it who said:</para><quote><para>Well the Australian military will continue to make a contribution where it usefully can at the level of the three services and once the war is finished there'll be of course no further contribution for them to make ...</para></quote><para>It was the foreign minister.

Who was it who said:</para><quote><para>... we made it clear to the Americans right at the outset, early this year before the war began, that whilst we would make a contribution to the war ... we weren't intending to stay on there for any period of time. And they understood that.</para></quote><para>Who said that? The foreign minister. Who was it who said:</para><quote><para>... the bulk of our troops, if not all of them, possibly all of our troops would be withdrawn as soon as the conflict is over. We aren't proposing to assist through providing troops for a medium term stabilisation force.</para></quote><para>It was the foreign minister. In answer to the question `Does Australia have an exit plan in mind, in terms of its existing military presence?' who was it who replied:</para><quote><para>We do. Our commitment is that we'll obviously form part of the Coalition of the Willing, which we're doing. When the war is finished we will be more or less withdrawing the Australian military contribution ...</para></quote><para>It was the foreign minister. And here is the grand-daddy of them all. Who said this, in response to a question barely six months ago:</para><quote><para>Journalist: Mr Downer, just quickly, would Australia contribute to a multinational force if one were established, or have we done our bit? </para><para>Mr Downer: We have done our bit. Australia said right at the outset to the Americans, and also to the British, that what we would do is we would contribute to the Coalition of the Willing and support the overthrow of Saddam Hussein ...</para></quote><para>Forget the doctrine on regime change. The answer went on:</para><quote><para>We have done that and we made it clear that we have a lot of priorities in our ... part of the world ... We have other responsibilities in our ... part of the world, for example in East Timor, and that's been well and truly understood.</para></quote><para>Who made that statement? The foreign minister. Here we have Foreign Minister Downer, back in September, articulating something remarkably similar, it seems, to Labor Party policy today—and therein lies the rank hypocrisy of it all.</para><para>Why did they say all these things? Let me give you an explanation. It is because throughout 2003 and 2004 this government have been quietly embarking upon their own exit strategy because the politics of Iraq were going all bad for them. For this mob, national security is first and foremost about domestic electoral politics. Weapons of mass destruction? They cannot find one, not even one under the Prime Minister's desk. Keelty let the cat out of the bag that an attack on Iraq was a contributing factor to Australia being a terrorist target. What we found with the government during the course of 2003 was that they wanted to put this whole thing behind them. If they had a different view, why would they have not murmured a single word of complaint when I said in Baghdad last November:</para><quote><para>The early establishment of an interim Iraqi government would also provide Australia with an appropriate exit strategy from its current formal responsibilities as an Occupying Power under the Fourth Geneva Convention. At present, we do not have such an exit strategy.</para></quote><para>Was there a murmur of complaint from any of the clowns opposite on this question? Not one—not even from the foreign minister. If you want further evidence that this mob are not actually interested, let me ask this simple question of the members of this House: when it comes to Iraq, which members of the occupying powers, which members of the coalition of the willing and which of their heads of government have actually bothered to visit Iraq?

If you want to trace the origins of this decision, which has been made on the run by the Leader of the Opposition, you need to go back to the end of last year when the Leader of the Opposition, upon being elected to that position, got some gratuitous advice from the Greens. Bob Brown of the Greens gave Mark Latham a 10-point plan. One of those points was: end Australia's involvement in the war in Iraq by bringing our troops home before Christmas.</para></talk.start></continue><para>That was advice delivered to the Leader of the Opposition at the end of last year. All of a sudden a political opportunity became apparent to the Leader of the Opposition and he decided to take the advice of the Greens. But you must ask yourself why. It is fairly obvious. He is looking for the support of the Greens in the election that may be held later this year. That is blatantly obvious in the populist move by the Leader of the Opposition in taking this position.</para><para>Some of the people in the Labor Party who think a little bit more deeply do not agree with him. We just heard from one of them—the member for Griffith. He is on the record on many occasions supporting what has been done in Iraq to help the Iraqi people.

We still believe it was right.</para><para>Having also visited Iraq, spoken to Iraqis there, spoken to Iraqis on their visits to Australia and visited our troops in Iraq, I am absolutely committed that that was the right decision. Having spoken to people in Iran—in Tehran and Isfahan—and Kuwait who have suffered at the hands of Saddam Hussein's regime, I am absolutely committed and absolutely believe it was the right decision. I think that, if the member for Griffith were honest, having visited all those places and having spoken to all those people as well, he would agree that it was the right decision.</para><para>It goes without saying, in terms of the current circumstances in Iraq, that you cannot make long-range decisions and forecasts like the Leader of the Opposition is. We need to wait and see how the situation evolves over time. We have a diplomatic mission in Baghdad that needs protecting. We have a responsibility to run air traffic control at Baghdad International Airport. We have a responsibility to some of our commercial operators that are active in the reconstruction of Iraq. There are any number of those. The Deputy Prime Minister outlined a range of commercial interests that are involved in Iraq and have been for a number of years, such as the trade we are doing through the AWB. In a deal announced just last Friday with the Iraqi Grains Board delegation visiting Australia the AWB has a contract for a further 450,000 tonnes of Australian wheat. One of the reasons for that is that the AWB has been involved and engaged with the Iraqi Grains Board for many years, not just in selling the product to Iraq but helping with the logistics of the distribution throughout Iraq.</para><para>We have a number of other companies that are active in the reconstruction process in Iraq. This is about creating a solid economy and nation for the future of the Iraqi people so that they can manage it themselves, so that Iraq can be the strong and vibrant economy that it should be had it not been for the intervention of Saddam Hussein and the Baathist Party over the last 25 years.</para><para>Companies that are in Iraq include: the Worley Group, which going to be participating in the reconstruction of the oil fields in the north with an American company, Parsons; the South Australian agricultural company SAGRIC International and the CSIRO, the government's own commercial body; GRM International; the ANZ Bank; and AWB Limited, which I have already mentioned.</para><para>There is the work that Trevor Flugge has been doing in Iraq to help the Iraqi people re-establish their agriculture department. When I visited Iraq in December of last year I found that the work that the Australian contingent led by Trevor Flugge had done was by far better and further advanced in reconstructing the agriculture department than the work in any other department we visited—the trade department, the oil ministry or whatever. Trevor Flugge certainly has done an outstanding job in that regard.</para><para>But it is still an insecure environment in Iraq. We found that when we were there. Australian troops escorted our delegation from where we were staying at Camp Victory at Baghdad International Airport to visit Paul Bremer and General Nash at the CPA. Going out to Saddam City where the oil ministry is located required the vigilant support of the Australian Defence Force. We salute and recognise the work that they have done. From first-hand experience I can tell you they are very proud of what they are doing and very proud that they are delivering on a task that they have been asked to do by the Australian people. We should never undermine that in any debates in this place.</para><para>They are committed to staying there to finish the job. They do not want to leave Iraq with a job half done. They are professional soldiers; they are professional air traffic controllers; they are professional Australian Defence Force personnel who do not want a base political decision to remove them from an environment where they have not completed the task that they have been set. They want to complete that task so that it goes down in the history books of global relations that Australian professional troops were involved in the liberation of Iraq, in the security of Iraq during the transitional stages, in ensuring that this country developed itself into one of the leading economies in the region and in ensuring that the Iraqi people were able to establish a democratic process that recognised the interests and the rights of the different groups within Iraq and that established a federal structure in Iraq so that the Iraqis can govern themselves equitably well into the future.</para><para>They want to complete the job so that the Iraqi people can take advantage of the great wealth that exists in that country. It is not just wealth from oil and gas reserves. It is one of the wealthiest agricultural countries in the region. They have water in the two rivers that flow through Iraq, the Tigris and the Euphrates. They have established irrigation systems. They have established agriculture. Between that and the fabulous wealth from the oil reserves they have, the Iraqi people can certainly live with a much higher standard of living than they have been experiencing for the last 25 years.</para><para>That is the role the Australian Defence Force want to play. That is the job the Australian Defence Force want to complete in Iraq. They do not want their term there shortened. They do not want their job truncated and cut off before they are finished it. These people are professionals. I put it to you that this announcement—this policy position that has been taken by Labor on the run to try and exploit the politics of the day, particularly following the bombings in Madrid—is nothing short of a populist move by the Leader of the Opposition in deference to the instructions that he received at the end of last year, and again this year when he visited Tasmania, from the leader of the Greens, Senator Bob Brown.</para><para>We should recognise the great difference in the position of the shadow spokesman for foreign affairs, the member for Griffith, who tried valiantly this afternoon to meld his position into the position of the Leader of the Opposition. But the public record in the media shows that he has a totally different position and that he believes that the troops should be kept there and that we should keep our shoulder to the wheel to finish the job off in Iraq. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>27581</page.no><name role="metadata">McClelland, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McCLELLAND</name><name.id>JK6</name.id><electorate>Barton</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We heard today the government's characterisation of statements by the Leader of the Opposition as representing a cut and run strategy.

That interview was with the radio presenter Mike Carlton, who, for those who are interested, set out the text of the interview in last Saturday's <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald.</inline> These are the words that the Prime Minister characterises to the Australian people as representing a cut and run strategy.

We would all like that to happen; that should be something we all aspire to. But how long is it going to be before a country that has been racked by civil war for well over a century and racked by religious and philosophical divisions of all kinds is capable, as a matter of custom and practice, of recognising different groupings within its community?</para></talk.start></continue><para>The Treasurer all too frequently picks up on interjections. What he will ignore are interjections that take him nowhere. The consistent interjection from our side, despite the protests of the Deputy Speaker, was, `When is the job going to be finished?' Of course it is going to be finished when there is a new regime in power. That was made clear before Australian troops were committed. Indeed, as the Leader of the Opposition said, the Prime Minister in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> of 11 February 2003—and I do not think the Prime Minister has sought to clarify it—said in answer to the question, `What time frame do you have in mind?':</para><quote><para>A very short period of commitment. But I won't try to put weeks and months on it. It will be short.</para></quote><para>Now we are talking about ensuring that Iraq becomes one of the leading economies in the region and waiting until the Iraqi people are capable of recognising the different groupings and working as an effectively functioning democracy. As for the commitment of the Australian troops, they have been more than dedicated and they have been more than brave in serving the interests of not only the Australian community but also the international community. They are going to be very disheartened to know that their commitment there is now open-ended. Despite the promises that this government made to the Australian people, despite the commitment the government made to them, they are there for an indefinite period.</para><para>Of course it is the Australian way to see it through. But again you have to ask the question which the government has not answered—when is it through? The commonsense answer, and the expectation of the Australian people, was: when the hostilities are over and when there is a transition to an Iraqi government. You are not going to instil democratic principles through military force; they are inconsistent concepts. You are going to instil democracy and democratic principles by providing humanitarian, economic and civil assistance to a new government—that is where both parties are in raging agreement about what must be done.</para><para>In terms of the misallocation of priorities, unquestionably our commitment to Iraq has distorted what should be our focus on Australia. The four-month engagement cost in the order of $750 million. If you ask yourself, Mr Deputy Speaker, what else that money could have been spent on, it is port security, regional airport security, public transport security or, indeed, fighting regional terrorism, actually breaking up regional terrorist cells, breaking up the crime syndicates that fund them and assisting our neighbours to arrest them. Of course that money would have been far better spent in our region. As for the message that we send to terrorists that are likely to harm Australian citizens—namely, the terrorists in our region—what is going to instil the greatest fear: hearing that our troops will be in Iraq until it becomes a leading regional economy and the Iraqi people learn principles of tolerance, or that their cells will be broken up and they will be arrested? Of course it is the latter.</para><para>The Labor Party is firmly committed to the United States alliance, unquestionably so. It was last century—and it will be this century—Australia's primary ally. But there is a lot we can be doing to assist the security of not only the United States and Australia but also our region simply by working with the United States in our region. For instance, on my recent trip to the United States I met with representatives of the Joint Interagency Task Force West, which is a combination of the United States Coast Guard, the FBI, the United States Army, the United States Navy, the United States Air Force and the United States Marine Corps, all focusing on the fight against narcotics and, related to that, the fight against terrorism. The Joint Interagency Task Force West are this year moving their whole operations to Hawaii. Why? Because, as they told me repeatedly during my visit, `You guys are living in a dangerous neighbourhood.' The reality is that Australia, in South-East Asia, is living in this day and age in a very dangerous neighbourhood. Yes, events in Europe are of concern to international security, but our immediate security relies on where we can be most effective—our region.</para><para>We are seeing the Joint Interagency Task Force West work to develop partnerships in Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia, through programs such as Train the Trainer; assisting those countries with maritime security; and assisting them with resourcing. They are developing partnerships to fight the narcotics trade. I know the minister for health expressed concern about narcotics today; the flood of narcotics that is going to come down through Afghanistan and South-East Asia will be truly terrifying. Unless we wake up to the reality that narcofinance is going to fund terrorism and focus on our region, Australians are going to be significantly at risk. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>27583</page.no><name role="metadata">Abbott, Tony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ABBOTT</name><name.id>EZ5</name.id><electorate>Warringah</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Health and Ageing</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—What we are seeing today is a sad day for the Australian Labor Party. It is a sad day for the Australian Labor Party because the honourable traditions of Curtin and Chifley have been dumped in favour of the tradition of Gough Whitlam. The honourable tradition of Curtin and Chifley of constructive and principled engagement with the wider world has been dumped in favour of the tradition of Gough Whitlam and unilateral withdrawal from inconvenient commitments. I hope members opposite might recall the words of that great Australian, that great Prime Minister, a man who sent Australian forces to Japan as part of the British Commonwealth occupation forces, not to fight a war but to build peace. Let us remember the words of Ben Chifley, who said that the Labor Party's light on the hill was to work for `the betterment of mankind, not only here but anywhere we may give a helping hand'.</para></talk.start><para>That light on the hill has been extinguished because, according to the Leader of the Opposition today and the reluctant conscripts in this unworthy cause that he has press-ganged them into, the light on the hill is all very well as long as people's commitment is not expected to run past Christmas time. They are committed to all the good causes in the world until Christmas time. The Leader of the Opposition said today that the Labor Party were committed to bringing home the troops by Christmas and they were committed to the right policy for the right reason. Why is Christmas the ultimate strategic date? Why is Christmas the only date that counts? Why is Australia's commitment to the good causes that we are involved in limited by Christmas?</para><para>The shadow minister for foreign affairs is a man of decency, integrity and intelligence who for 12 months has been arguing for Australia to put its shoulder to the wheel and to increase rather than reduce its commitment to the building of a new and peaceful Iraq. He came in here today, and what on earth could he say, having been comprehensively shopped by his leader? He mouthed the mantra that the Labor Party has been mouthing ever since the Iraq expedition—he said, `Of course we support the troops, but we don't want them to do their job.' First of all, they did not want them to do the job of ridding Iraq of Saddam Hussein, and now they do not want them to finish the job of building a stable and peaceful civil society in Iraq.</para><para>Let me make this very clear—today's resolution is not about the war; it is about the peace. It is not about waging war in Iraq; it is about building a stable civil society in that benighted country. It is not about opting into the war. That matter has been dealt with. It is about Labor's attempt to opt out of building a peaceful and better society in Iraq. The government's position is quite clear. We cannot cut and run on the people of Iraq. They have suffered enough, and they do not want now to be abandoned by countries like Australia which can help them to build a new and peaceful civil society. You cannot contribute to removing an evil regime—and it was an evil regime—and not try to build a stable, prosperous and secure future for the people who had to live under Saddam Hussein and his henchmen for so many years.</para><para>The government and the opposition have often disagreed on many topics in this place. We certainly disagreed furiously on the merits and wisdom and the rights and wrongs of sending our troops to Iraq in the first place, but we had never disagreed about the importance of Australian troops staying in Iraq until their job was done. We never disagreed about that until this week when, driven by polls, driven by populism and driven perhaps—who knows?—by the terrible events in Madrid, the Leader of the Opposition came in here and made new policy, and went on radio and committed the Labor Party not only to withdrawing the troops by Christmas but to withdrawing them even by the middle of the year. Let us not just take my word for that. Let us quote Greg Sheridan, the distinguished journalist and expert on foreign affairs. Speaking of the Leader of the Opposition, he said:</para><quote><para>He changed the Labor Party's policy on Australian troops in Iraq for no discernible reason, apart from the fall-out from the terrorist bombings in Spain.</para><para>This is not a happy moment for the nation.</para><para>...	...	...</para><para>But the step he has taken is extremely dangerous, because he has made it look as though Australian policy interacts with al-Qaeda attacks.</para><para>Certainly, this would not have been Latham's intention, but the result must surely be to give al-Qaeda a further incentive to conduct a bombing in Australia before the next election.</para></quote><para>It is not just detached journalists who have made these sorts of comments. We have even had none other than the former chief of staff to the former Leader of the Opposition, Michael Costello, who said:</para><quote><para>As Iraq today is clearly integral to the fight against terrorism, which Labor strongly supports, why undermine it by calling for their withdrawal? </para><para>Most worryingly, the terrorists seem to believe that the lesson from Spain is that a terrorist attack can change governments in democracies.</para></quote><para>Why wouldn't they believe that, having listened to the Leader of the Opposition? The Leader of the Opposition does not just want Australian troops out of Iraq; it seems that he wants Australian troops out of all places other than continental Australia. For instance, in the matter of public importance debate just last week, the Leader of the Opposition defined the Australian Labor Party as follows:</para><quote><para>Always the defence of Australia first and foremost, not expeditionary forces.</para></quote><para>This is a very significant statement. He does not only want our troops out of Iraq; he wants them out of Afghanistan, he wants them out of the Solomons, he wants them out of PNG and he wants them out of East Timor. One of the greatest things that Australia has ever done was to contribute to the liberation of East Timor after 500 years of colonialism. Our troops are there for the very best of reasons. They are working for the betterment of mankind, not just here but wherever we can lend a helping hand, and under the new Latham doctrine those troops should be out.</para><para>This debate is about many things. It is about our responsibilities to the people of Iraq. It is about our history and culture as a nation which does not cut and run. Obviously the defence of Australia and commitment to the armed forces of Australia should not be a matter of party politics, but the Leader of the Opposition has chosen to politicise our commitment to Iraq by junking the honourable and correct position that the member for Griffith has articulated for so many months. In so doing, he has raised the question of his fitness for high office, and obviously the people of Australia are now asking themselves who should be trusted with our national security: should it be a Prime Minister who has guided us through the most significant challenges we have faced in the post-war period, or should it be an opposition leader who seems to think that the defence of Australia begins at Circular Quay and that it is somehow illicit to send Australian troops anywhere except to continental Australia?</para><para>The Leader of the Opposition likes to talk about a ladder of opportunity; I think it is high time that he started contemplating a ladder of learning. The first rung is to maintain self-control—and, good on him, he has more or less done that. The second rung is learning to admit your mistakes—learning to admit that you are wrong and to withdraw gracefully. The third rung is working with colleagues, including colleagues who know more than you do, like the member for Griffith. The fourth rung is understanding that you do not make policy on the run about something as important as national security. The fifth rung of the ladder of learning is that you put aside your instinctive hostility to the United States and work with the United States when it is in Australia's national interests to do so.</para><para>I call on the Leader of the Opposition to correct the mistake: you have made a historic mistake that is out of character with this country; it is even out of character with the Australian Labor Party.

He is rattled at the thought that a historic fourth term is slipping through his fingers. He is rattled that he has no exit strategy. He is rattled at the realisation that the truth about his government's role in taking the people of Australia to war against Iraq is being exposed to all and sundry. We went not to prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction, as he told this House in his first motion on war in Iraq, but for a regime change.</para><para>I regret that the government has not seen fit to allow us more time for a wide-ranging substantive debate on this matter, forcing my cross-bench colleague, the member for Calare, and me to share this speaking slot. We had no debate before going to war—the government gave this House no such opportunity—and now we are having this emasculated, highly politicised discussion. In rising to speak, I am reminded of something the Prime Minister said nine years ago—back on 25 August 1995, to be precise. It is something which goes to the heart of the motion now before us. He said:</para><quote><para>... truth is absolute, truth is supreme, truth is never disposable in national political life.</para></quote><para>How things have changed.

The same man who told us that our troops would be committed in Iraq for months not years wants an open-ended deployment. This is the same man who told us that the war was about weapons of mass destruction but who now says it was about regime change. Now we know the truth: truth is not absolute, truth is subservient to political whim, truth is disposable in public life—at least for some.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>27586</page.no><name role="metadata">Andren, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDREN</name><name.id>KL6</name.id><electorate>Calare</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This debate is a further politicisation of our defence forces in the same way as they were shamefully politicised during the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline> episode and the `children overboard' affair. This government is being forced to defend its folly in following America into Iraq by trying to drive a wedge yet again into the electorate over this parliament's loyalty to its troops who are engaged in active duty for the first time in our history, as far as I can recall, without the support of the wider free world. To use the Prime Minister's words: this `has never been the Australian way'.</para></talk.start><para>It is ironic that we are here debating our involvement in Iraq for the first time since the invasion not because the Prime Minister thinks the issue should be debated but because an opposition leader had the temerity to suggest that our troops should not be there and that our defence responsibilities lie at home and close to home. So this is about politics, not principle. Point (1) of this motion goes without challenge, but point (2) asks this House—and, by extension, the Australian people—to endorse an open cheque: an unlimited role in the occupation of Iraq. It asks us to stay in Iraq until respective tasks have been completed. It is an invitation to get bogged down in a quagmire the likes of which we have not seen since Vietnam.</para><para>In today's newspaper poll the question, had it been turned around to read, `Do you support the withdrawal of Australian troops as soon as possible?' would also have got the 60 per cent yes vote the government is seeking on this motion. We are in Iraq at the bidding of the Americans, not the world community. We are there on the back of lies about the threat from weapons of mass destruction and the urgency of toppling Saddam Hussein to counter terrorism. We are there to prop up flawed US foreign policy. It is our job as a friend to help the US develop policies that truly develop constructive international engagement, in the words of the member for Warringah.</para><para>In taking action that is illegal under international laws and conventions, we have in fact increased the threat of terrorism. Unless and until the international community supports all international forces in Iraq, we should have no role there without UN endorsement. That is why, under standing order 178, I attempted to move an amendment to the existing motion that would have said: `and is of the opinion the continuing presence of Australian Defence Force personnel in Iraq be only at the specific request and under the authority of the United Nations in agreement with the Iraqi interim government.' That this amendment has been blocked by the government shows that it is not serious about dealing with this matter in any serious way.</para><para>On 16 October last year the UN authorised a multinational force to be in Iraq, but this does not apply to the coalition of the willing, who are regarded as an occupying force. Any countries outside the coalition are in Iraq under UN resolution 1511 of 16 October. After the handover of power on 1 July, the occupying powers can either become part of the UN multinational force or negotiate with the new Iraqi interim government. This is not adequate. As far as most Australians are concerned, our continuing presence must be endorsed by the UN and any presence must be under the UN banner and the blue helmet—something I note that the PM seemed to deride in a reference to the member for Lyons.</para><para>Unless the government—indeed, the parliament—is prepared to consider an amendment such as mine, the political cynicism of the Prime Minister's motion stands exposed for what it is: a piece of wedge politics designed to create division not only within this parliament but in the wider Australian community, a community that overwhelmingly rejected Australia's involvement in Iraq even before the spurious nature of the reasons given for our involvement was exposed.</para><para>My colleague the member for New England is ready and prepared to support my amendment, blocked as it is by the procedures for dealing with the question before the chair. Today's Nielsen poll shows that 60 per cent of Australians do not want to abandon the Iraqi people, but I would argue that the same 60 per cent would want Australia's presence to be under UN sanction. UN troops under other control than that of America, Britain or Australia would help defuse the explosive belligerence and festering resentment towards occupying forces. Notwithstanding the terrorist attack on the UN compound in Iraq, it will only be a sustained UN armed peacekeeping presence and civilian backup—medical, social and political, of the kind that we offered in East Timor with the Electoral Commission and others—that will neutralise attempts to foment civil war.</para><para>This motion as it stands without amendment is about shoring up the illegitimate actions of the coalition of the willing. Poland and Spain have already stated how they believe they were conned. So, given that the parliament will not consider my amendment, I shall abstain from any vote on part (2) of the motion and, if the points are not separated, I will abstain on the entire motion because, unaltered, the motion is nothing more than an election year stunt.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>27588</page.no><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name><name.id>0J4</name.id><electorate>Berowra</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Attorney-General</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I support very strongly the motion moved by the Prime Minister and particularly its continued expression of support for and confidence in the 850 Australian Defence Force personnel currently deployed in and around Iraq. I support strongly the resolution that no elements of the contingent of Australian Defence Force personnel should be withdrawn until their respective tasks have been completed and that no arbitrary time should be set for such withdrawal. I have looked at the amendment proposed by the Leader of the Opposition, which is essentially to substitute for the expression of opinion that the Prime Minister has invited us to support—that is, that Defence personnel should remain until their tasks have been completed—the expression of support for a defined exit strategy. The government does have an exit strategy: it is reflected in the fact that personnel have been withdrawn, tasks have changed and, as it is possible to make changes in the context of the broader strategic situation, they have been made.</para></talk.start><para>The rub of the matter is in paragraph 2(d) of the amendment, where the opposition express very clearly that their view is that our obligations will only have been effectively discharged with the intention of returning our forces to Australia by the end of 2004. In other words, what the opposition have confirmed through the amendment proposed by their leader is that they are quite determined, as we have said, to cut and run before the tasks are finished, because they have provided for an end date, an arbitrary date—one that bears no relationship to the job that has to be done or the tasks to be undertaken.</para><para>I agree with the Leader of the Opposition in one respect and also, I think, with the comments from my counterpart the member for Barton, the shadow minister for homeland security, that principal in the approach that we should take in this matter is Australia's national interest—in other words, the judgment we should always make is what is in Australia's best interests. The fact is that, if you look at the role that Australia has been involved in, our troops have been performing important tasks, vital to the future and the security of Iraq and the region. Our view is that it is not enough to remove Saddam Hussein and then walk away—it is wrong to start the job and not finish it. If you look at comments that have been made, a comment made by the member for Griffith after he had visited Baghdad was that protective security, as it relates to the wellbeing of several hundred Australian troops still in the country, is of paramount importance. The fact is that Australians are playing a very important role. It is a continuing role. The tasks may vary, but I cannot see how, in an environment that has not been secured, anybody can responsibly argue—particularly in the case of the defence forces that provide for the security of Australian diplomatic and other personnel—that those people should be removed by an arbitrary date.</para><para>The fact is that the opposition, by supporting this resolution, is making it clear that it is prepared to stand by its leader—and I think he is weak and ill informed on these matters—whatever the cost. The fact is that the opposition has changed its position in relation to Australian troops in Iraq. It has demonstrated, by doing so, its inability to deal with complex and challenging issues. It highlights the unwillingness of the Leader of the Opposition to seek advice, particularly from those who are expert in these matters—the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Defence generally.</para><para>The opposition leader has shown his inexperience and weakness in dealing with these matters. That was demonstrated today by the support that the member for Cunningham gave to the position taken by the opposition in this matter. The comments made by my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs pointed to the fact that Labor has been influenced in these matters by the Greens' 10-point plan. That is quite clear. Their 10-point plan was about ending Australia's involvement in the war in Iraq by bringing our troops home by Christmas, and of course we heard in a radio program the Leader of the Opposition essentially being flushed out in relation to the setting of that timetable. It is quite clear that, even if it had been discussed by the opposition, no decision had been announced 12 months ago on a troop withdrawal. If you look at some of the comments made by the member for Griffith, standing on their own, you would have to ask yourself, without any other corroboration, whether that assertion is in fact true.</para><para>I found that the most disingenuous comments today from the Leader of the Opposition were those in terms of the sceptical approach he took to critics. I have been quite surprised by the way in which on this issue commentators have almost universally condemned the approach taken by the Leader of the Opposition. There is a wide range of them. I do not intend to mention all of them, but I think to refer to them as `the same old critics' belittles people who have a very substantial and independent capacity to comment on issues and for whom I have some respect. I refer to Michelle Grattan. I have a great deal of respect for her, because I have found her to be one of the most professional journalists in checking the authority of the quotes that she is going to use. She said:</para><quote><para>The precise nature of the Opposition pledge became clear only in response to questions, which contributes to the perception of ad hocery.

Australia does not have a Prime Minister of the character of Curtin, who was prepared to stand up to Churchill and Roosevelt—and not only stand up to them, but also override them and order our troops home. One would have to think that, if John Howard had been Prime Minister then, in those dark hours of the Second World War, our troops would not have been brought home at that time—a time so crucial to the future of this nation. Instead, Australia has a Prime Minister who is not here for the long term but who is preparing for the next election on the basis that, whatever the outcome, he will cut and run. Australia has a Prime Minister who will say anything and do anything simply to get himself over the line at the next election. Indeed, what is in the Prime Minister's focus is not the security of Australia but securing his own future.</para><para>This motion before the House is an example of a Prime Minister who is failing in the polls, losing support in the party room and, indeed, leading a party of members who are close to panic. This motion today is a reflection of that panic. It is a reflection of this Prime Minister's inability to put before the people of Australia a strategy covering the future of Iraq or an exit strategy for our troops stationed in Iraq. This Prime Minister instead has one strategy—it is one aimed at hurting Labor and Latham but which, ultimately, may well hurt Australia. It is not a strategy aimed at the war against terrorism or at the security of Australia; it is just a political strategy. I want to say to the House and the Prime Minister that it will not work. Offensive motions like the one that he has rolled up to the House today will not work either.

They were not just buying a very good value for money asset; they seem also to have bought a guarantee of ever-increasing profits. The Howard government will smooth the way. It will make sure that no consideration for the residents of Sydney will get in the way of the exponential profits that Sydney Airports Corporation Ltd expects. Recently we saw the Minister for Small Business and Tourism double the duty-free allowance, handing the airport a fine increase in its profit stream. The trouble was of course that he forgot to ask the states, who have to approve the increase.</para></talk.start><para>Much worse are the expansion plans which the Minister for Transport and Regional Services recently rubber-stamped. It must seem bizarre to people who do not live in Sydney that we spend so much time talking about the airport. But consider this: at the moment the number of people in Sydney affected by serious aircraft noise is the same as the number of people who live in Darwin. In 20 years time, serious aircraft noise will affect the same number of people as the total population of Tasmania. That will mean that almost half a million people will stop talking when a plane passes overhead; they will not be able to hear the TV or sleep at night.</para><para>This expansion means a tripling of passenger movements. It means that movements will increase from 26.4 million in 2000-01 to 68.3 million in 2023-24. The government like to say that bigger aircraft will solve this problem, but in reality Sydney Airports Corporation's own figures show that aircraft movements will also double. As well as a tripling of passenger numbers and a doubling of aircraft movements, there will be a tripling of aircraft noise. Currently aircraft noise substantially affects about 125,800 residents who live within the 25 ANEF—Australian noise exposure forecast—zones. There are 4,300 people living in 1,600 homes that need to be insulated against aircraft noise. Even if there were no residential growth in the inner suburbs of Sydney, the number of people affected by this plan would triple in the next 20 years to 389,000 people living in 17,000 insulated homes. There is no chance that the number of people living in these suburbs will not increase. Urban consolidation is happening more in these suburbs than anywhere else in New South Wales. Anyone driving from Kingsford Smith airport into the city will have seen the building going on in Green Square. Another 28,000 people will be moving into that suburb over the next 10 years. It is easy to see how the number of people substantially affected by aircraft noise could top 500,000 under this plan.</para><para>The New South Wales state government's submission on the draft master plan says:</para><quote><para>Some suburbs now relatively unaffected will be (almost) entirely under the noise paths—Summer Hill, Ashfield, Annandale and Rosebery ... some residents will be exposed to 284 flights a day, every day—on some days as high as 451 movements.</para></quote><para>I believe that 51 suburbs which are not currently affected by airport noise will become affected under this master plan. All of this comes at a time when families, schools, hospitals and nursing homes are still struggling to get the insulation they need to lead normal lives. In answer to a question on notice from the shadow minister for transport, the Minister for Transport and Regional Services said that, while he had collected over $35 million in 2002-03 from the government's noise levy on Kingsford Smith airport, he had spent only $8.5 million on insulation. He collected $35 million and spent $8.5 million. In fact, the figures are likely to fall in coming years, to $6.5 million next year and almost nothing in the next three years. The minister should explain why he continues to collect the noise insulation levy when he is not spending the money on homes, schools, nursing homes and hospitals which are badly noise affected but which fall just metres outside the eligibility zone.</para><para>The master plan means abandoning noise sharing. Sydney Airports Corporation Ltd say they will not abandon the 80 movements an hour cap but, even if they meet the cap every hour of the day, that means using the parallel runways a lot more. Using the parallel runways means that we cannot have noise sharing as it is at the moment. The use of the parallel runways will be extended to up to 14 hours a day or even conceivably the 17 hours a day that the airport operates. Multiply 17 hours a day by 80 movements an hour and conceivably there will be 1,360 movements a day. That means the abandoning of noise sharing. It also means that even if there is a very short delay, due to bad weather or a bomb threat at Sydney airport, the backlog could last all day. It means that the cap and the curfew would have to be breached just to get through the flights that were scheduled for that day.</para><para>The master plan also proposes the building of 240,000 square metres of commercial and retail space. It is obvious that this will have a definite negative impact on local residents and businesses. Sydney Airports Corporation says of course that it has no responsibility to provide adequate transport, let alone to consider the effects on nearby residents and businesses. Bulky goods handling will put more trucks on the road. Retail precincts in these airports are designed to attract people who are not flying. That means that they will be sucking business out of all the neighbouring shopping centres. Eastgardens and other nearby shopping centres are likely to see a dramatic decline in their business. It also means increased traffic on the roads around the airport, including very heavy traffic, because there will be more trucks handling the bulky goods that SACL is proposing to run through the airport precinct.</para><para>Road congestion is going to increase. The master plan outlines the trebling of on-site car parking to over 14,000 places. That is very profitable for the airport owners. We all know how much it costs to park at Sydney airport. There is absolutely no consideration for traffic on local roads and traffic congestion. Kingsford Smith airport already has twice as many car parks as the biggest shopping centre in the Southern Hemisphere. If commercial and entertainment plans go ahead—they are talking about a leisure precinct as well—the number of people driving to the airport will increase dramatically. The master plan will bring an extra 20,000 cars on the roads per hour in peak hour every morning. The air pollution and noise that go with that road transport are obviously going to affect the residents around the airport. We should instead be encouraging people to use public transport.</para><para>What is really interesting about this proposal and what makes it such a great business proposition for the owners of the airport is that the profits are taxpayer subsidised. The New South Wales government is expecting to spend about $2.7 billion on road infrastructure around the airport to support the airport expansion if it goes ahead. Once again, the airport owners are seeking to privatise the profit and make the taxpayers of New South Wales pick up the tab. The state government has no right to levy taxes on the airport; it is subject only to Commonwealth law and Commonwealth taxes. So New South Wales gets no land tax, no parking levy and no section 94 developer levies. It would not be so bad if this restriction related only to the aviation aspects of the airport business, but it does not; it obviously relates also to the commercial aspects—the retail precincts, the parking and so on. It means that the taxpayers of New South Wales receive no contribution from the airport to spend on public transport, servicing the airport or the local roads that need upgrading. The profits go straight into the pockets of the airport shareholders.</para><para>The government keeps saying that it is possible to run more aircraft through Kingsford Smith airport. That is true. It is technically possible to run more aircraft through Kingsford Smith airport. We can expand aircraft and passenger movements, but do we want to? How much noise, how much pollution, how much traffic and how much road congestion is too much? People living in the inner city and the inner suburbs accept that there is a trade-off for the convenience of living close to the city, but everyone reaches their limit. There will come a day when this curfew and cap are unsustainable. By that time, all of the sites near Sydney will have been built out and there will be no alternative but to abandon the cap and curfew. Unless the government plans now for a second airport, buys the land and sets aside the site, we will reach saturation at Kingsford Smith airport and we will have nowhere to go but to get rid of the cap and the curfew.</para><para>The other thing to remember about the cap on aircraft movements is that 80 movements an hour is a hell of a lot of aircraft noise—it is a hell of a lot of planes overhead. Even if the cap were reached but not breached every hour, the increased burden would be intolerable. At the moment, there are quiet times of day, and I can tell you that the residents look forward to them and breathe a sigh of relief. But the proposal in the master plan is to fill out these quiet times of day and not waste a single minute, so those 80 aircraft movements an hour will be there every hour, 17 hours a day. Certainly, that is in the best interests of Sydney Airports Corporation Ltd, but it is not in the best interests of Sydney residents. The proposal has been opposed by local councils, by the New South Wales government and, perhaps most significantly, by the Sydney Airport Community Forum, the minister's own hand-picked consultative group. It has criticised the master plan and it supports the building of a second Sydney airport.</para><para>Of course, Labor has an alternative—that is, to build a second airport. We must build a second airport for Sydney. The costs of not building a second airport are obvious. There is not only the cost of noise and pollution for Sydney residents but also the economic cost estimated to be $2.3 billion by 2016. That is the loss of 17,000 full-time jobs. We have to retain the cap and the curfew at Kingsford Smith airport and also the noise-sharing arrangements that we have in the long-term operating plan. If you have those 80 movements every hour, that is going to put a lot of pressure on noise sharing. Noise sharing will be abandoned. We need to make sure that all those who need noise insulation get it. And we should give particular attention to schools, nursing homes and hospitals, not just domestic homes. At the moment, we have the absurd situation that two families living on opposite sides of the street might be treated differently for the purposes of noise amelioration.</para><para>Unfortunately, the delays associated with the building of Badgerys Creek airport mean this solution has slipped from our grasp. It would have been the best solution, but it is no longer available to us. When we planned to build at Badgerys Creek, the economic benefits which would have flowed to the area were substantial. It is estimated that Badgerys Creek airport would have created about 33,000 ongoing jobs and another 8,400 during the construction phase. Public transport links and roads would have been upgraded.</para><para>The government was not interested in creating these extra jobs. It is not interested in the noise and pollution effects of the exponential growth of Kingsford Smith airport, so it has put the problem off for another day. Someone else will deal with it down the track. Labor, in contrast, will build a second airport. We will look at sites in the southern highlands, south of the Nepean River, and we will ensure that the chosen site has minimal impact on the local environment and local populations. We will also make sure it is part of an integrated transport plan.</para><para>Incidentally, the Greens—and I notice the member for Cunningham is here—do not want Kingsford Smith airport expanded but they do not want a second airport either. I will not even waste time talking about how stupid that is.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>R36</name.id><name role="metadata">Albanese, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Albanese</name></talker><para>—Parachutes!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83M</name.id><name role="metadata">Plibersek, Tanya, MP</name><name role="display">Ms PLIBERSEK</name></talker><para>—The member for Grayndler suggests parachutes. Perhaps it is in their plan. We have to accept that, when Mascot Aerodrome officially opened in 1920, it was surrounded by a very different population density, and it represented a very different noise burden. It has reached its limit now. It is only nine kilometres from the central business district of Sydney. It is closer than any comparable airport anywhere in the world. Within five kilometres of Kingsford Smith airport, we have over 140,000 people; within five kilometres of Badgerys Creek, there are 5,000 people; and within five kilometres of Wilton, we have 1,000. Unless we build a second Sydney airport, life will become unbearable. Not today, not tomorrow but, as sure as night follows day, in 10 or 20 years time the residents of our greatest city will be cursing the myopia of today's leaders.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>27600</page.no><name role="metadata">Baird, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BAIRD</name><name.id>MP6</name.id><electorate>Cook</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is my pleasure to speak today on the member for Sydney's motion on Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport.

She undoubtedly is very concerned following the election of Clover Moore in the New South Wales council elections on the weekend. She knows that Labor are in big trouble in inner Sydney and she is doing her best to keep them at bay. The Greens have got every right to ask: where is the Labor Party's credibility? </para><para>There is probably a greater concentration of tourism workers living in the member for Sydney's electorate than in the whole of Sydney, and it is those tourism people who benefit from the closeness of Kingsford Smith more than anybody else. Every year, five million international visitors come into this country and 25 million people use the airport, and Australia benefits by some $16 billion in foreign exchange earnings into Australia from tourism. The airport is the greatest asset that we have to bring international visitors into the city. Of course, the domestic tourism industry is worth an additional $40 billion for this country. The member for Sydney is ignoring her constituents and the many tourism workers in her electorate for the straight political gain. </para><para>What is this all about? The fact is that the Labor Party said at their conference that they are going to build a second airport. They did not say where it would be, because they are worried about the protests. They say, `It might be Wilton. It might be Badgerys Creek'—never mind whether it would work at Wilton, because fuel from planes flying over the Sydney catchment area would contaminate the water in the catchment area; never mind the impact it would have on the people who live in the seat of Gilmore on the South Coast or the people who live in Wollongong. The Labor Party probably say, `We've lost the seat of Cunningham. Why don't we just put it in there and give it a burst there?'</para><para>As one of the great masterpieces in Labor's overall planning for the Sydney airport, the New South Wales Minister for Roads, Mr Carl Scully, came down to the F6—which would have connected Kingsford Smith into the south and would have therefore connected the airport at Wilton—in a great flourish before the last election, when he was actually the Minister for Transport, and announced that he was going to cancel the road. Labor are giving it away in terms of connections in that area. It is blown in terms of connections. You obviously do not speak to your Labor mates in Sussex Street, but it is probably time you did after last weekend's results. </para><para>There is a whole lot of naivety in the proposal. The member for Sydney said, `We would have built at Badgerys Creek. It would have created all these jobs out there. It would have been great.' But who remembers what happened at the last election? Every time Labor had a chance, they were out belting the government over Badgerys Creek. They did it in Lindsay, they did it in Macquarie and they did it in Macarthur, saying that the government was going to build an airport at Badgerys Creek. They used every opportunity. They organised protest rallies. When the alternative was Holsworthy, Labor were there with protest rallies against the minister and the government. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs, who is at the table, who is the fantastic member for Hughes, knows all about the  tactics they used when Holsworthy was proposed. Did we see them going down into the seat of Hughes saying, `What a great idea having a second airport here'? They were leading the charge—not as well as the member for Hughes—in protesting against the government every step of the way. Of course, there is all this hypocrisy now: `We should have built it at Badgerys Creek. It would have been fantastic.' Let us get some realism into the debate.

We might have it there,' but they have not actually decided. They do not want to do the work on it. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Labor are not looking at the greatest employing industry in the country, which is tourism. Some 600,000 people in this country are employed in the tourism industry, and over 60 per cent of tourists into Australia come via the Sydney airport. One of the great pluses for Sydney is the closeness of its airport. We have a guarantee that the cap and the curfew will be maintained, and we have the clear forecast that no additional airport will be required for at least 20 years, so why should additional government funding be put in to build another airport? </para><para>We remember what happened in Montreal. In the same way that Labor are talking about a second airport, they decided in Montreal to build their second airport before it was needed. They built the airport at Mirabel, which is a long way out of Montreal, and the problem was that nobody wanted to use it so it became a white elephant—so much so that they eventually closed it during winter. People would change their flights just so they could use the airport closer to the city. And so it will be with this one. If there is not the need, if there is additional capacity that is available to go into Sydney, they will find the way to do it. Of course the international airlines would not want to go out into either Wilton or Badgerys Creek if there is not the requirement to do it at this stage.</para><para>The cap of 80 movements an hour being maintained and the curfew being maintained were things that the Labor government initiated when they were in office. Now the member for Sydney is saying that this is far too much, that it is too high. But it was the Labor government that put it in place; it was the Labor members who moved the amendments in terms of the cap—and there is no consideration in any way that it is going to be changed or that the curfew is going to be changed at all. </para><para>The member for Sydney talks about people in her area that are affected. I say to the member for Sydney that 55 per cent of all flights—take-offs and landings—come across my electorate. If this were a real issue in my electorate, I would know about it. You have heard the member for Sydney say how terrible this noise is that comes through her area, but 55 per cent of flights go over my electorate. In fact, from the polling that I did, I found that one per cent of people in my electorate thought aircraft noise was a problem. I do not know who the member for Sydney talks to, but she should do her own polling and find out the reality of what people think. Only one per cent of people were concerned about the impact of aircraft noise. What is the reason for that? There are so many people in my electorate who work for the airlines. If you go down to the dry cleaners, you will see that the place is full of Qantas and Virgin Blue uniforms. People who work at the airport include the maintenance workers, those who drive the tractors and those who run the coffee shops and the restaurants. The airport is a great provider of employment right in the centre of Sydney. People in my electorate are supportive of the airport because they know it creates jobs, and it provides a very close and central link into the city.</para><para>The member for Sydney talks about the number of flights and how many people will be affected, without taking into consideration the way in which the size of aircraft is going to change. In less than two years, Qantas will have their new 380 aircraft, which will be about one and a half times the size of the current 747 and will take somewhere between 500 and 600 people on a flight. That is the trend: airlines are going from the 767 to the 330 aircraft—larger aircraft with less frequent flights across Sydney.</para><para>The traffic levels that we are talking about are quite different from what they were, for example, at the time of the Olympics. It will still take some time until we reach the number of international visitors that came to Australia at the time of the Olympics and during the year in which the Olympics was held. That is for a number of factors. Since that time, we have had September 11, which of course has meant caution for people who travel internationally. Then we had October 12 with the Bali bombing. Then with SARS we had the real impact of people being concerned about their health when travelling. All this has meant a downturn in tourism. We are starting to see a slow return to the tourist numbers that we had before, but it is a slow process. We do not know what other factors in the future will affect the numbers and, in many ways, in terms of the airport plan the forecast is optimistic. The noise sharing arrangement under LTOP means that each part of Sydney gets a share of the noise. I believe it works effectively in Sydney and it is a useful way of sorting out where the aircraft should be.</para><para>The member for Sydney also talks about the role of SACF in terms of bringing together their motions. It is an opportunity for members of this House and members of council to come together and express their views and concerns. I am not sure how many times the member for Sydney has actually attended SACF meetings and presented her views there. I doubt whether it has been very many times. I have certainly not seen her at those meetings. But there is a real opportunity to talk about noise sharing there. It is all right to grandstand in this House and express your concern but, if you were really concerned about noise in your electorate, you would be attending every meeting of SACF.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83M</name.id><name role="metadata">Plibersek, Tanya, MP</name><name role="display">Ms Plibersek</name></talker><para>—I am not a member.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—The member for Cook will refer to members by their seats.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>MP6</name.id><name role="metadata">Baird, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BAIRD</name></talker><para>—I am sure that the member for Sydney would be able to attend—</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83M</name.id><name role="metadata">Plibersek, Tanya, MP</name><name role="display">Ms Plibersek</name></talker><para>—I will break the doors down.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>MP6</name.id><name role="metadata">Baird, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BAIRD</name></talker><para>—We look forward to you attending.

They said that they were going to have it at Badgerys Creek, then it was Wilton, but the facts simply do not support them. The people who know the facts know that we only need one airport, Kingsford Smith—certainly in the short term—and the claims of the ALP are without substance.

On 20 January a letter was written by the general manager of corporate affairs and human resources at Sydney Airports Corporation Ltd, Mr Chris Falvey, to the Chair of the Sydney Airport Community Forum, Senator Marise Payne, advising that Sydney Airports Corporation Ltd had submitted the final draft master plan to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. The general manager's letter noted that SACF's submission was one of the most comprehensive submissions received. Despite this observation, not one member of SACF—of which I am one and the member for Cook is one—received notice of this letter until it was distributed through the SACF secretariat on 26 March 2004. That is last week, four days after the minister's 22 March 2004 media statement No. A39/2004 announcing the approval of the master plan.</para><para>What is at issue is that revelations are now emerging that there are substantial differences between the preliminary draft master plan and the final draft master plan for Sydney airport. No member of the public had any warning of the final draft master plan or its contents. Moreover, the SACF, the peak community consultation body established by the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, had no knowledge of the contents of the final draft master plan before 26 March 2004.</para><para>What does the final draft master plan say? I will tell you: at this time, we still do not know. Neither the minister nor the proponents of the master plan, Sydney Airports Corporation Ltd, are under any legal obligation to notify the public of the final draft master plan. However, it is true that Sydney Airports Corporation Ltd did have knowledge of the request of the chair of SACF, representing the community and the public interest in Sydney airport's future, to be given prior warning of the tabling of the final draft master plan. The bottom line is that the final draft master plan was tabled and a decision was made by the minister to accept the plan, without the community having any knowledge of the contents of the final draft master plan. That means that no-one had the opportunity to scrutinise the final draft master plan or to make any final submissions prior to the minister approving the plan.</para><para>All this flies in the face of my repeated calls to the minister to heed the recommendations of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee report on the inquiry into the development of the Brisbane Airport Corporation master plan published in June 2000. The eight recommendations in that report clearly envisaged amendments to the Airports Act 1996 and, in particular, the very provisions which at this time have so denied the public interest. Here we are on 30 March 2004, and still the recommendations are not implemented. The public interest has again been slaughtered by an appalling lack of statutory safeguards and the government's naked contempt for due process, natural justice and any other minimal standard of decency. This House needs to be reminded that the Sydney Airports Corporation Ltd is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern Cross Airports Corporation Holdings Ltd and that the Prime Minister's mate Mr Max Moore-Wilton is both the Chairman of the Sydney Airports Corporation Ltd and the Chief Executive Officer of Southern Cross Airports Corporation Holdings Ltd.</para><para>It is not possible at this time to know what the contents of the final draft master plan are in order to determine the basis and reasons upon which the master plan was approved. Going on the only publicly available information, the preliminary draft master plan, Sydney residents to the north of Sydney airport can expect—as the member for Sydney so appropriately put it—nearly a doubling of aircraft movements from 240,000 to 412,000 by 2023. With this will come a mammoth increase in aircraft noise for people in my electorate of Lowe and in the inner west of Sydney. Moreover, the repeated failure by Airservices Australia to meet the long-term operating plan aircraft movement targets, particularly to the north—which seems to be strange to the member for Cook—means that residents of Sydney are being bludgeoned into copping parallel runway mode operations. This is now clearly the real agenda of Sydney Airports Corporation Ltd and its master Mr Max Moore-Wilton's Southern Cross Airports Corporation Holdings Ltd and their principal shareholder, Macquarie Bank—so determined to maximise profits for its directors and shareholders at the expense of my constituents and the constituents of the members for Sydney, Grayndler, Watson and Barton. It is a shocking, blatant example of nepotism. The facts demonstrate that there is treachery being visited upon the people of Sydney and the public interest. The demonstrated contempt of Sydney Airports Corporation Ltd, Southern Cross Airports Corporation Holdings Ltd and Airservices Australia for the public is now undeniable. The minister must hold a further Senate inquiry.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>R36</name.id><name role="metadata">Albanese, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83D</name.id><name role="metadata">Murphy, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MURPHY</name></talker><para>—The member for Grayndler is correct. The minister must further make a decision under his statutory powers within section 78(2) of the Airports Act 1996 and direct by written notice to the Sydney Airports Corporation Ltd, as the airport lessee company, that he immediately be given a draft master plan that is expressed to replace the original master plan. This will give the public its right to remedy this treachery visited by the Howard government on the people that we represent.</para></talk.start></continue><para>As the minister is aware, under the provisions of section 78 of the Airports Act 1996, the airport lessee company has 180 days in which to table the replacement draft master plan. I think I speak for all the people of Sydney who are now totally fed up with the bullying of these big-end-of-town corporations—Southern Cross Airports Corporation Holdings, Sydney Airports Corporation Limited, Macquarie Bank, their Liberal Party mates and the likes of Max the Axe. These people have rammed the decision through with contempt for the people that I, the member for Grayndler and the member for Sydney represent. It is time to bring these people to account. They should be flogged.</para><para>Finally, I put on notice that today I have requested, under the Freedom of Information Act, the full file from the Minister for Transport and Regional Services to determine the extent to which the airport lessee complied throughout this master plan debacle. I remind the member for Cook of the gross dishonesty of the Howard government. In January 1996—and Mr Paul Zammit, my predecessor as the member for Lowe, behaved honourably when he knew that the Prime Minister was going to dud him—the Liberal Party put out this very shameful leaflet which says, `This is not Liberal policy; you can't trust Labor.' I will explain what this document is all about. Mary Easson, who before Paul Zammit held the seat of Lowe, said precisely what would happen in Lowe with regard to the expansion of aircraft noise under the Howard government. Three months after being elected to office, the Prime Minister in the Howard report—his own report to his own electorate of Bennelong—said: </para><quote><para>John Howard guarantees second International Airport for Sydney. </para></quote><para>The Prime Minister said to his electorate:</para><quote><para>Sydney is to be guaranteed a second international airport regardless of the outcome of the environmental impact statement of Badgerys Creek. This decision reflects the Howard government's determination to solve the Sydney aircraft noise problems as quickly as possible and responds to environmental and industry concerns about the viability of Badgerys Creek. </para></quote><para>What a lot of humbug and cant by the Prime Minister. This just reflects the lies and deception of the Howard government in looking after the interests of its mates at Macquarie Bank. If you do not believe me: when Mary Easson put her leaflet out in 1996 to expose the truth of the matter about where, under the Howard government, the planes were going to go, here is the government's own draft master plan which shows planes going all over Sydney but predominantly over the electorates of the members for Grayndler and Sydney and my electorate of Lowe. Why? Because they are Labor seats and the government could not give a damn about the people that we represent. Why? Because they are Labor held seats.</para><para>The government is only interested in looking after the big end of town—and that includes the Macquarie Bank, which paid an absurd amount of money: $5.6 billion. As I have said many times—and it was also alluded to by the member for Sydney—Sydney airport is operating very well as a car park and a shopping centre. It is not doing the job that it was supposed to do. It is only looking after the interests of the shareholders and the directors who get fat salaries and share options at the environmental expense of the people that the member for Grayndler, the member for Sydney and I represent. I will keep talking about this right up to the next election because I was elected on this, and I will remind my electorate of the dishonesty of the government—<inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

The manipulation of the City of Sydney to try and give the lord mayoralty to the failed former member for Dobell came very much unstruck. Indeed, Clover Moore, the state member for part of the area that now comprises the City of Sydney, really put the wind up the Labor Party members of that area of Sydney. They can see that Labor does not serve them well and so it was necessary for the member for Sydney to move this motion to try and show that they are doing something. It is truly a cynical exercise and should be seen for what it is.</para></talk.start><para>In her speech the member for Sydney talked about the development that was going on in areas that are adjoining the airport. They are part and parcel of the state government's medium-density housing policies whereby it wants more people to live in the inner city and inner suburban areas so that it does not have to have the expense of creating new infrastructure in developing new areas on the outskirts of Sydney. The people who are developing these areas in and around the airport know precisely what they are doing. They are building accommodation which is close to an airport, which has pluses and minuses for some. For the people who work in the industries which are associated with the airport or at the airport itself, it is very convenient; it is very convenient to the city. On the downside, the noise involved in being near an airport is factored into the purchase price of those properties, and so the market operates and those people who want to live there take that into consideration when they buy into this new development. So, very simply, that argument about the development of the area has to be seen for what it is: it is deliberate state government policy to see those urban areas grow, and the people who then choose to live there are those who factor in their proximity to the airport.</para><para>One thing that does not change about Sydney airport is the fact that one half of it is surrounded by water. This makes it quite unique. It means that there are many flight paths that can come in over the water where in other parts of the world they have no such luxury; they are all forced to fly over land and, indeed, mainly inhabited land. The idea has been raised that we should again go through the farce of Badgerys Creek—and it was a farce that Labor perpetrated upon the people of Western Sydney. First of all they said, `We're going to build this great airport,' and everybody said, `Where's the infrastructure for getting to and from the city?'—`Don't worry about that; it will all happen.' Of course it did not. There was no planning for it and then the airport itself just did not occur and, in the meantime, houses started to encroach and come closer to those areas. They never believed that Badgerys Creek would be built—and of course it will not be. But in the meantime many people who wanted to conduct their existing businesses were bought up and forced off their land. There were many unhappy people that this was perpetrated upon, and the farce went on.</para><para>But in the end we said that it would not be built, it was not needed; and the Labor Party under Simon Crean finally said also that it would not be built—because they knew that the people of Western Sydney would simply not wear it. So once again we are seeing a proposition come up: we must have a second airport. So the member for Sydney says, `Well, we haven't decided where it is. We'll take a look at the Southern Highlands, we'll take a look around Wollongong, we'll take a look here, there and everywhere, but we're not actually going to make a decision because we don't want to upset too many people before the election.' On the other hand, the member for Lowe says, `Oh, no, we've decided on Wilton.' Wilton was one of the sites that were rejected before Badgerys Creek was picked, and there were a whole lot of reasons for that. Largely it was because it is part of the catchment area for Sydney's water supply. So we do not even see agreement in the party itself.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83M</name.id><name role="metadata">Plibersek, Tanya, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

But if we have a look at this so-called plan which says we need a second airport, the Olympics were the big enlightening period, when it was shown that not only could Sydney airport cope with the traffic that was generated from the Olympics but it could go on coping for a long time to come. The member for Cook pointed out the futility of trying to impose an unwanted airport—as happened in Canada—upon air carriers and upon the public, who simply do not want to be part of it.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The plan that has come forward—and it was subject to 87 submissions, which were taken into account in the draft plan—is in fact one that remains within the cap and within the curfew. It is a straightforward and honest plan that says this is what is anticipated will happen through to the years 2023-24. It also points out that aircraft are going to be bigger so they will be moving many more passengers, which is good for the economy of Australia. Sydney is the gateway to Australia—this is where people want to come—and the fact that the airport is close to the city is a big plus for attracting people here and bringing money into the city and, by way of jobs, into the areas that surround the airport as well. We can have more people coming in larger aircraft, because they will be technically superior aircraft and will be quieter. So there are many things that will improve in technology and handling which will again bring benefit to the city.</para><para>I repeat that this exercise that we are indulging in today with a lot of hyperbole is really simply an exercise in being seen to be doing something, to try and fend off the headway that opponents of the Labor Party are making in this part of Sydney. Be it by Greens or by Independents, the Labor Party in that part of Sydney is under siege and they know it. Accordingly, we have had this very contrived debate forced upon us. I thought the wording of the motion was interesting:</para><quote><para>The urgent need for the Government to provide an alternative to the massive planned expansion of Sydney Kingsford-Smith Airport.</para></quote><para>An alternative. The fact of the matter is that the airport that exists there—with one half of the area being ocean, as I said, which allows much movement over unoccupied territory—is a great advantage for this city. When you look at the term `the urgent need', the fact is that we showed with the Olympics that Kingsford Smith can cope with a much greater capacity than was ever thought possible at the time when people were saying we had to have a second airport. That will occur when there is better handling, better usage and more efficiency. Many of the people in this chamber will remember that, when Badgerys Creek was still a possibility, there were all sorts of discussions by the airlines saying that they did not want to use it. They said it would be a disadvantage. They asked, `Who are you going to make use it?' and, `Are you going to force the regional airlines out of Sydney Kingsford Smith and force them to go out to Badgerys Creek, thereby disadvantaging regional people?' The same arguments will come again if a second site is ever contemplated—arguments about who will be the users or who will be forced to use a second airport which they do not want to use and which the capacity of Sydney airport has shown is not needed.</para><para>I put it to you, Mr Speaker, that today's debate has been nothing more than a contrivance. The fact is that Sydney airport does and can cope well. It does bring jobs. It does bring wealth to the city, and the people who choose to live around the airport do so knowing that they are living next to an airport and calculate that in both the price of their purchase and the convenience of purchasing in those areas.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>27608</page.no><name role="metadata">Organ, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ORGAN</name><name.id>BNL</name.id><electorate>Cunningham</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I welcome the opportunity to speak in support of the member for Sydney's call on the federal government to provide an alternative to the massive planned expansion of Sydney's Kingsford Smith airport. Despite what the member for Cook would have us believe, Kingsford Smith is an environmental and planning disaster, and the proposed expansion of the airport, as recently announced, will undoubtedly exacerbate the problems. The Greens are opposed to the government's plans. Their solution is no solution. They have clearly put this in the too-hard basket and have abrogated their responsibilities to the people of New South Wales. The Greens have openly criticised the government for accepting Sydney Airport Corporation's airport master plan, which allows for the doubling of aircraft movements and the tripling of passenger numbers through Kingsford Smith.</para></talk.start><para>However, the Greens also believe that the ALP's two-airport policy will not solve the problem either. The continued expansion of Kingsford Smith underlines the need for a replacement airport, not a second airport. That is right: a replacement, not a second airport, as the current site is dangerous, noisy, polluting and clearly inappropriate for Sydney's air traffic needs. The solution must start with a recognition that Kingsford Smith airport needs to be phased out if the millions of adversely affected Sydney residents are to be relieved of its many health and safety threats and issues.</para><para>The Greens also reject the ALP's plan to build a second airport on the southern highlands—with Wilton as their preferred site—for a variety of reasons. For a start, it is clear that the ALP's position on this issue has always been politically motivated, and in recent times driven by threats to marginal inner city seats. This is not a good climate in which to be making major policy decisions that are going to impact upon millions of lives. I know the member for Grayndler has been vocal on this issue and critical of the Greens' position, and only a week ago the member for Sydney sharply criticised the Greens on the Sydney airport issue, accusing us of having no airport policy. She said:</para><quote><para>The Greens don't want the expansion on Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport—</para></quote><para>which is true—</para><quote><para>but they also don't want a second airport built for Sydney. What do they want? Should we ban plane travel altogether? Or fly into Melbourne and catch the train to Sydney? The Greens are fine at pointing out problems .... Where do they want the extra planes and the extra passengers to go?</para></quote><para>The Greens' position is clear. We want Sydney airport phased out and replaced by a new airport outside of the Sydney basin. We want the site selected by a process that respects both the transport needs of New South Wales and the rights of affected residents. We want the Australian government to take carriage of this process. We want a replacement airport, not a second airport—an idea we reject. Building a second airport and leaving Sydney airport in place would only serve to massively increase aircraft noise and accident risks for all inner Sydney residents, including the member for Sydney's constituents.</para><para>Labor's second airport solution is no solution at all. Labor's second airport would inevitably handle only smaller aircraft and intrastate flights. It would thus increase the capacity of Sydney airport to take more of the big jets and, consequently, increase noise impacts on households that are already suffering. A second airport would not only make matters much worse for inner city residents but would relegate the residents of rural New South Wales who depend on air travel to an airport that has no connection to interstate and international flights. Labor's selection of Wilton as a site for their second airport typifies everything that has gone wrong in airport regulation over the past half century. Wilton has overriding environmental values—values the Leader of the Opposition himself has recognised. But, time and again, short-term political expediency has overcome evidence based planning, and this is why we are in such a mess with Kingsford Smith airport.</para><para>The Greens are committed to a process that decouples making decisions about appropriate sites for a replacement airport from the ability of private interests to influence politics. Only in this way will we get an airport location that delivers economic and social benefits without compromising the environment or the quality of life, health and safety of local communities. The appalling history of Kingsford Smith airport demonstrates the dangers of allowing politicians to make airport siting decisions. We have just seen the Howard government support the SAC airport master plan, which will not serve the best interests of the people of Sydney in particular. But both major parties are complicit. Labor's past record on the airport brings no comfort to Sydney residents. Having built the third runway, voted for the privatisation of Kingsford Smith airport and opposed a replacement airport, they share responsibility with the government for the appalling outcomes for Sydney's residents and the environment—appalling outcomes described in detail by the member for Sydney and the member for Lowe.</para><para>The operations of Kingsford Smith airport impose unacceptable noise, air pollution and accident threat burden on the population of inner Sydney. As demand for aircraft movements grows, the burden will intensify. Current so-called noise sharing flight paths will not solve the problem in the long run. The Greens believe that a replacement site should be found outside of the Sydney air drainage basin and that Kingsford Smith airport should be phased out. High-speed public transport links should be constructed to link the new airport to Sydney and suburbs. Money raised from the sale of the KSA site—except foreshore land and environmentally sensitive land—for residential, commercial and industrial development can fund the majority of the costs of relocating the airport. Because the greatest danger occurs when aircraft take off or land, it is desirable to locate airports as far away as practicable from densely populated areas and vulnerable installations such as chemical plants and oil refineries. This happens in major cities around the world, even in Australia, and Kingsford Smith is not appropriately sited at all. Moreover, when an aircraft experiences difficulties and needs to make an emergency landing, one of the first things done is to jettison excess fuel—as has happened over Sydney on occasion.</para><para>A proposed second airport at Wilton would spell an environmental disaster for the Illawarra and the Southern Highlands of New South Wales. Labor's proposal would compromise the quality of Sydney's water supply, with unburnt fuel and other pollutants dropped from planes flying over the catchment. Rather than promoting developments which threaten precious water supplies, communities expect government to move in the other direction. Labor's proposal would impose unacceptable noise on communities under the flight paths. KSA was originally constructed as a temporary airport which through the accretion of time became permanent. Its development has been marked by poor decision making, bad process, undue influence from private interests—as the member for Lowe has pointed out—and a lack of commitment to the community from either of the dominant political parties. The third runway was constructed to appease powerful friends of the ALP, without proper consideration of the impacts on local communities.</para><para>The Greens believe that the role of the political process is to establish and define the parameters for an expert site selection process which should then be conducted without political interference. The process must be responsive to the needs of individual communities that might be affected by airport siting decisions. The Greens believe that a replacement airport site should be found by an expert process that weighs the economic, environmental and social benefits and costs of candidate sites, free from undue commercial or political influence. We are committed to the development of a process that respects the wishes of all local communities.</para><para>The Labor Party, if it is elected to government, will face a massive community backlash if it chooses Wilton as the preferred site for Sydney's second airport. Wollondilly Shire, for example, has changed dramatically in the 18 years since Wilton emerged as the second choice behind Badgerys Creek as the preferred airport site back in 1985, and the ALP must accept this. Wilton is in the Sydney air drainage basin, and a major airport would worsen the poor air quality which already impacts on Illawarra residents, particularly residents in my electorate of Cunningham. Wilton is also close to major Sydney and Wollongong water catchments, which could well be adversely affected if a major airport were established in the vicinity. All Wollongong suburbs would be adversely affected by a major airport at Wilton or in the immediate vicinity. Aircraft would have to come in low over the city, and the escarpment would magnify the noise. And, remember, Wollongong is just two minutes landing time from the Wilton airport. An international airport at Wilton is a dumb idea, if ever there was one. The local council opposes it, the 38,000-odd residents of Wollondilly oppose it and the people of the Illawarra certainly will not accept having Sydney's airport noise problems dumped on them.</para><para>In summary, the Greens call on the opposition to reconsider their decision to build a second airport at Wilton, or to once again face the political consequences of ignoring the concerns of people living in the Illawarra. The people of Cunningham do not want a 24-hour a day, seven-day a week international airport at Wilton—and this is a likely scenario. But the Greens are honest about what we want. The fact that the ALP are not listening to us is not our fault. I therefore commend the member for Sydney's motion and call on the government to adopt our policy and put in place a process to identify a replacement airport site for Kingsford Smith airport.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>27611</page.no><name role="metadata">Albanese, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ALBANESE</name><name.id>R36</name.id><electorate>Grayndler</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am very pleased to speak in support of the motion moved today by the member for Sydney and seconded by the member for Lowe—colleagues who, along with me, have fought aircraft noise and its impact on our local communities. The Sydney airport master plan will see a doubling of the number of movements, from 225,000 a year to 412,000. It will see a tripling of the number of passengers, from 23 million to 68 million. It will have a devastating impact on our communities. I do not think that people outside those communities understand. The member for Mackellar said that half of the aircraft go over the ocean. That is absolute nonsense. Figure 16.1 of the master plan shows that, for the predicted daily jet aircraft movements in 2024, flight path G, which is the one to the south out over the bay, has 56 movements a day. That is 56 out of 1,131 every single day, of which 638 are directly over my residents. It is the most densely populated area, not just in Sydney or New South Wales but in Australia. This is an outrageous plan which puts the interests of profit holders above the interests of residents.</para></talk.start><para>I wish to apologise to you, Mr Speaker, for my interjections last week in this House for which you were forced to take action in accordance with the standing orders. I was particularly angry at the frustration I felt because kids from Fort Street High School have their education disrupted every 50 seconds by aircraft noise over their heads and the government has refused to listen. It says that there is noise from, say, here to where your office is, Mr Speaker, but that where Fort Street High School is there is no noise. It is New South Wales's oldest high school. The buildings were built before the airport and, indeed, before planes were invented, yet those kids have their education disrupted. That is the real impact of aircraft noise.</para><para>I do not have long to speak, so I will also address the other alternative. We know what the Liberal plan is: more noise over more people more often. Eventually the cap and the curfew will be gone and the smaller planes will have to go to Bankstown or somewhere else to free up Sydney airport for the major jets. The alternative put forward by the Labor Party is to have a second Sydney airport environmental impact statement. We do not want the problems of aircraft noise visited on anyone. That is why we say that, upon coming into government, we will have an EIS into the Wilton site and into sites in the southern highlands.</para><para>The Greens supported Wilton in my area. Councillors, state activists and state MPs all supported Wilton as the alternative until the member for Cunningham won that by-election. Then—talk about political motivation!—all of a sudden they were against Wilton as a site for the airport. They talk about environmental considerations. Three per cent of Sydney's air pollution is caused by the airport—the main cause is cars and transport—yet they say that we cannot have Kingsford Smith airport and that it should be shut down. I do not support the position of shutting down Sydney airport. Sydney airport creates 40,000 jobs and it is important for the economy. My community does not expect to have no noise; they expect what occurs through living in the inner city. What they want, though, is some fair standard of living. That is why we do not support the complete shutting down of Sydney airport. How dishonest is it to say that you can shut down Sydney airport, but you are opposed to Badgerys Creek airport and Wilton airport. The Greens' position, quite frankly, is that planes will have to fly over Sydney and you will have to parachute out over the spot to which you want to go. It is an absurd position. It is dishonest and it will be condemned as such. I call upon people to support the Labor Party position, which actually provides a real solution to aircraft noise.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>27612</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MURPHY</name><name.id>83D</name.id><electorate>Lowe</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr Speaker, I seek leave to table a letter to Senator Marise Payne.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Howard, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Howard</name></talker><para>—Is it confidential?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83D</name.id><name role="metadata">Murphy, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MURPHY</name></talker><para>—No, Prime Minister, it is not confidential.

This has been the most far-reaching change in the security policy terrain since the Cold War. The complexity of the challenges facing our intelligence agencies today necessarily means that the environment in which ASIS undertakes its functions has changed fundamentally also. Recognising this changed environment, this bill seeks to enable ASIS to protect its staff members and agents and engage cooperatively with other agencies—be they the AFP, the ADF or others—in the war against terrorism.</para><para>These are grave and important operational considerations that need to be addressed in the current environment. While we recognise that we need to provide greater levels of security for our officers and agents deployed overseas, we are also conscious of the need to ensure that these new powers are not abused. It is for this reason that we successfully requested that the government refer the amendment bill to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD to review the contents of the proposed legislation and suggest amendments where it identified them as necessary. That committee has now reported. The tabling of that report was done first in the Senate two weeks ago, and I understand that the tabling in the House of Representatives occurs today.</para><para>As many in this place are aware, ASIS's activities are the subject of intense scrutiny. We on this side of the parliament believe that this is a good thing. The current act, the Intelligence Services Act 2001, states: </para><quote><para>... ASIS must not plan for, or undertake, paramilitary activities or activities involving violence against the person or the use of weapons.</para></quote><para>This limitation arose from the Hope royal commission in 1983. That royal commission reviewed the security and intelligence agencies and investigated the controversy arising from an incident in November 1983 at the Sheraton hotel in Melbourne involving ASIS agents. The 1983 royal commission made a number of significant recommendations, most of which the government of the day adopted, and they remain in place today. It was recommended that ASIS's directive be amended to exclude ASIS from carrying out covert action or undertaking training for such action. Secondly, it was recommended that the use by ASIS of weapons be terminated and that ASIS's stock of weapons and explosives be disposed of.</para><para>Of course, it was generally accepted before the events of 11 September 2001 that these limitations were appropriate in the context of the security policy environment in which ASIS operated at the time. Since that time, however, we accept that the rise of international terrorism in the post-September 11 period has changed the operating environment for ASIS employees abroad. We accept that this changed international environment could not have been foreseen when the act was originally drafted. ASIS today is operating in a range of environments where the security situation is deteriorating and where its work involves intelligence collection on terrorism targets in the region.</para><para>ASIS's work on terrorism targets brings additional threats to the safety of ASIS employees. It is a reality that, in this changed international environment, ASIS employees now face much greater levels of personal and physical danger than they have before. To give some quantitative weight to this, the Singapore based Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies argues that up to nine additional organisations similar to Jemaah Islamiah—the organisation responsible for the Bali bombings—are currently operating within South-East Asia with different memberships, differing militant objectives, and a capacity and predisposition to participate in terrorist activities against Western targets, including Australian targets.</para><para>Additionally, there remain at large anywhere between 200 and 2,000 individuals who have been directly engaged with al-Qaeda, Jemaah Islamiah and/or associated terrorist organisations. As Glen Fisher, the Australian Federal Police's lead investigator on Jemaah Islamiah and one of the country's leading experts on the terrorist organisation, has observed, the fact that JI is restructuring and resuming its operations in response to increasing counter-terrorism efforts means there is a greater need to `run harder' and `stay abreast' of the organisation. As I have said in this parliament before, the first responsibility of the parliament and of the executive government of this country is to provide for the national security of the country. There is no higher responsibility. On this side, we recognise that it is important that, in these changed international circumstances, ASIS must be able to discharge its activities and provide for the adequate protection of its staff and those working for it. </para><para>What does this bill seek to do? Under the proposed amendment bill, ASIS employees would be allowed to carry weapons for self-defence purposes. Under this schema, they would still be unable to initiate acts of violence and would remain an intelligence collection agency that conducts its activities in a non-violent way. Given the enhanced self-defence needs of ASIS employees in the current international environment and the formalisation of self-defence powers involved, three proposed changes need to be considered in some detail.</para><para>The first relates to the provision of training in weapons use and self-defence techniques. The new proposed regulations for the training in the use of weapons for self-defence purposes are outlined in clauses 6(5) and 6(6) of schedule 1 and clause 1(1) of schedule 2. Essentially, the new provisions would enable ASIS officers and agents to be trained in the use of weapons only for self-defence purposes. In addition to the conditions attached to the provision of a weapon to an ASIS employee for the purposes of self-protection, for the protection of other ASIS employees, for the protection of individuals assisting ASIS operations or for training purposes, is the requirement that the Minister for Foreign Affairs must provide written notice to the director-general approving the provision of the weapon and the training in the use of the weapon.</para><para>Specifically, these provisions relate to the use of a weapon, or self-defence technique, outside of Australia. In other words, ASIS employees will not be authorised to use a weapon within Australia. Schedule 2 also outlines additional constraints involving the use of a weapon. These relate to individual ministerial approval in relation to the provision or use of a weapon: first, the provision of a copy of the approval to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security; and, second, the issuing of guidelines governing the detailed use of weapons for self-defence purposes.</para><para>Additionally, a further clarification sought by the Director-General of ASIS has been to ensure that ASIS officers and agents can participate in the planning and undertaking of joint operations with other Australian organisations and approved non-Australian organisations. Once again, this primarily relates to the new challenges arising from terrorism and the possibility of Australians being taken hostage and where operational cooperation with other agencies becomes essential.</para><para>This amendment bill would clarify this by introducing a regime in proposed replacement section 6(4) of the amendment bill. Note 1 of proposed section 6(4) states:</para><quote><para>This subsection does not prevent ASIS from being involved with the planning or undertaking of activities covered by paragraphs (a) to (c) by other organisations provided that staff members or agents of ASIS do not undertake those activities.</para></quote><para>Further, under the proposed amendment bill, the new schedule 2, ASIS would be able to extend physical protection in self-defence to individuals in other organisations that were acting in support of ASIS's activities, such as the Australian Federal Police or members of the Australian Defence Force.</para><para>The range of individuals that could be protected by those acting in self-defence is governed by section 13 of the existing act, which defines those organisations with which ASIS may cooperate. The proposed amendments would not alter this in any way, and, in any activity involving armed ASIS officers acting with any other approved organisation, ASIS employees would only be able to operate in self-defence or defence of those engaged in agreed cooperative operations.</para><para>When this bill was first introduced into this place late last year we, the opposition, immediately referred it to the Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD. We believed then that that was an appropriate course of action, given the content and the gravity of the proposed amendments. That committee made a range of unanimous recommendations that would ensure an improved oversight regime for ASIS under the amended legislation.</para><para>As far as self-defence and training are concerned, the committee recommended that guidelines on the use of weapons and self-defence techniques contain a detailed protocol for the planning or conduct of activities with foreign organisations and which may involve the use of force. The committee further recommended that these guidelines be produced in consultation with relevant departments and agencies, be agreed by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security and be approved by the National Security Committee of cabinet. Second, the committee recommends that the range of weapons be defined in the guidelines under schedule 2 clause 1(6) and that specific types of weapons to be used on each operation be authorised by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. In its report, the committee emphasised that these guidelines: </para><quote><para>... should comprise a detailed policy framework covering training, handling, use, storage and logistics. ASIS should draw on the expertise of relevant Australian agencies in developing the framework ...</para></quote><para>The committee also noted that training guidelines should include a detailed understanding of what is implied by self-defence training.</para><para>Third, the committee recommended that the Minister for Foreign Affairs approve a general training program in the use of weapons and self-defence techniques for specific ASIS officer positions as designated by the director-general. This training program would be ongoing and managed by the director-general. In addition, the committee recommended that a copy of the training program be provided to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, that any changes to it be advised as soon as practicable and that DFAT be consulted in the designation by the director-general of any position as requiring training in the use of weapons and self-defence techniques.</para><para>Fourth, the committee recommended that the guidelines on the use of weapons and self-defence techniques also cover all aspects of training, handling, use, storage and logistics, that training courses cover initial training and refresher-requalification training; and that a skills assessment regime be developed, and training certification be managed in such a way as to ensure that ASIS's capabilities are maintained. The current amendment bill requires that the director-general issue guidelines on the use of weapons and self-defence techniques. Finally, the committee recommended that, in developing training and logistics guidelines, the director-general, while consulting broadly, use the training and logistics models of the AFP as a basis.</para><para>As far as oversight mechanisms are concerned, the committee recommended that the bill be amended to include a provision setting out oversight mechanisms for the initial approval of operations and for subsequent reporting to enable review and accountability and that, where ASIS anticipates being involved in the planning or undertaking of operations with foreign organisations that may include the use of force, the approvals process be expanded from the Minister for Foreign Affairs to include the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General. Second, the committee recommended that the foreign minister approve each deployment of an armed ASIS staff member overseas and/or the training and arming of an ASIS employee overseas. In particular, the committee noted that deploying an armed staff member overseas or agreeing to the training and arming of an agent overseas was of a sufficient risk to warrant ministerial attention to those cases. The committee stated:</para><quote><para>ASIS should therefore determine which positions were likely to require appropriate training, and ensure that this was provided for all occupants of those designated positions, without having to seek further Ministerial approval whenever staffing changes occurred. This would enable the Minister to focus on individual operational requests, while the overall planning and conduct of training of ASIS staff in the use of weapons and self-defence techniques could be more effectively managed by the Director General.</para></quote><para>Third, the committee recommended that ASIS's request to the Minister for Foreign Affairs for approval of an operation include a detailed assessment of the risks to ASIS staff members and agents involved and to Australia as well as advice from DFAT on possible effects on bilateral relationships. Fourth, the committee recommended that the bill be amended to require the Director-General of ASIS to provide the inspector-general of security with a report on any operational incident with the potential to embarrass Australia. This information could then be included in the inspector-general's reports to government as appropriate.</para><para>The government has indicated it is taking up seven of the nine recommendations. These recommendations will enhance the oversight of ASIS's operations and training of ASIS officers. In particular, it is important that the government has accepted the recommendation that the foreign minister first consult the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General for approval of operations with foreign organisations that may include the use of force. As Senator Ray said in the other place on 11 March, it is much less likely that the foreign minister could authorise `mad projects' if the responsibility is spread over to the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General.</para><para>The adoption of guidelines and protocols governing the type and nature of training in and use of weapons and self-defence techniques strengthens the operational oversight of ASIS's activities and training while allowing ASIS to maintain the necessary operational flexibility that is required of an organisation of this nature. The procedures proposed by the committee would enable ministers to be adequately informed in advance of deciding on ASIS's involvement in foreign operations which may involve violence, and they would enable ministers to determine the overall appropriateness of the type and nature of operations and training that ASIS officers undergo.</para><para>We support the government in its decision to adopt seven of the nine recommendations in totality. However, while the government's formal response captures the essence of the PJC's recommendations, we have noted that there are variations between the government's response and the PJC's recommendations with regard to recommendations 2 and 3 in particular. In relation to recommendation 2, the government has accepted the inclusion, in the guidelines on the use of weapons, of a protocol specifying ASIS involvement in the planning or conduct of activities with foreign organisations; however, it has not included that the guidelines should be agreed with the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security.</para><para>We have said to the government that we believe IGIS should be given an instructive role in the development and formulation of guidelines. I understand that the government is proposing that IGIS be given a consultative role but not an actual clearance process. I have been advised that this is because of the potential conflict of interest that would arise if IGIS were to be given a role in formulating the guidelines while also having a role in overseeing adherence to them. We in the opposition remain of the view that there should be a greater role for IGIS in the development of guidelines. We would expect that, should disagreement occur between ASIS and IGIS in the consultation process during the production of these guidelines, IGIS would articulate, at an appropriate time, any such disagreement to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD.</para><para>In relation to recommendation 3, the government has accepted that the range of weapons to be used in ASIS training and activities be defined in the guidelines for the use of weapons and self-defence techniques. The government has agreed that the definition will note that the provision of weapons will normally be limited to semi-automatic hand guns, pistols and lesser or non-lethal weapons. However, the government has said that it would not be prudent for the bill itself to be overly restrictive in terms of the specific weapons to be utilised by ASIS staff members or agents. When it comes to assessing variations on weapons used for particular operations, I would expect the Director-General of ASIS, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the IGIS to exercise scrutiny and inspect any variation. Where there is a variation, I would expect that ASIS would provide an explanation to IGIS as to why this variation was necessary.</para><para>There has been some concern expressed that these amendments may, through ASIS's potential cooperation in joint operations, lead to ASIS's involvement in operations that include the possibility of assassination. I welcome the foreign minister's commitment and assurances that, in ASIS involvement in joint operations, the possibility of assassination will not be allowed under any circumstances and that internal protocols will be issued proscribing any involvement by ASIS in such activities. I further understand that this will be reflected by the minister, or the parliamentary secretary representing the minister, in the second reading debate.</para><para>The opposition support these amendments. We support them because they are an appropriate response to a real need: to provide for the self-defence of our ASIS personnel overseas and to enable cooperation with other Australian and foreign organisations. The intelligence business is a difficult business, and it is a business where, by its nature, violence cannot always be escaped, given the nature of the persons against whom intelligence operations are conducted in an age of terrorism. I said in September 2001, when the original legislation was introduced:</para><quote><para>We as a parliament and as a nation need to place on record the fact that we commend the professionalism of these agencies, because they discharge an important function for the nation. ... The work which they do is not only important, it requires a high degree of professional ability; and in some cases the work is arduous and dangerous. The staff of these agencies should be commended for their professionalism. I am happy to join those on this side of the House in our support for the legislation.</para></quote><para>Those sentiments were articulated when we passed the bill in 2001. We live in a changed international environment that is fundamentally at risk from the continuing threat of global terrorism. We must be strident in our fight against this threat, and we must ensure that the men and women we send out to fight it are equipped to adequately address it. In the case of ASIS, it is essential that we allow those officers in the field of operations to have the ability to defend themselves. This is not radical legislation; it is sensible legislation. And, thanks to the work of the parliamentary joint committee, in the broad it has the balance correct. We on this side of the parliament therefore extend our support to the legislation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>27619</page.no><name role="metadata">Baird, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BAIRD</name><name.id>MP6</name.id><electorate>Cook</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am pleased to follow the member for Griffith and to hear that the opposition will be supporting the <inline ref="R1913">Intelligence Services Amendment Bill 2003</inline>. It is an important bill. It is significant in the new global environment in which we operate—a world that has been changed by September 11 and October 12 and the terrorism that now pervades our communities and the international arena. The challenge is how we approach it. This piece of legislation will assist those who are at the front line, dealing with terrorism, to protect themselves. The Intelligence Services Amendment Bill 2003 will update the 2001 act to allow ASIS officers to protect themselves by being able to carry firearms. It is important to note that this bill does not provide ASIS with a licence to use aggressive force; it still encourages and requires ASIS to maintain the performance of its functions in a nonviolent way. However, it does allow its agents and staff to better defend themselves if placed in a situation of conflict. It provides various checks and balances in that approvals for officers to carry firearms must be given by the minister. If the firearms are discharged then a report on what occurred will need to be submitted.</para></talk.start><para>The Intelligence Services Act 2001 was constructed to provide a legislative base for ASIS to operate on, and also to establish a parliamentary committee to oversee the operations of ASIS. The current legislation does not allow for certain tasks to be performed by ASIS. With the turn of world events since the act's establishment, it is necessary to revise the legislation to allow the security agencies to be brought up to speed with the changing face of terrorism. It is important to note that the primary functions and current responsibilities of ASIS will remain unchanged by this bill. The legislation will ensure that ASIS agents will be protected and able to defend themselves in the various arenas in which they operate, if the need arises.</para><para>The bill allows the use of weapons only for the self-defence of agents operating outside Australia. It is important to emphasise that this bill does not in any way change the functions or the mission of ASIS. The sole exemption to the use of weapons clause relates to the use of weapons only for training purposes within Australian territory. The amendment merely assists in protecting the staff of ASIS from the dangers that occur in performing their duties. It is not possible to judge the direction of future terrorism, but the preparedness of our agents is important. ASIS agents will be exempt from state and territorial laws with respect to gun licences when operating under the bill's requirements. This is to assist in the protection of the identity of ASIS operatives and staff.</para><para>All the accountabilities of ASIS are still in effect. It is still bound to ministerial approval and still answers to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. There are no provisions in the amendment which allow ASIS to remove itself from any of its responsibilities or from any accountability chains to which it is currently attached. Part of this bill addresses the issue of reporting. When a firearm is discharged by a member of ASIS, a report has to be made and recorded. This method of accountability is to make certain that all incidents are recorded, providing a check on ASIS's operations and ensuring that it operates within the guidelines provided by this bill.</para><para>We need to ensure that ASIS is able to communicate, and deal effectively with, intelligence gathered from outside Australian territory that deals directly with domestic Australian security. That is the second important aspect of this bill. This bill seeks to achieve better lines of communication between ASIS and the agencies responsible for conducting counter-terrorism operations. Under this amending legislation, ASIS will be able to communicate to domestic security forces any foreign intelligence that it gathers. Under the current act, ASIS is specifically not allowed to participate in any form of paramilitary operation or planning for or conducting any tasks involving the use of force. This amendment will allow ASIS to work more closely with other agencies, including the Australian Defence Force and other counter-terrorism forces, in order to conduct its operations without the fear of contradicting any legislative requirements.</para><para>In conclusion, I point out that this bill is essential to protecting and securing Australia's future way of life. It is important for the day-to-day protection of the staff of ASIS and all those who work with ASIS. We must allow our security agencies to do their job effectively. This bill is not giving ASIS any licence to impinge on the freedoms of the people of Australia. ASIS will still retain its policy of nonviolence and will provide intelligence and support to those agencies which may be at the centre of conflict, along with improving its own defence in line with new levels of conflict. ASIS's functions are crucial to the security of this nation. ASIS is important in the fight against terrorism. It plays an important role in the collection of intelligence on a global basis. This legislation will not only enable ASIS officers to carry firearms for their own self-protection; it will enable them to communicate directly with foreign organisations to assist and enhance the collection of intelligence on a global basis. I commend this bill to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>27621</page.no><name role="metadata">Danby, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DANBY</name><name.id>WF6</name.id><electorate>Melbourne Ports</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1913">Intelligence Services Amendment Bill 2003</inline>, which was first introduced into the House by the Minister for Foreign Affairs last October and has now returned having been the subject of an inquiry by the Joint Parliamentary Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD. The committee's report on the bill was unanimous and bipartisan. I commend the members of the Jull committee for that achievement. That is as I would expect from a committee whose members include the honourable member for Brand and Senator Robert Ray, both of whom are former defence ministers. The committee's recommendations have significantly improved the bill. It is to the credit of the government members on the committee that they saw the deficiencies in the original bill and accepted the need for them to be amended.</para></talk.start><para>The bill the minister has presented today is to be significantly different from the bill that was introduced last year, and it has considerably improved. The purpose of this bill is to provide protection for the agents of the Australian Security Intelligence Service as they carry out their extremely important role in defending Australia's security in the new and dangerous international situation in which we have found ourselves since September 11 and the Bali bombings of October 2002. The main provisions of the bill are to provide for the self-defence of ASIS agents and officers, including the use of weapons under defined and regulated conditions, and to clarify ASIS's powers to undertake joint operations with other organisations while limiting to self-defence purposes only ASIS's use of weapons in such operations.</para><para>This is, in some respects, a reversal of decisions taken by the Hawke government in 1984 as a result of recommendations of the Hope royal commission into ASIS. That royal commission was appointed in the wake of a scandalous raid on the Sheraton Hotel in Melbourne carried out by ASIS in an ill-conceived training exercise in 1983. I am sure the kind of professional work that they are needed for overseas will not see them behave like a bunch of bozos as they did in Melbourne in that particular raid. The commission recommended that ASIS no longer be allowed to engage in covert actions, that ASIS operations be put on a statutory basis and that ASIS be placed under much closer supervision through the office of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. I am glad that supervision still exists, but we live in new days.</para><para>Those decisions of the Hawke government were correct in the circumstances of 1984. The Sheraton Hotel incident showed that, during the years of the Fraser government, intelligence services had become too loosely supervised by the government and that there was a need to bring their activities under closer supervision. The sad fact is that, in the 20 years since those decisions were made, the world has changed dramatically, particularly our part of the world. We have seen the rise of radical Islamism in countries to our near north, importing ideologies of theocratic totalitarianism from the Middle East and hijacking the great monotheistic faith of the people in those countries for its own purposes.</para><para>We saw in October 2002 what the consequences of the spreading of the tentacles of Islamist terrorism in our region mean. The bombs that exploded in Bali and killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, were planted at the instigation of Jemaah Islamiah, the Indonesian franchise of al-Qaeda. I believe that those bombs were deliberately planted where and when they were in order to kill Australians, although they also killed a large number of Indonesians and citizens of some 20 countries. In these circumstances of a direct terrorist threat to Australia and to the lives of Australians when they are travelling in other countries, the role of our intelligence services must change. We can no longer be content with a situation where our intelligence services operate only as observers and gatherers of intelligence. Of course, the gathering of accurate and reliable intelligence is of vital importance, as we know more than ever after the war in Iraq, but the protection of Australia from terrorism now requires more.</para><para>Many Australians, and certainly most of us on this side of the House, have traditionally been wary of giving our security agencies this kind of power. Those whose memories go back to the Vietnam War recall the misuse of ASIO by the then Liberal government and their surveillance of people involved in protesting against the war in Vietnam but neglect in doing very much about the Croatian Ustasha or the various Nazi war criminals who found their place in Australia.</para><para>I think we need to recognise that, in the current climate, the provisions of this bill have become an unpleasant necessity. I do not seek to make accusations against anyone over the Bali bombing, but the fact is—and the experience of other countries shows this—that good intelligence work and well-targeted pre-emptive interventions can detect plans for this kind of atrocity and prevent them from being executed. I note that the government has undertaken major expenditure in the intelligence area. I hope it is being well directed, particularly to people able to speak Arabic and Indonesian languages who can be trusted long-term analysts in this area. I do not think any member of this House would have objected to a targeted operation by our intelligence services in cooperation with those of Indonesia to disrupt Hambali's Jemaah Islamiah group as it was planning the Bali bombing.</para><para>It is very important to understand the mentality of this new Islamist totalitarianism. It is best brought to mind by reference to the Yemeni spokesman of al-Qaeda. Their franchise there is called the Islamic Army of Aden. He was asked why they had blown up a French supertanker, the <inline font-style="italic">Limburg</inline>, when France had been perceived to be more moderate on issues related to the extreme Islamist view of the world—this was before the banning of the hijab. The al-Qaeda franchise representative from the Islamic Army of Aden said:</para><quote><para>We would have preferred to hit a US frigate, but no problem because they are all infidels.</para></quote><para>I think that is very instructive of the mentality of the people that we are dealing with. We are all infidels—Left, Right, Australian, American, Indonesian—according to them, and they will have no mercy in dealing with us. The role of our intelligence services therefore becomes very important in protecting this country.</para><para>The Joint Parliamentary Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD has approved the central principles of this bill: that ASIS agents should be given the right to carry and use arms in very tightly defined circumstances and that ASIS should have the right to act in cooperation with the intelligence services of other countries in carrying out counter-terrorist operations. The opposition support these objectives. We believe that Australia's intelligence services must be given the right to defend themselves when they are engaged in the difficult, dangerous and absolutely necessary work of penetrating the network of Islamist terrorist organisations operating in our region and preventing any repetition of the terrible crime in Bali. We also believe that ASIS, as Australia's front-line international intelligence organisation, should be given the right to cooperate with the intelligence services of our allies and our neighbours in carrying out these tasks, which may at times necessitate the use of weapons, certainly for purposes of self-defence.</para><para>We further believe that the joint parliamentary committee was right to raise doubts about the provisions of the original bill introduced by the Minister for Foreign Affairs last year. The first of its recommendations was to insist on a more rigorous mechanism for the approval and oversight of operations. Under the original bill, the power to give approval to operations which may entail the use of force rested solely with the foreign minister. I do not want to say anything derogatory about the current foreign minister but I think, as members of the committee thought, it is wrong that the power to approve the use of force by Australian agents should be vested in one person. That is the principle involved here—it is not that we are denigrating any particular minister. The committee recommended that the power of approval be expanded so that the approval of the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General must also be obtained. In addition, the committee recommended that the Minister for Foreign Affairs must specifically approve the deployment of armed ASIS staff overseas.</para><para>The committee recommended that there be a detailed protocol for the planning or conduct of such joint activities with foreign organisations which may also involve the use of force. This may seem a rather obvious provision, and I was surprised to learn it was not in the original bill, but that is indeed the case. This shows once again the wisdom of referring this bill to a committee of members whose experience and judgment has enabled them to make important improvements to the bill. It shows the worth of parliamentary oversight of these kinds of bills and issues. </para><para>The committee also recommended that the provisions of the bill be limited to pistols and automatic handguns and that ministers must specifically approve the use of the specific type of weapons in any proposed actions under this bill. This is a useful limitation on the expansion of the powers the bill confers. ASIS is not an army, and it is not the intention of the bill that ASIS should duplicate the functions of the SAS by acquiring sophisticated weapons, RPGs or heavier weapons other than those necessary for self-defence. </para><para>As the recent terrorist atrocity in Madrid showed, the threat of terrorism against civilian targets in Western countries has not yet been defeated, although it is clear that the power of the al-Qaeda network has been greatly reduced by the loss of its base in Afghanistan and the seizure of its key operatives like Hambali and Khalid Sheik Mohammed. The war is not over yet, even though I believe it is being won. Australia is part of that war whether we like it or not. We became a target when we liberated the people of East Timor, when we assisted in the liberation of the people of Afghanistan and also given our current role in Iraq. I think it is absolutely necessary to recognise that, even though it may have been necessary. </para><para>It is therefore necessary that Australia equip itself properly to defend itself, and that means giving to our intelligence services the powers they need to protect this country and its citizens, particularly when they are outside Australia. The bill aims to do that and that is why we are here supporting it. The bill as initially presented to the House had some deficiencies, and the House should be grateful to members of the joint committee for the recommendations to improve this bill. It is now a bill that I and the opposition are pleased to support.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>27624</page.no><name role="metadata">Hunt, Gregory, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HUNT</name><name.id>00AMV</name.id><electorate>Flinders</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1913">Intelligence Services Amendment Bill 2003</inline> knowing that all of us in this House are aware of the international climate which faces not just Australia or the Western world but the entire global community. Only two weeks ago, we witnessed the tragedy of the Madrid bombing, where 200 souls were destroyed and over 1,000 people were injured, many of them grievously. That bombing is a tragic and timely reminder that we are faced with a situation not like anything that Australian society has faced before, because it is an insidious movement carried out by a small group who are seeking to sow seeds of disruption, destruction and damage throughout not just the Western world but the moderate Islamic world as well.</para></talk.start><para>In an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline> today, I wrote that al-Qaeda is seeking to establish a Taliban-style Islamic caliphate across the world. That is its objective. It is a clear, 100-year vision and it is an objective which it seeks to bring about through jihad or holy war. There is no capacity to reason, talk or negotiate. Everything that we try is rejected. We are infidels in their mind, and so too are all of those moderate Islamic states which reject the notion of a Taliban-style globe. That is the situation we face today. The strategic objective of al-Qaeda is very clear. It is to bring down the core Islamic states of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Indonesia by destabilising them and breaking down the structures in those societies. In order to do that, it seeks to break down Western connections, to frighten away Western engagement, to break down resolve within those societies and to cause fragmentation. That is the world which we now face. </para><para>There are two core elements in the response to that world. Firstly, there has to be hard security, and that is contained within this bill. It is about taking head-on those who will not negotiate, those who do not seek anything other than the annihilation of a system in which they have no belief. They reject the democracies; they reject the moderate Islamic societies; they reject all groupings other than their own combination of al-Qaeda and a Taliban-style globe. Secondly, and this is something I want to lay before the House in speaking to this bill, there also has to be what is known as soft power. Soft power is the recognition that ideas can move countries and people. They will not change al-Qaeda; they will not change the core Taliban. But it is very important that, whilst we use the hard measures to defend ourselves and to break down the capability of al-Qaeda and those extremists who support al-Qaeda, at the same time we take three key steps to influence the communities from which they draw some of their people. </para><para>Firstly, there has to be a democratisation of both wealth and political power within the Middle East. We see in Afghanistan and Iraq the seeds of that democratisation; we see extraordinary steps. Incidentally, in Iran, Libya and Syria, we see the nascent steps towards some form of disarmament. It is very positive. Let us not overstate it, but it is positive. So, firstly, there has to be a democratisation of wealth and political power in the Middle East. The Western world has to stand up and take responsibility, because we have been too weak on that front in the past. Secondly, we have to encourage those who would support moderate, broad based education as opposed to those who would support extremist education. Thirdly, we have to participate in joint policing operations. But in terms of hard security, intelligence is indispensable and the Intelligence Services Amendment Bill 2003 is critical to bringing forth those steps.</para><para>What it does is essentially two things: firstly, it allows Australian Secret Intelligence Service personnel to be armed under appropriate circumstances; and, secondly, it allows them to participate in the planning of authorised force operations by other agencies—until this point in time they have not been able to do so. When you look at situations in Indonesia, in the Philippines and in other parts of the world, the lesson from the Bali bombing is that an extraordinary amount can be achieved through cooperation between Australia's security and policing forces and the appropriate security and policing forces in the region and amongst our allies. That is what this bill enables. It enables Australia to participate in the planning of activities which involve authorised force to protect, to preserve and to prevent. Those are the core elements, and that is what we have to do.</para><para>We face a threat unlike anything we have faced before. We are a target, not because of any specific actions but because of who we are. As we have seen, whether it was the Philippines, Indonesia, the Middle East, Tanzania or Kenya, numerous countries have suffered from direct actions against them despite the fact that they were not involved in Iraq and they were not involved in Afghanistan. Actions have been taken against countries because al-Qaeda will base its activities on opportunity and capability. So we have to deal with that by confronting them head-on. At the same time, the second thing that we have to do is to make sure that we deal with the communities from which they draw some of their people. We have to do that by emphasising democratisation of wealth and power, by emphasising education and by emphasising joint policing activities. This bill takes a small step and an important step towards protecting Australian Secret Intelligence Service personnel and allowing us to cooperate in the hard security matters with other countries, like-minded countries and those who have genuine concerns. I commend the bill to the House. I recognise that it is an important step in Australia helping to protect itself and to participate in global protection.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>27625</page.no><name role="metadata">Ripoll, Bernie, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RIPOLL</name><name.id>83E</name.id><electorate>Oxley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Australian Labor Party supports the <inline ref="R1913">Intelligence Services Amendment Bill 2003</inline> and the proposed amendments to the Intelligence Services Act 2001. As all in the House would know, the proposed amendments provide greater measures for the Australian Secret Intelligence Service—ASIS—to be involved in the planning and undertaking of paramilitary or violent activities by others and to provide, train with and use weapons and self-defence techniques in certain circumstances. Given the current climate and the need for Australia to be active in the fight against terrorism, these measures are necessary. Australia abhors terrorism and is steadfast in its fight against it. That is why the Labor Party supports these amendments. They are necessary and appropriate. The passage of this bill is necessary because the international security climate has changed greatly in recent years.</para></talk.start><para>We now live in a time where terrorism is threatening our very way of life. Terrorism, in all its forms, affronts all that Australia stands for and all Australians find terrorism repugnant. Given the changing circumstances in international security since the September 11 attacks in the United States, Australia must adopt and initiate methods to counter terrorist activities. ASIS today is operating in a range of environments where the security situation is deteriorating and where its work involves intelligence collection on terrorism and weapons proliferation targets in the region. ASIS's work on terrorism and weapons proliferation targets bring additional threats to the safety of ASIS officers and agents. It is a reality that, in this changed international environment, ASIS agents now face much greater levels of personal and physical danger than they have in the more recent past. ASIS officers are now operating in a difficult and uncertain international environment that needs to be dealt with.</para><para>The first responsibility of this parliament and of the executive of this country is to provide for the national security of our nation. The ALP recognises that it is important in these changed circumstances that ASIS be able to discharge its activities and provide for the adequate protection of its staff and those working within the organisation. Under the proposed amendment bill, ASIS officers and agents would be allowed to carry weapons for self-defence purposes. This still precludes the initiation of acts of violence and ensures ASIS remains an intelligence collection agency that conducts its activities in a non-violent fashion.</para><para>Given the enhanced self-defence needs of ASIS officers and agents in the current international environment and the formalisation of self-defence powers involved, three proposed changes need to be considered in some detail. Firstly, there is the provision of training in weapons use and self-defence techniques. Essentially, the new provisions would enable ASIS officers and agents to be trained in the use of weapons only for self-defence purposes. In addition to the conditions attached to the provision of a weapon to an ASIS officer or agent for the purposes of self-protection, for the protection of individuals assisting ASIS operations or for training purposes, is the requirement that the Minister for Foreign Affairs must provide written notice to the Director-General approving the provision of the weapon and the training in the use of the weapon. Specifically, these provisions relate to the use of a weapon or a self-defence technique outside of Australia. In other words, ASIS agents or officers will not be authorised to use a weapon within Australia.</para><para>Secondly, ASIS officers and agents can participate in the planning and undertaking of joint operations with other Australian organisations and approved non-Australian organisations. Another change to the act allows ASIS officers and agents to participate in the planning and undertaking of joint operations—that is, with other Australian organisations and, again, with approved non-Australian organisations. This primarily relates to the new challenges arising from terrorism and the possibility of Australians being taken hostage and where operational cooperation with other agencies becomes an essential element of ASIS agents and officers doing their task. </para><para>Thirdly, ASIS would be able to extend physical protection in self-defence to individuals in other organisations that were acting in support of ASIS's activities. This change, which is part of the new second schedule, relates to Australian Federal Police or members of Australia's military. The range of individuals that could be protected by those acting in self-defence is governed by section 13 of the existing act, which defines those organisations with which ASIS may cooperate. The proposed amendments would not alter this in any way and, in any activity involving armed ASIS officers acting with another approved organisation, ASIS officers and agents would only be able to operate in self-defence or defence of those engaged in agreed cooperative operations.</para><para>This bill has been to the Joint Standing Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD. It was referred to that most important committee on our intelligence organisations when it was first introduced into the House late last year. The committee has unanimously recommended strengthening the amendment legislation in three key areas: self-defence by ASIS officers, including training; oversight of cooperation with other Australian agencies who are armed, such as the Australian Federal Police and ASIO; and oversight of ASIS involvement in planning paramilitary activity and accompanying overseas agencies who are armed and who are doing what is defined in the legislation as legitimate activity.</para><para>The opposition support these amendments. We support them because they are an appropriate response to a real need. While we continually talk—and will do for many years to come—about the changed security environment, the recognition of that changed security environment has to be reflected in government legislation. It also needs to be reflected in the powers that are given to our policing forces, our military and our intelligence organisations in carrying out their duties and responsibilities. The complexity of the environment in which ASIS agents and officers operate necessitates these changes and amendments.</para><para>This bill addresses the changes in the international security environment, provides for the self-defence of our ASIS personnel overseas and enables cooperation with other Australian and foreign organisations. With the amendments in this bill, I agree that there is no need for change within Australia, as in the past when officers were armed we have experienced difficulties. That has been talked about quite a few times tonight, so I will not repeat that. Certainly in the international sphere and in the role that our officers play internationally that change is most necessary.</para><para>Equipping our personnel so that they may be able to defend themselves is an essential requirement in this day and age if we are to be serious about fighting the war against terrorism. We live in an internationally changed world that is fundamentally at risk from the continuing threat of global terrorism. We must be strident in our fight against this threat. We must ensure that the men and women we send out on our behalf to fight and to protect us are equipped and have the necessary training to carry out their duties safely. In the case of ASIS, it is essential that we allow those officers in the field of operations the ability to defend themselves properly. This is a responsible response to the changing nature of the threat environment that we live in.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>27627</page.no><name role="metadata">King, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KING</name><name.id>00AMQ</name.id><electorate>Wentworth</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It was on 1 October 2001 that the Intelligence Services Act was passed, establishing the constitutionality and accountability of some critical intelligence agencies in this country—in particular, the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, the Defence Signals Directorate and ASIO, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. That legislation was important, because it established for the first time a proper foundation in law for the secret intelligence agencies which hitherto had been the subject of ministerial direction and exercise of prerogative powers, and ministerial and administrative powers. However, it had been thought—indeed presciently, I might add—that it was time to put these bodies on a proper footing. It is interesting that the September 11 tragedy occurred prior to the enactment of the Intelligence Services Act 2001, but it is also fair to say that it did not take into account the events of 2001 itself. That, of course, was a cataclysmic event, and I want to come to that in a moment.</para></talk.start><para>I wish to draw the attention of the House to a couple of features of the original statute which the <inline ref="R1913">Intelligence Services Amendment Bill 2003</inline> is amending, because they do establish an important foundation for the conduct of Australia's intelligence agencies. The functions of ASIS, the subject of the amendment before the House, are particularly relevant and are threefold. The first function is to obtain, in accordance with government requirements, intelligence about the capabilities, intentions or activities of people outside Australia; the second function is to conduct counterintelligence activities; and the third function is to liaise with intelligence or security services.</para><para>I suppose the word `intelligence' in this context gives rise to interesting observations about spooks and what they do. The fact that Peter Ustinov recently passed away even gives rise to some humorous observations about the clandestine activities of intelligence services and their agents. But it could never be suggested that those observations apply to ASIS—or not as far as we are aware in this country. What is important is that that intelligence gathering concerning the capabilities, intentions or activities of people or organisations outside Australia is at the heart of the role of ASIS. As a counter to that is its counterintelligence role. As I understand the nature of counterintelligence activities, they particularly involve the organisation infiltrating where it can the organisations of intelligence agencies from competing or rival countries and providing information to government in a way that could not ordinarily be done through straightforward intelligence activities.</para><para>The third function of ASIS is to liaise with overseas agencies. It seems to me to be important to point out the limits that currently exist on the activities of those agencies. The first limitation is that the activities must occur outside Australia. That is important, because ASIS has had a particular role in the context of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the relevant ministerial oversight body in respect of the activities of ASIS, subject of course to the provisions of the operation of the Inspector-General of Security and Intelligence.</para><para>The second interesting limitation relates to the privacy arrangements which are set out in section 15 of the statute. When the Intelligence Services Act was brought into effect in October 2001, the privacy arrangements were very much at the heart of the concern of many people in this place so far as the future operation of ASIS was concerned—and, indeed, that of DSD and ASIO. It is fair to say that the Australian community has always been a little suspicious of secretive or clandestine agencies such as ASIS—and, I respectfully suggest, properly so in a democracy such as ours. Therefore it was appropriate, when establishing ASIS on a proper footing, to have regard to those concerns in the community. The third limitation, which is critical for present purposes, was that ASIS must not plan for or undertake paramilitary activities or activities involving violence against the person or the use of weapons, as provided for in section 6(4) of the statute—and those words speak for themselves.</para><para>That being the foundation of ASIS, which is the critical intelligence organisation, as we sit here tonight the question is: what has changed to make the relevant amendments necessary? The first critical change came with the cataclysmic events of September 11 and October 12 and, indeed, the recent events in Madrid, Spain. These events have made the work of such agencies dangerous and even more imperative and important than it was before. The limitation referred to in section 6(4) obviously gives rise to concern, because to limit in that way an agency which is gathering information to assist the Australian government in the protection of the Australian people would certainly hinder its operations. That indeed was the opinion of the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD. That committee comprised parliamentarians who were very experienced—particularly in this area. It was chaired by the Hon. David Jull and had as members the Hon. Kim Beazley, Mr Stewart McArthur MP and the Hon. Leo McLeay—all very experienced in their concern for and consideration of the national interest in relation to intelligence gathering and, in particular, the limitations that have been placed upon ASIS as a result of the changed international environment to which I have referred.</para><para>I do not wish to go into the detail of what happened on September 11 or in the Bali bombings. I have done that on another occasion. Members of this House would well know that from my area of Australia, the eastern suburbs of Sydney, more were killed in the Bali bombings than from any other area of that size in the country, and I attended many of the funerals of those who were killed. So I feel very strongly about the importance of ensuring that those people did not die in vain.</para><para>Let me come to the heart of the matter in relation to the amendments now before the House. The first amendment to which I wish to draw attention concerns the operation of section 6(4), which relates to the limitation on the carriage of weapons. The way in which the amendment operates is somewhat curious. Subsection 4 in schedule 1 of the amending bill provides that that section—which is the original section which I have read out—does not prevent the provision of weapons or training in the use of weapons or in self-defence techniques in accordance with schedule 2. So it does not seek to amend section 6(4) at all, but what it does then, in that portion of the statute which deals with so-called limits on the provision of weapons and training, is provide the following under the heading, `Schedule 2—Limits on provisions of weapons, training etc.: </para><para>1 Provision of weapons, training etc.</para><para>(1) The provision of a weapon, or training in the use of a weapon ... is not prevented by subsection 6(4) if it is provided:</para><para>(a)	to a person who is a staff member or agent of ASIS; and</para><para>(b)	for the purpose of enabling the person:</para><para>(i)	to protect himself or herself; or</para><para>(ii)	to protect a staff member or agent of ASIS; or</para><para>(iii)	to protect a person who is co-operating with ASIS ... or to provide training.</para><para>Of themselves, those provisions appear to be rather limited in their scope and offer only limited additional protection to service officers. However, it is important to note that subsection (2) of the additional provisions provides as follows:</para><para>(2) The use of a weapon or self-defence techniques is not prevented by subsection 6(4) if:</para><para>	(a)	the weapon or techniques are used:</para><para>	(i)	for a purpose covered by      	paragraph (1)(b); or</para><para>	(ii)	in training ... </para><para>(b)	in a case covered by any of subparagraphs (1)(b)(i) to (iii)—the weapon or techniques are used outside Australia; and</para><para>	(c)	guidelines have been issued by the Director-General ... and</para><para>	(d)	the weapon or techniques are used in compliance with those guidelines.</para><para>So what are the protections for the Australian public, having regard to the privacy and other civil liberties issues which I raised or adverted to earlier? The first is that the activities of carrying and using weapons must only occur outside Australia subject to this one limitation: where there is the training of staff members or agents of ASIS, that may occur within Australia without ministerial approval and without any guidelines issued by the director-general; so those limitations that otherwise apply have no operation. </para><para>I suppose it is appropriate to permit the training of ASIS officers within Australia without ministerial approval or without restrictions upon the guidelines issued by the director-general. I would certainly support it, although on balance I would say this to those who administer ASIS in the future: the issue should be carefully monitored. We cannot allow an over-mighty subject anywhere to have complete freedom in relation to the use of firearms, especially as in this case there is no requirement to obtain a licence, permission or indeed registration for the training in the use of those weapons. But then we come to the actual use of weapons or self-defence techniques themselves. These can only occur outside Australia—not within Australia; outside Australia—and then subject to ministerial approval, subject to use in accordance with guidelines issued by the director-general and subject to complete compliance with those guidelines.</para><para>I have mentioned concerns that we should not put in place a clandestine organisation not normally subject to the law of this country—or indeed any other country—which has powers that are unusual or not consistent with normal democratic policing techniques. It seems to me that the protections that are being put in place by the proposed schedule 2—and in particular by items 1(1) and 1(2) in that proposed schedule—are satisfactory, both in the interests of the Australian people as a whole and in regard to our responsibilities to ensure that, when those operatives are working outside Australia gathering intelligence or are involved in counterintelligence or in liaising with foreign agencies, the limitations placed upon their use by this amending legislation are appropriate.</para><para>For those reasons, I therefore support the amendments. I commend the honourable member for Fadden's committee, which I know has worked very hard in coming up with these amendments, and I commend the members of that committee. But I would make this final comment: in establishing this important power for these agencies, those who are ultimately responsible for monitoring the use of those powers, the use of those weapons and indeed the use of the various self-defence and other techniques which they are now entitled to use—which they were not entitled to have or use before<inline font-weight="bold">—</inline>should be carefully monitored. The guidelines themselves should be the subject of consideration by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security from time to time. In my respectful submission to the House, the minister too, through an appropriate mechanism, should ensure that both the inspector-general and the director-general are carrying out their activities in a way that is consistent with the general interests of the Australian people, their concern for privacy—as in section 15 of the original statute—and, at the same time, the civil liberties of all Australians and those who these laws are ultimately designed to protect. I support the bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>27630</page.no><name role="metadata">Organ, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ORGAN</name><name.id>BNL</name.id><electorate>Cunningham</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I welcome the opportunity to speak on the <inline ref="R1913">Intelligence Services Amendment Bill 2003</inline>. I have genuine concerns over this bill, and I am not as comfortable with certain aspects of the bill as the member for Wentworth, who did raise some concerns as well. The purpose of the Intelligence Services Amendment Bill, according to the second reading speech of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, is:</para></talk.start><quote><para>... to allow the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS) to undertake its functions more effectively, while maintaining appropriate legislative limitations on the functions of the agency.</para></quote><para>The minister went on to say:</para><quote><para>ASIS's functions under the act would not be changed by this bill.</para><para>At the time the act commenced operation, it was expressly stated that ASIS was not to conduct paramilitary activities, and in the planning and performance of its functions was not allowed to undertake activities involving violence against the person or the use of weapons.</para><para>Since that time, however, the aftermath of the tragic events of 11 September 2001, and the Bali bombing on 12 October 2002, have contributed to a fundamental change in the environments in which ASIS must work. These changes could not have been predicted at the time the act was prepared. As a result, this amendment bill is now required to allow ASIS to provide more adequately for the protection of its staff ... and agents ...</para></quote><para>This is rather twisted logic. According to the minister, two terrorist attacks equal fundamental environmental change. It seems to me that the minister is putting the cart before the horse. Surely 9-11 and Bali resulted from a changed environment rather than the reverse. After all, it is not as though they were the first large-scale terrorist actions.</para><para>However, there is no doubt that ASIS has an obligation to provide adequately for the protection of its staff, and the government's answer to that is to give the staff and agents guns—not, you understand, that those guns will be used for paramilitary activities or to offer violence against any person. As the minister has told us:</para><quote><para>... the bill retains the restraint on ASIS undertaking in its own right activities involving the use of force, including use of weapons, other than for the limited purposes of protection. ASIS will continue to conduct its activities in a non-violent way.</para></quote><para>That is reassuring, isn't it, Mr Deputy Speaker? But, if we are not getting involved in state-sanctioned murder just yet, just what is ASIS getting involved in? Let us go back to the foreign minister in his second reading speech, where he said:</para><quote><para>Currently the act can prevent the agency—</para></quote><para>ASIS, in other words—</para><quote><para>from effectively cooperating with other authorities who might use force as a legitimate part of their functions. The amendment addresses this issue.</para></quote><para>Let us just try and understand for a minute why that is. Subsection 6(4) of the Intelligence Services Act 2001 says:</para><quote><para>In performing its functions, ASIS must not plan for, or undertake, paramilitary activities or activities involving violence against the person or the use of weapons.</para></quote><para>The change now proposed by this bill inserts a new section 6(4) which says:</para><para>In performing its functions, ASIS must not plan for, or undertake, activities that involve:</para><para>(a) paramilitary activities; or</para><para>(b) violence against the person; or</para><para>(c) the use of weapons;</para><para>by staff members or agents of ASIS.</para><para>Do you see the subtle change there, Mr Deputy Speaker? Now it is apparently okay for ASIS to take part in paramilitary activities, activities involving violence against the person or the use of weapons, as long as they do not do it themselves. There are distinct shades of George Orwell here. I am sure honourable members are familiar with <inline font-style="italic">Animal Farm</inline>, Orwell's parable about the Russian revolution. In that story, written towards the end of the Second World War, the animals of Manor Farm revolt against Farmer Jones, led by the pigs under Napoleon. The revolution is successful, and the animals draw up a list of principles which includes the precept that no animal shall sleep in a bed. Over time the pigs get greedy. Boxer the horse and Benjamin the donkey discover that the pigs are sleeping in beds in Farmer Jones's old house, and the precept that no animal shall sleep in a bed has the words `with sheets' added—no doubt by a `no sleeping in beds amendment bill'. There is more, but I am sure you get my drift here, Mr Deputy Speaker.</para><para>It is an awful lot like what the Intelligence Services Amendment Bill does. Under this bill, ASIS can involve itself in—when they are carried out by other agencies—paramilitary activities, violence against the person or the use of weapons, as long as its staff members and agents do not undertake those functions themselves. We do not know who those agents are, by the way. The enabling legislation is silent on that point. Nor do we know why this has become such a burning issue, except that terrorist attacks 18 and 30 months ago contributed to a fundamental change in the environments in which ASIS must work.</para><para>I smell a rat. There is something here that the foreign minister is not telling us—no doubt he will say that is because of security or operational reasons. But whatever it is, it did not happen 30 months ago or even 18 months ago. I believe it is something recent, otherwise the minister's concern to protect ASIS personnel in the conduct of their legitimate functions under the act would be just so much flummery. The minister offers no justification for his claim that the current act can prevent the agency from effectively cooperating with other authorities who might use force as a legitimate part of their functions. Nor does he tell us who those other authorities might be: perhaps they are the Australian Federal Police, state police, the Defence Force. Or maybe, just maybe, they are foreign authorities like the CIA, which has a long and shameful history of state sanctioned assassination. And maybe these operations are taking place in Iraq. It is just a thought, but one which would certainly fit with the government's extraterritorial adventurism.</para><para>I have no quarrel with allowing ASIS to provide more adequately for the protection of its staff members and even its agents. Those aspects of the bill I accept. What I cannot accept is any move towards actions such as state sanctioned assassination, and there are aspects of this bill which would suggest a move down that path. I therefore, in conscience, cannot support this bill as it currently stands.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>27632</page.no><name role="metadata">Schultz, Alby, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SCHULTZ</name><name.id>83Q</name.id><electorate>Hume</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1913">Intelligence Services Amendment Bill 2003</inline> tonight because I am mindful of how times have changed. I can remember when I was a little boy my father being away fighting for Australia in the Second World War. When I was in my teens issues arose with regard to intelligence and intelligence gathering and the sorts of things that used to occur in those days. One of the techniques that I am talking about was that members of the Australian Defence Force were dropped on to isolated islands around New Guinea and beyond to gather intelligence information for the Australian Defence Force and, indeed, for the allies during the Second World War.</para></talk.start><para>I really do get disappointed when I hear the left-wing comments of people like the member for Cunningham who place a sinister emphasis on the changes that are being made to this act in the interest of protecting people going about their business, in the interest of protecting people such as him as an Australian in this great country of ours. I wonder why the political Greens party has gone along this mindless, politically correct direction and is willing to see the lives of good, highly trained Australians put at risk because of its ideology.</para><para>The Australian Secret Intelligence Service is an intelligence collection agency. Its primary function is to obtain and distribute intelligence information, not readily available by other means, on the capabilities, intentions and activities of individuals or organisations outside Australia, which may impact on Australian interests and the wellbeing of its citizens. The tasks of ASIS include reporting on major defence, international relations or national economic issues. ASIS can also work against threats from terrorism and weapons proliferation and against other threats to national security.</para><para>I would have thought that the two incidents that have shocked the world, which led to a change in this particular bill, would have been sufficient to send a message to people like the member for Cunningham that changes had to be made. I refer of course to the Bali bombings, which were perpetrated by members of terrorist organisations and which killed many fine, young Australians. I also refer to the September 11 aerial bombings of buildings in the United States, which killed thousands of people. One wonders whether people like the member for Cunningham are living in their own special little world, where they can ignore those sorts of incidents and how innocent men, women and children have died because of them. One wonders why they object to a very necessary change to legislation that is designed to, in the long term, protect Australia's best interest by allowing people who risk their life and liberty to go overseas and, in very difficult circumstances, obtain that sort of intelligence.</para><para>I am pleased that these amendments have been supported by the Australian Labor Party, because it is one of the very few bills that I have seen in the time that I have been a member of this institution that is going to contribute to the safety of Australia and its citizens that the Australian Labor Party have supported. I commend them for acting in a bipartisan way on a very serious issue.</para><para>Back in the late 1970s the royal commission into the intelligence services recommended placing ASIS on a statutory footing. Following the Samuels inquiry in 1995, the then government adopted the proposal that ASIS be placed under legislation. The present government committed to such legislation, and the Intelligence Services Act 2001 came into effect on 28 October 2001. It had, however, been drafted and introduced to parliament before the tragic events that I have just alluded to. It was passed into law when the changes that these and other factors would bring to the environment in which ASIS works could not be foreseen.</para><para>As stated in the act, ASIS is not a police or law enforcement agency and it does not plan for or undertake activities involving the use of force. The proposed amendment would not change this but would operate to ensure that the act no longer prevented a staff member or agent from using a weapon or self-defence technique for defensive purposes outside Australia when on ASIS business, providing that the legislative oversight and guidelines requirement of these legislative amendments were met.</para><para>Under the act, ASIS is responsible to the government through the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The Director-General of ASIS is directly responsible to the minister. ASIS obtains intelligence in response to priorities determined by other government agencies. These priorities are set within the framework of critical interest determined by government. Key agencies involved in the setting of intelligence tasking for ASIS include the Office of National Assessments, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of Defence and various agencies within the defence portfolio. ASIS tasking is kept under ongoing review, as it should be in the interest of protecting individuals within this great country of ours.</para><para>The government places a high value on intelligence capabilities and outputs and on ASIS being a strong, professional and vibrant organisation, well equipped to meet the intelligence challenges of the global environment and able to assist in securing the wellbeing of all Australians. ASIS has important obligations to protect those who work with it and to protect information which foreign governments share with it. ASIS relies on people who sometimes put their lives and liberty at considerable risk. ASIS therefore attaches the utmost importance to security and the protection of sources of information.</para><para>Those of us who have relatives in one of the organisations that have been mentioned by a number of members here tonight would appreciate that, at times, when there is no other alternative but to take action to protect yourself, people living in that very dangerous environment must be given the means to protect themselves and those working with them. I have a son and daughter-in-law who are AFP officers and I am conscious of the fact that, in this day and age, with the terrorist threat that we know is out there, we are no longer as safe. We do not live in an environment where we can go freely about doing the things that we take for granted in this great democratic society that we live in. But we are also aware that, when people, whether they are in the Australian Defence Force or the Australian Federal Police or any other law enforcement or defence agency, are placed in a position where they are undertaking work on behalf of their organisation and the country in general, they should be able, where appropriate, to take whatever action is needed to protect themselves and, in doing so, to protect the security of Australia and its people.</para><para>I have to say that I do get a little upset when I hear the sorts of comments that were made by the member for Cunningham. I get upset because I would have thought that a person of some considerable intelligence, which he obviously is, would think very seriously about running in the ideological direction that drives the party that he is a member of and that he would think on a broader scale—out of that narrow, tunnel-vision ideological view that he has—not only about Australia in general but also about its people and, more importantly, its future generations. We have to take all of those things into consideration when we make changes, which are sometimes very difficult for governments, in bills such as this one. We do not do it because we want to create some sort of controversial argument of a political nature out there in the community; we do it, with the assistance of Her Majesty's opposition, in an environment where we believe collectively that we are doing what is right for this great country of ours.</para><para>There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that what is occurring with this particular bill is going to be beneficial to the Australian Secret Intelligence Service and, more importantly, the men and women that work in it. They will ensure, I have absolutely no doubt, that they will do all that is physically and mentally possible within their highly trained capabilities to gather intelligence and information that we want to be forewarned about—that is, on any terrorist organisation or illegal activity that is being contemplated against Australia and its people—which reaches this great country and that our appropriate organisations will act upon it in a time frame that allows us to neutralise that problem before it occurs. I compliment the bill and I thank the House for the opportunity to speak on it. As I said, I believe it is a very important piece of legislation. Can I say once again that it is very pleasing from my point of view as a member of parliament to see the opposition joining with the coalition in supporting this bill and putting it through the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>27634</page.no><name role="metadata">Smith, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANTHONY SMITH</name><name.id>00APG</name.id><electorate>Casey</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to support the <inline ref="R1913">Intelligence Services Amendment Bill 2003</inline>. It is a very important bill. It will improve Australia's capacity in this area into the future. At the start of my remarks I would like to associate myself with the remarks of the member for Hume with respect to the position of the Greens and the member for Cunningham. I agree with them wholeheartedly. I also agree with his remarks with respect to the opposition and, in that light, I commend people such as the member for Fadden who have worked long and hard, through the committee system, through the detail of this important bill for the benefit of Australia.</para></talk.start><para>As previous speakers have said, this bill is all the more relevant to the security needs of our nation following the tragic events of September 11, the horrific Bali bombing and, of course, in the forefront of our minds, the recent events in Madrid. These events highlight the critical role that our security agencies, such as ASIS and our other defence agencies, play. They also highlight the consequential need for us as a parliament to ensure that they have all the powers and resources necessary to carry out their very important functions for our country.</para><para>Australians are only too aware that international security issues have come to the fore, as I have just said. In that context the contents of this bill have been developed in response to the difficult environment in which our security agencies, such as ASIS, operate. As Australia's overseas intelligence collection agency, ASIS has for many years served our interests around the globe. As previous speakers in the debate have outlined, its primary function is to obtain and distribute intelligence information not readily available by other means about the capabilities, intentions and activities of individuals and organisations outside our country which may impact on Australia's interests and, of course, the wellbeing of our citizens. The tasks of ASIS include reporting on defence, international relations and the like. The service can also work against threats of terrorism, weapons proliferation and other threats to our national security.</para><para>The rise of international terrorism and other more recent developments means that amendments are needed to ensure that ASIS is not held back in its quest to fulfil its functions and responsibilities for Australia. The changes being debated in this bill this evening will not change the primary functions of ASIS but will rather clarify and—more importantly—expand the existing law relating to the use of weapons and self-defence techniques by ASIS staff. The proposed amendments will mean an ASIS staff member or agent is no longer prohibited from using a weapon or self-defence technique for defensive purposes outside Australia when on ASIS business. In fulfilling their role it is fair to expect that ASIS staff on occasions may find themselves in dangerous situations—situations where they need to be able to defend themselves and those around them. These threats will of course only have increased in recent years as a consequence of the war on terror.</para><para>It is important to note that ASIS is not a police force or an agency that plans for or undertakes activities involving the use of force. These amendments, subject to some very strict safeguards, which have been outlined, simply allow for a greater degree of personal protection. Currently, ASIS is prevented from effectively co-operating with other international agencies that might use force as part of their normal functioning. This amendment will allow ASIS to be involved in the planning of activities undertaken by other organisations, provided that ASIS staff members do not themselves undertake such activities. The bill also will allow for the protection of ASIS staff as they perform their duties—that is, another agency can provide the level of personal protection required by ASIS staff.</para><para>Once passed, the bill will allow the use of weapons or self-defence techniques only for personal protection on missions outside Australia. The only permitted use inside Australia will be for training purposes. As with other activities covered under the Intelligence Services Act there are very strict guidelines and requirements on ASIS staff, including the director-general.</para><para>I am glad, as the member for Hume and most of the other speakers on this side of the House are, that these measures are supported by both sides of the House. As a parliament we should be able to respond quickly when the needs of our Defence Force, police, law enforcement and intelligence agencies require a fast response. ASIS is a key contributor to the efforts needed to protect Australia's national interest and to combat those engaged in terrorism. These amendments are vital, as are other legislative initiatives and policies undertaken by the Howard government. Given that the opposition are supporting these sensible amendments to the act, I also hope they will be able to take a constructive approach and support the government's other defence policy and security initiatives. I commend the bill to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>27636</page.no><name role="metadata">Gallus, Christine, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs GALLUS</name><name.id>CU4</name.id><electorate>Hindmarsh</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of the government, I would like to thank all those honourable members who have participated in the debate on this very important bill.

Importantly, however, the bill retains the restraints on ASIS undertaking, in its own right, activities involving the use of force, including the use of weapons other than for the limited purpose of self-protection. Therefore ASIS will continue to conduct its activities in a nonviolent way. Amendments to the original bill were introduced to the House on 15 October 2003. Further amendments have been circulated. These amendments respond to the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD on the Intelligence Services Amendment Bill 2003. That unanimous report was presented to parliament on 11 March 2004.</para><para>I commend the committee's report and record my appreciation for the work of the committee and the secretariat as well as those who participated in the private hearings held by the committee. The committee's report contains nine recommendations. The recommendations for the bill do not propose to expand or significantly change the activities ASIS could undertake, but relate mainly to strengthened oversight and accountability mechanisms. At this point, I present the government's response to the committee's report and table that response.</para><para>In summary, the government accepts recommendations 4, 5, 6, 8 and 9 as proposed. It also accepts recommendations 1, 2, 3 and 7 with some slight modifications. I will comment in detail on the amendments to the bill following from the recommendations of the committee. As I go through them, I think the members who have commented on this bill earlier tonight will see that many of their points have been taken up.</para><para>Recommendation 1 states that the bill:</para><quote><para>... be amended to include a provision setting out oversight mechanisms for the initial approval of operations and for subsequent reporting to enable review and accountability; and </para><para>where ASIS anticipates being involved in the planning or undertaking of operations with foreign organisations that may include the use of force, the approvals process be expanded to include the Prime Minister and the Attorney General.</para></quote><para>ASIS already has extensive oversight mechanisms for the initial approval of its activities. All highly sensitive proposals are considered and either approved, or put aside, by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Comment from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is provided on all submissions to the minister.</para><para>The Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security has the responsibility to review the legality and propriety of all of ASIS's activities and this includes ASIS's compliance with ministerial approvals and directions. Notwithstanding these measures, the government accepts the recommendation. To address the first part of recommendation 1, amendment (2) specifies that ASIS should include in its annual report details of the number and broad nature of any cooperation by ASIS with an authority of another country in planning or undertaking of the foreign authority's activities which involve violence or planning for the use of violence. The annual report is available to relevant senior ministers and the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security.</para><para>Amendment (1) of the further amendments refers to recommendation 1 of the committee's report. An approval under section 13(1)(c) of the Intelligence Services Act 2001 will not enable ASIS to cooperate with an authority of another country in the planning or undertaking of the foreign authority's activities covered by the proposed sections 6(4)(a) to (c) of the act unless the Minister for Foreign Affairs has consulted the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General before giving approval. In addition, and in implementation of the first part of recommendation 2, the Director-General of ASIS will issue classified internal protocols, separate to the guidelines on the use of weapons and self-defence techniques already required by the amendment, on the conduct of cooperation with foreign authorities where that cooperation could include planning or undertaking activities covered by the proposed sections 6(4)(a) to (c) of the act. These protocols would proscribe the involvement of ASIS in any activity intended to lead to assassination. A copy of these protocols will be provided to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security.</para><para>Recommendation 3 states:</para><quote><para>... that ASIS's use of weapons under the provisions of the Bill be limited to semi-automatic hand-guns and pistols. In addition:</para><para>the range of weapons to be used in ASIS training and operations be defined in the guidelines under Schedule 2, sub-clause 1(6); and</para><para>the specific types of weapons to be used on each operation be authorised by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</para></quote><para>The government agrees that the range of weapons to be used in ASIS training and activities be defined in the guidelines for the use of weapons and self-defence techniques. The definition would note that the provision of weapons will normally be limited to semiautomatic hand guns, pistols, and lesser or non-lethal weapons. However, it would not be prudent for the bill itself to be overly restrictive about the specific weapons to be utilised by ASIS staff members or agents.</para><para>Amendment (3) proposes that approval for the provision of a weapon or training in the use of a weapon or self-defence techniques must specify: the purpose for which the weapon or training is provided; any conditions that must be complied with in relation to the provision of the weapon or training; and, in particular, the kind or class of weapon involved.</para><para>Recommendation 7 states:</para><quote><para>... that the Bill be amended to require the Director-General of ASIS to provide the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security a report on any operational incident with the potential to embarrass Australia. This information could then be included in the Inspector-General's reports to Government as appropriate.</para></quote><para>Under the existing Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act 1986 IGIS already undertakes review of ASIS activities. This would include any activity which resulted in such an incident.</para><para>Amendment (4) specifies that, where a staff member or agent discharges a weapon in the protection of a staff member or agent or person cooperating with ASIS in accordance with section 13 of the act, the Director-General must, as soon as practicable, give to IGIS a written report of the discharge which explains the circumstance in which it occurred.</para><para>I will comment briefly on two of the other recommendations. In accepting recommendation 2 the government notes that, given the independent oversight role of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, it would not be appropriate for him to have a direct role in the approval of the guidelines on the use of weapons and self-defence techniques that the Director-General of ASIS is required to issue under the existing provisions of the bill. The government therefore proposes that the guidelines be produced in consultation with the inspector-general and with relevant departments and agencies and that the guidelines be referred to the National Security Committee of cabinet for approval. With regard to recommendation 9, the government accepts the recommendation in its entirety but notes that, in using the training and logistics models of the Australian Federal Police as a basis for developing training and logistics guidelines of its own, ASIS should not be precluded from undertaking additional training from other Commonwealth and state agencies, should there be a requirement for it.</para><para>From what I have said, it is clear the four amendments to the Intelligence Services Amendment Bill 2003 largely follow the recommendations of the committee on this important bill. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs stated when introducing this bill, the functions performed by ASIS are essential and highly valued and, in the current environment, have arguably never been more important to Australia. This bill strikes a balance between the need to allow ASIS to protect its people adequately and cooperate with other agencies effectively and the need to maintain ASIS as an organisation which carries out its own functions in a nonviolent way.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>27639</page.no><name role="metadata">McClelland, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McCLELLAND</name><name.id>JK6</name.id><electorate>Barton</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I indicate to the House that the opposition supports the amendments as proposed.</para></talk.start><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill, as amended, agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>27639</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Mrs GALLUS (Hindmarsh—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs) (8.46 p.m.)—by leave—I move:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a third time.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a third time.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title><type>Questions Without Notice</type><page.no>27639</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Defence Force: Deployment</title><page.no>27639</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>27639</page.no><name role="metadata">Mr ANDERSON,MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDERSON</name><name.id>4K4</name.id><electorate>Gwydir</electorate><party>NATS</party><role>Minister for Transport and Regional Services</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek the indulgence of the chair to add to an answer.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

This limitation in the act means that the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service does not have the flexibility it requires to respond as quickly and efficiently as it would like in order to meet demands for increased levels of intervention to protect Australia's vast quarantine borders. The government has proposed to overcome this limitation by including contractors in the range of persons who could be appointed as quarantine officers. The Senate has rejected this approach, with opposition and Democrat senators claiming that this was some kind of attempt to privatise AQIS by stealth. I reject that assertion absolutely.</para><para>However, to avoid further delay in the resolution of this very important issue which directly impacts on the capacity of AQIS to deliver quarantine services, especially in remote areas and at times of unusually high demand for staff resources, the government has decided to propose an alternative approach which seeks to broaden the pool of persons who may be appointed, while remaining within the framework of organisations established under legislation for a public purpose. These amendments demonstrate the government's commitment to ensuring that AQIS has the capacity necessary to protect Australia's long and often remote borders.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>27641</page.no></debateinfo><para>Mr TRUSS (Wide Bay—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (8.52 p.m.)—I move:</para><motion><para>That the House do now adjourn.</para></motion><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>New South Wales: Carr Government</title><page.no>27641</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>27641</page.no><name role="metadata">Baldwin, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BALDWIN</name><name.id>LL6</name.id><electorate>Paterson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I, like many members in New South Wales, awoke this morning to find out that the New South Wales government was recalling the New South Wales parliament next week to have a mini-budget. `Mini-budget' means mismanagement. As a member from the Hunter, it concerned me when I read the <inline font-style="italic">Newcastle Herald </inline>this morning and saw the headline: `$35m service cuts to Hunter'. The article said:</para></talk.start><quote><para>The people of the Hunter will face state tax increases in the new financial year, as well as the possibility of losing $35 million worth of services.</para></quote><para>It went on to say:</para><quote><para>Mr Carr and Mr Egan said they did not have specific details of which projects would go “on hold'' and which assets would be sold, but Mr Costa said critical services in the Hunter would suffer.</para></quote><para>It continued:</para><quote><para>For every dollar spent per capita on capital works in the Hunter, three dollars was spent in Sydney and that is even after 32 per cent of the state's exports come from the Hunter Valley ...</para></quote><para>I find this absolutely outrageous, when you consider that the New South Wales state Labor government have had an enormous windfall from stamp duty. In fact, they have had $8.4 billion in unexpected revenues in the last nine years. In 2004-05 they will receive from the Commonwealth a total of $15.9163 billion, which is a total increase of $188 million on the year before. In fact, the amount they will receive in total is nearly double the $8.348 billion they received in 1995-96. As I said, `mini-budget' equals mismanagement.</para><para>The <inline font-style="italic">Telegraph </inline>today highlighted the fact that there has been some $3.3 billion of wastage by the New South Wales Labor government. That includes the political advertising costs of the Commonwealth Grants Commission, which were $875,000. Energy Australia's loss on PowerTel was $96 million. The aborted Austeel project cost $21 million. The health write-off for the Allandale Aged Care Facility in the Hunter was $30.5 million. The millennium train stages 1 and 2 blow-out was $114 million. The Hunter and outer suburban train carriages blow-out was $78 million. The Pacific Highway upgrade blow-out was $876 million. The New South Wales government also spent $99 million in 2002-03 on consultants' bills for their mates. The amount spent on displaced public servants was $17.4 million. The one I love most of all is the fact that the department of education failed to budget for a leap year, which led to a blow-out of $8.6 million. State debt recovery office mismanagement cost $32 million. Those in the state government super fund would love the fact that their state Labor government have delivered them a Treasury managed fund negative investment return of $305 million. The list goes on and on. The Labor government in New South Wales have mismanaged $3.3 billion of taxpayers' money.</para><para>They talk about the Commonwealth Grants Commission. That is an independent body that distributes to the states the GST revenue—which will be $34 billion in the next financial year. The New South Wales government will receive a minimum of $9.6 billion of that GST revenue. Compare that to Victoria, which receives $7 billion, and Queensland, which receives $6.6 billion. The New South Wales Premier, Bob Carr, loved this distribution of funds not so long ago. He wrote in his diary on 19 April 1999:</para><quote><para>To my intense relief, (Howard) says he won't—cannot—overturn a recommendation of the Grants Commission unless the States are unanimous. Strong. Fair. I won't hear ill of this man. This gives me a victory to talk about to Sydney media and I praise the Prime Minister. I've learned that the more unaligned electorate loves this kind of non-partisanship.</para></quote><para>So when Bob Carr thinks he is getting a good deal, everything is fine and rosy, but when he thinks he is not he complains. New South Wales has the highest tax per person in the entire Australian state system. We pay more tax per person in New South Wales than happens anywhere else. Bob Carr and Michael Egan have more money now than ever before, yet they have run short. We have not seen massive increases in teachers' wages, nurses' wages or police wages. In fact, we have seen effective cutbacks. I call on the Carr Labor government to manage their money properly or get out of the chair and let a New South Wales Liberal-National Party government manage it effectively. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Moore, Mr Harry, OAM</title><page.no>27642</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>27642</page.no><name role="metadata">Hall, Jill, MP</name><name role="display">Ms HALL</name><name.id>83N</name.id><electorate>Shortland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Tonight I would like to pay tribute to Harry Moore OAM, a former member for Wyong, a former Wyong Shire councillor and an all-round good guy, who turned 80 yesterday. Harry is a legend on the Central Coast because of his dedication and commitment to the Central Coast and in particular Wyong Shire. Harry describes himself as being a rough diamond brought up in the school of hard knocks. He came from humble beginnings, worked hard and achieved greatness. Harry never forgets what it is like to struggle. He never forgets about the importance of his community, the importance of family and the importance of caring.</para></talk.start><para>Harry married his beloved wife, Cassie, in 1947. She is the proud daughter of a wharfie. In that same year he joined the ALP, and he has been a member of the Labor Party for 57 years. He joined the Phillip branch, which held its meetings in Billy McConnell's gym. His idol was Jack Lang. He is now a life member of the Labor Party. Over the years Harry has made enormous contributions through his involvement in the Labor Party. He worked as an electorate officer for Harry Jensen and helped Harry Jensen when he was Lord Mayor of Sydney.</para><para>But Harry Moore's contributions are greater than his contributions to the Labor Party. He has made enormous contributions to the community. The ALP has helped him to do that. The ALP was the party that Harry chose because it was in line with his philosophy. He used that to benefit, and to give to, his community. Harry served in the Second World War and was awarded the Australian Defence Medal, the Pacific Star, the Australian Service Medal and the Star. For his service during 1945-47 he was awarded the Australian Defence Medal with PNG clasp.</para><para>He has been involved with the Toukley RSL sub-branch, and he has been the master of ceremonies at the Wallarah Recreation Club Anzac Day service since 1999. He is a friend of Legacy. He helped Brisbane Water Legacy gain the crown land grant in Soldiers Point Drive at Norah Head, and that is where the Legacy hostel is now located. He got crown land granted in Evans Road, Toukley for the Vietnam Veterans Keith Payne VC Hostel. He runs a Legacy golf day every year. At his birthday celebrations on Sunday he had a raffle, and the money from that raffle went to Legacy. He is a person that supports his community.</para><para>He is a foundation member of the Toukley District Bowling Club. In 1977 he helped found the Central Coast Bowling, Sports and Recreation Club at Norah Head, and he organised to get tennis courts put there as well. He was instrumental in the construction of playing fields at Toukley senior and junior rugby league clubs. He was responsible for the Toukley swimming pool being constructed—and that in itself is quite a story. He was a councillor on Wyong Council at that stage and he just stood up and moved it and it got through the council meeting without any dissension. He was involved in installing reticulated water supply during the drought in 1977. He is a member of the building committee for the Toukley District Cricket Club.</para><para>One of the things that Harry is proudest of is his contributions to the Wyong Hospital and, in particular, in more recent times, to fundraising to put in place a cancer wing at the hospital. Harry has done so much for his community that this five minutes I am allocated will go nowhere near thanking him for his contributions. He has received the Order of Australia Medal, the New South Wales Parliament Medal and the Centenary of Federation Medal. He was Citizen of the Year in Wyong Shire.

This was a site that they chose a month or so ago to build an ACT jail. It happens to be a site right on the doorstep of the residential area of Jerrabomberra, which is not in the ACT but in New South Wales. It is very convenient for the ACT Chief Minister to put a jail near New South Wales residents rather than ACT residents. In actual fact, the background to this is that a site near Narrabundah was originally chosen as the ideal site for the prison. That was chosen after an extensive inquiry by an ACT assembly committee, and that was where it was going to go. But then the residents of Narrabundah jumped up and down so, in the election campaign before the last ACT election, the Labor Party said, `No, we won't build the jail near Narrabundah residents; we'll look for another site.'</para></talk.start><para>They have looked for another site and they have decided on Hume. They said that they chose Hume because they could not get the Commonwealth to agree to sell them land near the airport. That is not true. What the Commonwealth have said is that we do not want the integrity of the airport compromised. We want to see what is required for the next 20, 30, 40 or 50 years and then see whether there is some land available. I believe there probably will be land available when that work is done. But, no, the ACT Chief Minister has got no runs on the board since he was elected and is therefore desperately trying to get this project going. He has said, `We'll stick it out at Hume. New South Wales residents are the ones that will be affected. They don't vote in the ACT, so they don't matter.' Well, we are not going to let that happen. I can assure him of that. This appointment of a consultant, who is now going to take six months to assess the site, just seems bizarre because, well within that period of time, the work that is being done at the airport will be completed and it is highly likely that there will be some land available there for them to build it.</para><para>It is incredible. I wrote to the ACT Chief Minister many weeks ago including a list of the many hundreds of people from Jerrabomberra who had filled out a form and sent it back to me saying that they did not want the jail on their doorstep. He has not even bothered to respond to that letter. I then wrote another letter to him and actually co-signed it with the state Labor member for Monaro, Steve Whan, and he got his other minister, Katie Gallagher, to write back to us. She finally wrote back to me saying, `Thank you for your letter to the Attorney-General.' I did not write to the Attorney-General; I wrote to the Chief Minister. The Chief Minister might be the Attorney-General as well, but I wrote to him in his capacity as Chief Minister. She wrote back saying, `Thanks for your letter, but this is what we're going to do.'</para><para>He has not bothered to respond to the first letter or to the many hundreds of residents affected. He is effectively now doing a backflip on this, because he has appointed a consultant to do an assessment and he says that that consultant will consult with the community. It is a bit late. The consultation should have happened in the first place, before he even made such a silly announce-ment. There was no consultation with the Queanbeyan City Council; no consultation with Jerrabomberra residents; no consultation with HMAS Harman, which is right next door; and no consultation with the Snowy Hydro SouthCare helicopter service, which is on the other side of them. There was no consultation with anybody. The ACT government just made an announcement.</para><para>I will be going to the National Capital Authority if the Chief Minister is going to pursue this, because I am sure the last thing the National Capital Authority would want to have on a major access route into the city is a jail. From a planning point of view, it is the most stupid decision that I have ever seen. It is an absolutely ludicrous decision. There are many places where the jail could go in the ACT away from residents and appropriately located, but he has to put it out there near New South Wales residents. I will not allow this to happen and the Jerrabomberra residents will not allow this to happen. In fact, I think the ACT government ought to reconsider whether they should be putting $100-odd million into a prison in the first place. They would be far better off putting that money into a decent convention centre, which is certainly needed, rather than only the $20 million or $30 million that they propose. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Automotive Industry: Tariffs</title><page.no>27644</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>27644</page.no><name role="metadata">Vamvakinou, Maria, MP</name><name role="display">Ms VAMVAKINOU</name><name.id>00AMT</name.id><electorate>Calwell</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Last Friday I visited the South Pacific tyre factory in my electorate and had discussions with management as well as representatives from the Australian Tyre Manufacturers Association about the issues facing Australia's tyre industry. South Pacific Tyres is a significant industry and an important contributor to the Australian economy. It is also of great importance to my local community. With a 40 per cent market share in passenger and commercial tyres, South Pacific employs some 800 workers at its Campbellfield-Somerton site in my electorate of Calwell, as well as 6,000 workers nationally. It is a major supplier of tyres to Melbourne based car manufacturers such as Ford—which is also in my electorate of Calwell—Holden and Toyota, and Mitsubishi in South Australia. </para></talk.start><para>South Pacific Tyres has a long history of association with Melbourne's north, and during that time it has strived to achieve world's best practice in the manufacturing of its product and the efficiency of its operations. It provides a safe and secure environment for its workers because it understands that its work force is central to its overall success. Testimony to that is the fact that it has a work force that sticks with it for years. I was given the opportunity to meet many of those workers on my tour last Friday. </para><para>In the past 20 years, the industry as a whole has faced a diminishing tariff regime which has led to a reduction in the number of tyre manufacturers from six to two and in the number of factories from 16 to five. </para><para>There are three issues I want to raise this evening in the House. Before this government took office in 1996, tyre manufacturers imported raw materials free of any tax levy. In 1996 the government imposed a three per cent levy on the importation of raw material in order to raise revenue for its budget targets, indicating that it would remove the levy as soon as its fiscal position improved. Eight years later and with considerable budget surpluses, there is no sign of the government fulfilling its initial promise, despite repeated submissions by the industry minister, the member for Groom, to remove the levy, including representations from peak bodies and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and despite this pledge by the government as part of the Liberal Party's election promises in 2001: `We remain disposed to the removal of the levy under the tariff concession scheme when it is fiscally responsible to do so.' Despite all this, there is no sign or movement from the government on this issue to date. </para><para>It is possible that, despite the budget surplus, it may not be responsible to remove the levy at this time; but it could also be that this levy, which nets the government $400 million per annum, is a significant revenue raiser and one it is reluctant to part with. The paradox about this particular tariff, however, is that, although tariffs are traditionally meant to protect jobs and industry, on this occasion this tariff is doing the opposite and actually threatening jobs. The ATMA has made it very clear that the continuation of the levy will worsen the already challenged market share of the Australian tyre manufacturers and thus threaten the industry's viability. This is because the tyre manufacturing industry faces added challenges from the importation of cheap, second-hand tyres from Japan. These used tyres sell for $50 to $60, compared to the locally produced tyres which cost about $100, but they have a shorter life expectancy than new tyres and they also raise serious issues of established safety standards being compromised. </para><para>The proliferation of these cheap imported tyres raises another issue also—that is, the growing problem of disposing of old and discarded tyres. It is not enough that local manufacturers have to compete with cheaper imports; they also have to deal with the cheaper tyres that are offloaded into Australia and have to be disposed of each year in an environmentally friendly and responsible manner, which of course costs lots of money and requires many resources. Fortunately, South Pacific Tyres is already working with the Department of the Environment and Heritage to come up with a plan to tackle this problem. </para><para>The industry wants me to convey its concerns to the House. It is seeking the government's cooperation in lifting the three per cent levy, but it acknowledges that this could be difficult to do in one hit and therefore proposes a gradual phasing out in order to help it remain competitive and to help it continue to produce excellent Australian-made tyres which are safe and affordable. More importantly, lifting the levy will ensure that South Pacific Tyres and the local tyre industry as a whole are able to continue to provide much needed jobs for Australian workers and especially for the workers in the electorate of Calwell.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Dunkley Electorate: Community Project</title><page.no>27646</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>27646</page.no><name role="metadata">Billson, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BILLSON</name><name.id>1K6</name.id><electorate>Dunkley</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight to brief the House on progress with the Pines `Connecting the Community' Project, an initiative supported by the Howard government with half a million dollars from the Stronger Families and Communities Strategy. This project has been running for about two years now. Essentially, it is about the federal government providing a plaza, a space and some resources where all of the community of Frankston North—or the Pines as it is known locally in my electorate of Dunkley—can come together and bring their ideas and hopes for the future, work with each other to diagnose particular challenges faced by families and young people, and even some social stresses that are being experienced in the neighbourhood, and then formulate collectively some responses to them. </para></talk.start><para>The program to date has been very encouraging, with social and recreational events, family and youth programs, training and educational opportunities and also a very well received local community chest fund where $50,000 a year is made available to local community groups to implement some of their ideas in conjunction with the Pines `Connecting the Community' Project. Also, young people have been working together to form a Youth Action Group, and they are focused on those youth related issues which are very much a challenge for the Frankston North community. </para><para>Last Sunday we had the second Pines Pride Day celebration. I was pleased to be invited along to open the event. With the help of Kayla and Anne-Marie from the Youth Action Group, we symbolically let some balloons go to signify the new beginnings and the possibilities the project presents.

A poem from Marion Beattie is something we all look forward to in our community, and she never lets us down. She really lifted the occasion with her contribution—a rich contribution to the social and cultural fabric of the Pines. Marion is one of the many big-hearted people that make up the Pines community. Frankston North is a special place where many of us still put in a lot of time and energy. </para><para>Some of the projects that have been supported through the Commonwealth government's funding support include the Pines peer bike support program; some flora and fauna leadership programs; a maternal and child health service; a mothers' group; some playgroups; student mediation at Monterey Secondary College, where I am on the school council; the Pines art action crew; community noticeboards; youth workers; sponsorship of an alpine camp; and a community circus. There are many great things happening in that community. There are many great, able, willing and committed people making sure that Frankston North is a place which nurtures good citizens and good opportunities, and I commend everybody for their work. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Workplace Relations: Policy</title><page.no>27647</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>27647</page.no><name role="metadata">Burke, Anna, MP</name><name role="display">Ms BURKE</name><name.id>83S</name.id><electorate>Chisholm</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am not sure how I can follow that contribution from the member for Dunkley. I rise tonight to commend a very brave soul who was brave enough to say to her employer: `No.' This is a very brave and at times risky business for employees, especially young female employees in the retail industry. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations again during question time today rattled on about scary unions and tough men in the building trade. I wonder if he ever stops to think that most workers are not tough blokes able to stand up to their employers, but are employees frightened of losing their jobs if they dare say no. Generally that is why employees actually belong to unions: to give themselves some rebalance in the power stakes.</para></talk.start><para>The brave soul I want to commend is Sarah Freeman, who had the courage to say no to her employer. She said, no, she would not continue to wear a T-shirt. It was a tight T-shirt with a provocative, sexually explicit statement spread across Ms Freeman's chest which resulted in her being harassed by a customer. No wonder Ms Freeman was harassed. The T-shirt read: `Stop pretending you don't want me.' I do not know if Ms Freeman is a member of a union so, in many respects, she is even braver as she had no-one supporting her gutsy stance last Sunday when she told management at Westco she would not wear the T-shirt. The T-shirt was issued to staff accompanied by the following note:</para><quote><para>This week you will receive from the Store Support Centre—a Westco Jeans T-shirt that must be worn each and every shift until further notice. (THERE WILL BE NO EXCEPTIONS). It must be kept clean and in excellent condition. Please wear with either Westco jeans, pants or a skirt with it.</para><para>NO T-shirt equals NO work—any team member that does not dress correctly for work will be sent home.</para><para>The company at great expense has provided these T-shirts and they should be worn with great pride. There will be no variation from this uniform until further notice.</para><para>Regards</para><para>Andrew Hart</para></quote><para>Yes, management thought it could do this and, in fact, did it. It sent Ms Freeman home when she refused to wear the T-shirt. Under the current Workplace Relations Act with just 20 allowable matters there is no provision in awards to protect employees from such requests. Under the federal shop assistants award, the award which covers workers at Westco, there was previously a provision which stated that employers could not require employees to wear revealing or indecent clothing that would cause the employee embarrassment. This provision had to be removed when the award was simplified in line with the Howard government's award simplification process. This provision was originally introduced into the award back in the late eighties to stop employers introducing topless shop assistants—that is right. There was a great marketing move back then in hardware and spare parts stores to encourage topless sales assistants. So they introduced the clause and it prevented such harassment of staff. This provision is gone, and Westco believes it is within its rights to expose staff to harassment and embarrassment. I would like to read from an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline>, which said:</para><quote><para>She raised her concerns with the management and Westco's help desk but they were dismissed.</para><para>Announcing the recall yesterday, Westco operations manager Andrew Hart said the T-shirts were `a quirky statement reflecting the fact that Westco jeans products are pleasing, in demand and difficult to resist.'</para><para>Despite the backlash, Westco maintained that feedback had been overwhelmingly positive, and that there had been significant demand for the shirt from the public.</para></quote><para>It is one thing for the public to determine they want to wear it personally; it is another thing for management to demand that staff wear it when going to work. I think Ms Freeman summed it up well—again I quote from the <inline font-style="italic">Age </inline>article today:</para><quote><para>`I feel like I am open to harassment,' she said. `You can put it on a billboard, but I don't think you can put it on your employees.'</para></quote><para>I think she summed it up correctly. This is a government that prides itself on family values and returning our society to decent morals we can all feel comfortable instilling in our children. The Prime Minister prides himself on slaying the politically correct dragon summoned up by the Labor Party. Terrific! Having killed off political correctness, he must now suffer the consequences of management believing it is okay to expose women and men to sexual harassment and exploitation in the workplace. Men were also required to wear these shirts. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations likes to hold his head above all, claiming moral superiority, voicing his views about family values and portraying himself as a defender of moral rights in this otherwise grubby place of parliament.

Our constituents—one million residents in the east and south-east of Melbourne—were told just weeks before the last state election that it was not just a promise, it was a solid commitment from the state Labor government that they would be getting a toll-free Scoresby Freeway. Within weeks—not after a change of government, but when the very same people who were in power when that commitment was made were also in power after the election—they came out and said, `Woops! We've got it all wrong. We've got no cash. We have no funds for that.' The proof is out there: $1.7 billion of funding is available for capital works. That illustrates the point that the funds are there; they should be made available. There is absolutely no explanation as to why that project cannot proceed as was promised.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Quickly wrapping up my other point before handing over to my colleague who is looking for the call, there is great irony in the announcements made by the Southern and Eastern Integrated Transport Authority.

He has no evidence to back up his claims. He makes statements that are entirely contradictory to all the expert opinion available. He also makes claims about what the federal government plans to do. He has come out saying that the feds will not honour the agreement. That is absolutely incorrect. He should realise that honourable people honour their funding commitments, and that is what the Howard government will do. It will provide 50 per cent of the funding. If the state government have their costings wrong again, they should fess up; they should say so. And they should come back to the federal government with accurate costings—even if it will be the third or fourth try they have had at it.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Cunningham Electorate: Program Funding</title><page.no>27649</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>27649</page.no><name role="metadata">Organ, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ORGAN</name><name.id>BNL</name.id><electorate>Cunningham</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—While looking through yesterday's <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> I noted that, in a question on notice from Mr Kelvin Thomson to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage about the spending of environment fund money, the spending on Landcare, Rivercare and Bushcare programs in the Cunningham electorate was shown, and Landcare funding to the value of $26,000 was recently allocated to Cunningham by the government. This raises the issue of the allocation of Landcare and Bushcare funding in our electorate.</para></talk.start><para>A local issue arose in Cunningham last year when the Wollongong City Council decided to set up an environmental fund. After a lot of community lobbying, they put aside $1 million for environmental works to be carried out as part of the so-called environmental fund. In the last couple of weeks they have announced how they have spent that money. Most of that money is being spent on flood mitigation programs. As a result, last week various people—volunteers throughout the Illawarra who have been involved with Landcare and Bushcare—called a strike. They said, `Look, there is $1 million of environmental funding. We expected some of this money to go to help some of the volunteer groups who do great work in regards to Bushcare.' I am sure many people throughout Australia are aware of the great work that Bushcare and Coastcare volunteers do. Wollongong City Council has basically rejected them.</para><para>One of the reasons the council gave for having spent most of the million dollars of environmental fund money was that they were not receiving flood mitigation money from the state government. Far be it from me to criticise the New South Wales Labor government, but the issue we have here is that the use of the term `environment fund' is of great concern in that it is more like an engineering fund. A lot of this money, instead of going to support the Bushcare groups, the Coastcare groups and the volunteers—helping them with their spades, shovels and plants; helping them clean up creeks and other areas, as we expect them to—goes elsewhere. We should support them, because they are volunteers and they need that support.</para><para>Because of shortfalls in the local council and the problems we have in the Illawarra, with probably more creeks per square kilometre than any other part of Australia, we have a lot of flood mitigation—and in the past councils have allowed developments in creeks, next to waterways and on floodplains. As a result, the Bushcare groups in Cunningham are suffering. They have basically called a strike. They have asked for meetings with council, saying, `Unless we get part of this environmental funding, we are not going to carry out our work. We want support from the local council.' This is another example of a lot of money going from the federal government into the state government coffers and not getting down to the local government as it should so that it hits the people on the ground and a lot of these important environmental works can be carried out.</para><para>I welcome the opportunity to raise this issue, because I am sure there are Bushcare and Coastcare groups throughout our electorates and we need to support those volunteer groups. They do a lot of valuable work. They save this country a lot of money through their work. I went out with a volunteer group two Sundays ago. We did some planting along a creek. There were kids, adults and old people from all walks of life and of all political persuasions, and I think that is really important: these Coastcare and Landcare groups go right across the board and do a wonderful service in this great nation of ours. I applaud their work and their action in putting it to the local Wollongong City Council, saying, `No. This money is for environmental enhancement, conservation and protection.' Issues such as flood plain mitigation—fixing up properties that have been built in the wrong place and that have been subject to flooding and possible damage—are issues that state, federal and local government can and should address separately. We do not want to put the Landcare and Coastcare volunteers offside. We need to support these people because they perform an important job within our communities.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

Like all members in this place, I too have a very strong view about the great volunteer effort of people involved in a variety of environmental groups within my own electorate. The people who have made a difference in my area include those from the Norman Creek Catchment Coordinating Committee, N4C. They have been absolutely first rate and innovative in so many different ways and have received money from the Australian Government Envirofund over a number of years. It has been the hard work of those volunteers taking the shovels and trees, which have been bought with small licks of Australian government funding, which has led to the planting out of entire areas around the Pacific Motorway, the former South East Freeway, and in the Greenslopes area in particular.</para></talk.start><para>Likewise, the work done by the people of the Bulimba Creek Catchment Coordination Committee has also provided a great sense of innovation—from the source of the creek, which starts within my electorate and flows through the Griffith and now Bonner federal electorates into the Brisbane River. It really does bring to mind how the work of these volunteers again with small licks—a few thousand here and maybe $10,000 or so there—from the Australian government has made a difference in the quality of the water which is flowing in the Brisbane River and into Moreton Bay.</para><para>The Oxley Creek catchment area is quite expansive and is served by a number of community based groups who are also taking the time to restore the quality of the water coming out of Oxley Creek. A tremendous amount of turbidity goes into the Brisbane River because Oxley Creek is such a powerful creek. But the creeks feeding into it—like Rocky Waterholes Creek, Stable Swamp Creek and Sheep Station Gully, through Algester and Parkinson—are threatened by the way our urban infrastructure has basically used our creeks in Brisbane for so many generations as stormwater drains. </para><para>There is a greater realisation, I think, amongst average everyday Australians about our environment—mainly because average everyday Australians are involved in practical ways in dealing with local creeks and local waterways. I am certainly proud to be part of a government which has recognised the strength of the volunteer effort and localised the way in which Australian government funds are spent—in small amounts in terms of the overall, with tens of billions and hundreds of billions of dollars spent by this government each year—and I am pleased to find a few thousand being put to work. I know Greg Sullivan with the Stable Swamp group around Les Atkinson Park at Sunnybank has pulled out foul papyrus grass and elephant ears which were thrown in there as waste 20 to 30 years ago as new suburban developments created pressure on this particular area, and they have actually replanted this with Australian natives. That they have wholly replenished this area and got it back to its more natural state is a credit to each person involved with the group. </para><para>There is still a lot more work to be done, there is no doubt about it; but what is important is that the Envirofund, which Minister Kemp administers so well, does provide the flexibility which responds to the needs of local community based volunteer environmental groups. It is not just River Murray work, Murray-Darling Basin work, desalination work or important work being done on the eradication of weeds—all these great national initiatives; it is, in fact, investing in local communities and letting them deal with the things that are very important in their own back yards—as we also, of course, have to spend our time and effort dealing with some of the broader environmental issues. So I am pleased to have been able to make those comments and I congratulate the local environment groups within the federal electorate of Moreton. </para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><adjournment><adjournmentinfo><time.stamp>21:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>27652</page.no></adjournmentinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">House adjourned at 9.35 p.m.</inline></para></adjournment><debate><debateinfo><title>NOTICES</title><type>Notices</type><page.no>27652</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following notices were given:</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>0J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Ruddock</name></talker><para> to present a bill for an act to amend the law relating to foreign incursions and recruitment, terrorism offences and proceeds of crime, and for related purposes.
