Mrs Churcher's report was completed in October 2003. On 1 December 2003 copies were sent to all members and senators, and comments were invited. I reminded members of this invitation to comment on 11 March 2004. Having regard to the comments received and preliminary advice from the Department of Parliamentary Services on some aspects of Mrs Churcher's report, the President and I have made certain decisions about the future of the Parliament House art collection.</para></talk.start><para>The Parliament House art collection has five main components. These are the commissioned art works, commissioned art furniture, the Historic Memorials Collection, gifts, and the Rotational Collection. While Mrs Churcher's review addressed issues relating to all aspects of the collection, the most important aspects of her review were those relating to the Rotational Collection. Having regard to Mrs Churcher's recommendations and the comments of members and senators, we propose a framework for a rationale and an acquisitions policy for this collection.</para><para>The purpose of the Rotational Collection is to provide Australian artworks of suitable quality for members' and senators' suites and for the public and semi-public areas of Parliament House. The collection has never been intended to function as the basis of a public art gallery, but it has in the past encouraged emerging artists. In view of the comments of some members and senators, I should emphasise that the new approach accepted by the President and me will not mean that the work of new and emerging artists will cease to be acquired. It will mean that new acquisitions will not be restricted to emerging artists solely.</para><para>The general criteria for selecting artworks for the Rotational Collection will be that the artist has appropriate professional standing and that the work is suitable to be added to that collection. The Department of Parliamentary Services will develop detailed criteria for the suitability of artworks for the Rotational Collection. This work will take account of the original development of the collection, the existing acquisitions guidelines and specific recommendations made by Mrs Churcherâin particular, the focus on better representation of some currently underrepresented areas of Australia.</para><para>We note, however, that Mrs Churcher's recommendations do not require any reduction in the acquisition of artworks for the Rotational Collection. Furthermore, since artwork acquisitions will no doubt continue to be constrained by funding limitations, works by new and emerging artists may well continue to represent a significant proportion of acquisitions. The point should be made that the current acquisition guidelines express a preference for first point of sale acquisitions, and this has effectively precluded consideration of the purchase of appropriate works from established artists, alive or dead. That issue has now been addressed.</para><para>Separately from her recommendations about the Rotational Collection, Mrs Churcher recommended the compilation of an alternative collection of reproductions that would be suitable for hanging in members' and senators' suites. These reproductions would not be accessioned into the Parliament House art collection. We have accepted Mrs Churcher's recommendation in principle because we agree that members and senators should have a broader choice of works available to them to decorate their suites. </para><para>An Art Advisory Committee will continue. However, we propose to supplement the membership as proposed by Mrs Churcher so that the committee consists of:</para><para>	the presiding officers as joint chairs,</para><para>	the Deputy Speaker,</para><para>	the Deputy President and Chairman of Committees, and</para><para>	the Secretary of the Department of Parliamentary Services.</para><para>The main role of the Art Advisory Committee will be to consider recommendations for acquisitions made by the art consultant, whose engagement was recommended by Mrs Churcher.</para><para>Several of Mrs Churcher's other recommendations will be implemented by the Department of Parliamentary Services, and the President and I will advise members and senators of the details in due course. There is more work to be done in relation to the Parliament House art collection, especially in relation to the rationale and acquisition policy for the Rotational Collection and in relation to funding for the extra commissions and the alternative collection recommended by Mrs Churcher. I will keep members informed of developments in this area.</para></speech></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ANTI-TERRORISM BILL (NO. 2)

improving Australia's counter-terrorism laws.</para><para>They build upon legislation enacted since 11 September 2001 that allows us to more effectively provide for the safety of all Australians, here and abroad, insofar as legislation can achieve that end.</para><para>This package highlights the Australian government's commitment to continuous review and modification of the law to meet new challenges as they arise. </para><para>In creating these laws, the government is striving towards the twin goals of security and justice. </para><para>We do not assume that protecting national security is opposed to protecting our civil rights, particularly the most fundamental right of allâthe right to human security.</para><para>The achievement of these goals should not be seen as separate ideals.</para><para>The measures contained in this bill will have a real practical impact and are necessary.</para><para>The bill updates the Criminal Code to improve our terrorism offence regime.</para><para>The amendments make it an offence to intentionally associate with a person who is a member or who promotes or directs the activities of a listed terrorist organisation where that association provides support that would help the terrorist organisation to continue to exist or to expand.</para><para>Unlike the offence provisions in division 101 of the Criminal Code, this offence does not require proof of a connection with a terrorist act.</para><para>The new offence of `associating with terrorist organisations' is aimed at the fundamental unacceptability of terrorist organisations as entities by making a wider range of activity which supports the existence or expansion of such organisations illegal.</para><para>The offence is directed at people who cannot be proved to be directors, members, recruiters, trainers, or financiers of a terrorist organisation under existing offences. </para><para>Under the new offence, what must be proved is that the person communicates or meets directors, members or promoters of a listed terrorist organisation and in doing so provides support intended to assist the expansion or continued existence of the organisation.</para><para>The maximum penalty of three years imprisonment is lower because such people are not necessarily directly involved in terrorist acts.</para><para>A wide range of exceptions are provided for in relation to associations with `close family members', associations for the purpose of  religious worship, the provision of humanitarian aid, and the provision of legal advice in connection with criminal proceedings or proceedings in relation to the listing of terrorist organisations.</para><para>Significantly, an exception is also provided to exclude the application of the offence where it would infringe any constitutional doctrine of implied freedom of political communication.</para><para>Australia's response to the terrorist attack in Bali was a very effective blow against terrorist activity in our region.</para><para>Part of that response was the way in which Australian authorities used DNA technology to identify those who were tragically victims of the bombing.</para><para>This was made possible by amendments moved by the government shortly after the attack which provided a single seamless legal framework for the collection and matching of DNA profiles.</para><para>This bill will amend the forensic procedure laws in part 1D of the Crimes Act 1914 to ensure that if a terrorist attack or other mass-casualty disaster were to occur within Australia forensic services from all jurisdictions in Australia would be able to work together, using the national DNA database system, to identify the victims of the disaster and conduct a criminal investigation.</para><para>Securing our borders against incoming or outgoing terrorist suspects is clearly an important weapon in our fight against terrorism both domestically and internationally.</para><para>We are not interested in letting terrorists enter Australia.</para><para>Nor are we interested in exporting terrorists who are then free to pursue their deadly ambitions in other countries.</para><para>This bill contains amendments to the Passports Act 1938 that will, among other things, give competent Australian authorities the power to request an order for the surrender of a person's foreign passport.</para><para>A `competent authority' could be the Australian Federal Police or the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation.</para><para>These amendments are necessary to ensure that a person who carries both an Australian passport and a foreign passport cannot leave Australia on a foreign passport after the person's Australian passport has been cancelled by Australian authorities.</para><para>The amendments to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 will give the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation the power to demand a person surrender their Australian and foreign passports if the person is subject to a request for consent to apply for a questioning warrant.</para><para>The new power builds on the existing power in the ASIO Act relating to surrender of a person's passports where the person is the subject of a questioning warrant.</para><para>These amendments are necessary to ensure that all reasonable measures are taken to prevent a person who would have vital information about a planned terrorist attack from leaving Australia before ASIO has the opportunity to question that person. </para><para>Capturing and convicting terrorists is not the end of the story.</para><para>Once a person is in custody for an offence, that person can raise security issues for the correctional facility in which they are detained.</para><para>In some cases it may be necessary to move the person to another part of the country for security reasons.</para><para>The bill provides a legislative basis for the transfer of prisoners between states for security reasons.</para><para>The provisions would be used only where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the transfer is necessary in the interests of security.</para><para>`Security' here has the same definition as in the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979.</para><para>Persons transferred for security reasons will be the subject of a security transfer order. The orders are to be reviewed every three months to determine whether the person should remain subject to an order.</para><para>The bill also amends the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 to make decisions of the Attorney-General on security grounds exempt from the application of the act.</para><para>As Attorney-General, I am acutely aware that the law represents a very potent form of defence against terrorists.</para><para>A fair, just and even application of the law can protect us in a very real way.</para><para>Our use of the law establishes the parameters of what we think a just and civilised society should be.</para><para>This bill sets out those parameters without unnecessarily encroaching upon individual rights and freedoms.</para><para>This bill appropriately targets those in our community intent on doing wrong: a person who provides support that would help a recognised terrorist organisation to continue to exist or to expand; and a person who may have vital information about a planned terrorist attack who seeks to flee Australia under a foreign passport before ASIO has the opportunity to question the person.</para><para>Combined, these types of activities create an environment in which terrorist organisations are permitted to thrive and opportunities to prevent a terrorist attack are not taken.</para><para>I am sure members opposite, who have been generally supportive of government initiatives to prohibit the `big ticket' terrorist activities, will want to support further measures that enhance terrorist potential in Australia.</para><para>I request that the opposition recognise the importance here of the more subtle and sophisticated initiatives designed to target infrastructure, support networks and techniques that enable terrorists and their associates to evade the law.</para><para>I hope the bill will receive a sympathetic and speedy passage.

Industry depends on reliable, secure and competitively priced energy to underpin its investment decisions. Australia's electricity and gas prices are among the lowest in the developed world. It is important to Australia's competitive position in this area that we pursue the required energy market reforms.</para><para>The arrangements in this legislation pave the way for the establishment of a truly efficient, competitive Australian energy market. These measures put into action the energy white paper, released by the Prime Minister earlier this week.</para><para>The bills I am tabling today represent the practical implementation of the findings and recommendations of the <inline font-style="italic">Independent review of energy market directions</inline>, commonly known as the Parer review, commissioned by the Council of Australian Governments (COAG).</para><para>The Ministerial Council on Energy, which I chair, has had responsibility for overseeing the Parer review. The review identified the strategic issues for the Australian energy market and the key policies required from the Commonwealth, state and territory governments.</para><para>The 11 December 2003 MCE report to COAG was the culmination of 12 months work. The recommendations contained in the report constitute a substantial response to the Parer review, and agreement to these policy initiatives has been formalised through a new intergovernmental agreement known as the Australian Energy Market Agreement.</para><para>The bills before the House are part of a new national legislative framework which has been developed on a collaborative basis with all states and territories. Over the next few months, complementary legislation is to be introduced into all Australian parliaments.</para><para>The package of legislation I am introducing today provides for new institutional and governance arrangements for the Australian energy sector. It will improve the quality, timeliness and national character of the energy markets.</para><para>This legislation will apply first in relation to the national electricity market. A revised template electricity law is to be passed by South Australia.</para><para>All other governments, with the exception of Western Australia and the Northern Territory, will pass application acts applying this law in their own jurisdiction.</para><para>The <inline ref="R2077">Australian Energy Market Bill 2004</inline> is the Commonwealth's application of the South Australian template electricity laws. The Australian government will be applying the electricity laws, including the Electricity Code, in a similar way to its current application of the Gas Code as a Commonwealth law. This arrangement will enable the energy market rules to apply consistently across all participating government jurisdictions.</para><para>This bill is also forward looking in that it provides a mechanism to enable other energy laws to be applied consistently across Australia. This would be done only with the consent of all governments, as provided for in the Australian Energy Market Agreement.</para><para>South Australia will also pass a law establishing the Australian Energy Market Commission. The core functions of this body will be to continue to develop the market rules, carry out the reviews of the market and undertake other functions as conferred on it under energy laws. These functions in the first instance will relate to the template electricity laws as set out in the National Electricity Law and Code. </para><para>A highlight of the cooperative legislative framework is the new arrangements which will apply to the regulation of Australia's energy market.</para><para>The Parer review found that the current multiplicity of regulators creates a barrier to competitive interstate trade and adds costs to the energy sector. There are currently 13 regulators operating across every layer of commercial activity. The Australian government has worked with state and territory governments to achieve a reform package that will see a significant reduction in the regulatory burden facing market participants and investors in the energy sector.</para><para>To streamline and improve the quality of economic regulation, lower the cost and complexity of regulation facing investors and enhance regulatory certainty, all governments have agreed to establish a single, national energy regulator known as the Australian Energy Regulator (AER). The <inline ref="R2076">Trade Practices Amendment (Australian Energy Market) Bill 2004</inline> seeks to implement this agreement.</para><para>Initially the AER will have responsibility for the economic regulation of wholesale electricity and transmission networks and key rule enforcement functions. It will undertake the regulatory and enforcement functions previously exercised by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and the National Electricity Code Administrator.</para><para>The AER will be exercising powers as a result of the application of the National Electricity Law and National Electricity Code as a law of the Commonwealth through the Australian Energy Market Bill 2004. The AER will also have functions conferred upon it by the states and territories where they are also applying the national electricity law and code.</para><para>The responsibilities of the AER are to be extended to include gas transmission by 30 June 2005. Further, all governments have agreed that the AER will be responsible for the regulation of distribution and retailing (other than retail pricing) by 2006, following development of an agreed national framework.</para><para>The AER will be a separate legal entity but will operate as a constituent part of the ACCC for matters such as staffing and financial arrangements. These proposed amendments to the Trade Practices Act 1974 establish the AER as a body corporate constituting three membersâa Commonwealth member, who is also an ACCC member, and two state/territory AER members. The AER is to be assisted in the performance of its functions by staff and consultants made available to the AER by the Chair of the ACCC.</para><para>The Parer review also found that the process for making changes to the National Electricity Code is complex, both in its conception and the way in which the system has worked in practice.</para><para>Accordingly, the trade practices amendment bill incorporates amendments that will facilitate the streamlining of the code change process and any subsequent process relating to industry access code approval or authorisation under the Trade Practices Act 1974.</para><para>In particular, the amendments enable the ACCC to make use of consultations undertaken by the Australian Energy Market Commission during the amended code change process, avoiding unnecessary duplication.</para><para>These bills are extremely important to energy market reform in Australia. They constitute the cooperation between the states and the Commonwealth in an unprecedented way in the energy market reform process. </para><para>I commend these bills to the House and I wish them swift passage.

A marriage is and should be between a man and a woman, to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life. The amendments in the <inline ref="R2053">Marriage Legislation Amendment Bill 2004</inline> include those marriages entered into in other jurisdictions and overseas, measures which are important to ensure legal loopholes are not used to introduce social changes which go against the will of the people. Far be it from me to criticise the courts, but where there is a lawyer and there is a loophole, there is a possibility for social change. The other amendments to the Marriage Act will spell out that overseas adoptions cannot be undertaken by persons not in a marriage which is recognised in Australia. These are consistent amendments, consistent both with the social expectations of the people of Australia and the legal definition of marriage.</para></talk.start><para>From the outset I want to make it very clear that I am a Christian and that I regularly attend church. I get great comfort from the teachings of Christ and the support of my fellow parishioners. As a Christian I have no prejudices against people who are different from meâfor the colour of their skin, for the lifestyle choices they make, or for the religions they may or may not practise. I have an acceptance of every individual as an individual. But as a Christian I have to be true to all of my convictions, and that means when issues like same-sex marriages arise I will speak out for what I and the broad majority of Australians believe in. </para><para>The changes proposed will entrench in federal laws that a marriage is between a man and a woman. It is important to understand that these amendments do not seek to remove any rights that homosexuals currently have with regard to marriage laws, as same-sex marriages are not currently recognised. There is no doubt that this topic is by its very nature an emotive topic. When we seek to entrench into law who can marry, there will be some people who will be offended that they do not fall within the law.</para><para>I received one letter from a woman in a relationship with another woman. She asked if I questioned whether or not she loves her partner. I do not question her love for her partner, nor do I question the time they have spent together. I do not sit in judgment of their partnership or their relationship, but what I am seeking to do is ensure that the Christian values of marriageâbeing an institution between a man and woman for the purpose of procreationâremain as the cornerstone of the foundation of our society.</para><para>This lady's was but one letter compared to the many I have received from my own constituents and those in neighbouring electorates in support of the amendments to the legislation. I have also had discussions with individuals who are homosexual and who have also stated a support for this bill. They have stated to me that they do not want the Marriage Act changed to allow for same-sex marriages; they accept their current arrangements. There is an old saying in politics: you can't please all of the people all of the time; you can please some of the people most of the time and most of the people some of the time. This is one of those times when some people will not be pleased but most will be.</para><para>The feedback I have received from my constituents, from those who attend church regularly and those who consider themselves Christian but do not attend churchâin fact, from others who do not profess any religious beliefsâis that they overwhelmingly support these changes to ensure that the law specifically states that a marriage is a union between man and woman. Paul, at verse 26 of the first chapter of his Epistle to the Romans, writes:</para><quote><para>Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another.</para></quote><para>The time that Paul speaks of is in the years immediately following the death of Christâthe time when Christianity was a secret movement kept alive by true believers in God and the sermons of Jesus. This is the time that the Romans sought to remove Christianity from the world because it challenged the social mores of the Roman Empire. Paul's writings in particular went against the entire Roman social cultureâthe avarice, the lust, the carnage, the incest. The teachings of Christ taught a new way of living that would force radical change on the Roman Empire. Christianity did not just force change on the powerful leaders but on all of the people.</para><para>In allowing same-sex marriages, we jeopardise the core of Christianity, we devalue the sacrifice made by Christ and his disciples and we devalue the very foundations of the Christian faith. Some will argue that true love between two men or two women is just as valid as that between a man and a woman, but in the terms of the Christian faithâthat faith which created marriage as we know it todayâmarriage is not recognised when it is between two men or two women. It was not considered right by Paul in his Epistle to the Romans, and today the same is true. </para><para>Bit by bit, the church and its teachings are being whittled away by those who do not attend church or practise religion. The perfect example of this is that more people identify Christmas with a Coca-Cola symbol of Santa Claus than they do with a nativity scene. In much the same way, marriage is becoming a symbol of a union between two peopleânot an institution where lives are built together and children are brought into the world and raised and loved.</para><para>Christianity is only alive today because of the teachings of Paul and those enlightened men and women who continued Christ's teachings throughout the years of persecution by the Romans. Paul's teachings represented a minority in his time. He went against what was considered socially acceptable and he taught a different way of thinking. The fact that he knew that Christ himself was crucified and that continuing Christ's teachings would mean sure death gives his words more resonance. And perhaps it gives us greater reason to protect his teachingsâthat people should be encouraged to enter into unions between men and women; that the natural way is between a man and a woman.</para><para>Some argue that the Bible stands in contrast to what is socially accepted today. But it stands as a benchmark of what many people in society believe. In both Genesis 1:28 and Mark 10:6 it is stated that God created humankind in two sexes for the purpose of procreation. God's established law is the basis for marriage. And I can tell you, a lot of people are getting a bit fed up with the boundaries constantly being challenged. <inline font-style="italic">Play School</inline> should be about Jemima and Big Ted and not include social political messages about what is right or wrong in matters of gender. Television at 7 p.m. should not have to be bleeped over time after time to ensure the timeslot is not compromised by the foul language, discussions of masturbation and boasts of sexual relationships of 12 fake housemates doing nothing. Everyday, the boundaries are being tested. We let one small thing go, then another and then another, and finally Nero is standing on the roof playing his fiddle while the society and city burn.</para><para>Many people who argue for allowing marriage between a man and a man or a woman and a woman argue that there is no place for Christianity in the debate about homosexuality and marriage laws. I have already discussed how vital Christianity was to preserving the institution of marriage in the form that it takes today. The teachings of Christ and his disciples are the only reason we are standing here today discussing marriage between two men or two women. In the first place, if you take Christianity or God out of this marriage debate, you might as well take marriage out of the debate. Without Christianity, there would be no marriage.</para><para>The definition of the act of marriage is: the unity of a man and woman under God. The vows of marriage do not talk solely about this mortal life; they talk about eternity. Without God, marriage becomes a piece of paperâeasily torn. And maybe this is the reason why 30 per cent of marriages fail: people forget that the vows are taken not just between a man and woman to spend the rest of their lives together but also in front of God. Taking vows in front of Godâin front of witnesses who similarly believe in Godâholds a couple to account. It makes the promises more solemn and gives them a greater reason to keep them. By the same token, if you take God and the teachings of Christ and Paul out of this equation, then you take away the moral arguments against homosexuality. Even Queen Victoria tolerated homosexuality provided it `didn't frighten the horses'. But we are talking about marriage. If you talk about removing God and Christianity from the debate about marriage you may as well not talk about marriage at all. It is moot. </para><para>The democracy we enjoy today is built on Christianity.

And, in this instance, we are preserving the institution of marriage as being a union between a man and a woman, because we are Christians. There will be some in the community who will condemn me for being a God botherer, but I have to be true to my faith and beliefs. I am here today to not only serve the people of Paterson in the parliament but also serve God. By supporting this bill today I believe I do both.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>30720</page.no><name role="metadata">Lawrence, Dr Carmen, MP</name><name role="display">Dr LAWRENCE</name><name.id>XS4</name.id><electorate>Fremantle</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am going to speak only briefly on the <inline ref="R2053">Marriage Legislation Amendment Bill 2004</inline> today, but I do want to make a modest observation about the comments by the previous speaker, the member for Paterson. Everybody respects religious belief; indeed, it is part of our culture and tradition that we do, and we are tolerant of others' religious beliefs and practices. But we have, since the inception of this country, been very clear about the need to separate church and state. It comes too with our tradition from the United Kingdom. Legislation in this parliament should be capable of being abided by and understood by all citizens, regardless of their religious beliefs. It certainly is not appropriate either to use Christianity as a justification for certain acts in this parliament or to claim that such a definition of marriage stems solely from a Christian tradition, because it does not.</para></talk.start><para>However, that was not the principal point that I was going to make in this debate, we need to look at marriage as an evolving institutionâbecause it is. It is not an institution that, as some people have described it, has been the same for thousands and thousands of years; it simply has not. There have been different forms of marriage across cultures and across time. And marriage, if you look at the history of it, did not evolve initially as a solely Christian institution. It exists in many cultures and has taken forms that really had more to do with the disposition of property and inheritance than with the specific blessing of a relationship by some religious organisation. </para><para>So let us look at the nature of marriage if we are going to talk about defining it in legislation. Let us look at how it has evolved over time and some of the more curious practices that until recently were embraced by some of our predecessors. For instance, there are examples in Christianity of polygamyâI do not think there has been any polyandry, but there have certainly been polygamous arrangementsâcontinuing to this day in certain parts of the United States, although I know there are attempts being made to reduce the frequency of such arrangements. They have existed even within the Christian tradition and they certainly exist in other cultures and have over time. I do not think any of us would necessarily want to suggest that Australians open up those possibilities; I simply make those observations to suggest that the notion of marriage as an unchanging institution with a single definition is incorrect.</para><para>Indeed, if you go back through the history of marriage as an institution you will findâI think this is correct; I have not been able to fully check it, but the research seems adequateâthat between the fifth and the 14th centuries, for instance, the Roman Catholic Church conducted special ceremonies to bless same-sex unions which were almost identical to those they used to bless heterosexual unions at the time. At the very least these were spiritual if not sexual unionsâit is not altogether clearâbut there existed a form of ritual even within the Catholic Church. I think it is worth noting that for a long time there were explicit prohibitions too about who could marry which we would no longer consider acceptable. In the 11th century, for instance, Pope Alexander issued a decree prohibiting marriages between couples who were more closely related than sixth cousins. So there were explicit prohibitions against what we would not regard as close relations getting married.</para><para>As we know from Thomas Hardy's wonderful book, from the 1690s to the 1870s wife sale was common in rural and small town England. Wives were so regarded as property that a husband could actually sell his wife. All he had to do to divorce her before the sale was to present her at an appropriate gathering with a rope around her neck, and offer her in public for sale to another man. So these are some of the precursors, if you like, to the institution of marriage. For a long time, of course, marriage was a strictly civil institution in some places, and religion was not involved at all. In Australia that is still the case. For many people marriage is an entirely secular arrangement. There is no religious ceremony, nor is there required to be.</para><para>I think it is also worth remembering that for a very long time there were certain groups of people apart from cousins who could not marry in certain parts of the world. Until recently, in South Africa an interracial marriage was considered illegal, as it was in the United States of America. In 1662 in Virginia there was a fine for fornication between interracial people, and marriage between African-Americans and other Americans was all but outlawed in most of the southern United States. Under English common law and all the laws derived from it, married women had very few rights to property and little capacity for entering into agreements or arrangements, which they now can do. </para><para>I make those points simply to illustrate that this notion that marriage is an entirely religious institution with a simple definition which everybody understands is not the case. We have seen arranged marriages supplanted over time by marriages based on affection and sentiment rather than the economic concerns of the parties involved. For a long time too, many marriages required the consent of parents, something that for the most part is no longer required. In some countries today marriages are still formed between very young people, people we would regard as children. I think it is also worth pointing out that that was the case in our own tradition until reasonably recently, and very young people often entered into what were effectively prearranged marriagesâwhich required the consent of parents, it has to be said, but which we would regard almost as equivalent to child abuse.</para><para>In all the cultures around the world, including in the West, marriage evolved as a practical device to form alliances between families. It was really about considerations of property, sometimes of religion, and of complementary abilities. These were essentially arrangements of convenience. Although respectful love was supposed to develop in those circumstances, neither sexual nor romantic love was initially the basis for marriage. Indeed, some would argue that, to the extent that that has become the basis for marriage, marriage has become a less stable institution. I do not necessarily endorse that view, but you will hear it argued. Fathers had legal rights in the past to give or withhold consent and, as I say, often entered into economic negotiations about these arrangements. Even in the Western tradition, the bride usually brought some form of dowry and the groom was expected to provide land, tools and the like to support her and the children.</para><para>Marriage in English law, generally speaking, subsumed the legal being of the wife into that of the husband. So the idea of marriage being between equal partners is a very recent innovation. Married women until my lifetime were often discriminated against explicitly, even in employment in this country and in their capacity to enter into independent financial arrangements, to take out loans and the like. In the sixties, it was still commonplace in most state departments of education to require women to resign when they got marriedâto give up their permanency. Many of them then became permanently temporary, with effects on their superannuation that are still flowing through today. The university I went to in the sixties and seventies actually required women who wanted to marry to get the permission of their head of department if they wanted to remain permanent. So the idea of a woman as an equal partner in marriage is a very recent idea in law and in practice in our own community.</para><para>By the mid-19th century, sentimental doctrines of romantic love came to prevail but Victorian marriages, like those I have just referred to, still demanded strict fulfilment of gender specific roles centred around family responsibilities. I know that there are some people who still have that idea of marriage and that in some people's views the woman's role is clearly defined in religious doctrine and any departure from it is to be frowned upon. Indeed, I sometimes think that is the Prime Minister's view of the relationships between men and women in marriage in this country. But the sexual revolution in the second part of the last century changed all of that and weakened the connection between sex and marriage. I am often surprised to hear people talk about marriage as though its sole purpose today is for the procreation and support of children, when we all know that there are many satisfactory marriagesâmarriages undertaken in good faithâwhere there are no children, either by choice or because that is the way matters have evolved. </para><para>So I want to point out that, in the context of debating the definition of marriage, we should be very careful. That is why our predecessors did not put it in the legislationâso as not to pre-empt arrangements that people may enter into and not to deny people certain rights, privileges and understandings that would apply if we allowed the institution to evolve through the common law. The argument that we hear from the conservative side, and we heard it from the previous speaker, is that marriage has endured for thousands of yearsâit has, but not in the form that we would recogniseâand that it is a bedrock institution and should not be changed. I hope I have demonstrated at least in part that that is not the case. The reality is that between cultures and over time the meaning and form of marriage have changed dramatically, as I have described.</para><para>I think you will find that Australians understand that, because Australians enter into a great variety of relationships of longstanding commitment. Sometimes they are marriages conducted under the auspices of particular churches or religious traditions complete, in the case of a Catholic service with a mass, or an Anglican communion service or an appropriate Jewish religious ceremony. But many Australians go through secular marriages conducted in their own backyard or homes with family present, and they make a vow and commitment to one another, hoping it will be a union that lasts for a lifetime but knowing realistically that the divorce figures belie that factâthat many Australians, both those who have been through the religious ceremony and those who have been through the secular ceremony, end up separating at some point, going about their lives and needing arrangements through our divorce courts. So, in reality, marriage is not for life, and many people understand that well or have certainly come to believe it, even if they are hopeful at the point of being married.</para><para>Australians attitudes are also much more flexible. They do not necessarily see marriage as an institution that they need to enter into in order to show commitment to one another or to have children. There are a great many people who live in stable, longstanding relationships without ever entering into marriage. Many of those people have been discriminated against in law, and it is a matter of record that Labor governments around the country are trying to ensure that de facto couples get the same rights and entitlements as those who enter into marriage as described in this legislation. Then there are the people for whom marriage is now to be denied, and I understand that the common law for the moment effectively precludes marriage between homosexual couples. However, Australians are not so certain that that is necessarily a good thing. The most comprehensive survey of social attitudes on this question found that 65 per cent of people under 35 years of age in Australia would happily describe same-sex couples with children as a familyâand 56 per cent of people between 35 and 45 years of age have the same attitude. These Australians recognise that a same-sex couple with children is a family. They do not have any trouble with that at all. I am not sure about the older group. I imagine they would be more conservative on this question, but I think we need to put our debate in the context of what the citizens of this country regard as reasonable.</para><para>When it comes to the specific provisions of this bill, my concern is that we are sending a message to gay and lesbian couples in this communityâcouples who have longstanding relationshipsâthat theirs are effectively second-rate relationships, that they are to be seen as unworthy in some respect and not to be accorded the respect that this parliament gives to people who are in a married relationship. I have to say that, no matter how you look at the proposals that this legislation embodies, they have a nasty political whiff about them, because the Howard government has shown itself capable on many occasions of pulling out an issue that it regards as likely to divide the community and to result in the expression of certain prejudices for its own political advantage. You have to ask: why are we debating this right now? This government has been in office since 1996. It has had many opportunities to open up this question to the wider community. There has not been a debate in Australia about gay marriages. There has been a debate in the United States about gay marriages and, as in other things, this Prime Minister finds it attractive to follow along behind the American conservatives. I think that is very unseemly. It is not fair to the Australian community, because when you are making changes of the kind described in this legislation you really do need a mandate, the community does need an opportunity to discuss it and you need to think about the protection of minority rights and interests and how best to do that. We should debate what marriage should mean in a secular society, respecting people's religious beliefs and the equality that should apply to being a citizen in this country. We are effectively enshrining in legislation a form of discrimination which most of us would want to see eliminated in other forms ofâ </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>XH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McGauran</name></talker><para>âSo you will vote against it?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>XS4</name.id><name role="metadata">Lawrence, Dr Carmen, MP</name><name role="display">Dr LAWRENCE</name></talker><para>âNo. I am saying that this is a very political act. We have not had the debate necessary in the community. The minister may find it convenient to use a minority of gay and lesbian couples in the community as a weapon in a political strategy. I think that is an obscene thing to do and I am very disappointed that there are members on the other sideâI am sure of good faithâwho are prepared to go down this path. We need a proper discussion and I am pleased as I understand that is likely to occur, in part, in the Senate. Issues about adoption and so on flow really from this attempt to make gay and lesbian couples, in a sense, abandon any aspirations they may have in formulating a relationship. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Ultimately that may be what the Australian people decide. It may be that, after proper debate about the pros and cons of these arrangements, they would accede to what is existing common law. But to close the door in the way that this government is proposing as a political strategy I think does raise questions about its good faith. Frankly, I have no difficulty at all in seeing this as just another form of `divide and conquer'. You sow seeds of bias, prejudice and discrimination out in the community, just scatter them around a bit, and then allow them to grow for your political benefit. It is a very nasty tactic. I have seen this government do it with Indigenous people. It has tried it before with lesbian couples in relation to the IVF debate. It has done it with asylum seekers. In my view, history will judge this Prime Minister very harshly for having implemented this strategy so comprehensively and so often in Australian political life since 1996. </para><para>It is always easy to find people or groups in the community that you do not like or that you know others do not like and to engage them politically on the basis of their dislike for that particular group. This is not about protecting the institution of marriage. As I understand it, there is no suggestion in the law that it is under challenge. There are no cases, as far as I know, specifically challenging this matter, although there may be some in prospect. If this legislation passes, people who have entered into marriages in other countriesâgay and lesbian couplesâwill find they are not recognised here; and they are to be prevented from undertaking adoptions as well.  </para><para>As I say, these things need to be fully debated: what is in the interests of a child; what are the best circumstances for children from other countries to come into our country to begin their lives anew, many of them from very tragic circumstances? The message to the gay and lesbian community is a very cruel one. It basically says that members of the government regard their relationships as second rate and that they regard them as inappropriate partners for one another. We all know that sexual preference is something that most of the rest of the world regards as a basis for discrimination that should not exist and there are all sorts of legislation and international agreements to prevent it. So they are being told, `You are not worthy of entering into longterm relationships. The fact that you want to marry is not seen as a vote of confidence in marriage but as some form of perversion. And your desire to bring up children in families'âfamilies that many Australians recognise as reasonableâ`is one that we repudiate.' That is what this parliament would effectively be saying to members of the gay and lesbian community. That in my view is discrimination front and centre and it is a very cruel way of treating a minority group in our community. </para><para>It is an easy thing to find these minority groups and beat them up. It is not politically very smart but can be very effective. But I am pleased to say on this occasion that the Australian community has reacted to the government's strategy of using gay and lesbian people as a political weapon while caring not one bit about their feelings. Like many, I have had a large number of emails from both constituents and people around Australia expressing their hurt feelings, as much as anythingâpeople saying, `I am writing to you about the proposed ban on gay marriage and overseas adoption. I cannot begin to tell you how disappointed and shocked I am.' Other people talk about the pain that they have suffered having children in communities and now being faced with discrimination against them in a way they thought they had overcomeâtheir children at school effectively having to live with the idea that Mr Howard and the government are opposed to their parents. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>XH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Peter, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>XS4</name.id><name role="metadata">Lawrence, Dr Carmen, MP</name><name role="display">Dr LAWRENCE</name></talker><para>âWe are doing no more at this stage than ensuring that this matter is properly debatedâand we will do that.

I understand, since coming to this place, that we each represent approximately 80,000 to 100,000 people in our community. I believe that as elected representatives we should stand up for those people and for what they believe in. But those opposite agree with one side of politics and then leave it up to the Senate to come up with a different answer because they do not have the spine to stand up for what they should truly represent in this place. Much of the legislation ends up in the Senate for debate because the opposition do not say, `This is what we believe in and this is what we stand for.' Instead they agree with the government and leave it up to the Senate to refine the bill before it is passed.  </para></talk.start><para>I rise today to speak in support of the Marriage Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 as it has been put forward by the Prime Minister and the coalition government. As a representative of Western Sydney, an area with strong beliefs in the traditional institution of marriage between a man and a woman, I am concerned with the possible erosion of the sacred institution of marriage. The legislation honours marriage between one man and one woman. Up until now, neither the Marriage Act 1961 nor the Constitution contained a clear definition of marriage. The Family Law Act 1975 prevents regulation being made either under the Hague convention or under bilateral agreements to facilitate same-sex couples adopting a child from overseas. The provisions of this bill are to define marriage as a union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others, to confirm that unions solemnised overseas between same-sex couples will not be recognised in Australia, and to prevent intercountry adoptions by same-sex couples. I uphold the government's view that marriage be legally defined as such, with the intention of maintaining the Christian as well as the traditional concept of marriage.</para><para>By legally recognising the unique relationship of a man and a woman in marriage, we continue to instil the special status of this most fundamental institution in our society. This legislation gives us a rare opportunity to question and to re-examine some of our community's bedrock institutions, such as marriage. The matrimonial institution, worthy of protection, has endured for thousands of years. The union between men and women through marriage, tested over centuries across the world, has become a universal institution. It is a social institution that has formed the very basis of the whole fabric of our modern society and it has always been understood to involve the union of a man and a woman.</para><para>Whilst I recognise that there are many different relationships in our society, I also believe that they cannot be given equal status to a marriage between two members of the opposite sex. This bill does not discriminate against any kind of relationship; it simply reinforces the definition of marriage being between a man and a woman as the founding institution of our society. The act of marriage is something very profound and goes much deeper than merely an expression of affection between two people. There is no denying that the expressions of emotion, support and public commitment have been recognised as among the attributes of marriage. Such interests alone do not confer a right to marriage, however. Marriage is not meant to serve a single purpose of individual interests; it is about serving othersâour children and our family.</para><para>Some may argue that heterosexual intercourse, procreation and family responsibilities are not necessarily inseparable and that there are alternatives. After all, we do live in the 21st centuryâan era of significant technological and social change, where sexual alternatives are readily accepted by many people in our society. But I ask you here today: why should we do things differently just because we can? Why should we drift away from the basics of our human values and traditions? Simply because we live in a society with advanced technology, where anything is possible and different ways of life are available, is not reason enough to change the sanctity of marriage from the way that it was meant to be. I believe that this is the very time that we should stand up and confirm the sanctity of marriage. I am not saying that two men cannot raise a child or that two women cannot raise a child. What I am saying is that marriage is not just about sex or expressing individuality. Marriage should not be used as a policy tool to be redefined to achieve social goals and should not be defined or legislated by courts and judiciary. It is simply about love and the commitment between a husband and a wife to spend the rest of their lives together, often with the intention to bring a child into this world and to raise a family. </para><para>I believe that I represent the 80,000 residents in Macarthur and the majority of the Australian community when I say that the institution of marriage does play a most vital role in procreation, the creation of a stable family structure and stable communities. Surely this must be the reason why the majority continue to choose the traditional family arrangement, believing this best meets the needs of families and the Australian society. Perhaps most importantly we have to teach our children about love and sexuality from a female and a male point of view and give them an equal opportunity to make their preferred choice of lifestyle. It is our responsibility as parents to ensure that the needs of our children are met. Our children, including adopted children, should be given the opportunity to be raised by a mother and a father. The marital family unit is the foremost environment for the education and socialisation of children.</para><para>Children learn about their world, and their place in this world, primarily through their parents. A family defined by two parents of opposite gender continues to be the most prevalent social structure in which the majority of children are born, nurtured and raised to perform their role in our society. This is important not only for a society and our families but also for our lives. By supporting this legislation we are encouraging parents to remain committed to each other and to provide their children with an unbiased education about both men and women. This institution of marriage between a man and a woman does exactly this. Even more so, it facilitates a stabilising future and social structure for our children, and marriage and procreation are fundamental to the very existence and survival of our species.</para><para>This government seeks to establish its foundation on the basis of the idea of family consisting of one man and one woman. This stable and noble foundation is the basis of all decision making in our social and political development. It is also true that historical changes in our cultural, political and economic conditions have altered some of our traditional notions about marriage as an institution. Nevertheless, the institution of marriage remains the principal basis of our social foundation. We need to promote this view of marriage for what it truly isâa pillar of our societyâand it should not be altered.</para><para>I am confident that the majority of Australians would agree that the amendments to the Marriage Act 1961 and the Family Law Act 1975 are extremely important and legitimate in ensuring the promotion and support of a most favourable social structure in which to bear and to raise children. The Marriage Legislation Amendment Bill, when enacted, will ensure that marriage status continues to serve its purpose in our society. This is the point that I want to leave with all of you: we need to get back to the fundamentals. Marriage should be between one man and one woman, and the reason God created both man and woman is to procreate. By this we ensure that our values, our traditions and our heritage will live on through our children.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>30727</page.no><name role="metadata">Price, Roger, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PRICE</name><name.id>QI4</name.id><electorate>Chifley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI do not intend to make a long contribution to this debate on the <inline ref="R2053">Marriage Legislation Amendment Bill 2004</inline>. The contribution made by the member for Macarthur is one that I might have made when I was first elected to this place. But the reality is far different from what the honourable member for Macarthur was advancing in this House. The first thing I would say is that, in relation to marriage, this bill makes no difference whatsoever. It will not change one union in the future. The reason is that the definition of marriage in the Marriage Act is based on case law, or common law. The current definition that applies in Australia is that it is the voluntary union, for life, of one man and one woman, to the exclusion of all others. That definition was provided by Lord Penzance in Hyde v. Hyde and Woodmansee, and that is what the courts have been operating on. So the people of Australia have to understand that, by passing this legislation, the only difference we are making is changing from common law, or case law, to legislative law. In terms of the circumstances of individuals and citizens in this country, it is not making one whit of difference. </para></talk.start><para>The honourable member for Macarthur talked about the sanctity of marriage. Let me say that I do not think that this House, or even the Senateâor the two houses togetherâcan confer any sanctity on anything. When I got married it was not the civilian bit of paper that conferred sanctity upon the union; it was the receipt of the sacrament of marriage. That is what was important to me. For those who see the sanctity of marriage as being important, it is not what happens in this House, in the Senate or in the parliament but what happens in the church, in the mosque, in the temple, in the synagogue that confers sanctity. It is not the business of the state to interfere in what goes on there. I might say, though, that my electorate's namesake, Ben Chifley, was not able to receive that sanctity, because of prejudices that operated during the day.</para><para>Other speakers have commented that the Prime Minister, in announcing this legislation, indicated that he was going to rectify something that has been an outstanding injustice for a long time, and that is the inability of same-sex couples to legally access superannuation.

It is an absolute tragedy that there is no legislation accompanying this bill to rectify that.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I also need to stand up and say how very much I regret a past action. When I was involved in looking at child support in the mid-1990s, child support in relation to same-sex couples was clearly an issue. Given the controversy of the report and the matters that we were dealing with, I took the view that dealing with same-sex relationships, and particularly with respect to child support, was one bridge too far. Having seen how the report was by and large ignored, I have lived to regret that decision, and I would not make the same decision again. The point I am trying to make is that, whether we like it or not, there are same-sex unions and it is ridiculous for this parliament to ignore them. It is really disappointing that, having promised relief on superannuation, this bill has betrayed the aspirations of those people. </para><para>We have seen some legislation come into this place that is not really designed for the betterment of Australia and Australians and that has been clearly identified as a wedge for a forthcoming election. The classic example before this was the bill that was rushed in to amend the Sex Discrimination Act so that the Catholic Education Office would be able to provide scholarships for 10 male teachers. What a farce and a fiasco! As I commented then, I have never seen such an outpouring of concern and distress from coalition backbenchers. And where is that bill in the wash of things? It has disappeared into the ether.</para><para>This bill, as the member for Wentworth opposite knows, makes absolutely no change to the situation of same-sex couples in Australia. Prior to this bill they were not able to be married and after this bill they will not be able to be married. The current situation is based on case law, and we are merely institutionalising that with this change. I will be interested to hear from the member for Wentworth because, whilst all members of parliament have constituents who are in same-sex relationships, he probably has more than most. I will be most interested to hear whether or not the member for Wentworth is concerned about the betrayal on superannuation and whether or not he will argue that this gross injustice in relation to superannuation should be overcome.</para><para>There is one other issue I want to raise, relating to the contribution from the member for Macarthur about the sanctity of marriage. From memory, something like 45 per cent of couples are living in a de facto relationship. They are choosing not to get married. I have a profound belief in the institution of marriage, but I do not think it is right for me as a member of parliamentâor even the parliament itselfâto impose that belief on others. A huge number of young people today are choosing not to be married, not to have a civilian bit of paper that says that they are a union or living within the sanctity of marriage. I am not sure how this bill is embracing this current phenomenon. If we wish to speculate about the future, I do not believe we can suggest that these numbers are going to diminish and that we are suddenly going to have 98 per cent or 99 per cent of all Australians living in a marriage. I think the reverse is true. I think this trend of increasing numbers of de facto relationships is going to increase.</para><para>I understand people have very strong views on this subject. But those strong views emanate from what happens in churches, temples and mosques. This bill does not interfere with what happens in those instances. But I predict that in the future we will have to revisit this legislation, because we cannot ignore realities. The realities are that significant numbers of our fellow Australians are living in long-term, meaningful andâin the words of the member for Macarthurâloving relationships. We cannot afford to turn our backs on the reality of that, pretend that they do not exist or pretend that there are not children of those unions. I have said what I want to say. If Mr Howard was again looking for a king hit in terms of wedge politics, he has missed out with this legislation. It would be far better for the Prime Minister to take forward a program of future action for his fourth term, rather than try to play politics of the lowest common denominator. As Prime Minister of Australia, he should do better.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>30729</page.no><name role="metadata">King, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KING</name><name.id>00AMQ</name.id><electorate>Wentworth</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWithout doubt, the family is the bedrock of our society. But it is true to say that the way in which families are established has changed quite substantially over the years. Whilst I for one am delighted to be able to say in this House that I enjoy a loving and close relationship with my wife of some 20 years and our three children, I recognise that there are others who have formed different relationships and established families of a different kind. The <inline ref="R2053">Marriage Legislation Amendment Bill 2004</inline> will not prevent such families being established in the future. It does not close the avenues by which families may be established and founded. What it does is limit, restrict or exclude those who may enter a family relationship through a formal marriage. </para></talk.start><para>A couple of things which might be said to be beneficial come from this bill and the cognate legislation. The first is that the financial arrangements, particularly the definition of interdependence, will change so that those who establish gay relationships will not be discriminated against in Commonwealth fiscal and revenue relationships. That has been the undertaking in relation to the cognate legislation, and I am informed by a member of the government that this legislation will be taken through the Senate with legislation which presently rests there. So I am looking forward to having that ensure that all discrimination against gay couples that are properly established and appropriately definedâin accordance, perhaps, with the definition in the migration regulationsâwill cease.</para><para>In regard to this legislation in relation to the definition of marriage, it is interesting to look back to what Senator Gorton, during the carriage of the bill for the 1961 Marriage Act, said about this question. He said:</para><quote><para>... in our view it is best to leave to the common law the definition or the evolution of the meaning of `marriage' as it relates to marriages in foreign countries and to use this bill to stipulate the conditions with which marriage in Australia has to comply if it is to be a valid marriage.</para></quote><para>It is important that our churches are very closely involved in the definition of marriage and what is acceptable. I for one agree that in our society marriage is, according to the current law and according to the accepted tenets, the union of a man and a woman in a long and loving relationship.</para><para>But it may be that this legislation is going to defeat its own purposes. The attempt to exclusively define marriage itself gives rise to the recognition that section 51(xxi) of the Constitution gives rise to a power to exclude certain people from marriage in such a way that another parliament could redefine marriage and include those people. One of the reasons that the wisdom of the parliament of 1961 should prevail is that it may be that future societies will change the definition of marriage. One of the purposes of an evolving society isâin my view, anywayâto ensure the family, which is the bedrock of our society, remains as such.</para><para>It is possible that the definition of marriage in this legislation is going to give rise to constitutional challenges. We know that Justice McHugh in a recent case in the High Court and Justice Brennan in Fisher and Fisher and in another case, Hyde v. Hyde and Woodmansee, have made observations which suggest that the definition of marriage in the Constitution may in fact have some evolutionary nature.</para><para>I do not have time to go into those issues at the moment, as interesting as they are. But I will say this: those constitutional and personal matters give rise to the consideration that, in my view, the bill before the House ought to be a matter of conscience. I am disappointed that this legislation is not a vote of conscience, because on a matter as personal as the nature of marriage many different views will be acknowledged and it is only appropriate that such a course be taken. Nonetheless, that is not the case, so one has to deal with the matter as it stands. </para><para>I have also raised the concern that the exclusive definition of marriage and the way that it has been done may render illegal de facto relationships because of the impact that the public law may have upon the definition in the common law of what an accepted de facto relationship is. I refer to the decision of the Court of Appeal in New South Wales in the matter of Seidler v. Schallhofer, in which Justice Hutley, Justice Hope and Justice Reynolds acknowledged that an agreement to enter into a de facto relationship is not, as a result of evolving law, unlawful. If we start fiddling with the definition of marriage that may have some unfortunate implications for other sorts of established relationships, and that is a matter of some concern.</para><para>My time has run out, I regret to say, in accordance with today's permitted debating time. I am concerned about the definition exclusively put in this fashion. I have a significant number of established, happy and long-term gay couples in my electorate. I would not wish in any way it be thought that there was anything to be said offensively against the establishment of such families. On the other hand, I also recognise that the institution of marriage as it is is part of our society and is part of that bedrock which I mentioned earlier: namely, the established family.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>30731</page.no><name role="metadata">Andren, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDREN</name><name.id>KL6</name.id><electorate>Calare</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âFirstly, I would like to acknowledge the very wise and knowledgeable contribution from the member for Wentworth, and particularly the concerns he has noted over the definition of marriage in this legislation. The <inline ref="R2053">Marriage Legislation Amendment Bill 2004</inline> amends both the Marriage Act and the Family Law Act in relation to same-sex couples and is the primary part of a wider government policy in regard to the rights of same-sex couples in Australia.</para></talk.start><para>The amendment to the Marriage Act 1961 clearly defines what constitutes a marriage for the purposes of the act. A marriage is determined to be the union of a man and woman to the exclusion of all others voluntarily entered into for life. This intention is clear in the act as it stands in section 46(1), which deals with certain statements that must be made by a marriage celebrant. This amendment presents no departure from the act's current function. I support the inclusion of this definition of marriage. The act has served its purpose to date, and this amendment will in no way detract from its function. This amendment to the Marriage Act no more discriminates against certain groups in our society than the intention of the act as it stands already does.</para><para>I do believe that if there is, as the Attorney-General stated in his second reading speech, `significant community concern about the possible erosion of the institution of marriage' there are better ways to focus our efforts to protect the institution than banning people from joining it. We could start by tackling the causes of marriage breakdowns in this country. I believe that our time in this place would be much better served if we were concentrating on social dysfunction and the breakdown of relationships rather than finding ways to discourage a lifelong bonding between people in whatever context. As far as I can see, if this place were to allow same-sex marriages, the end result would have no effect on the incidence of heterosexual marriages and heterosexual couples willing to contribute to the survival of the species.</para><para>The amendments to the Family Law Act 1975 effectively ban same-sex couples from adopting children from overseas and prohibit any person from facilitating the adoption of a child from overseas by a same-sex couple. This seems in the most part to be aimed at preventing immigration officers issuing the necessary visas for any children adopted by same-sex couples to enter Australia. This is borne out somewhat by the comment on the adoption issue attributed to the Attorney-General in an article in a recent <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline>: that `it was up to the federal government, not the states and territories, to decide who entered the country'. This suggests that the government approaches adoption from an immigration perspective rather than on the ability of a couple or a person to care for and nurture a child. Or perhaps it is more indicative of where the federal government has identified an opening to inject its influence into the area of adoption that is administered by the states and territories. </para><para>The government's amendment will prohibit a same-sex couple from an overseas adoption by making it against the law for any entry visa to be issued in these circumstances, even though a specific state or territory may have deemed the couple eligible to adopt. This is not to suggest that there will be a flood of same-sex couples adopting children from overseas. The states and territories apply eligibility criteria equally to domestic and overseas adoptionsâand we need to keep in mind that they are hardly uniform in their approach. The Australian Capital Territory, Western Australia and Tasmania adoption laws consider same-sex couples eligible to adopt. This is applied in much the same way to de facto heterosexual couples, usually with certain conditions to ascertain the stability of the relationship and the commitment of the prospective adoptive parents. However, New South Wales, South Australia, Victoria, Queensland and the Northern Territory do not allow same-sex couples to adopt children. Their respective adoption acts basically determine that `a couple', whether married or de facto, refers to a relationship between a man and a woman. In fact, the Queensland act also excludes heterosexual de facto couples, although this is under review.</para><para>So, despite the fact that the majority of states already subscribe to the federal government's approach on same-sex adoptionsâand in fact do so to a greater degree, as they ban domestic adoptions by same-sex couplesâthe government have decided that it is necessary to close the loophole available to these couples in Western Australia, the ACT and Tasmania, and then only half close it, as they cannot ban domestic same-sex adoptions in these states without being accused of infringing states rights. And the government do not want the focus of this debate skewed from same-sex couples to states rights.</para><para>This policy is full of holes. Even in those states and territories where same-sex couples are banned from adopting, there remains an indirect mechanism for a same-sex couple to adopt, as most allow single persons to adoptâalbeit in special circumstances. One partner of a same-sex couple could well take this approach. However rare a successful adoption in these circumstances may be, the opportunity legally remains. This is policy on the run, and the government is scraping the bottom of its wedge politics barrel. If the government were truly committed to the protection of the institutions of marriage and the family from the perceived threat from same-sex couples, surely it should have taken the time to draft federal template legislation for a uniform national approach to adoption, complete with its exclusion of same-sex couples, and bring the states and territories under control and have the full debate that this issue certainly requires instead of attacking it from this piecemeal and political perspective. Instead, we have an inconsistent patchwork policy, with the Commonwealth exerting its leverage on the states and territories through its responsibility for immigration law.</para><para>The final part of this policy package highlights this inconsistency even further. The government's changes to the tax treatment of inherited superannuation for same-sex couplesâbringing them into line with married and de facto couplesâare to be moved in the choice of superannuation bill in the other place. This is a thinly veiled attempt to distract attention from the obvious incongruity of banning a same-sex marriage on one hand whilst, on the other hand, recognising that the strength of commitment in such relationships can be equal to that of any married or de facto heterosexual couple. This is a double standard of epic proportionsâand I need only look as far as the Treasurer's recent address at the National Day of Thanksgiving at Scots Church in Melbourne to see this. The Treasurer spoke of the `tradition that underlies our societyârespect for individuals, tolerance within a framework of law and mutual respect'. He also said, `A government should never get into religious endeavours.' On both counts raised by the Treasurer, the Prime Minister obviously disagreesâjudging by this legislation. </para><para>I support the amendments to the Marriage Act 1961. As I said earlier, I do not feel these amendments change the operation of that act in any way. I support the government's changes to policy on tax treatment of superannuation for same-sex couples. I do not support interfering in states or territories rights, except in the most extreme circumstancesâas with the former mandatory sentencing laws in the Northern Territory. The adoption changes are not borne of extreme circumstances, and adoption should remain the domain of the states, where the best interests of children are well protected.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>30733</page.no><name role="metadata">Neville, Paul, MP</name><name role="display">Mr NEVILLE</name><name.id>KV5</name.id><electorate>Hinkler</electorate><party>NATS</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âToday we debate the definition of the core social institution of human society: marriage. Perhaps there will always be some difficulty in putting forward a cast-iron definition of marriage, for this debate cuts to the very core of human relationships. Marriage can be strictly defined as `the formal union of a man and woman, by which they become husband and wife'. It is within that union that procreation takes place, yet no clear definition of marriage exists in Australian law. The <inline ref="R2053">Marriage Legislation Amendment Bill 2004</inline> will remedy this situation, and that is the part of the bill I would like to concentrate on.</para></talk.start><para>From time immemorial, marriage has been a framework from which other aspects of orderly society have been regulated. Public health, inheritance, transfer of wealth and, in past times, even the alignment of nations and international treaties have hung on marriage. But the one overriding factor in Western society is that marriage always took place between a man and a woman. There are many aspects to the institution of marriage, the formal union between a man and a woman. It is a framework recognised by society, by law and by the church, and it is the formal expression of love and commitment between two people. But our modern society is apparently moving away from that.</para><para>Let me make myself clear on this matter: I am not homophobic and I am against all forms of discrimination. People should be able to live their lives in Australian society without prejudice, discrimination or bias. I am not judgmental of single-sex relationships, and I recognise that such people should be able to transfer property, superannuation rights and the like. But minorities cannot redefine marriage. No minority group has the right to attach traditional symbols to their own circumstances and turn the institution into something it is not. Some would argue that to alter the essential nature of the marriage union and its ceremony is to degrade it to the point of meaninglessness.</para><para>Almost every society and religion sanctifies and consecrates the union between a man and a woman. In most societies, marriage has been a monogamous union between a man and a woman, though not exclusively so. It is seen to be a societal framework, a contract and the best environment in which to raise children. It is seen by some religionsânotably, Christianityâto be a sacrament. Even atheistic societies, while not recognising the sacramental purpose of the union, have recognised its higher purpose. In the early days of the Soviet Union, the so-called bourgeois institution of marriage was dispensed with. But, even in that atheistic society, the state came to realise the importance of monogamy for the raising of children and the stability of society. </para><para>As society's formal expression of commitment, marriage is only a recent phenomenon. Our modern society is rapidly moving away from traditional structures. Our moral, legal and social expectations have morphed us into an `almost anything goes' society. Of course `normal' society has its taboos but, more and more often, minority groups are pushing the boundaries. Fringe groups seek the benefits attached to mainstream society but do not want to adhere to its strictures. Do not get me wrongâI repeat: I am against all forms of discrimination. But minorities cannot redefine marriage. It is the bedrock of society and should not be moulded to suit the changing mores and expectations of minority groups. On this issue I am completely determined. </para><para>My electorate office has taken several messages of support for the bill, one of which said:</para><quote><para>I write to commend your government for making the proposal to place the definition of marriage into legislation. I am a marriage, family and youth counsellor and have been such for 27 years. I know the heartache of trying to work with families where either the mother or father is absent and the children are acting out of control. ... The traditional definition of marriage needs bolstering.</para></quote><para>Modern relationships take many different forms. We have de facto relationships, single-parent families, same-sex couples, divorcees, arranged marriages and marriages of convenience. I accept that we cannot shut the gate once the horse has bolted. My point is that people are free to choose their relationships and arrangements, as they always have been, but legal marriage should not exist outside the vows made between a man and a woman. People are free to have long-term relationships and commitment ceremonies if they wish. Indeed, they can take part in wedding ceremonies overseas. But those unions will not be recognised as marriages in Australia.</para><para>A 2002 research report compiled by 13 American scholars, titled <inline font-style="italic">Why marriage matters: </inline><inline font-style="italic">twenty-one </inline><inline font-style="italic">conclusions from the social sciences</inline>, concluded:</para><quote><para>Marriage is an important social good, associated with an impressively broad array of positive outcomes for children and adults alike.</para></quote><para>I agree wholeheartedly with that statement, which is why I support the bill banning same-sex couples from adopting children from overseas countries. The majority of Australians think that children, including adopted children, should have the opportunity, all things being equal, to be raised by a mother and a father. That is a compelling argument and one I agree with.</para><para>I know that families which fall outside the definition of the traditional nuclear format often raise happy, well- adjusted children. But I stay strong on the point that every child deserves the love and affection of a mum and a dad. Again it may boil down to the heart versus the head, but I have never once heard anyone argue against this point. The 2002 study I referred to previously reached some fundamental conclusions: (1) that marriage increases the likelihood that children will have a good relationship with their father; (2) growing up outside an intact marriage increases the likelihood that children will themselves divorce or become unwed parents; and (3) children who live with their own two married parents enjoy better physical health, on average, than do children in other family forms. </para><para>I have always been a proponent of the traditional form of marriage and advocate spouses sticking together through thick and thin. Life and love are not easy. There are good times and bad, as referred to in the traditional wedding service. I do not support same-sex couples adopting children. I believe children are a blessing and it is every parent's duty to care for, love and guide their offspring as they grow. I sometimes hear the argument that other forms of relationships can express these things just as well. I do not think the evidence is there. </para><para>We can look in years to come from this `anything goes' society and wonder what the effects will be even on things as fundamental as genetics in two or three generations time. I think this is the time for Australian society to draw a line in the sand. It is time to recognise that marriage is essentially the union between a husband and wife. When we bring children into the world, some parents decide to have a christening, some people decide to have a baptism, some people decide to have a naming ceremony. But a christening is not a naming ceremony and a naming ceremony is not a christening or a baptism. I think most people recognise that. When we come to marriage, people are free to enter into living arrangements and are free to have ceremonies of commitment if they wish. They are free to have contracts. I make no judgment about those things. But those relationships are not marriage. I commend the government for having the courage to put this legislation forward and I support it wholeheartedly.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>30735</page.no><name role="metadata">Plibersek, Tanya, MP</name><name role="display">Ms PLIBERSEK</name><name.id>83M</name.id><electorate>Sydney</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>â`Countess G used to say, âWhat do I care if they love men, women or canaries?â' wrote Natalie Barney. I believe that as parliamentarians we should adopt the same approach. Surely, with so much hatred, war and division in the world, we would strengthen our community by celebrating love, devotion, kindness and constancy, not by seeking to proscribe it. Which one of us in this place is so morally superior that we have the right to judge other humans and their love for one another as inferior, second rate or second best?</para></talk.start><para>Through the <inline ref="R2053">Marriage Legislation Amendment Bill 2004</inline> the Prime Minister is seeking to amend the Marriage Act to insert the definition that marriage is `between a man and a woman, entered into for life, to the exclusion of all others'. The sad fact is that human beings are frail creatures, and I know very few marriages that meet the criteria of being `to the exclusion of all others' and `for life'. If these are really the criteria the Prime Minister sets for marriage then very few couples measure up. We are all fallible and many marriages fall by the wayside. Many have difficult timesâsome end, some rebuild. The point is that as a society we are stronger when we look for ways to celebrate and increase the sum total of love: not wall it in, deny it or ignore it because it does not read like a Mills and Boon novel.</para><para>The changes to the Marriage Act which the Prime Minister is proposing are unnecessary and they are discriminatory. Some time in the not too distant future, people will look back on this desperate attempt at wedge politics and treat it with the contempt it deserves. Some time in the not too distant future, there will be formal recognition of same-sex couples, and the sky will not fall in, and we will not be destroyed like Sodom and Gomorrah, and life will continue. The main difference will be fewer violent or abusive attacks on gay men and lesbians, and fewer teenagers suiciding, because they will not be taught to feel shame about their sexuality as many are now. </para><para>These changes are not necessary from a legal viewpoint. One has to wonder, with the packed legislative agenda that the government claims it has, why it would make such legislation a priority. Not one extra man or woman would be able to marry their same-sex partner if this law is not passed. The amendments are unnecessary because, firstly, the Marriage Act already says marriage is between a man and a woman. Secondly, the common law states that a marriage is the `voluntary union for life of one man and one woman' in Hyde v. Hyde, 1866. </para><para>Thirdly, countries where courts have extended marriage to same-sex couples have entrenched rights of equality absent in Australia. In Canada the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in section 15 specifically provides for the right of equality before the law. There is no similar right of equality under Australian law. Any suggestion that Australian courts may follow the lead of Canadian courts is misinformed and fails to understand the particular legislative background in Canada, which differs substantially from that of Australia in the area of fundamental rights and freedoms. Those European countries where same-sex marriages are permitted, such as Belgium, have chosen after much community debate to legislate to allow such unions, usually because their de facto relationship recognition is so poor.</para><para>Fourthly, the proposed definition anticipates that marriage is a continuing union `for life' notwithstanding the ability of parties to a marriage in Australia to divorce under the Family Law Act. The words `for life' are consequently inappropriate given that there is no suggestion that the amendments are intended to abolish divorce. This just shows how ill thought out and rushed this legislation is. </para><para>Since when do we make legislation to reassert the status quo? Since it has become a possible political wedge. This government and this Prime Minister should be ashamed that, with all of the pressing issues facing Australia todayâour involvement in the so-called war on terror and what it means for our place in the world and our safety, the destruction of Medicare, the affordability of education and hundreds more I could nameâthey are wasting the time of the parliament reasserting the status quo for political purposes. Does anyone believe that it is a coincidence that this legislation came up at the same time as the member for Makin was making the front page of every newspaper with new revelations about the trip to Paris she took with her then boyfriend? This is an ugly little trick designed to rebuild the government's family values credentials after that fiasco.</para><para>This legislation is also offensive. It is offensive because it goes out of its way to say that same-sex love is second-class love. As one of my constituents wrote to the government:</para><quote><para>I am a 29 year old Australian born woman, who also happens to be a lesbian. Today I do not feel like an Australian. I feel like my rights as a citizen of this country have been totally disregarded. That my rights to freedom, equality and lack of discrimination do not exist as an Australian citizen. I am part of a community, the gay and lesbian community, that is approximately ten per cent of the population. I am surprised that in this day and age, politicians think it necessary to use this community as a political football ...</para></quote><para>Not all gay men and lesbians, even those in committed relationships, wish to marry. They just really resent being told that they have no right to want the same options as their straight brothers and sisters. I will be moving an amendment to this legislation in the consideration in detail stage which will state explicitly that same-sex de facto relationships should have exactly the same legal status, rights and responsibilities as heterosexual de facto relationships. </para><para>The adoption provision that the government has introduced is also offensive because it says that gay men and lesbians cannot be trusted around children. The coded message is that homosexuality is the same as paedophilia. It suggests that children are better off growing up in an orphanage in a developing country than in a loving family in Australia if that family happens to have two mothers or two fathers. The message that this sends to gay and lesbian parents in Australia is deeply wounding, but the message it sends to their children is even worse. I know a number of children who have grown up with two mothers or two fathersâusually two mothersâand they are perfectly well-adjusted little human beings who understand that their families are different from the norm but who are just fine with that.</para><para>What right does this Prime Minister have to tell those children that their families are so abnormal and so dangerous that this government has to override state legislation to make sure no more families like theirs are created? What message does this send to those children? There is no evidence that growing up with same-sex parents is in any way harmful to children. A number of my constituents wrote to me saying: </para><quote><para>This flies in the face of all credible research that suggests that it is family processes, not family structures, that determines a child's health and well being. That is, it is the love and care within a family, not the gender or sexuality of the parents which is of utmost importance for a child's wellbeing. Even if this bill is passed by Parliament, gay men and lesbians will still be able to adopt as individuals. Denying both persons in a same sex relationship from adopting a child will serve only to deny that child of rights, such as the right to child support payments, inheritance rights etc.</para></quote><para>We have no evidence to suggest that growing up with same-sex parents is in any way harmful to children. We do in contrast have evidence that child abuse and neglect are harmful, yet the government is not interested in developing a national plan for child abuse or neglect. We know that pneumococcal disease kills children, yet this government has had to be dragged kicking and screaming to follow expert recommendations to vaccinate children against pneumococcal disease. We know that smoking around children harms their health, is associated with low birth weight, with sudden infant death syndrome, with other illnesses and with a greater likelihood the child will become a smoker later in life. This is something we know damages children, but the government has made little or no effort to stop this killer of children.</para><para>We have the highest rates of child obesity in our history, but the government refuses to join Labor in supporting a ban on the advertising of junk food during children's television viewing hours. It seems absolutely bizarre to me that instead of doing anything to deal with these great challenges facing children, not to mention the chronic federal underfunding of the public education system, this government instead builds up this straw man, this imaginary threat, just to be seen to tackle it with this unnecessary and offensive legislation.</para><para>It seems bizarre also that parliamentarians, people who choose to spend well over 80 nights a year away from their children, have the right to suggest that loving same-sex parents cannot bring up a child. I have heard several times in this debate that children would ideally have a mother and a father who were married and so on. I am very sorry to disabuse the pollyannas who have suddenly populated this placeâthere are no ideal families. All families face challenges and most muddle through as best they can. That is just life. There are no ideal parents and there are no ideal families. All we can do is our best. If our children scramble into adulthood mostly undamaged, with intact self-esteem, a positive outlook and a strong set of values, then we have done a great job as parents. </para><para>To be honest about same-sex parents, I have to say that the same-sex parents I know are often more thoughtful, dedicated parents than the average parent. They have made a clearer, more considered decision to have a childâthere are no unwanted pregnancies in lesbian relationships. Friends of mine, Penny and Jo, who are soon to have their second child, were foster parents for many years before they made a decision to have their own biological children. There is a chronic shortage of foster carers around the country, and one of the reasons is that sometimes the young people are so damaged by their past experiences that they are difficult and disruptive.</para><para>This couple usually took in teenagers who had experienced years of abuse or neglect before they reached Penny's and Jo's home. This couple and their friend Allan, who shared the caring duties and provided an excellent male role model for these kids, were robbed. They had one girl whose friends trashed their home. They stayed the distance with these troubled kids because they were committed to giving them a better start in life. Who has the right to say that these women, who exhibited so much care and compassion for troubled children who came to them as strangers, have no right to children of their own?</para><para>I know another family that was made uncomfortably famous by this government's ridiculous response to their appearance on <inline font-style="italic">Play School</inline> recently. Young Brenna wrote two books with her mum Vicky so that the kids at her school and at other schools would understand that families come in all different shapes and sizes. On top of her usual work and being a mum, Vicky has spent unpaid hour upon hour trying to get these excellent books into schools so that all kids are presented with the notion that families are varied. How many parents go to such lengths to make sure their children feel secure? How can anyone say that Vicky and Jacky are less worthy of being parents than I am?</para><para>I simply cannot believe that, of all of the things this government could do to improve the lives of Australian children, it thinks the most pressingâthe most necessaryâis to stop a few couples from two states being able to adopt children from the few countries which might allow adoption to same-sex couples one day. It is a travesty and an insult to every same-sex parent and it is a terrible, terrible message to send their children.</para><para>I want to end by telling the stories of two couples I know. Colin and Izzy have been together for more than 20 years. Recently they participated in a commitment ceremony in Melbourne, which they wish was a proper marriage with the full force of Australian law. But their relationship is living proof of the fact that people do not need a bit of paper to show their commitment to one another. In 20 years together, Izzy's diabetes has worsened. Colin has saved Izzy's life on a number of occasions by preventing him from slipping into a coma. He has supported Izzy financially when he could not work because of his illness. They have a respectful, committed, loving relationship. Their families and friends see them as an inseparable couple. What is so very threatening about their love that they should be singled out by this absurd legislation and legislatively corralled so that they do not pollute the rest of society?</para><para>My friends Bruce and Greg had a commitment ceremony many years ago. About seven years ago we celebrated their 10th anniversary with a big party. What was really special about that party was that Bruce's parents and Greg's mum, who had not been at the original ceremony, came to the 10th anniversary party. Over a decade they had come to accept that their sons' love was deep and genuine and deserved celebration. Bruce's brother-in-law's motherâa wonderful, devout Catholic mother of fiveâsaid at that ceremony that, seeing all the love that was around her, she could not understand why she had been taught to be prejudiced. </para><para>Bruce's mum once said to me that her only regret for her son and his partner was they could not have a family of their own, especially as children loved Greg so much. As it happened, Greg later became the biological father of the daughter of lesbian parents. Bruce and Greg play a big part in this little girl's life, as do their families. How can it be bad for her to have so many extra people to love her? This is the reality of modern life: love comes in all shades and textures. As a society we should recognise and value human kindness and constancy; we should seek to increase the sum total of happiness, not shrink it with proscription and prejudice. Surely, like Bruce's and Greg's parents, as we grow, we will learn to accept what we previously feared.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>30739</page.no><name role="metadata">Smith, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANTHONY SMITH</name><name.id>00APG</name.id><electorate>Casey</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe <inline ref="R2053">Marriage Legislation Amendment Bill 2004</inline> contains important amendments to the Marriage Act which, as previous speakers on this side of the House have outlined in some detail, seek not to introduce a major change but rather to confirm and reaffirm the legal understanding and definition of marriage in Australia. The Marriage Act 1961, as previous speakers have said, does not specifically stipulate a definition of marriage, and the Attorney pointed this out in his second reading speech when introducing this amending legislation.</para></talk.start><para>Of course, as he indicated, the reasons for that lack of a specific definition relate mainly to the fact that some 43 years ago, when the Marriage Act was enacted, the need for such a specific black-and-white definition would, I am sure we would all agree, have seemed largely unnecessary to those framing the legislation and to the members of parliament who passed it during that period. However, the intention of the Marriage Act 1961 was clear, as the Attorney pointed outâthat is, that marriage is between a man and a woman. That is the intention of the act. That has always been the strong understanding of the act in the Australian community. No-one has doubted that. No-one in Australia, I think, doubts that situation todayâno-one doubts that, when the Marriage Act 1961 was framed and the legislation was drawn, that was indeed the unambiguous intention of those framing the legislation.</para><para>I make that point because even those opposite would not challenge that fact, despite their difference with this side of the parliament, as we have heard from the member for Sydney. Even those opposite would not challenge the fact that the Marriage Act 1961 had a clear intention based on the public understanding that marriage is between a man and a woman. As the Attorney outlined, much of the act indirectly confirms this, but the specific legal definition is not there and that is precisely why we seek through this amending legislation to introduce a formalised definition into the act so that the issue is beyond any doubt whatsoever. And the reason we seek to do that is quite simple: while the current legislation remains as it is, it is potentially open to challenge from those seeking to have same-sex marriages recognised under the Marriage Act.</para><para>Previous speakers from the other side have made the bizarre claim this morning that this amending legislation is both unnecessary and divisive. They say it is unnecessary because it simply affirms the current law, but it is divisive because it does so. How something which affirms and puts beyond doubt the universal understanding of the current law, which has been on the national statute books for 43 years, can be divisive is really beyond me. What it says about those opposite is that, if they find the amendment that affirms and confirms the current statute divisive, they must think the current law itself is divisiveâthey must think the Marriage Act is divisive. There can be no other option. If they honestly think an amendment to confirm an existing statute is divisive, they must think that statute itself is divisive. </para><para>As I indicated, those opposite also think that this amendment is unnecessary because, whilst the Marriage Act 1961 lacks that specific definition of marriage, common law and court-made law make clear what the current statute does not. How a member of this Houseâin fact, how a member of any house in a democratically elected parliamentâcan stand in a prime law-making chamber such as this and say that it is unnecessary for a law to be updated, it is unnecessary for a loophole to be closed or it is unnecessary for the parliament to act, because common law or court-made law has it covered, is very illustrative. What it illustrates is what we have seen throughout this debate over the last 24 hoursâthat is, there is a difference between the approach from our side of the House and the approach from those opposite. We believe parliaments elected by the people should make these decisions primarily, not judges and courts elected by no-one.</para><para>We have seen judicial activism in other democracies such as the US, and previous speakers, including the member for Aston, articulated that very clearly. We believe it is the role of our parliament to clarify the issue. We do not believe it is the role of the national parliament to acknowledge that there is a gap or a flaw in the existing legislation and then to sit and wonder what a court might do in the future, when we know the legislation itself requires amendment. We on this side of the House believe it is our role to ensure our laws reflect the intention with which they were passed. It is right and proper in this House and in the other place in this parliament that we exercise our duty, our responsibility and our democratic mandate to remove that doubt and to confirm the intention of this parliamentâand confirm the will of the Australian people.</para><para>The public expect nothing less of us. Not only do they expect us to make laws that do the best for Australia but they also rightly expect that, where a deficiency arises, where a loophole appears or where there is a problem with an existing law, we act to fix itâthat we do not do what some opposite seem to prefer, which is to ignore it or to wait until a problem arises elsewhere or the legislation itself is subject to challenge or called into question, and then for us to scramble around and try to come in after the event and overturn a court decision. The public expect us to act exactly as we are acting today through this piece of legislation. To those who say it is unnecessary, I say there is never a problem with a parliament confirming their intention; that is precisely our role. And, when it comes to this important issue of marriage, that is exactly what we are doing.</para><para>This bill reconfirms the definition of marriage, but in doing so it also affirms the fundamental importance of marriage in our society. We seek not just to defend that institution but also to promote it. Of course, no-one is suggesting that there are not meaningful relationships outside marriage, but the point is they do not constitute marriage. Marriage is between a man and a woman. It is the bedrock of our society, it is a fundamental reason for the success of our society and it will be a fundamental ingredient to the future success of our country and the wider society in the years ahead. In passing this amending bill, the parliament is doing precisely what it should be doing. </para><para>In closing, I want to refer briefly to the fact that, at the same time the Attorney announced these changes to the Marriage Act, the government also announced it was amending the tax treatment of superannuation to introduce a new concept of financial interdependency, whereby the definition of a `dependant' for the purposes of paying superannuation death benefits will now include a person in an interdependent relationship. For many in the community, including but not only those in same-sex relationships, this amendment removes what they saw as a very practical barrier, where superannuation assets were treated less generously for those who were not married or in a recognised de facto relationship. Now the situation will be identical. The reason I raise that is that on that very practical, sensible level the tax laws are being amended to equalise treatment for all those in financially interdependent relationships.</para><para>Contrary to the views of those opposite, the vast majority of Australians will not see this legislation as divisive or confrontational; they will rightfully see it as something the parliament should be doing, and I think they will rightfully see it as legislation that should be clarified and probably should have been clarified some time ago.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>30741</page.no><name role="metadata">Organ, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ORGAN</name><name.id>BNL</name.id><electorate>Cunningham</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise today to speak to the <inline ref="R2053">Marriage Legislation Amendment Bill 2004</inline> with much sadness, for it is a bill I would have hoped would never appear in this place. I should say at the outset that the Greens oppose this bill. We object to such blatantly discriminatory legislation being brought before the parliament and we oppose the discrimination against individual Australians based upon their sexuality. The bill before us has two main purposes: firstly, to define marriage in the Marriage Act and therefore `delegitimise' same-sex marriages which may take place either overseas or in Australia and, secondly, to prevent same-sex couples from adopting children from overseas countries. The bill raises complex and controversial issues relating to the definition of marriage, the recognition of validly contracted foreign marriages for the purposes of Australian domestic law, and adoption by same-sex couples.</para></talk.start><para>The government has stated that this bill is necessary because of significant community concern about the possible erosion of the institution of marriage. But where is the evidence for that? It is obvious that there is homophobia out there in the community, but to say that gay marriage will erode the institution of marriage is rubbish. This is not the reason for this bill at all. The reality is otherwise. The government has admitted during this debate that the bill aims to head off court challenges in regard to the recognition of overseas marriages. We only have to look back to the Prime Minister's comments of August last year that gay marriages `do nothing to support the survival of the species' to realise where the government is coming from.</para><para>As I said, the Greens are fundamentally opposed to the position taken by the Prime Minister and the government on these matters. The Greens have developed detailed policy positions on the many issues facing lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people in Australia. I suggest that members of the House visit our web site and read those policies. There are many issues in there, and it would be very informative. These policies were developed over many years in close consultation with the community. The issue of marriage is just one of the many elements of discrimination these people face on a daily basis in this country. The Greens do not believe that allowing members of the LGBTI community to marry fundamentally undermines marriage. Indeed, such a desire can surely only strengthen it. If two people wish to make a public declaration of their love and longterm commitment, then their gender is irrelevant. We should remember that we are dealing here with the emotions, feelings and relationships of ordinary Australians. I am sure that there are many here in this place who feel that such issues should not be politicised, but they are being politicised. </para><para>It is obvious that there is a degree of homophobia behind the position taken by the government. Homophobia, for the members' interest, is defined as a fear of homosexuals, be they male, female or transgender, and is usually linked with hostility towards them. But I ask: why the fear? There is no reason for it, and there is no reason for the bill before us, apart from a desire to discriminate against ordinary Australians based upon their sexuality. A desire to commit to spend your life with another person and to have that commitment publicly recognised is an important tradition in our current social and cultural context. The government and opposition both suggest that we should blatantly discriminate in the area of marriage. How would people react if the parliament suggested that two people could not marry because of the colour of their skin or because of different religious beliefs? Members would say: `What an outrageous suggestion.' Yet we are clearly faced with discriminatory legislation here today. This is despite the fact that on 24 August 2001 the Prime Minister stated:</para><quote><para>... people shouldn't be the subject of discrimination if they choose a particular lifestyle.</para></quote><para>...	...	...</para><quote><para>... I don't think people should be in any way penalised or discriminated against if they are homosexual. I mean I certainly don't practice any kind of discrimination against people on the grounds that they're homosexual, I think that is unfair.</para></quote><para>This is inexcusable hypocrisy, for this bill clearly discriminates against homosexuals in our community. It is, in the words of the Prime Minister, therefore unfair. Has the Prime Minister's position changed since 2001? Does he now believe that we should actively discriminate against homosexualsâagainst the LGBTI community? Obviously the answer is yes, and this bill is evidence of that.</para><para>We have heard many worthy speeches in this debate, especially from this side of the House, on the issues of the history and status of marriage, on LGBTI relationships, on discrimination and on related issues in this country and overseas. The members for Gellibrand, Grayndler, Melbourne Ports and Fremantle covered these issues eloquently and in much detail, and I agree with many of their statements. It is therefore disheartening that the opposition will not be opposing this bill in totalâthat they will not be supporting those thousands of Australians in the gay community who want to live as a married couple, whether it be called a civil union or some other term, and who do not want to be discriminated against because of this. These people are not single; they are not living in de facto relationships. They are, for all intents and purposes, living in relationships as a married couple. We cannot stand here in this place and deny that. The ABS tells us that there were almost 20,000 such couples in Australia at the last census and that those numbers were probably substantially less than the real figures due to the nature of the census form, so we are talking about some 40,000 Australians at least.</para><para>At this point, it might be useful to make reference to an Alan Ramsey article which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> on 29 May this year and which outlined just one aspect of the government's highly problematic approach towards recognition of same-sex partners. Ramsey outlined the case of Colin Hollis, a former Labor MP from the Illawarra, who went to New York to represent the Australian parliament at the United Nations in the same year the member for Makin took her now infamous study tour. Ramsey wrote: </para><quote><para>... the besieged Howard Government now argues, in panic, that what Draper did four years ago was entirely proper and âwithin the rulesâ, while it insisted in July 2000 that Hollis must pay the air fare of his live-in partner of 36 years to go with him, even though his partner, a bloke, so scrupulously met all the rules of an MP's ânomineeâ that Janette Howard hosted him one year at her annual afternoon tea at The Lodge for MPs' âspouses and partnersâ.</para><para>How's that for hypocrisy fit to choke.</para></quote><para>Ramsay's article quoted Colin Hollis directly on this issue. Mr Hollis said:</para><quote><para>We took out a $10,000 bank loan and paid for Gordon's ticket ourselves. ... But what was so galling was the other MP who was going to the UN ... took his wife ... and they had their fares paid, yet while I met all the guidelines of a `genuine domestic relationship'âI mean, 36 years we've been together, joint bank accounts, joint ownership of our home, joint names on the bills, everythingâI gave all this documentary evidence to the Department of Finance. ... They just wouldn't have it. ... everyone else has taken their partner on this trip over the years ... because you're away several months. Everyone, but not us.</para></quote><para>Hollis took his case to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in 2001 but lost on the strict definition of `spouse' in the legislation. Again, the government fought Hollis all the way. This blatant discrimination is an affront to fair-minded people everywhere.</para><para>For centuries, gay and lesbian people have made a phenomenal contribution to our society in all fields of endeavour. To suggest that by acknowledging gays and lesbians in marriage we will fundamentally erode the institution, and ultimately society, is ridiculous. To suggest that gays and lesbians cannot raise children with the same successful result as heterosexual people is also ridiculous. As we are all well aware, every family is different. If the government are so concerned about children having parents of different sexes perhaps they feel that single mothers or single fathers should have their children taken away from them. To judge a person's parenting ability with such a broad brush on the basis of their sexuality is ludicrous. And to suggest that these relationships are not worthy of the recognition of marriage is also ridiculous.</para><para>As I have suggested, the contribution of gay and lesbian people to our community has been enormous. Despite this, we still seem to be determined to discriminate. Some are willing to give in to the rantings and ravings of homophobes. For centuries many gay and lesbian people have been forced to hide their sexuality through fear of discrimination. Let us make no mistake: this legislation sets their cause backwardâback to the fifties, I would suggest, a time period that the Prime Minister is obviously very comfortable with. I believe that acknowledgment and acceptance of the legitimacy of gay and lesbian people and of their love is inevitable; the community is very much supportive of that. But the government and opposition are today making that journey that much harder. </para><para>Graham Willett, in 2000, published a book called <inline font-style="italic">Living Out Loud: A History of Gay and Lesbian Activism in Australia</inline>. A description of this work by Paul Sendziuk, from the Department of History at Monash University, in 2001, provides a brief overview of gay and lesbian rights and cultural acceptance in Australiaâand I think it is worth bringing this to the attention of the House. According to Sendziuk, Willett provides a chronological narrative which traces the construction of a homosexual `community' and the movement towards gay `liberation' and homosexual law reform in Australia. The book's three parts titled `Living', `Out' and `Loud' broadly characterise the emergence of homosexual visibility and vibrancy between 1950 and the present day. It surveys the so-called camp scene in the 1950s, a decade in which fear of violence and arrest stifled homosexual life and any ideas of political actionâand we do not want to return to those days at all. </para><para>Although fear of bashing, employment discrimination and arrest kept most homosexual activities hidden, this did not prevent homosexual men or women from finding each other. By the late 1960s decriminalisation was on the minds of politicians, the clergy, newspaper editors and liberal reformers, both male and female. Not surprisingly, given the history of repression and violence, homosexuals were not among the many voicing their dissent publicly. As Dennis Altman has contended and Willett echoes, the arguments of these small `l' liberals were propelled by the emerging discourse of multiculturalism, which would also come to have a dramatic impact on public policy and attitudes concerning Indigenous people and immigrants.</para><para>The first gay rights organisationsâthe Daughters of Bilitis and the Campaign Against Moral Persecution, CAMPâwere established in this country in 1970 and, from that point on, political activism became a permanent part of Australian homosexual life. These organisations and their leaders gave the inspiration for thousands of peopleâgay and straightâto become politically involved. Willett keenly relates the way in which they organised community meetings, established single--issue lobby groups and ran for parliament on a policy platform of gay rights. He also notes their opposition, the leading voice of which was the Reverend Fred Nile, a member of parliament in New South Wales, and his Festival of Light organisation. In the transition from `Out' to `Loud', Willett explains how homosexual activity between consenting adults was first decriminalised in 1975 under the Dunstan Labor government in South Australia, to be followed by reform of Commonwealth and Victorian legislation in 1978 and 1980 respectively. He also charts the growing support for the `gay agenda' in the community and the way in which a visible and vibrant homosexual communityânurtured by gay businesses, gay press, gay bars and sporting competitionsâemerged in Australia's two largest cities. The author cautions however against assuming that the experience of Sydney and Melbourne gay men and lesbians and other members of the community was shared by their brothers and sisters in rural areas and provincial cities, some of which even now have still to form `communities' of homosexual men and women in any real sense. </para><para>I have certainly been made aware of the homophobia that has existed in the community in my electorate of Cunningham. Vile letters to the editor on this issue have appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Illawarra Mercury</inline> since the Prime Minister raised the issue last year, and recently in response to my same-sex relationships billâthough I should point out to the House that the letters in support of gay marriage and gay rights have far outweighed the homophobic. This legislation does nothing to progress the rights of gay and lesbian people in this country; indeed, it deals them a blow. At present there is no definition of `marriage' in either the Marriage Act or the Family Law Act 1975. The issue of defining `marriage' in the Marriage Act was raised when the Marriage Bill was being debated in the Senate when it was first introduced in 1961. A Country Party senator unsuccessfully proposed that marriage should be defined and made a number of suggestions including: </para><quote><para>... `marriage' means the union of one man with one woman for life to the exclusion of all others, such union being contracted in the manner provided in this Act ...</para></quote><para>and:</para><quote><para>... `marriage' means the voluntary union of one man with one woman, for life to the exclusion of all others ...</para></quote><para>The last amendment was put to the vote and defeated by 40 votes to eight. While it can be argued that for the purposes of Australian law `marriage' does not include unions between persons of the same sex, it is also true that our understanding of who can contract a valid marriage under Australian domestic law is changing. For example, the Full Family Court was recently asked to make a declaration that a marriage between a post-operative transsexual person, `Kevin', who had been born female and a woman, `Jennifer', was a valid marriage. Both a single family court judge and later the Full Family Court declared the marriage valid. The Commonwealth intervened in the first proceedings and then appealed the single-judge decision to the full Family Court.</para><para>The amendments contained in schedule 1 of the bill will also mean that marriages between same-sex couples validly contracted overseas will not be recognised for the purposes of the Marriage Act. There have been newspaper reports in recent months that some Australian same-sex couples who have married overseas may seek a declaration from the Family Court that their marriages are valid in Australia. A number of overseas jurisdictions now allow same-sex partners to marry or enter civil unions.</para><para>Australia is a party to the Hague convention. Under article 9, the convention obliges Australia to recognise marriages validly entered into in foreign states. However, article 14 provides:</para><quote><para>A Contracting State may refuse to recognize the validity of a marriage where such recognition is manifestly incompatible with its public policy (ordre public).</para></quote><para>Same-sex marriages are not specified in the convention as marriages to which the convention does not apply, nor are they listed as an exception to the general obligation to recognise foreign marriages that are set out. Countries where gay marriage is allowed and where registered partnerships or civil unions are granted include the Netherlands, Belgium, Canada and the United States, where, this year, Massachusetts was the first US state to allow gay marriages. Countries considering gay marriage legislation include Spain, France and Sweden; while US states considering gay marriage legislation include California, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont.</para><para>It is an unfair and ridiculous situation that same-sex relationships all over this countryâdespite their longevity, despite their passion and love and despite their profound commitmentâmust be treated as `different' relationships. Australia has an opportunity here to be one of the most progressive and forward thinking in the world in relation to a whole range of issues, the recognition of same-sex relationships being just one of them. However, the government and opposition bury their heads in the sand, refusing to accept and support same-sex relationships as a normal part of Australian life in 2004. For this reason I cannot support this bill and I condemn the government for bringing it before the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>30745</page.no><name role="metadata">Schultz, Alby, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SCHULTZ</name><name.id>83Q</name.id><electorate>Hume</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak on the <inline ref="R2053">Marriage Legislation Amendment Bill 2004</inline>, and I do so in an environment where I have taken note of a significant number of comments from members of both sides of the House. I just want to make a brief statement on the contribution by the member for Cunningham. The member for Cunningham does not agree with anything the government has done as the elected governing body of the Australian people. In the three-year period that he has been in this House, to my knowledge, he has never voted with the government on any issue. That is the ideological bent of the member for Cunningham. It is in direct contrast to the views of the member for Casey, who eloquently and dispassionately explained the practical and historical reasons why the marriage legislation bill has been introduced into this House. </para></talk.start><para>Before I make any further contribution, I want to illustrate what I have just said by reading from page 18 of the <inline font-style="italic">Weekend Australian</inline> from Saturday, 29 May 2004. Those of us on this side of the House know that the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> is not a print media outlet that has any great love for the government. The editorial is headed `Gay marriage not needed'. It is rather lengthy, but I will read it in part:</para><quote><para>Homosexual Australians had a big practical win and a small symbolic defeat this week. The Government announced legislation to allow superannuation to pass to a same sex partner without penalty tax. It means that gay and lesbian partners will have the same rights as married couples and heterosexuals in de facto relationships. This is a long overdue and sensible decision that will put an end to a ridiculous restriction on the rights of homosexual couples.</para></quote><para>It goes on to say:</para><quote><para>The Government was accused of playing politics, seeking to shore up conservative support. But if this was the Prime Minister's motive it was one Labor was quick to share, saying it would support the legislation restricting marriage to heterosexuals. While gay activists might not like it, the major parties are convinced the community will not wear the idea of same sex marriage.</para></quote><para>Finally, the article said:</para><quote><para>Without this legislation, social engineers on the bench and at the bar would likely soon find some contrivance under international law that would bind Australia to acknowledge overseas same sex marriages and adoption rights. Mr Howard is quite right to say that if the definition of<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>marriage is to change it should be done by the people's elected representatives, not the courts.</para><para>Gays who argue this is demeaning and unjust should get over it. There is nothing that prevents priests and celebrants conducting ceremonies for gay couples affirming their decision to live as couples. They may not be married under the law but surely how they, and the people in their lives, perceive their relationship is what matters most.</para></quote><para>I think that is a very eloquent editorial, and it is written in the context of the values of people like me, as I represent the majority of my constituents, knowing and adhering to the reality that marriage is the accepted bond between a man and a woman. Marriage is a bedrock institution worthy of protection. There should be no doubt about what the word `marriage' means. However, there is growing evidence to suggest that the commonly accepted definition of `the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others' is under threat.</para><para>Amazingly, there is no definition of marriage in the Marriage Act 1961, despite the fact that section 46(1) of the act requires that a marriage celebrant who is not a minister of religion of a recognised denomination must say to the parties to a proposed marriage, in the presence of the witnesses, words including:</para><quote><para>âMarriage, according to law in Australia, is the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life.â;</para><para>or words to that effect.</para></quote><para>The government's proposed amendment to the act will ensure that the legal position in respect of marriage is further strengthened. I think that is a classic illustration of why the government has taken the action that it has. I have listened to the contributions of members on the other side of the House with their attacks on the Prime Minister and what they say is the reason for him introducing this amendment bill into this House through the appropriate minister. The reality is this: 30 backbenchers, of whom I was one, who represent in excess of a quarter of a million constituents, went to the Prime Minister and highlighted the need to amend the current act. </para><para>The meaning of marriage has also been raised in Australia recentlyâand the member for Cunningham did allude to that in a number of waysâincluding in the Family Court, in the case of Kevin and Jennifer. In this case, the court was asked to declare that the couple's marriage was valid, even though Kevin was born a woman. The trial judge found that Kevin was a man at the time of his marriageâa decision upheld by the full bench of the Federal Court when challenged by the Attorney-General. In addition, same-sex couples married in overseas jurisdictions such as Canada, the Netherlands, Belgium or Denmark may seek judicial recognition of their marriage in Australia. A notice of intent to do that was made in February this year by a male couple from Melbourne who had earlier flown to Canada to be married.</para><para>It is my belief that moving away from the traditional definition of marriage would be to the detriment of our society. Marriage provides stability and is a solidly-built roof under which children can grow and be nurtured. The Australian Family Association has strongly supported this view, as has the Australian Christian Lobby. I think that we as Australians still hold dear the traditional family values that marriage implies and would like to see those values maintained and protected well into the future. As someone who has been married to a very loving, caring and sensitive woman for 42 years, I concur with my wife's sentiments about the need to protect the sanctity of marriage.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>CK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hardgrave, Gary, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Hardgrave</name></talker><para>âShe's glorious.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83Q</name.id><name role="metadata">Schultz, Alby, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SCHULTZ</name></talker><para>âThat is correct. Each of us should have the opportunity to participate in our community and to experience the benefits and accept the responsibilities that flow from such participation without fear of discrimination. It is clearly in the best interests of children for them to have, all other things being equalâas the Prime Minister has said on numerous occasionsâthe care and affection of both a mother and a father. That is one of the reasons why I think the other part of the bill which relates to the adoption of children by same-sex couples has to be referred to here.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Many of my parliamentary colleagues may not be aware that 16 per cent of married couples are unable to have a child. As there are very few babies or children available for adoption in Australia, these married couples are forced to go through a time consuming and costly process to adopt a child from another country. The issue of adoption is centred around both the Commonwealth and the states, and the Commonwealth government does not control adoption practices. This is a matter that lies within the control of the states and territories. The government believes, however, that it is inappropriate for the Commonwealth to intervene to overturn the laws of elected governments other than in the most exceptional circumstances, and in this respect the government believes it is appropriate that the territories are treated as equivalent to the states. The government has decided that it will, to the extent of its direct responsibility under the external affairs powers, legislate to prevent adoptions by same-sex couples under the international arrangements being recognised in Australia.</para><para>When these sorts of issues arise, many members of parliament are subjected to accusations by elements within their communitiesâand I sympathise with the member for Cunningham, who has been attacked for his views. We do, after all, live in a democratic society. But I also concur with one of my National Party colleagues, who referred to the issue of homophobia, which he and people like me are accused of when we make a comment or a statement which is in contrast to a minority view on a particular issue, such as, for example, homosexuality or gay couples. </para><para>It may surprise the House that I have a very close relationship with a number of homosexual people in my electorateâand with a number of homosexual couples. Some of them I class as very dear friends. They are good, loving people and very fine Australians, but they are also very fair people, and they understand that I have different views to theirs on some issuesâand I have been attacked for some of those views, particularly those that are centred around mainstream Christian values. In fact, they support me when I make some statements. So the things we are hearing today from some members about what the homosexual community may or may not think are not necessarily the thoughts of all homosexual people or gay couples. I needed to make that comment, because that is the reality and it is the message that I have got from some of the gay people I know who live in a relationship as a couple.</para><para>I also have to say that the point that I made about 30 members bringing this matter to the attention of the Prime Minister, and those 30 members representing in excess of a quarter of a million constituents, is a very poignant point that the member for Cunningham has failed to pick up on. He certainly has not picked up on it in the three years that he has been a member of this place. Unfortunately for the member for Cunningham, I think his seat will go back to the Australian Labor Party at the next election because he has got a narrowly focused view of his constituency. That is one of the reasons why I take very strong exception to people coming into this place and making loud noises about minority groups. In this case we are talking about a group of peopleâgay couplesâwho make up about 0.5 per cent of all couples, married or living in a de facto relationship, in Australia. I take strong exception to people coming into this place and attacking me and to people in my electorate who represent a very small group of people attacking me for the views that I am articulating and the stand that I take on behalf of the majority of the people that I represent.</para><para>As I have said before and say again today, I will face my constituents at the polling booth. They will exercise their democratic right to make a decision about whether they want me to continue to represent them in the manner that I have in the 16 years that I have been a member of state and federal parliament, and I will accept that decision gracefully one way or the other. I wanted to make that point in this place. I will not be intimidated by individuals in this place or by individuals or groups out in the electorate into moving away from the things that I grew up with, the things my father and my mother taught me about honesty, integrity and principle, and my Christian beliefs, which I hold very dear.</para><para>In closing, I want to say that the institution of marriage is a very precious thing to most Australians. I am talking about the majority of Australians. I am concerned that the Australian Democrats and the Greens have already moved and voted for an amendment to the Marriage Act which will allow marriage between two men or two women. So far the ALP, the alternative government, has not supported this amendment, but this could change, especially given the ALP's recent support of a motion in the Senate calling for full recognition of same-sex couples in federal law. Traditional mainstream marriage is an enduring social institution which benefits family members and provides for stability in society. More specifically, it benefits children by ensuring their welfare not only is maximised but also is paramount. I have a great deal of pleasure in saying that I support this bill. It is long overdue in ratifying a very grey area in the Marriage Act, and I commend the Prime Minister, my party and the Attorney-General for introducing it into this House. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>30749</page.no><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name><name.id>0J4</name.id><electorate>Berowra</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Attorney-General</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn the spirit of moving the matter on quickly, I will deal with general comments made on the <inline ref="R2053">Marriage Legislation Amendment Bill 2004</inline>. I think my comments should be generic, rather than picking up on comments from each speaker. Much of the ground was covered in a similar way in contributions, depending on whether people support the measure or support the opposition's approach and its amendment. For the record, let me make it clear that the government will be opposing the second reading amendment proposed by the honourable member for Gellibrand and will be opposing each of the amendments that will be moved in the consideration in detail stage.</para></talk.start><para>I thank members for their contribution to the debate. The number of speakers who have contributed demonstrates the importance of this issue. The debate demonstrated that it is an important matter for the broader Australian community. I thank the opposition for its support for at least those amendments we proposed to the Marriage Act which seek to define the fundamental basis of the institution of marriage.</para><para>I note that, in relation to the question of the government's motivation in bringing forward this bill, some have suggested that it was because the government had in mind `wedging' the opposition. I find this a particularly fascinating term, primarily because I only ever hear it being used in relation to the government when it has a different view to the opposition on a matter of substance. It is well known that politics is about difference. I have not heard it said that, when the opposition present a different view on health policy or education policy, they are `wedging' the government. We could adopt this term and get the histrionics right, suggesting with some fervour that there is something improper about having a difference on public policy.

They were determined by the fact that numbers of people believed that, by going offshore and entering into marriages that were permitted offshore, on return to Australia they could invite our courts to recognise those relationships. That is contrary to what we believe the common law to be, but it is not a matter on which the parliament has expressed a view. Our concern has been that some judges have already flagged that they believe they are the custodians of the common law and that they might offer another view. In those circumstances, it is quite appropriate for the parliament to leave no doubt as to what it thinks the situation is. It is not a matter that should be postponed until such time as we find that a courtâ</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83K</name.id><name role="metadata">Roxon, Nicola, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>0J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name></talker><para>âA number of them. I understand there are as many as five. They have been reported in the press, so the information is as much available to the member for Gellibrand as it is to me. The fact is that in the government's view, with those proceedings afoot seeking a declaration of validity, this is not a matter in which the government should abdicate its proper leadership role in relation to families.</para></talk.start></continue><para>These provisions are not about discriminating against anybody. As I have been told over and over again in the context of this debate, this is merely affirming what people understand to be the law. They have not come into the parliament and advocated that it should be something else. It should be a matter of no contest. It should be supported, and if you support it the government's motives in relation to this matter should not be impugned. We are not about discriminating against anybody. We are of the view that people can have their relationships. It is just that they cannot have their relationships ascribed the characteristic of marriage, as marriage is a relationship between a man and a woman. So the purpose of the bill is to give effect to that commitment, to protect the institution of marriage. </para><para>The bill has another provision, which the opposition is not prepared to support, so let me deal with that second matter. It relates to the question of same-sex couples being put forward as adoptive parents for children from overseas countries. The government is firmly of the view that all children should have the opportunity, all things being equal, to the care of a mother and father. That is a statement that has been made by this government. It is a statement that was uncontested by the Leader of the Opposition.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83K</name.id><name role="metadata">Roxon, Nicola, MP</name><name role="display">Ms Roxon</name></talker><para>âWhat about if all things are not equal?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>0J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name></talker><para>âThe opposition raised this during the course of the debate and I answered a question some time ago in relation to this matter. There are few such situations which are likely to arise in relation to overseas adoptions because the pool of people available to adopt is in fact quite large and the number of children available for adoption abroad is quite smallâas is the case with the number of children available for adoption in Australia generally. What that means is that this is not a question of suitability of people to adopt. This is a question of when you have a limited pool judging who among those who are suitable ought to be given priority. That is really what the issue is. We are not seeking to interfere in relation to the states' entitlement to make a judgment as to who might be suitable to adopt.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83K</name.id><name role="metadata">Roxon, Nicola, MP</name><name role="display">Ms Roxon</name></talker><para>âThat shows it is a state issue.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>0J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name></talker><para>âNo, it is not. The law in relation to these matters is in the hands of the states. Some states are prepared, as some honourable members have saidâand I think it was the honourable member for Sydney who said thisâto allow same-sex couples to be approved for adoption; others are not. But that is not the issue. The issue is about a matter where the Commonwealth has primary responsibilityâthe approval of people for entry into Australiaâand the implications of Australia going into countries that give some primacy to children having parents who are going to play the proper role as a mother and father and saying, `Regardless of your culture and your approach, we are proposing to put forward as suitable adopting parents same-sex couples.'</para></talk.start></continue><para>That would have significant implications for bilateral relationships. It would be likely to jeopardise those countries' continuation in a program which is important to Australians who are unable to find children for adoption. I simply make the point that this issue is within the Commonwealth's constitutional competence. We are not seeking to intrude in whether the states or territories regulate adoptions in any particular way.

We know that most of the states in Australia do not permit it. But we do not think it is necessary for the federal government to intervene in the way that it is simply to make its point about its view of what a family should look like and what it thinks is always in the best interests of the child. We do not believe that, if a child is in traumatic circumstances, if they are living in poverty or if they have been involved in a country which is war torn or has some other civil disruption, there will never been a good home for them here in Australia with a same-sex couple. That is a ridiculous argument for the Attorney to make. It is not one that we think stands up to any sort of criticism.

The government says, `We have to take action in these things because we have been asked to take action,' or, `We have to take action because the intercountry adoption system is going to fall apart'âthe Chicken Little approach of `The sky is going to fall in'âbut it cannot give us any evidence, any substantial request or any indication from any country that they might withdraw participation in the intercountry adoption system.

When the Prime Minister made his announcement about this latest wedge tactic with his minister who specialises in these tactics and specialises in vilifying the most vulnerable people in our community, he said that there would be changes made to superannuation to allow for people who were interdependent to gain access to superannuation benefits. The Labor Party has had a bill before this House since 1998 which would have achieved this reform. This bill, the provisions of which I have included in this amendment, has the support of the superannuation industry, the support of the Gay and Lesbian Rights Lobby and other equal rights groups, the support of the ACTU and the support of the Association of Certified Practising Accountants.</para><para>HREOC had a report into this issue in the case of Greg Brown, whose partner, Robert Corva, died. He had worked for the defence department. Mr Brown went to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, went through the bureaucracy and went all the way to HREOC. In his finding, Commissioner Sidoti found that this was discrimination but it was legal discrimination. This is 2004. What sort of society and what sort of parliament accept the situation that legislation can be described as legal discrimination? This amendment seeks to remove it immediately. It has the support of the private sector. The Body Shop conducted a campaign under the theme `Same Sex, Same Rights' for which they got petitions signed supporting my bill. That reflected the community's support to remove this area of discrimination.</para><para>The government has spoken about interdependency. But that will still leave discrimination, because same-sex couples will be required to prove financial and emotional interdependence and they will also be excluded from some of the benefits of superannuation, such as the spouse contribution rebate. Why has the government gone down this path? It used the example of elderly sisters who are dependent upon each other. That is a legitimate issue and a legitimate area of reform, but it is not the same as reform in the area of relationships. The relationship between two elderly sisters, one of whom is looking after the other, is not the same as a loving sexual relationship between two men, two women or a man and a woman.</para><para>We seek to remove that discrimination and to change the definition of spouse, but that is one step too far for this government. It says it wants to remove discrimination, but it does not want to do it openly because of some of the redneck, bigoted attitudes of those who sit opposite. We still have not seen the bill on superannuation. My amendment would ensure that change in superannuation happened and that it happened today, because reform is long overdue in this area.

The same would apply to Sir Robert Helpmann, Patrick White and many other famous Australians. I will not embarrass government members by naming some of their own former colleagues who would also be discriminated against.</para><para>The amendment I am moving tests this government's promise that they will do something to lift the burden of discrimination from the gay and lesbian community. It follows amendments moved earlier by the honourable members for Gellibrand and Grayndler. I want to take this opportunity to say something about the honourable member for Grayndler's efforts over the years to abolish discrimination in superannuation. He has been a tireless opponent of discrimination, and I know that in this area his efforts have been appreciated by many people outside this House.</para><para>My amendment is very simple. It provides that the government's amendments to the Marriage Act and the Family Law Act, if and when they are passed by the Senate, will not come into effect unless and until this government fulfils its promise to amend Australian superannuation law to abolish discrimination against same-sex couples. When the Attorney-General introduced this bill, he said that there would be legislation to remove discrimination against same-sex couples in superannuation. In other words, this legislation came as a package. The Prime Minister got to amend the Marriage Act so that he could go around the country, especially to regional seats at election time, posing as Mr Family Values while the blatant political agenda which lies behind this bill, which relates to a nonexistent problem, was to be concealed by a reform to the superannuation law.</para><para>We have had that part of the government's package. We have seen the amendments to the Marriage Act and the Family Law Act. But where is the other part of the package? Where is the fig leaf to cover up this blatant exercise in wedge politics? It is nowhere to be seen. The Attorney-General said it would be introduced at `an appropriate time'. Is now not the appropriate time? I have to ask: what is holding up the government's proposal? It is not as if it is a difficult piece of legislation to draft. The honourable member for Grayndler and I have tried on many occasions, since he has been in this House and since I was elected in 1998, to introduce a simple set of amendments which would have the effect of abolishing discrimination against same-sex couples in superannuation. Each time we have been defeated.</para><para>Nor can the problem be that we are proposing something radical. We are talking about money that has been contributed by employees into superannuation funds and their right to gain equal treatment regardless of whether they are in same-sex or heterosexual relationships. Honourable members opposite claim to be the party of individual rights, and particularly of the rights of property. Here we have a group of individuals who are still being denied the right to dispose of their property as they see fit. Now we are trying again to abolish this piece of unjustified discrimination. We will be watching to see how members opposite vote on these amendments. They assure us that they have no prejudice in bringing in this bill. Now is their chance to prove it by voting in support of this amendment. </para><para>I will be particularly interested to see how members opposite who represent electorates similar to mine vote on this amendment, including the member for Higgins. There are members opposite who have significant numbers of gay men and lesbians in their electorates. I think of the honourable members for Wentworth and Adelaide. There will be many voters in those seats who will be very unhappy if those members vote against this amendment and for the continuation of discrimination in superannuation. Most particularly, I am thinking of the honourable member for Higgins, the Treasurer, whose electorate abuts mine and includes Prahran and South Yarra, where many gay men and lesbians live. They are of course more affluent people than those in my electorate, and many of them no doubt have voted Liberal until now. They will discover today what their local member really thinks of them and of their right to live their lives as they choose and particularly to dispose of their property as they see fit. In short, we will find out today who are the real liberals in this House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>30758</page.no><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name><name.id>0J4</name.id><electorate>Berowra</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Attorney-General</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe amendment is not needed.

It is necessary to move this amendment, because the Labor Party wants to make clear that we believe that de facto same-sex relationships should have absolutely equal status under the law to de facto heterosexual relationships. They should have absolutely equal rights and absolutely equal responsibilities. This is an area where there still is a great deal of discrimination. Some of the areas in which there is discrimination include, but are not limited to, workplace relations, taxation, superannuation, immigration and citizenship, Defence and veterans' entitlements, health, aged care and social security. For example, if you are a de facto heterosexual couple the calculation of your health expenses is different to that for a de facto same-sex couple. It is absolutely wrong that in 2004 we still discriminate between same-sex and heterosexual relationships in this way.</para><para>To give effect to this amendment we will need the audit of all Commonwealth legislation that the ALP have promised. We have said that we will go through every piece of Commonwealth legislation and remove discrimination based on sexuality or gender identification. I noticed earlier that the AttorneyGeneral said that this was an unwise move because there were areas in which discrimination was a good idea. I cannot believe that the AttorneyGeneral would come into this place and say that some racial discrimination is a good thing. It is absolutely wrong to discriminate against people on the basis of sexuality. How is it different from discriminating against people on the basis of their race? I am sure that he would not be arguing that it would be right to discriminate on the basis of race.</para><para>This amendment is absolutely in line with Labor's history of addressing discrimination against gay men, lesbians and others. We were the ones who lifted the ban on gays and lesbians in the Defence Force. In the Disability Discrimination Act 1992, we banned discrimination against people who are HIV positive. We outlawed federal and state government interference in private sexual conduct when the Keating government passed the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill 1994, which implemented article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. This guaranteed that no federal or state government could create legislation that interfered with private sexual conduct between consenting adults. We were the party which provided lesbians and gay men with the same immigration rights as heterosexuals in 1992, when amendments were made to the Migration Act 1958 which made it possible for Australian citizens and Australian permanent residents to sponsor their same-sex partners to migrate to or remain in Australia on the basis of their relationship. However, while these are great achievements, there are still significant gaps, because de facto same-sex couples are treated differently from heterosexual de facto couples. As well as being in line with Labor's history of addressing discrimination against the gay and lesbian community, the amendment is also in line with moves in this country over time to address discrimination between people who are married and people who are in de facto relationships. Once upon a time, people who were in de facto relationships were really regarded as second-class citizens; they no longer are. I commend this amendment to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>30761</page.no><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name><name.id>0J4</name.id><electorate>Berowra</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Attorney-General</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âCan I just make it clear that the amendment is not accepted. It is not clear what the effect of such an amendment would be. The Marriage Act is enacted under the marriage power of the Constitution. It does not deal with de facto relationships. It is not a marriage and de facto relationships act, and that is essentially the bottom line. I think the proposed amendment would impact on the definition of marriage that we are proposing. We do not think that it would be helped by reference to what de facto relationships may be and what other relationships may be equated with them. It would only cloud the issue by introducing amendments about the legal or other effect of such relationships. I simply make it clear that in the course of this debate there has been a reference to what state and territory governments should deal with. In relation to the affairs of those in de facto relationships, broadly speaking, aside from areas relating to childrenâwhere I think there has been a referral of powers to the Commonwealthâthe states regulate those issues, and they have made arrangements which I think are quite clear in terms of what the honourable member is seeking to achieve here. I was however interested in her comments in relation to discrimination. Let me make it very clear: I talked about difference; I did not talk about discrimination.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>R36</name.id><name role="metadata">Albanese, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Albanese</name></talker><para>âYou started to say the word.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>0J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name></talker><para>âNo. I talked about difference. I make it very clear that in the area of raceâthe honourable member for Sydney believes that nobody would advance that there should be discrimination or `differences' in the way in which programs are implementedâthe most significant areas of difference in Australian public life are in relation to programs that have been put in place beneficially for Indigenous Australians. I do not see anything wrong with difference where it is designed to address issues in an appropriate way where people in the past have suffered significant disadvantage. I make that clear; I do not run away from it. I do not necessarily agree in every circumstance where people argue we ought to be doing it, but I am not arguing that in appropriate circumstances it is not proper or responsible.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>30761</page.no><name role="metadata">Plibersek, Tanya, MP</name><name role="display">Ms PLIBERSEK</name><name.id>83M</name.id><electorate>Sydney</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI just want to clarify for the record that I was speaking about negative discrimination: discrimination against people on the basis of race.

I am most concerned to think that, even if it did, it would no doubt want to discriminate between those in a same-sex relationship and those in a heterosexual relationship. I think it is discriminatory, despite what the Attorney-General says. It is very important that this legislation be amended to recognise properly and appropriately de facto relationships. There should be no discrimination in the Marriage Act about whether or not people are in de facto relationships or whether they have been married through the appropriate forums. </para><para>I know many same-sex couples who have had longterm relationships; they have longterm commitments to one another. They are good family people. They show their contribution to our community in a way which many people in this chamber ought to be thinking about. I do not know the average length of a marriage these days, but I suspect it is around seven or eight years. It seems to me that, if most people who go into a marriage are going to have that marriage end within seven or eight years, we will have a very skewed view of families and family relationships as a result of the proposal which the government is advocating. We need to understand that families are different. That does not mean they are any less a family nor does it mean that they do not have relationships which rely upon partnerships in which people's rights are recognisedâwhether it is through superannuation or any other aspect of their lives.

Schedule 10 will require charities, public benevolent institutions and health promotion charities to be endorsed by the Commissioner of Taxation in order to access relevant taxation concessions. In addition, endorsed charities will now have their charitable status displayed on the Australian Business Register. These changes are part of the government's response to the report of the inquiry into the definition of charities and related organisations. The changes will allow greater scrutiny of the use of taxation concessions by charities, improve public confidence in the provision of taxation support to the charitable sector, and provide charities with certainty of their entitlements. These Senate amendments postpone to 1 July 2005 the requirement that charities, public benevolent institutions and health promotion charities be endorsed by the Commissioner of Taxation in order to access relevant taxation concessions. This is to ensure that charities have sufficient lead time to comply with the new arrangements in light of the bill not yet having received passage through parliament.

Any pension being paid from the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Scheme to a former senator or member who rejoins parliament will be suspended while he or she remains in parliament, but payment of the pension will be restored from the later of the completion of that new period of parliamentary service or age 55. The changes proposed in the bill will not affect the superannuation arrangements for sitting senators and members, who will not be able to transfer to the new arrangements.</para><para>The government does not support the amendments, moved by the opposition and passed by the other place, to cap the entitlements under the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Scheme of any existing member of parliament or senator to the level applying to a cabinet minister. The arrangements proposed by the government will ensure that all members, both existing and new, have their superannuation benefits based on their total parliamentary salaries regardless of the amount of those salaries.</para><para>If the opposition believes it is appropriate for a Prime Minister to be paid a higher salary than a ministerâand I think most people in the community would agree that that is indeed the right way to goâthen it is entirely appropriate that the salary of that member for superannuation purposes should also reflect that differential. It is, however, pleasing to see that the opposition has indicated that it will not insist on these amendments when the bill goes back to the Senate from this place. I therefore commend the motion to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>30765</page.no><name role="metadata">Cox, David, MP</name><name role="display">Mr COX</name><name.id>83U</name.id><electorate>Kingston</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI think it is extremely disappointing that the government has not accepted the opposition's amendments.

I mentioned that prominent among concerns voiced by that committee was a disagreement between the Australian Federal Police, who are advised by the Director of Public Prosecutions, and the Attorney-General's Department, who are advised by the Solicitor-General, about the existing relationship between the telecommunications interception regime and the AFP's comparatively new cybercrime powers under section 3L of the Crimes Act to remotely access stored communications in computers and the like. There was also ongoing concern about the ability of law enforcement authorities to access emails stored on ISP servers without a telecommunications interception warrant. Again, the government withdrew the amendments, and Labor cooperated to facilitate the timely passage of the remainder of the bill.</para></talk.start><para>The bill presently before the House approaches the matter somewhat differently from the earlier 2004 bill. Firstly, there is no longer an amendment proposed to the definition of interception to encompass reading or viewing communications. Unfortunately, however, it is not explained in the material accompanying the bill why it was necessary to remove the proposal altogether. In the explanatory memorandum accompanying the earlier 2004 bill, that amendment was said to be necessary in order to:</para><quote><para>... extend the protection afforded to communications in their passage over the telecommunications system to include protection from reading or viewing those communications. This extension addresses advances in technology which have resulted in many telecommunications now taking the form of written words, such as email, or even images and to which the concept of listening is not directly applicable.</para></quote><para>We can only assume that the complete removal of this provision has something to do with the concern expressed by the AFP that it would no longer be able to read emails between the points of the firewall and receipt by its employees, for the purpose of internal security or integrity measures. It was obviously necessary to address that concern, but we are left wondering whether it was necessary to completely remove this provision from the bill. In many ways, we think removing that concept of reading or viewing, which obviously keeps pace with modern technology, has resulted in having potentially thrown the baby out with the bathwater.</para><para>Another departure from the approach in the earlier 2004 bill is that this bill no longer brings stored communications within the telecommunications interception regime, subject to the three exclusions I mentioned earlier, but rather excludes stored communications from the regime altogether. The only exception to this new principle is in the proposed new definition of `stored communication' itself, which brings within the telecommunications interception regime voice over Internet protocol and other communications `stored on a highly transitory basis as an integral function of the technology used in its transmission'. That technology is essentially using computers as another form of telephone communication, as I understand it.</para><para>Again, we recognise that these amendments will address the concerns raised by the AFP, in that there no longer appears to be a conflict with section 3L of the Crimes Act nor any requirement that an email must have been accessed by its recipient before a copy is accessed on an ISP server. However, the alternative approach in this bill does raise some unanswered questions. For example, how exactly did the Attorney-General's Department and the Australian Federal Police resolve their competing legal interpretations of section 3L of the Crimes Act? Did they agree to disagree about the existing position and instead agree to wind back the telecommunications interception regime to remove any potential obligation to seek a warrant in connection with remote access of the kind contemplated in section 3L? Again, this was the remote access to information contained on a computer to which I have referred. That is one interpretation of what has happened, but the government's statements to date leave considerable room for speculation about exactly what agreement the AFP and the department have reached and whether they have effectively wound back the clock as a result of an inability to reach an agreement that resolves the actual point of difference between them.</para><para>Moreover, it must be asked what the broader consequences are of the approach proposed in the bill. Essentially, as I say, removing the concept of protecting from interception communications which can be read or viewed creates its own questions. For example, it has been put to us and, I understand, to the government that one consequence of the amendments is to enable network owners or administrators, which would include telecommunications carriers and their employees, to freely access customers' electronic communications passing over their network, once they meet the definition of stored communications. In other words, this would be something akin to a post-office worker seeing a postcard coming through the mail exchange and having the ability to access and read that communication. I think that would be of concern to most senders and potential recipients of that information. These are issues of substance and concern, and we believe they should be looked at.</para><para>For these reasons, we do believe it is desirable for the bill to be re-examined by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. The familiarity of the committee and the relevant stakeholders with the issues should reduce the amount of time needed to conduct any inquiry. These issues are of substance. In the meantime, we will not oppose the bill being given a second reading in this House. We acknowledge that the amendments will be sunsetted after 12 months, pending a more comprehensive review of the act, which we welcome. But we are determined to ensure that, in this important and sensitive area, parliament is entirely clear about the consequences of any legislation we put in placeâeven if it is for a period of only 12 months. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>30769</page.no><name role="metadata">Neville, Paul, MP</name><name role="display">Mr NEVILLE</name><name.id>KV5</name.id><electorate>Hinkler</electorate><party>NATS</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWe live in the age of technology. Virtually every daily activity involves machinery, computers, telecommunications enhancements and the like. The <inline ref="R2061">Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment (Stored Communications) Bill 2004</inline> will rebalance our law and order needs with the ever-increasing pace of communications technology. We must be responsive, if not proactive, in the matter of changing communications technologies, and the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment (Stored Communications) Bill 2004 addresses that need.</para></talk.start><para>There is no question that, since the act was originally enacted in 1979, our methods of communicating and contacting each other have changed dramatically. At the time of its commencement, the act only needed to cover `live' communicationsâthat is, messages which we pass to each other through a regular telecommunications system, such as telephone calls, telexes et cetera. The matter of accessing stored electronic communications was not relevant to that era. But, as any of us who carry a mobile telephone, pager or palm pilot know, those days are long gone.</para><para>Rather than having to rely solely on landline telephones and telexes, we now use email, text messaging, picture messaging and paging on a regular basis, with increasing frequency. A never-ending stream of communication is taking place 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Aside from changing our work environment and social interaction, this technology has ever-widening implications for national security. These days it is easy to create an email account or fire off a text message on a mobile phone, and it is therefore relatively simple to coordinate actions and activities without actually having physically to meet those with whom we are participating.</para><para>If this technology is turned against us as citizens then it is vital that our law enforcement agencies have the tools to deal with the new methods of compiling, sending and storing information. Under the current legislation the interception of stored communications is prohibited. This government is seeking to amend the law and in effect close a loophole for criminal activity. The intent of the original bill was to protect `live' communications in the process of transmission via a communications system, and in practical terms those arrangements will still stand. The amendments contained in the bill continue the prohibition of interception of real-time communications without an interception warrant. However, communications that have been stored on equipment will be excluded from the scope of the act because as technology changes so must our laws.</para><para>Modern-day communications technology allows us to draft, edit, write and store messages and information before sending them to a recipient. We can send messages to one recipient or a number of recipients. We can recall messages after transmission and we can edit messages once they have been received. We can forward received messages to other recipients. We can store them in an inbox for an indefinite period and we can print them out for hard copy storage. Quite obviously, as technology progresses in leaps and bounds, our legislation must try to keep pace. The sheer scope of modern-day communications and the method of their transmission is mind-boggling and understandably very difficult for our law enforcement agencies to track.</para><para>This bill is not seeking to eavesdrop on our communications, but it will give our law enforcement agencies the power to access stored communications in whatever form that might be. There is a sunset clause attached to these amendments, so they will cease to have effect 12 months after their commencement, and a telecommunications interception warrant or other right of access will still be necessary to access messages, whether stored or in transit. This amendment also empowers law enforcement officers who have the consent of the intended recipient of a message or the owner of the device on which a message is stored to intercept a communication without having a telecommunications interception warrant. The owners or administrators of a communications network will also be able to access stored messages. </para><para>To stay in step with changing technology and modes of communications, these amendments will extend the time line of legal interception to include messages which have been drafted and stored but not sent, as well as messages that are in the process of being sent and those that have been received. Accessing short message service messages, otherwise known as SMS or text messaging, and multimedia messaging service messages, or MMS, will still require a telecommunications interception warrant for live or real-time interceptions because of their fleeting nature.</para><para>I have a reasonably clear understanding of the basis of this legislation, given that a seminal event in telecommunications interception took place in Bundaberg earlier this year. A trial in Bundaberg for attempted murder, which of course revolved around proving intent, hinged on the Crown being able to provide stored text messages as evidence against the accused. An extraordinary manuscript of more than 2,500 text messages sent over a six-week period was one of the crucial pieces of evidence produced during the trial. Without going into the detail of the court proceedings, stored mobile telephone text messages from the mobile telephone of the accused showed that she colluded to murder an individual in late 2001. The Crown prosecutor in the case provided jury members with print-outs of the full SMS conversations between the defendants and told the jury that the accused and her codefendant were prolific texters. The prosecutor said:</para><quote><para>The devil is in the detail, it is in the detail the plan fell apart ... The transparency of evidence is almost comical.</para></quote><para>He then went on to say that the accused's habit of sending text messages was her `fatal mistake'.</para><para>This is not an isolated case. In Sweden police and prosecutors used text messages to prove that a nanny influenced by a pastor of a religious sect shot and killed the pastor's wife while she slept and then killed a neighbour next door with whom she was alleged to be having an affair. And police in southern Japan are examining email and text messages as part of an investigation into the recent box-cutter killing of a 12-year-old girl, allegedly by an 11-year-old classmate.</para><para>The Bundaberg trial undoubtedly brought the issue of stored communications into focus for the use of the nation and in turn has sparked various privacy concerns. Telstra's privacy policies state that the company can disclose personal information to government or regulatory authorities as required or authorised by law enforcement authorities, but never before have law enforcement agencies been able to access the content that has been stored. These amendments are being put in place to clarify the powers of law enforcement agencies and to give guidance to the carrier services which provide the technology.</para><para>The government also recognises that the entire communications technology phenomenon has wider implications for law enforcement and matters of public safety, so the Attorney-General's Department will undertake a thorough review of the Telecommunications Interception Act at the expiration of the amendment. Of course, privacy concerns are at the forefront of any legislation which impacts on personal communications, but I ask you: what price a human life? We do have to make compromises. </para><para>In the Bundaberg instance, a vicious attack was planned with the help of new technology, and justice was delivered with the help of new technology. In the wake of the trial, in which the text messages contributed to a finding of guilty, the Privacy Commissioner called for telecommunications companies to make their customers aware that text messages may be stored for a length of time. Media coverage provided some degree of information to the general public immediately after the trial, but I urge telecommunications carriers to keep customers informed about their system of communications storage as well as any future changes that are contemplated.</para><para>Up until the time of the Bundaberg trial, Telstra reportedly kept SMS messages sent between Telstra mobile phones for up to 28 days. Optus has reported that it only keeps full text messages for three days, while Vodafone has put it on the record that it does not store the content of any telephone calls, text messages or picture messages. Interestingly, text messages sent on the Telstra network at the time of the Bundaberg incident were stored as part of the billing process. The originating telephone number was contained within the message and therefore the message itself was kept. The company now operates under new guidelines, keeping text message details for only 24 hours after they have been sent before they are wiped from the system. I have already given an example of where interception of stored communications has delivered justice for a victim of violence, but the legislation undoubtedly has implications for national security as well. Given the dreadful terrorist atrocities which occur on an almost daily basis throughout the world, these amendments are relevant and necessary and it is in that spirit that I commend the bill to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>30771</page.no><name role="metadata">Organ, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ORGAN</name><name.id>BNL</name.id><electorate>Cunningham</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI welcome the opportunity to speak against the <inline ref="R2061">Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment (Stored Communications) Bill 2004</inline>. The Attorney-General told us in his second reading speech that the amendments address the practical implications of modern technology for access by law enforcement and regulatory agencies by excluding access to stored communications from the current prohibition against interception of communications.</para></talk.start><para>The explanatory memorandum to this bill is written in such convoluted language that it is nigh on impossible for a non-lawyer to make any sense of it, but it is pretty obviousâeven to my non-legal eyeâthat it is another run around the track on a subject where the government has already been rebuffed twice. Fortunately, I have been able to take advice from Electronic Frontiers Australiaâand I have to tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that they are not happy. Electronic Frontiers Australia Inc., or EFA, is a non-profit national organisation representing Internet users that is concerned with online freedoms and rights. EFA was established in January 1994 and incorporated under the Associations Incorporation Act in May 1994.</para><para>As I have said, EFA are not happy with this bill, and I would like to bring some of their analysis to the attention of the House. The Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment (Stored Communications) Bill 2004, introduced in this place on 27 May 2004, is the Commonwealth government's third attempt since early 2002 to amend the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 in relation to email, SMS and voice mail messages. The first bill, introduced in March 2002, sought to remove the protection from interception for delayed access messages. Those provisions were deleted by the government when it became clear they did not have sufficient support in the Senate. The second bill, introduced in February 2004, sought to increase the protection for delayed access messages. Those provisions were deleted due to disagreement between the Attorney-General's Department, relying on the opinion of the Solicitor-General, and the Australian Federal Police, relying on the opinion of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, concerning the correct interpretation of the law. </para><para>The third bill currently before us, introduced in May 2004, not only reverts to substantially the same proposal as was rejected in 2002 but would remove even more of the existing protections from interception than the 2002 bill would have. The bill would inappropriately change the long-established balance in telecommunications interception law between individuals' rights to privacy and the needs of law enforcement agencies. We have just heard from the member for Hinkler about some of the uses that law enforcement agencies are able to make from some of these electronic messages.</para><para>Under current law, an interception warrant is required to access the contents of email, SMS and voice mail messages that are temporarily delayed and stored during passage over the telecommunications systemâfor example, stored on an Internet service provider's or telephone service provider's equipment, pending delivery to the intended recipient. This is the same as is required to intercept a telephone call. The bill before us would remove the existing protection from interception for email, SMS and other voice mail messages that have not been delivered to the intended recipient, thereby allowing government agencies and not only the police but also private investigation agencies, telephone companies, ISPs and other businesses to access such communications without a warrant of any type. Although the government frequently cites enthusiasm for technology-neutral laws, this bill is certainly not that. It treats email, SMS and voice mail telecommunications quite differently from facsimile and telephone call telecommunications.</para><para>The effect of the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment (Stored Communications) Bill 2004 is substantially the same as the rejected provisions in the 2002 bill. However, this bill would make access to undelivered communications even more easily available to law enforcement agencies than did the 2002 proposal because it completely removes stored communications from the scope of the Telecommunications Interception Act. In addition, the bill would see access being made available to other people, including private investigation agencies, telephone companies, Internet service providers and other businesses.</para><para>The Attorney-General's media release of 27 May 2004 states: </para><quote><para>...the amendments will enable access to stored communications, such as email and voicemail, without a telecommunications interception warrant.</para><para>The amendments will allow access to stored communications under other forms of lawful authority, such as a search warrant.</para></quote><para>The same was said about the 2002 bill. For example, on 19 April 2002, the Attorney-General's Department informed the Senate committee hearing that agencies would be permitted to access stored communications under some other lawful authority like a search warrant. </para><para>The Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment (Stored Communications) Bill 2004, like the 2002 bill, would remove the need for an interception warrant to access the content of communications temporarily delayed and stored on a telecommunication service provider's equipment during transit. As a result, access to undelivered email, voice mail, SMS messages et cetera would become available not only with a search warrant but also without a warrant of any type. That must be cause for concern. The Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment (Stored Communications) Bill 2004 should therefore be abandoned. Frankly, it is a disgrace. It is the type of legislation one might expect to see in a police state, not a democracy. Some of the reasons for that have been outlined above. </para><para>In addition to those matters raised earlier, the bill fails to recognise that interception of communications invades the privacy of third parties who have nothing to do with the police investigation. As I said, the previous speaker did give examples of where police investigations have been usedâfor example, the instance of compiling 2,500 SMSs over a six-week period and how that was used in a court case. I think this bill goes too far in that direction.</para><para>Allowing access without a warrant to the telecommunications of people who are not even suspected of engaging in a crime, or allowing access even with an ordinary search warrant designed for the searching of property, fails to give due regard to Australia's obligations as a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Article 17 of the covenant provides:</para><quote><para>(1) No-one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation.</para><para>(2) Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.</para></quote><para>You can see that the main element of that first covenant is that no-one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with their privacy. There is no doubt that access to some of these technologies and communications is invading people's privacy. As I said, we have heard details of how SMS messages have been used in a court case. SMS is widely used in the community at the moment. Mobile phone usage in Australia is, I think, reaching about 70 per cent penetration. There is talk that in a couple of years 100 per cent of Australians apparently are going to have mobile phones. People are using mobile phones for private communications. It is clear that to open this up to private investigation agencies and other agencies without any due consideration and without any due safeguards in place is really opening up a can of worms, and we should be very concerned about that.</para><para>Although the government claims the proposed amendments are urgent, it should be noted that this claim was also made when the 2002 bill was introduced in the package of antiterrorism bills. As we have seen recently, the government has claimed that a lot of the bills being brought before this House are urgent, yet we are given precious little time to consider them, especially in light of the so-called war against terrorism. As I said, similar claims were made when the 2002 bill was introduced in the package of antiterrorism bills. Nevertheless, after the 2002 stored communications provisions were rejected, the government did not introduce its next proposal until two years later. Clearly the amendments were not urgent in 2002, and no evidence has been put forward to demonstrate the amendments are urgent now. The existing act should remain in place unamended for the forthcoming 12 months, while the Attorney-General's Department conducts the announced full review of the interception regime.</para><para>Members of this place should take the time to read the full analysis of this bill, which is to be found on the web site of Electronic Frontiers Australia, www.efa.org.au. If they do take the time to look, I believe they will reach the same conclusion that I haveâthat is, the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment (Stored Information) Bill 2004 should be rejected. As has been pointed out, the Attorney-General's Department is looking to conduct a full review of the interception regimes in this country at the moment and there is no urgency in this bill before the House. </para><para>There is concern among organisations such as Electronic Frontiers, which is one of the peak community organisations in this area, that elements of this bill will open up a can of worms with regard to the invasion of privacy of ordinary Australians. I think we need to be very mindful of invading individuals' privacy in this country. It is becoming so much easier with the new digital technologies. As parliamentarians, we make great use of those technologies and we appreciate the importance of our individual privacy in the work we do. To open up some of these digital technologies to investigation by private organisations and by private investigators, I think is real cause for concern. It is something about which we should tread very warily. </para><para>I call on the government to withdraw this bill and to give more detailed consideration to the review by the Attorney-General's Department of the interception regimes operating in Australia at the moment so that this bill and others of a similar nature can be reconsidered, rather than pushing it through at this point in time, rather than calling it an urgent bill and rather than trampling on the rights and freedoms of Australians. We have to preserve and protect our privacy. As Electronic Frontiers have said, there are real concerns with this bill. It will open up privacy to misuse and abuse, and it is not something which the Australian Greens could support at this point in time.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âOrder!

The Prime Minister will soon be making a major statement on this very important topic.</para></talk.start><para>It is an important issue, but it is certainly not going to be tackled by stunts masquerading as policy.

I know that she represents very ably many naval personnel who live in her electorate, and they appreciate the strong support she gives them. HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Stuart</inline> has a ship's company of 175 personnel, and they are playing a vital role in coalition operations in the Iraq theatre. HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Stuart </inline>was deployed in April, primarily to conduct maritime security for Iraqi oil terminals and territorial waters and to prevent the smuggling of oil and illegal cargo. Indeed, the <inline font-style="italic">Stuart</inline> has had boarding parties on 30 different vessels and has questioned another 278 vessels since it has been in the area of operation. Significantly, HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Stuart</inline> assisted with the evacuation of injured United States service personnel during a foiled terrorist attack on the Basra oil terminal in April. The <inline font-style="italic">Stuart</inline>'s role, I might remind the House, is anything but symbolic. The Leader of the Opposition says that the presence of our troops in Iraqâhalf of whom he now wishes to keep thereâis nothing but symbolic. There is no doubt about the value of that ship in the operation.</para></talk.start><para>The Leader of the Opposition has been telling the Australian people that if he is elected as the Prime Minister of Australia he will have the troops home by Christmas. Of course, now we knowâas a result of the events of the last weekâthat this is not true. Some of those troops will remain in Iraq, but they will be stranded by Christmas because the support of the C130s will have gone. It is now apparent that HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Stuart</inline> would also be left in the Persian Gulf by the Labor government. Senator Evans, the Labor spokesman on defence, said, `Labor supports the deployment of HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Stuart</inline> but makes a distinction between the ongoing war against terrorism and the postwar environment in Iraq.' So this is another shambles of a policy. The Labor Party says that the HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Stuart </inline>will remain in the Persian Gulf and that it will help with the war against terrorismâbut only if the terrorists are not targeting Iraqi targets. Just imagine how utterly foolish that policy is. If terrorists are targeting Kuwaiti targets, or Iranian targets, or targets in Dubai or the United Arab Emirates, then HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Stuart </inline>can be used; but if the terrorists go to Um Qasr or Basra, then HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Stuart</inline> cannot be used! </para><para>This again illustrates the simple absurdity of the Labor Party's muddle-headed `troops home by Christmas' policy. The Leader of the Opposition owes it to the parliament and to the country to make a statement explaining precisely what his policy really is, because at the moment it is a policy where he is telling the public one thingâtroops home by Christmasâand his spokesmen are going around telling another story. When this is raised with the Leader of the Opposition's office, they say, `We've been saying all these troops will remain, and we've been saying that since March.' Yet, if you go through the Leader of the Opposition's statements, and if you go through the transcripts of what he said, there is no sign of him saying he would keep any troops there after Christmas. The fact is that the Leader of the Opposition has been grossly misleading, and the Leader of the Opposition is way out of his depth on this important security issue.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Iraq: Treatment of Prisoners</title><page.no>30777</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>30777</page.no><name role="metadata">Rudd, Kevin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDD</name><name.id>83T</name.id><electorate>Griffith</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.

From 16 January until after the Abu Ghraib photographs were released, we heard not one word from the opposition.

This is despite the advice that Victoria has had from the Commonwealth that we would ensure that such a body had effective telephone interception powers which, it is believed, are an important resource for being able to investigate criminal activity of this sort. Instead of seeing that as a constructive comment, the acting Victorian Premier yesterday sought to denigrate me for the action I have taken, which has been clearly seen by most dispassionate observers as being a proper and legally sound position. If the acting Premier will not take my word, he ought to at least take the word of the honourable member for Barton.

Not in this year's budget but in last year's budget the government announced measures to reform Australia's international taxation arrangements. This was designed to encourage Australian companies to set up regional headquarters here, to improve Australia's attractiveness as a base for our own multinational companies and to make it possible for increased business and increased jobs here in Australia. Those measures passed the House of Representatives yesterday, and they passed with Labor support.</para></talk.start><para>I was a bit surprised, really, to read in today's <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> that the member for Kingston, who actually came and supported these measures and helped them wing their way through the House of Representatives, said that these were good measures but `a bare minimum'. He said that Labor wanted a debate on more fundamental reform, including dividend streaming and a tax credit for foreign dividends. The member for Kingston says that it is good as far as it goes but it should go furtherâwe should have cut more tax on the international arrangements. Behind his mild mannered exterior he would have you believe he is a veritable superman of fiscal restraint. `It's not a bird, it's not a plane; it's Superman, the member for Kingston!'</para><para>Why was I so surprised by all of this veritable superman fiscal restraint that was being talked about down here in the House of Representatives yesterday?

So tax less, spend more, invest it away for the future and have it left at the end of the dayâand it is the same $270 million! It is the most amazing piece of creative accounting that I have ever seen in my life. </para><para>I know of only one authority for Labor economicsâNorman Lindsay, in his book <inline font-style="italic">The Magic Pudding</inline>: `cut and come again'.

Walk the right-hand side of the street, walk the left-hand side of the street, walk down no street and, if you are the member for Hotham, hide five blocks away and do not engage in the argument at all.

But, seeing that the Leader of the Opposition has invited me to compare the coalition's approach to this issue with the approach adopted by the Australian Labor Party, I do so with some enthusiasm. I have to say that his proposal to impose an arbitrary, draconian and sweeping ban on advertising in not only child-specific television programs but also general television programs where predominantly the audience is likely to be children is one of the more ham-fisted, ill-conceived policies that any leader of a political party has produced in recent months. It bears all the hallmarks of something dreamt up for the 6 p.m. news bulletin without any sort of design and without any regard for the fundamentals of life.

Of course the government has a responsibility in relation to obesity programs, the community has a responsibility, the doctors have a responsibility and commercial interests have a responsibility. But, at the end of the day, if we are going to build a really healthy society where families are the dominant influence in shaping the young, we do not take responsibility away from mothers and fathers; we back their responsibility. We do not say to them, `Don't you worry; the government will take over your monitoring role and your role to set an example.' </para><para>What the Leader of the Opposition is propounding is a charter for a retreat by parents from their responsibilities in relation to their children.

How often have I said to beware of the ALP web site and to get the original text before it gets airbrushed out of existence? I am going to table that as well. It is a pretty simple proposition, isn't it? If Commonwealth expenditures can be cut by $8 billion and there is a list of how it can be done, why can't the public look at it? The public have been told that all of these promises can be funded from these savings, so why can't the public look at it?</para><para>In addition, I will make another point. It is not just the savings that have to be paid for with this nonexistent $8 billion, on a list which does not exist in a transcript which has been airbrushed; we also have to find a tax policy out of this. And we knowâdon't we?âthat it is going to be a wide and broad tax policy, with tax cuts for everybodyâand not small amounts. It is going to have tax cuts because the Leader of the Opposition promised that also in the budget week. I do not know whether I put onto the record yesterday the transcript from the Jon Faine programâthe transcript of 28 April 2004, when we were going to find out in budget week the thresholds and amounts of the ALP tax policyâbut I do have it and I would like to put that down as well.</para><para>What is happening here is this: the Labor Party has made a whole lot of promises that it cannot keep, the Labor Party has no ability whatsoever to fund the promises that it already has on the record and the Labor Party is now running scared. The Leader of the Opposition counts down every single day until the ending of a parliamentary week and says to himself, `If I have distracted the press on some issue, that is one more day that I have escaped scrutiny.' The stuff of politics is about scrutiny and it is about policy. It is about making choices and it is about coming clean with the Australian people. The Australian people will not be taking this opposition leader seriously until such time as he can put down a policy, show that he has some substance and put himself out for scrutiny by the Australian people.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Sport</title><page.no>30783</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>30783</page.no><name role="metadata">Latham, Mark, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LATHAM</name><name.id>K26</name.id><electorate>Werriwa</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is to the Prime Minister.

When Paul Keating was Prime Minister of Australia, he really created a culture in which young people were told that if they did not go to university they were not as good as somebody else who did, and that is something that has been carried on very strongly by the Australian Labor Party, reflected by the amount of attentionâor lack of attentionâgiven in this House by the other side to apprenticeships and training. There are now 407,000 Australians who are doing apprenticeships, a 10 per cent increase on last year; and 1.3 million Australians who are in TAFEs throughout the length and breadth of Australia.</para></talk.start><para>It is interesting that across Australia last year we had increases in TAFE fees. TAFE fees are set by state and territory governments. In the state of New South Wales, for example, TAFE fees increased on average by 95 per cent in last year's state budget, but they increased by up to 300 per cent across New South Wales. In Victoria, the Victorian government increased TAFE fees by 25 per cent. In South Australia, TAFE fees for apprentices increased by 50 per cent. Unlike university students, who have access to HECS, where they do not pay their bit back until they are working and can pay it back through the tax system, students who go to TAFE have to pay their fees up front, and they often have to pull out the family credit card to do so. In fact, a quarter of the people who go to TAFE in Australia come from the poorest socioeconomic status suburbs in the country.</para><para>I asked my department to do some analysis and engage some work to find out what might be the impact of these substantialâin some cases, way over the topâTAFE fee increases across Australia. My department engaged a firm called Access Economicsâwhich would be very well known to the Leader of the Oppositionâto do some work upon the impact of these TAFE fee increases on the demand for TAFE across Australia. In fact, Access Economics has found that over the next three years 100,000 Australians, most of them young Australians, will not be going to TAFE, as a direct result of these fee increases across Australia. It is absolutely shameful. In the state of New South Wales alone this yearâthat is 2004âthere are some 24,000 people who will not go to TAFE, and 6,500 in Victoria.</para><para>I take the House back to 24 July 2003. Speaking on 2UE's Steve Price program, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Jagajaga, received a call from a bloke called Andrew. He said: `I've just got a concern. I'm currently enrolled at a TAFE in Western Sydney. Our fees at the moment are $710 a year. I'm doing an advanced diploma and we've been told yesterday those fees will go up to $1,200 next year. I'm pretty concerned and our teachers are very concerned.'</para><para>The Deputy Leader of the Opposition's reply was this. She said: `I agree with you, Andrew. It is really important that we don't get those fees at TAFE making people avoid going to TAFE. I couldn't agree with you more.' I could not agree with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition more. Access Economics cannot agree with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition more. The fact is that I and the Prime Minister have repeatedly called on the Australian Labor Party and the Leader of the Opposition to do somethingâto get off his backside and speak to the premiers across Australia about doing something about the magnitude of these fee increases. </para><para>In order to help the Leader of the Opposition, I have drafted a joint letter from me as Australia's Minister for Education, Science and Training and from the Leader of the Opposition.

If they want to go to Blacktown, they are paying 200 per cent more to do brake repairs and 300 per cent more to do tourism.

We are constantly looking for ways to try to reduce the red tape burden on small business. It is therefore unfortunate that the Labor Party has a different view. As we know, the Labor Party has a view that all small businesses have to have four BASs a year. The Labor Party has a view that all small businessesâand businesses generally and farmsâhave to fill out diesel fuel rebate forms, and we are abolishing those.</para><para>In Victoria the state government has introduced the Child Employment Bill. Some of its intentions are worthyâI think everyone would agree with thatâbut there are some so-called unintended consequences which clearly illustrate that the Labor Party does not understand either families or family businesses. For example, under this new law, grandparents must get a permit before their grandchildren are allowed to work on the family farm, to work in a family shop or even to help out with grandma's weeding in the garden. Under the Labor Party's law in Victoria grandma now has to get a permit to have a grandchild work around the house.</para><para>It goes further. Aunts and uncles running a family farm have to get a police check and a permit before they offer a job to a niece or a nephew. You might ask, `What is the impact of that? What happens if someone is looking for a helping hand in a sudden situation?' In the course of a drought, if a next-door neighbour is looking for a helping hand, they have to have a police check and a permit before they can offer any form of paid employment to a younger person. So do not ask your kids to go and collect the eggs from the chook shed or help out feeding the cattle, because under this arrangement any voluntary work by anyone under the age of 13 around the house is not permitted.</para><para>This is red tape gone wrong. What it clearly illustrates is that the Labor Party believes that families have no sense of regulation about their own services and that the government has to regulate all family activities. If you ask your kids to go out and collect the newspapers or to bring in the garbage and you give them a couple of bucks for it, you are meant to supervise them, or you cannot engage them in that work with a police permit.

The simple reason is $40 million. Forty million dollars is the amount of money that the Australian unions have donated to the Australian Labor Party over the last seven years. We have a conflict of interest here with the union arm of the Australian Labor Party who, in return for their $40 million worth of donations to the Australian Labor Party, are demanding that Australian workplace agreements be abolished. They are demanding that the ability of employers and employees in Australia to enter into an agreement of choice be abolished and taken out of the statutes and the codes so far as Australia is concerned.</para><para>There can be only one reason for this, and that is a pure ideological hatred of Australian workplace agreements and the fact that employers and employees in this country, in numbers increasing by thousands each month, can enter into agreements where there is one party that is excluded from those agreements.

In return for their $40 million of donations from the big unions the Australian Labor Party are saying that this ability of employers and employees to actually choose the sort of employment agreement that they want is something which they will not allow.</para><para>What the Leader of the Opposition wants is a return to a regressive systemâa one-size-fits-all systemâwhere you give the Australian Industrial Relations Commission increased powers to arbitrate, where you extend the number of matters under awards; you drive jobs down and investment in Australian businesses out, because you have this regressive system which the Australian Labor Party is planning to put in place. The Latham Labor Party ought to wake up to how regressive this is for jobs and for investment in Australia.

It is a very serious issueâan issue which impacts on something like 30 per cent of Australian children and, looking around the chamber, clearly many of us, as adults, also face this issue on an ongoing basis in our everyday life.</para></talk.start><para>One of the interesting things today was question time. There comes a time in a government where you really get a sense that they are not quite sure of where they are up to anymore. You get it through the arrogance of the answers and through the lack of answers. What we saw today with this particular issueâwhich is a very serious public health issueâwas an example of a government showing that arrogance. I will go to the question of the Minister for Health and Ageing later. The Prime Minister basically refused to answer the questions that were put forward; he refused to treat the issue, in my view, seriously; he refused to engage; and he refused offers of bipartisanship on what is, as I have said, a very serious issue.</para><para>Obesity is without doubt one of the major health crises affecting Australia, with around 30 per cent of Australian children currently estimated to be overweight or obese. According to an article published in the <inline font-style="italic">Medical Journal of Australia</inline> in 2001, the childhood obesity rate in Australia is now one of the highest in the world. A later report by the same researchers published in 2003 in the <inline font-style="italic">Journal of Obesity Related Metabolic Disorders</inline> showed that a child who is overweight or obese has about an 80 per cent chance of being overweight at age 20. Some experts believe that the prevalence of obesity in our adult population has reached epidemic proportions. In 2000, 67.5 per cent of adult men and 50.7 per cent of adult women were classified as overweight or obese. </para><para>This problem does not just affect Australians; we know it is an international problem of real significance. In May 2004 the United Nations Health Agency agreed to launch a global campaign against obesity, blaming obesity for an increase in deadly chronic diseases worldwide. The Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health was approved by the annual assembly of the UN's World Health Organisation. The plan, which is currently under negotiation, calls on governments to work with consumer groups on issues like food labelling and advertising. According to the World Heart Foundation, 1.1 billion adults and 22 million children under age five are obese. The problem of overeating or poor eating habits is replacing malnutrition as a health problem in many developing nations. Diseases linked to unhealthy diet and lack of exercise account for nearly 60 per cent of the 56.5 million deaths a year around the world that are deemed to be preventible.</para><para>While these are big figures, what do they mean for children who are obese or overweight? There are a range of health and other consequences for people in those circumstances. They can be psychosocial, leading to social isolation and discrimination, poor self-esteem and depression, learning difficulties and longer term poorer social and economic success. There are physical and medical problems in childhood, such as orthopaedic problems, back pain, flat feet, slip growth plates in hips, knock-knees, fatty liver, type 2 adult diabetes, menstrual problems, asthma, and obstructive sleep apnoea. As we can see, it is a very serious issue. </para><para>So what has this government done on this issue? In question time, the Minister for Health and Ageing came up with, I thought, three initiatives. He mentioned $4.3 million for an Active Script program to encourage doctors to ensure that proper decisions are taken and advice given to people who are overweight and obese; $9.1 million in NHMRC research into the area; and almost $1 million in the walk to school, walk to work program. That is basically all he mentioned; that is all that he had. There is little bit more that the government has done, and we know there is some more being proposed; I will just go to that, though, for the moment.</para><para>It is some 10 years since the World Health Organisation made the point that we are dealing with a global problem, and it has taken a large part of that time for the penny to drop with this government and for them to do something about it. They established the National Obesity Taskforce in November 2002 and then effectively used that as a reason not to take any action. When their report came down, <inline font-style="italic">Healthy weight 2008: Australia's future</inline>, released in November 2003, the minister had this to say in response:</para><quote><para>The Australian Government is concerned about the declining levels of activity and exercise among Australian children and the amount of high energy food they eat.</para><para>Today I am launching a national website that will provide practical advice and encouragement for families and young people to be more physically active and lead healthier lives.</para></quote><para>It is a web site. That is something that the minister forgot to mention. He spent a good deal of time later in question time talking about web sitesâhe obviously spends a fair bit of time surfing the Net. But the bottom line here is: we have got a government that really has not done that much. It is a government that basically only tends to act on serious issues when it can see an election down the track. We have a lot of debate in this country about the question of how long a term should be, and there is often talk that we should move to a four-year term. However, this is a government that ought to be on a one-year term, because it is only in the last 12 months leading up to an election that it has done anything. It needs that one-year term in order to ensure that some action is taken, and in this area we are seeing it again.</para><para>In terms of the government's new plan, which was outlined in part by the Leader of the Opposition in question time and which was largely ignored by the Prime Minister, we are seeing an initiative which has some good parts to it and it is something that I think is well worthy of support. But there are a couple of key points to it that were made by the Leader of the Opposition that need to be remembered. The first point is: it was meant to be a bipartisan initiative. This initiative, which came out of the codes themselves, was supposed to be about both sides of politics getting behind an important initiative for the good of the country. Yet what have we heard about this project? What have we heard about this initiative that has been under consideration for quite some time now? We have not heard anything from the governmentânot a word; nothing. What we have heard has been from other sources. The bottom line is that the government is not prepared to engage, talk or to be bipartisan because, as far as it is concerned, it is election mode time and it is going to use that issue and squeeze it for all it can. We all know how often the Prime Minister likes to get pictured with sporting stars or actorsâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LS4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Martin Ferguson</name></talker><para>âOr with his rugby scarf on.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>VU5</name.id><name role="metadata">Griffin, Alan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GRIFFIN</name></talker><para>âWith his rugby scarf, the works.

The other point about all that is: why is it taking so long for this initiative to come forward, because we know it has been under consideration for some time? Why was it not out around the time of the budget, because we certainly believed that that was when things were supposed to be happening? It is very simple. The reason it was not out at the time of the budget, the reason why it was not brought in earlier, is that it is another one of those late in the term initiatives that this government is so fond of when dealing with issues in a public contextâand that is criminal. It is criminal because this is an issue about our children. It is criminal because it is a concern which relates to our own kids. It is something that ought to be up and running much sooner rather than later. The government ought to be condemned for acting in such a partisan political manner in these circumstances.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Unlike this government, we have had a plan out there for some timeâsince last year. It is a plan that realises that this is not a simple issue. This is a complex plan which requires a range of initiatives across a range of areas. The most recent announcement with respect to that is the ban on junk food advertising during children's television viewing times. However, to remind the House, we had something like $25 million of proposals announced late last year, including $500,000 to implement pilot student wellbeing programs for school students in disadvantaged communities; $2.5 million for a national nutrition education framework; $2 million for a school physical activity national task force; $2 million to develop and implement national school canteen food guidelines; $2.5 million for a national active life media campaign; $500,000 to establish an obesity action alliance. So that is proof that we have been looking at this issue for some time, that we have made the announcements, that we have got the policy out there, that the policy is comprehensive and it goes across a range of areas. It is a policy which has been endorsed by many people and many organisations in the public sphere.</para><para>On the issue of the junk food ad ban in the last couple of days, a number of points need to be made. We have had the Prime Minister standing up here basically dismissing it, condemning it and taking the view that this is an initiative about introducing a nanny state. I remind you of his words. He said:</para><quote><para>The question of what children eat is ultimately the responsibility of their parents, and it is about time that the Leader of the Opposition stood up for parental responsibility instead of trying to throw everything over to the government ... I think governments have to be very reluctant to embrace too willingly the nanny state in banning this, that or the other. We will never build a nation of independent, proud, self-reliant people until we reinforceâindeed reviveâthe notion of parental responsibility for their children.</para></quote><para>The Coalition on Food Advertising to Children, a group of organisations which have a real, abiding interest in and understanding of these issues, made a number of points with respect to Labor's policy and the comments from John Howard. I quote from their statement: </para><quote><para>It is clearly not a simple strategy or it would have been done a long time ago. It is instead a strong and forceful measure that says that industries are not allowed to profit at the expense of children's health. It would show a government that is willing to put the long-term interests of our children's health in front of the interests of industries to make huge profits. A nanny state is where people's control is taken away from them; at the moment our children have no control about being bombarded by unhealthy junk food ads during their programs. So the commercial TV and advertising industries are in fact creating nanny states in this situation.</para><para>Yes, parents do have a responsibility to educate children about healthy eating, but so does TV food advertising have a responsibility, because it also is a significant source of education to children about what is good to eat. And at the present time, TV food advertising is very successfully educating our children to want to eat unhealthy foods that are contributing to childhood obesity. Parents need to be supported in their difficult role of educating children to make healthy food choices. A ban on TV food advertising to children would be a simplistic move if it were the only strategy we used to tackle childhood obesity.</para></quote><para>The fact of the matter is that there is a range of initiatives. That is what we have got: we have got a plan, and that plan will see some real improvements in this areaâand banning junk food advertising is a key part of what needs to be done. But we will not hear about that from the minister. He will probably drag up the old nanny state allegation. What about tobacco advertising? We banned tobacco advertising because of health concerns. Here you have got a situation where 30 per cent of children are overweight or obeseâand this government is doing nothing. All we have got is the minister yabbering away in the background.</para><para>The ban will be implementable and will work. This ban will include all food advertising, firstly, in order to prevent so-called junk food companies using healthy foods to continue to promote their brand names and, secondly, because policing bans on specific foods and potential loopholes mean that a blanket ban which excludes responsible health promotion messages is considered to be the only viable option. The capacity, through the ABA, to work out the banning with respect to general classified programs means that it is implementable, and the fact is that it is something which will be in the interests of our children. Today we saw from the government, in question time, that they have no interest in any of that. They say, `We have got an announcement coming down the track.' We know it is coming soon, because the election is coming.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

He is long on rhetoric and very short on facts. He gives me a good opportunity now on this MPI to outline some of the serious and complex issues around the issue of obesity, which faces Australian children in particular. He gives me an opportunity to outline some of the real causes of obesity rather than this simplistic silver bulletâyesterday's announcement about the ban on advertisingâwhich is more interested in getting a headline than in the health of children. He also gives me an opportunity to talk about some of the double standards that the ALP have quite conveniently adopted. More importantly, he gives me the opportunity to broaden the issueâa very serious issue. I think it is rather flippant that the opposition are trying to make a political issue out of this rather than trying to address the seriousness of childhood obesity.</para></talk.start><para>When we look at the issue of childhood obesity in Australia, we know that one in five children are overweight and we know that one in 10 children are classified as obese. This is a major health problem facing a generation of young children today. We know that if a child is putting on a large amount of weight early in life, it will set up a potential future chain reaction for diabetes type 2âwe have one of the highest rates in Australiaâcardiovascular problems, heart disease, asthma, and a whole range of other medical issues. But to say, as suggested by the ALP, that their $25 million program over four yearsâwhich they outlined at the beginning of the yearâplus a ban on advertising, is going to be the panacea is ridiculous. To say that this is going to be the silver bullet to solve a very complex issue is absolutely ridiculous, and it demonstrates that the Leader of the Opposition is more interested in a headline than in the health of Australian children.</para><para>To back up my point, the Leader of the Opposition has not once made reference in the parliament to the issue of banning advertising in his whole career since 1993, except for this week. It makes you wonder how committed he is to the health and welfare of Australian children. The idea of banning advertising is directly plagiarised from none other than the leader of the Labour Party in the United Kingdom, Tony Blair. This is the plagiarist at workâstraight onto the Internet, straight onto Google. As we heard in question time today, the Leader of the Opposition loves quoting, although he does not acknowledge it. He quotes from Bill Clinton, Dick Morris, even George W. Bush and, over the last few days, Tony Blair. That is where this latest policy stunt has come from. It is a straight lift from what is happening in the United Kingdom.</para><para>This is a very cynical wayâa ham-fisted attemptâto address a very complex issue. It is not good policy. Quite frankly, these are meaningless measures backed up by very little evidence. I would like to go to the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record, because this says it all. Last March the Leader of the Opposition said:</para><quote><para>We have become very much a sedentary society by watching too much TV, playing videos and computer games. </para></quote><para>I totally agree. He went on:</para><quote><para>We need children to be active, exercising and to be following sound dietary practices.</para></quote><para>There was not one mention of banning advertising. If we are to make a genuine attempt to tackle this significant health problem looming over our current generation and the next generation, we do not need this flippant, shallow policy response of banning advertising. </para><para>For goodness sake, the issue of obesity relates to about three factors. The first is diet. We know that young children, as well as adults, are consuming food which is high in fat, sugar and salt. A lot of that comes about through the time pressures that families are facing. We know that Australian children today are exercising less than our parents' generation or ours. Forty per cent of children do not participate in organised sport. And we know that the greatest factor for obesity is not what kids are watching on TV but the number of hours they spend sitting down watching TV, or playing video games on their computer screens. The single greatest influence on the health of Australian children is the sedentary lifestyle that we as parents allow our children to have.</para><para>The Prime Minister is spot on: if we are genuinely serious about this, whilst governments can play their part it is only a small part; the bulk of it comes down to the parents who are the guardians, the custodians, and have the responsibility of ensuring not only what their kids eat but when their kids exercise and how much time they spend at the computer screen or the TV. My argument is always this: so much of this is commonsense. Get the kids away from the PlayStation and out into the playground. Instead of driving down to the corner store, get out of the car and walk with your children to the corner store. Show a bit of parental discipline on the number of hours they spend watching TV, just as my wife and I do. When my kids are home, they do not watch TV during the week.</para><para>The notion is that we are going to ban junk food advertising during the hours when children watch TV. What about all the other hours when children watch TV? What about the hours they spend watching pay TV or DVDs, as my kids do on the weekends, or the hours they spend watching computer screens and playing games? This is just ridiculous, because the policy does not work. In Holland they have one of the lowest rates of childhood obesity in Europe and they do not ban advertising, and nor do they in many other countries. It might sound sexyâit might sound like a nice thing to doâbut it does not work.</para><para>The central issue when it comes to the fight against obesity is parental responsibility. It is about parents taking control and having responsibility, rather than abdicating itâwhich seems to be the paradox which is coming out from the Leader of the Opposition. On the one hand, in previous speeches he has advocated having contracts on parents, being able to fine parents if they are irresponsible with their teenagers. On the other hand, with young childrenâwho are meant to be his raison d'etre for being in Australian politics; he has another flimsy policy, perhaps well-meaning, in the read aloud programâhe is saying he is going to solve the issues of childhood obesity by a $26 million program and by banning advertising. That is the Labor response. The government will be coming out with a response shortly and, interestingly, the response that we have been working on gives great consideration to consultation with a whole range of individuals. It is not policy on the run.</para><para>The idea of this ban on advertising is interesting. Almost all the state governmentsâLabor state governmentsâhave had numerous summits on the very important issue of childhood obesity. Interestingly, even in New South Wales, the home state of the Leader of the Opposition, they did not recommend the banning of junk food advertising, not because they had a philosophical position but because the facts are that it does not work.

The use of technology, while it has made our lives far more convenient, has also allowed more sedentary behaviour among children. We recognise that there is far more knowledge about asthma, about insulin dependent diabetes, about eating disorders. But again the central element is: who is actually the guardian, who is actually the person who has the parental responsibility to ensure that the child (a) gets proper exercise, (b) has adequate nutrition in their diet and (c) gets away from that sedentary lifestyle in which technology is used to a large degree as a substitute to keep our kids quiet?</para></talk.start></continue><para>This flimsy notion that advertising will be the silver bullet or that a $26 million campaign will solve all the problems of obesity is ludicrous. It is quite disappointing that the Labor Party have reduced the debate to this and are now calling for bipartisan support, when they are the ones who quite conveniently want to try and politicise this issue. Today in question time we asked for bipartisan support on TAFE fees and bipartisan support on more accountability of taxpayers moneyâlike the rip-off that is Centenary Houseâbut that was not good for them. What they are doing here is narrow banding. What they are doing is totally inconsistent. </para><para>Ultimately, if we are to get our kids to be healthierâto either put on less weight or overcome anorexia and loss of weight through thatâwe need more parent and community involvement. That is why I am delighted that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing, Trish Worth, recently went out to launch a program called the WellingTONNE Challenge. This was in the town of Wellington in New South Wales. It was all about building healthy communities. The community decided to come togetherâthey were not asking for a Big Brother approachâand have an initiative whereby they could set a target of losing one tonne. Everyone in that community got weighed in. The initiative was about being active, about better nutrition, about more sport and about a less sedentary lifestyle. That is a very good example of where a community of parents and families got involved to tackle this issue, rather than rely on the blunt instrument of government to try and solve their problems.</para><para>But there are many things the government is doing on the issue of obesity. As I said, 99 per cent of it comes down to parents. But there are things that government can do. The Minister for Health and Ageing has mentioned the Active Script program, the National Health and Medical Research Council and the walk to work and school initiative. They are small but very effective things. Again, they are all about healthy lifestyles. The major packageâa $365 million packageâthat I launched not so long ago, Stronger Families and Communities, has $110 million going towards communities for children in 35 sites round Australia. There is one in the electorate of the member for Werriwa, which will help thousands of children. I gather 17,000 people will be receiving family tax benefit in the electorate of the member for Werriwa.</para><para>In that program, 2,000 kids will be helped to improve their resilience to make them stronger and more independent. Part of that may be a nutrition program. Part of that might be an exercise program. That is up to the community to decide and come back to us. There is a very strategic, grassroots example of how a national program is being tailored to meet local needs to solve some of those local problemsâparticularly the issue of obesity.</para><para>We have a number of other initiatives. A lot of it is not down to money; it is down to communication. It is trying to get people to live healthier lifestyles. One of the first things I did when I became the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs was to ensure that we communicated with all those organisations that might be looking after children, particularly child-care centres. A lot of this is elementary stuff. It is about ensuring that our kids get off the couch and get out into the playground, ensuring that the dietary element is looked at and ensuring that education programs are looked at. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>30800</page.no><name role="metadata">King, Catherine, MP</name><name role="display">Ms KING</name><name.id>00AMR</name.id><electorate>Ballarat</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOur future generations are becoming more and more obese.

We on this side of the House would have been pretty surprised to hear him talking about health. Around 30 per cent of our children are currently estimated to be overweight or obese. This makes it one of the major health crises affecting Australia. This issue is not new. The member for Sydney and I debated this matter in a private members' motion almost over a year ago now. It is still sitting on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>. The issue is not new. But the government has been putting off doing anything about it until the eve of an election.</para></talk.start></continue><para>There are two major contributors to this problem of childhood obesity: poor dietary habits and inadequate levels of physical activity. Labor last year announced a comprehensive plan to tackle childhood obesity. Yesterday's announcement of a ban on junk food advertising complements that policy. It is part of a comprehensive approach to tackle childhood obesity. Where has the government been on this issue? Absolutely nowhere. This government's grasp of major public health issues and its lack of action until there is either a crisis or an election is well known. We wait with anticipation to see if we have once again got the minister to follow our lead and do what he is paid to do: develop health policy. From the details that have leaked so far it looks like it is going to fall way short. It looks more as though rather than responding to a major public health crisis they are jumping at an opportunity for an election policy.</para><para>Parents work really hard and do a great job raising their children. Despite the extra burdens of additional taxes, having to work two or three jobs and battling to make ends meet, parents do a great job providing for their children's physical and emotional requirements. Unfortunately, parents also have to battle another foe: television advertising. Television advertising that focuses on junk food specifically targets their children during the very time that children usually watch television. Australian studies show that 75 per cent to 80 per cent of foods advertised during television programs targeted specifically at children are for non-nutritious or unhealthy foods. A study of 13 OECD countries showed that Australia, at 12 per hour, had the highest number of television food advertisements during children's programming time of any country, including the US and the UK. So to compare us to Holland on this issue is simply wrong.</para><para>The only way to reverse the advertising assault on our children is to enforce a total ban on all food and drink advertising during all preschool and children's programming and during Gâgeneralâclassified programs. These programs are, as identified by the ABA, clearly aimed at children. That is why these companies advertise during them. We need to replace this advertising with community service announcements that send messages promoting healthy eating. If the government can spend $120 million on advertising to get itself re-elected, what is it willing to spend on a health promotion program? Our children need to make healthy food part of their lives, and we need to support our greatest resourceâparentsâin this challenge. </para><para>Again today the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Ageing, in response to a question from the Leader of the Opposition, dismissed the junk food advertising ban out of hand, arguing that it was a `nanny state' proposal and that a child's health and wellbeing are the sole responsibilities of its parents or guardians. We do not disagree with the fact that parents have responsibility for their children's upbringing. But, equally, governments have a responsibility to tackle public health issues. The Australian Consumers Association today congratulated Labor on its strong stand:</para><quote><para>Junk food advertising to children is by no means the sole cause of Australia's current obesity epidemic, and a ban on junk food advertising will never be the single solution. But children do need to be protected from the persuasive and unhealthy messages sent to them via TV food ads. Research shows that TV food ads influence children's food choices, and marketers know kids are easy targets.</para></quote><para>It went on to say:</para><quote><para>For Mr Howard to suggest that childhood obesity is purely the responsibility of parents is absurd and out of touch.</para></quote><para>As the caretakers of our next generation, we have responsibility to legislate for advertising changes that provide children with positive health messages and the knowledge and skills to put them into practice. We already legislate to protect the public from tobacco advertising and X-rated programs, because we rightfully acknowledge the danger to personal health and welfare. We knew that smoking and sport did not go together, despite the claims of tobacco advertisers in the 1980s. We know now that an unhealthy diet for our children does not go together with sport or other physical activities.</para><para>The second part of Labor's plan to assist children to lead healthy and productive lives is physical activity. It is a fact that this generation of children spend a lot of time watching television or sitting at desks playing computer games. We believe that children do love playing sport and would love to get out and be active if given the opportunity. That is the keyâif given the opportunity. We need to encourage children to be more active, but we need to do this in a much more proactive way. We need to provide financial support and resources to parents and community sporting organisations to help them take up the challenge. The current government's sport and recreation funding is skewed towards elite sport. They have defunded many local sporting associations. On this side of the House, we think that our sport funding should be focused on encouraging grassroots participation in sport, and that means assisting local sporting organisations.</para><para>The government is again up to its political tricks. We heard in question time today about the government's failure to respond to a request from national sporting bodies to tackle childhood obesity as a bipartisan program. What we have instead is the Prime Minister deferring a policy announcement on childhood obesity until he can get the time to appear with sporting heroes in an election-grabbing stunt. That is not good public health policy; it is election policy. But it is not the first time the government has been prepared to use sporting heroes to suit its own political ends, and I am sure the member for Ryan can tell us about that. </para><para>Providing a policy that tackles childhood obesity makes good economic sense. We need to direct more money towards creating an environment where people find it easier to eat well and to move more. We spend around two per cent of our total health budget on health promotion and preventing communicable diseases, cancers, cardiovascular disease and injury. This sees most of the remaining bulk of the health budget being spent on treatment of all diseases. It seems ludicrous that, in this day and age, with all of our resources, knowledge and research that allow us to prevent many diseases and injury, we spend only two per cent of our health budget actually doing so.</para><para>It has been estimated that the direct health costs of childhood obesity alone are around $830 million per year. Childhood obesity is estimated to be rising at about one per cent per yearâa trend which, if continued, will see half of all young Australians overweight by 2025. That will occur during our lifetimes. In providing progressive policy and resources to tackle childhood obesity, we are providing a future for 30 per cent of Australian children who are overweight or obese. We are not interested in stigmatising these children or blaming their parents. That will not help the situation at all. We are interested in saying to parents, `We understand the stresses and challenges that you face every day and we want to help you.' We are saying to children, `We believe that you are our greatest resource and you deserve a healthy, active and prosperous life.' We as a parliament are agreeing that we have a role to work alongside parents to help them in their task of bringing up healthy kids.</para><para>Labor believes that, in acknowledging the increased incidence of childhood obesity and committing to a policy that tackles the issues that lead to childhood obesity using tried public health approaches, we can reduce its incidence. The sad thing is that the government knows this as well but it fails time and time again to address major public health issues until those issues are either a political problem or a crisis. The health minister has been so busy sticking his nose into the relationship between parents and children in relation to medical records disclosure that he has failed to date to come up with adequate public health policies. We wait with anticipation to see if, once again, we have managed to drag him to actually do his job and to adopt Labor's policy to tackle childhood obesity.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>30803</page.no><name role="metadata">Hartsuyker, Luke, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HARTSUYKER</name><name.id>00AMM</name.id><electorate>Cowper</electorate><party>NATS</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI note with some interest the comments of the members opposite on the creation of the `nanny state', but I really believe that is all they are trying to do. From the rhetoric filled comfort zone of opposition, the opposition benches, they seek to make the government responsible for absolutely everything. Their proposal to ban fast food advertising meets the Labor Party's three-part test of policy. Firstly, you determine the policy by typing it into Google. What sort of policy do you get when you type the words `fast food' into Google? I have done it. I arrived at a rather interesting web site called `Fast Food Fever'âan absolute smorgasbord of delights with products such as chicken dogs and fry dogs. The list is endless. I might say that none of those is to be found on television.</para></talk.start><para>The second part of the Labor Party's guide to determining policy is: will it grab a cheap headline, will it be seen as a good stunt for the six o'clock news? Quite obviously, the answer to that is yes. The third test is: will it deflect public attention from Labor's lack of any real policy direction? Certainly, the answer to that too is yes. This latest stunt, this latest piece of Labor Party rhetoric to ban fast food advertising, is purely part of their three-part test and part of deflecting attention from the real issues that confront this country. The issue of childhood obesity is important. My parliamentary colleague the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs went into some detail on the important issues that surround childhood obesity. Banning fast food advertising is merely a simplistic approach to grab a quick headline. </para><para>We on this side of the House believe that the health of our children is an area in which governments have a role to play but that it is very much an area that should be addressed by families. Proper nutrition, adequate exercise and education are the keys to developing a healthy lifestyle for young children as they grow into healthy young adults. We believe the family is paramount in achieving healthy young Australians. This government supports families in doing just that. We do not need the Labor Party to legislate away fast food advertising to come up with a good diet for young children. The development of sensible measures, not media stunts, is what this government is about.</para><para>The Minister for Health and Ageing and the Prime Minister have noted that there are announcements to come on the issue of obesity. We will hear those in the near future. The government has done a great deal on childhood obesity. This government has provided $450,000 to Deakin University for a demonstration project on preventing obesity in children and adolescents. In the 2003-04 budget, this government provided $4.3 million over three years for the development of lifestyle scripts for GPs to manage obesity in children and adults. For walk safely to school and walk to work days, $750,000 was provided. These are good initiatives. The simple acts of walking more, driving less and getting the family out and going for a walk around the park can yield huge dividends in health outcomes.</para><para>Under the Department of the Environment and Heritage project, $2.4 million was provided for cycleways and cycling infrastructure. Getting people exercising on their pushbikes is another great move to keep away the problem of obesity. In the 1999-2000 budget, $15 million was announced for the development of national child nutrition programs. Also, $9.1 million was provided for NHMRC obesity related projects from 2000 to 2004 and $13.1 million was provided for Indigenous sport and recreation programs. It is good to see Indigenous Australians enjoying the outdoors and being involved in sport and recreation. Sport and recreation are major elements in controlling obesity. There was $11.53 million provided in 2002 for the Targeted Sports Participation Program.</para><para>These are sensible measures that do not involve knee-jerk reactions such as banning the television advertising of junk food. The ban is absolutely impractical. How do we define `junk food'? When does food become junk food? It is an interesting question. Is flavoured milk junk food? Are biscuits junk food? Is a milk arrowroot biscuit an acceptable food and a tim tam a junk food? How do we define it? Are we going to have a Labor Party committee of food police? I wonder who would make up that committee. The mind boggles as to who in the ALP would be chomping into the tim tams and the meat pies to determine what is junk food and what is health food. A meeting of the food police would be interesting.</para><para>Banning junk food advertising is a way of slugging the good old multinationals. The Labor Party wants to have a hit at those big bad multinationals that are destroying our way of life by making everybody fat. They are not making everybody fat; they are actually providing a product that people seek to buy and, if those products are eaten in moderation, it is totally appropriate. In fact I know the operator of the local McDonald's store in Coffs Harbour. He plays a very keen role in promoting and supporting amateur sport. We know the importance of regular exercise and appropriate diet. McDonald's support the nippers in Coffs Harbour, Woolgoolga and Sawtell. McDonald's are also major sponsors of junior basketball, which involves some 400 to 500 players in Coffs Harbour. McDonald's also sponsor junior soccer on the North Coast and in the New England district to the tune of $100,000. McHappy Day raised $1.2 million for charities, and $6,000 of that was raised in Coffs Harbour. </para><para>Fast food companies are not necessarily the demons in our economy. In many ways they are contributing to our health outcomes through sponsorship and support of junior sport. They contribute to charity. Organisations such as Ronald McDonald House are vitally important for people in regional and rural areas. It provides accommodation in Sydney, which is incredibly expensive for families that are unfortunate enough to have sick children. These are good activities that are carried out by these types of companies.</para><para>I think that fast food advertisers are just a convenient target for a party that is seeking nothing more than a cheap, populist hit. If the Labor Party are really serious about this policy, what are they going to do about web sites? I refer to the web site I looked at earlier, Fast Food Feverâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AN1</name.id><name role="metadata">Cobb, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr John Cobb</name></talker><para>âIt is changed pretty often.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AMM</name.id><name role="metadata">Hartsuyker, Luke, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HARTSUYKER</name></talker><para>âThat is right, the airbrush could be out there.

Oscar the Grouch lives in a garbage can, and that is not representing appropriate hygiene standards.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I believe this policy is ill conceived. The government believe that government has a role to play in the issue of childhood obesity, but we believe that the family has an even more important role to play in equipping young children with the values of proper diet, in teaching them the benefits of a balanced diet. Fast food is fine when eaten in moderation, and it is up to families I believe to take the lead in advocating the benefits of a balanced diet, in advocating the benefits of regular exercise and in coming up with a setting that gets that right for our young people so that they get that balance of exercise and good food and grow up to be young Australians who can contribute to this country. I think that the ban on TV advertising is nothing but a cheap stunt to attract attention away from the opposition's lack of real policies in so many areas.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>30805</page.no><name role="metadata">Organ, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ORGAN</name><name.id>BNL</name.id><electorate>Cunningham</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI welcome the opportunity to speak on the matter of public importance raised by the member for Bruce on the government's failure to address one of Australia's most concerning community health problems, the growing incidence of child obesity. As a parent myself I have been considering this issue for a couple of years now, and it is a very difficult issue facing parents throughout this country. We have heard various aspects of it. The previous speaker talked about some of the political aspects of it, the so-called problems with Labor's policy announcements; but, as the minister saidâand I have to agree with the ministerâat the end of the day it is a massive issue which has lots of elements to it. Obviously the role of parents, parental responsibility, is a very important part of it.  </para></talk.start><para>One of the issues the minister did not spend a lot of time on is schools. Our children spend a lot of time at school. In dealing with the issue of childhood obesity which is confronting so many of us, we have to consider the whole context, from when the kids wake up in the morning what we feed them for breakfast, what they eat at school, what their activities are at school and what they do when they get home from school through to what they do at night. </para><para>As previous speakers have pointed out, at present some 30 per cent of our children are defined as overweight or obese, and apparently by 2025 that figure is going to be up near 50 per cent. So there is obviously an urgent need for the Australian community to do something about it. We know that other developed countries such as America are facing this problem as well. It is a problem we all know about. What is the role of government? Who is going to make a change? Who is going to make a difference? We have obviously got a problem. How has that problem happened? It has happened very naturally, I think. The previous speaker said, `You can't blame this person, you can't blame that person.' I think that is right. The whole obesity thing has crept up on us and all of a sudden in the last couple of years we are saying: `Hang on, we've got a real problem here. We've got children getting diabetes and heart disease, we've got problems with their teeth, we've got all those associated issues that come out of childhood obesity and how it affects children in their later days.' It has come on us and we have not really been prepared for it. We have not known how to deal with it and we are still coming to terms with it. </para><para>In this House the opposition is saying that the government has not done enough and the government is saying that the opposition's policies are not going to work or are misguided. Those debates will carry on, but outside of this place the community is also discussing and is concerned about this issue. It was brought to my attention as the federal member for Cunningham early last year by a local fitness trainer who trains people working at the University of Wollongong. He is the father of some young children who go to the same surf club as my children. He spoke to me early last year about the whole issue of childhood obesity and how it is a major issueâhow trainers, physical education teachers and other such people throughout Australia have been really concerned about it for a number of years. It has crept up on a lot of us and we were not really aware of it. The Greens are very supportive of a natural, healthy lifestyle, supporting people in the community and making sure that we are a healthy society in every way so that those health problems do not impact on the cost of health care and some of those other issues as well. </para><para>When it was brought to my attention, I looked first at my own family and thought, `Yes, I can see the issue here.' We have heard stories about lethargy and lack of exercise children are currently experiencing. My two sons spend a lot of time playing video games; they do not necessarily play a lot of physical games like I did when I was a kid. There are lots of reasons for that. In my day we could go and play in the local paddock or near the local creek. Nowadays there are not a lot of places where kids can go out and play. There are concerns in the community about their safety. There are also the issues of insurance and public liability. Two weeks ago I wrote to the principal of my sons' primary school. Until this year, during lunchtime the children from fourth class up would go across the road to a park and would run freely. I used to do that when I went to that school back in the early 1960s. But that has now been stopped and the children in the primary school are forced to stay within the confines of the school grounds, which are now fenced in with high fences, and they are forced to play on the hard concrete and tar and other areas like that. For 30, 40 or 50 years children had been able to play during lunchtime in the park and engage in strong physical activity. </para><para>It is not just parents who are not pushing children outside and forcing them to do more exercise; it is also society. They cannot run free because of cars on the roads and they cannot play in playgrounds because of insurance problems faced by schools. These are some of the issues that have to be dealt with. We have to make sure that the insurance system is friendly enough for schools so that schoolteachers do not think, `If I'm going to let the children go into the park at lunchtime, we've got to have a survey of that park two hours before to make sure there's no broken glass and there are no hazards for the children.' These things are forcing our kids inside more and more to become more lethargic, unfortunately.</para><para>The fact that a lot of kids do not do a lot of exercise at school is also a problem. I think schools have a big role to play. We need to focus on how we can get exercise in the school environment to be more upfront and more of an issue. Things such as having good food in school canteens and having regular exercise at school are important. I am a parent and I agree with the minister that it is important that parents, guardians and carers of children have to be mindful of the issue of lethargy and the problems of bad diet and a lack of exercise. We have to say, `No, it's not all right to sit in front of a computer game on Saturday for six hours.' We have to get them out and about. That is something that we are responsible for as parents.</para><para>As parents in this place we do not have much time for our kids, unfortunately, because of the stresses and the time constraints on us as politicians. We have heard here about people with two or three jobs. There are real problems with parents being available to spend quality time going for a walk with their kids. Parents do have a role, but it is not just parents who have a role; it is schoolteachers, guardians and carers.</para><para>We have heard issues about the health effects. I went to an obesity forum recently. Robert de Castella was there. He is promoting exercise in school. We heard there about issues such as stage 2 diabetes becoming more prevalent among our children as a direct result of obesity. There are going to be real impacts on the costs of health care in this nation as a result of childhood obesity if we do not get on top of it and find the solutions. Obviously one of the main issues we are facing is foodâwhether it is junk food or just kids eating too much. We have to deal with the issues of food, overeating, diet and all those sorts of things. The other issue is exercise, which we have to promote as well.</para><para>What the government need to do is quite simpleâthey need to offer some leadership, give some direction to families and give support to families. It is not all up to the federal government, state governments or local governments; it is up to the whole community to be aware of this issue and work together. I could be critical of the government for not having done something more specific on this issue. I wrote to the Minister for Health and Ageing last September asking what specific programs there were in regard to treating and preventing childhood obesity. The comment came back from the minister that there were no specific projects and that they were looking into it. I understood that a task force would be reporting to health ministers on 28 November 2003 on this issue. We are still waiting for the outcome of that inquiry. </para><para>Like many Australians, I am looking forward to what the Prime Minister has to say at the end of this month in regard to the $120 million playing for life policy and how the government is going to move forward in dealing with childhood obesity, because it is an issue that we are all facing and it is an issue that I am sure we are all going to work together to confront and it is an issue that really cuts across all political boundaries. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âOrder!

Since the end of last month my local daily paper, the <inline font-style="italic">Illawarra Mercury</inline>, has been running stories about a bed crisis in Wollongong public hospitals. On 31 May it reported that Wollongong Hospital nurses were threatening to walk out over the issue. On 4 June it revealed that Wollongong Hospital fails to meet the New South Wales health department benchmark on bed admission in 45 per cent of cases. To top it off, yesterday it reported that on Tuesday there were no public hospital beds at all available in the Illawarra Area Health Service's Wollongong, Shellharbour or Bulli hospitals. This is a national disgrace.</para></talk.start><para>Yesterday it was brought to my attention that a 72-year-old Dapto man who needs life saving surgery to treat the extreme risk of a catastrophic stoke was told last week that he will not be able to have a bed until some time in October. After intervention by his doctor and family he has now been told that he may be able to be admitted on 24 August, 2Â½ months from now, and he is at extreme risk of a catastrophic stroke. And I do mean he may be admitted; it cannot be guaranteed and it is highly likely that it could be cancelled. There are seven patients booked before this man who also require high dependency unit beds for post-operative care, and the Wollongong Hospital does not have enough of these high dependency unit beds. Two other people, who are also critical risk patients, were booked into Wollongong Hospital this past week for surgery but have been cancelled due to the lack of those high dependency unit beds. </para><para>What is going on here? Why aren't public hospitals in my electorate of Cunningham and those of my parliamentary colleagues the members for Throsby and Gilmore adequately resourced? Why is a 72-year-old man forced to wait a minimum of 2Â½ months for life saving surgery? I will tell you whyâit is because the government would rather give money to the rich than provide health services for all of us. The cash-strapped public health system is collapsing around its ears, but the government is giving tax cuts to the rich. That is not just disgraceful; it is obscene. There is no excuse this government can offer for its abject failure to provide resources to the public health systemâand there is no excuse the New South Wales state government or the Illawarra Area Health Service can offer either.</para><para>Ambulance officers in New South Wales are threatening industrial action, and who could blame them? On Tuesday this week every ambulance between Helensburgh and Kiama was stuck outside Wollongong Hospital waiting for beds to become available. More than 250,000 Australians in Wollongong, Shellharbour and Kiama were left without emergency care because the government would rather give tax cuts than properly fund the public health system. And what about the 72-year-old man awaiting a bed for his life-saving surgery? How do you think he and his family feel? And how does the government think they will vote?</para><para>I think this is a real area of concern that we need to address at the national level. We have a real health crisis in Wollongong at the moment and it has been going on for some time. As I said, they have recently closed the emergency department at the Bulli Hospital and there have been ambulances queued up at the main hospital in Wollongong and people just left in corridors, basically. I heard that someone actually suffered a stroke while they were waiting to be admitted to the emergency department at Wollongong Hospital. We really need to look into the issue and provide more money to the hospital system.</para><para>There is a crisis in the Cunningham electorate and in Wollongong. A lot of it comes down to money; some of it comes down to management. I would suggest it needs to be better managed, but proper funding also needs to be available to the public hospital system so that there are plenty of doctors and staff on board and resources and beds are available to cater for these emergencies. And we are going to need more and more beds in hospitals. Just in the last couple of months, Wollongong has been overwhelmed because of the onset of winter and various other issues. This crisis is not going to go away. We need to find a solution, and I think all levels of government need to work on this matter.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health: Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme</title><title>Howard Government: Performance</title><page.no>30809</page.no></subdebateinfo><title>Howard Government: Performance</title><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>30809</page.no><name role="metadata">Wakelin, Barry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr WAKELIN</name><name.id>HV5</name.id><electorate>Grey</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âJust under two years ago, the subsidised treatment for erectile dysfunction was withdrawn from the PBS. It is not an easy subject to talk about. My constituents, of course, when they come to talk to me about it are somewhat embarrassed, but nevertheless there is no longer treatment available under the PBS for erectile dysfunction. So, in deference to those people who have brought it to my attention and have requested that I bring it to the parliament's attention, I should say that I think the withdrawal of that drug, without replacement, was unduly harsh. There may be some compromise available for gentlemen who have this issue, particularly related to the specific health requirements they have. I ask the government to consider what could be done within the PBS, particularly for low-income earning men for whom this is an issue. </para></talk.start><para>The budget, brought down in May, continues the government's very sound economic performance. You do not have to have a great memory to remember the financial position of Australia 15 years or even a decade agoâthat is, the interest rates, the debt, the unemployment and all the normal benchmark indicators. We now have unemployment at a rate which is approaching its lowest level for 25 years. We have interest rates that, 10 years ago, we would have only dreamt about. We have debt at a level that is probably, in real terms, lower than for the last 50 years of Australia's history. We have inflation very much under control. That is the measure of the government in terms of its economic performance.</para><para>The package for families was well received and certainly highlights the focus that this Australian government has brought to the area. The reductions in income tax are important for the further development of our economy and for strong incentive, particularly at the middle to higher levels. Superannuation and retirement savingsâall of those issues which have been so well looked after over the last eight yearsâwere put to the fore as well. I point out to the House that, in terms of the general financial position of Australia, one of the most remarkable financial statistics that I have heard this year was that Australians now invest more in the US than the US invests in Australia. The diversity of our economic performance is highlighted in that one simple statistic.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>6J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sciacca, Con, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Sciacca</name></talker><para>âIt's the superannuation guarantee brought in by Laborâthat is what it is.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>HV5</name.id><name role="metadata">Wakelin, Barry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr WAKELIN</name></talker><para>âAnd I believe it has done a very good job, member for Bowman. Following on from my example about investment in the US and counter-investment, in terms of investing in Australia's future, the recent science and innovation statement, topped off by the energy statement this week, show the very strong commitment of this government to the long-term future of the country. In terms of infrastructure, you do not have to go any further than Roads to Recovery II, added to by AusLink in recent weeksâjust a remarkably well-received policy in local government and throughout Australia for the future of our infrastructure.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In conclusion, I say that the rural community, with the reinstatement of the rural counsellors and with further discussion about drought policy, is in good order and well supported by this government. As far as our environment goes, the climate change program and the greenhouse impact outlined in this week's energy statement, on top of National Heritage Trust II and the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality, just indicate this government's credentials. To those states that are constantly complaining about this Australian government, you need go no further than the GST. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Bowman Electorate: Environment</title><title>Australian War Memorial: 38th Parallel Medical Society of Korea</title><page.no>30810</page.no></subdebateinfo><title>Australian War Memorial: 38th Parallel Medical Society of Korea</title><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>30810</page.no><name role="metadata">Sciacca, Con, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SCIACCA</name><name.id>6J4</name.id><electorate>Bowman</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI think the member for Grey is a good bloke tooâvery nice. As the member for Bowman I have the good fortune to represent Moreton Island and a good proportion of the Moreton Bay Marine Park, a beautiful place and an environmental treasure. Following the electoral redistribution in Queensland and my preselection as the Labor candidate for the new seat of Bonner, I have had the opportunity to learn more about another important environmental site, Spring Creek, an offshoot of Bulimba Creek that runs off Belmont Hills, under Scrub Road and through the Pacific Golf Club course. This evening I wish to draw the House's attention to the importance of this waterway and the flora and fauna that it supports, and to add my voice to the calls for the Brisbane City Council to protect this area from the threat of overdevelopment. </para></talk.start><para>Local environmental groups, including SCRUBâwhich stands for Save, Care for and Rejuvenate our Urban Bushlandâand the Bulimba Creek Catchment Committee have worked very hard over many years to preserve and protect the pristine environment in and around Spring Creek. Teresa Adams, a Carindale resident and secretary of the Belmont Hills Conservation Group, told my office that Spring Creek is the only creek system left in this area that runs off Belmont Hills. It is the only riparian corridor for local wildlife to reach Bulimba Creek. The water in this unique environmental site has a low pH, is very clean and provides a home to a variety of native fish including the ornate rainbow fish. The ornate rainbow fish is classified as a vulnerable species by the Queensland government and apart from this area can only be found at Tin Can Bay and on Fraser and Moreton islands. The creek is lined by rainforest remnants linking the area to the nearby Belmont rainforest. </para><para>Council has acted in the past to protect the site, buying back four blocks of land on one side of the creek as a buffer that local volunteers replanted. The importance of the ornate rainbow fish to the area is celebrated in the tiled display in the water feature at the Millennium entrance to Carindale Shopping Centre, one of our largest shopping centres in Queensland. So residents were both surprised and alarmed late last week when a notice appeared giving them just one week to lodge submissions on a proposed housing development. Comments made by local Guy Vickerman, reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline> newspaper this week, echo the concerns of many residents. Mr Vickerman said, `Run-off from this development will go directly into Spring Creekâoil, soap and everything else from people's homes. The developers also plan to fill in the grotto, a lovely pool with its own waterfall, and use it as a retention barrier.' This would destroy the water quality in the creek and devastate the ornate rainbow fish population.</para><para>Local residents and conservationists are determined to preserve Spring Creek and the flora and fauna it supports, but they are not unreasonable in their demands; they want to work towards a win-win situation so that neither the environment nor the developers are damaged irreparably.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>849</name.id><name role="metadata">Sidebottom, Sid, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>6J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sciacca, Con, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SCIACCA</name></talker><para>âMy friend the member for Braddon knows that the environment and industry can live together. With only a week to lodge objections, the local residents and conservationists have worked tirelessly to produce a submission outlining their opposition to the proposed large-scale development on land designated as an environmental waterway corridor in the local area plan. I would like to add my support to the submissions prepared by local organisations and individuals. I repeat their calls for the council to adhere to the city plan that says the waterway corridor should be transferred into public ownership where the land is required for ecological functions, linking core and remnant habitat areas and protecting water quality and ecological processes.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I was pleased to see that Cr John Campbell, the chairman of the Brisbane City Council Development and City Businesses Committee, has said the council will be considering any environmental impacts before making a decision about this proposed development. I urge the committee to carefully consider the suggestions local organisations have put forward to ensure that an adequate buffer is enforced around the area and this pristine waterway is preserved. These suggestions aim to strike a balance between allowing development and protecting the unique nature of the area and include: amending the route of Greendale Way, which runs close to the grotto and clay pools and crosses the waterway on the current plan; reallocating parkland from the various stages of the development, required under the council's `green' levy, to provide a green buffer along the creek corridor; initiating a conservation recovery plan and environmental management plan to preserve the ecological value of the area; and rejecting the proposed sedimentation basin in the creek, ensuring the quality of the creek water is not compromised by stormwater. </para><para>In the short time left to meâin what will probably be my last adjournment debate before the electionâI wanted to say a quick thankyou to Mrs Eleanor Howard of Wynnum, who together with her younger sister, Claire Clelland, has arranged to donate a certificate commemorating their late sister's membership of the 38th Parallel Medical Society of Korea. Lieutenant Margaret Becker served as a nursing sister in Korea and Japan with the British Commonwealth Occupation Forces and was one of only a very few Australians to be part of this society, whose members are drawn from more than 30 countries worldwide and served in this noble profession. The Australian War Memorial has not previously had any private records documenting the experiences of the small contingent of Australian nurses who served in Korea, and this donation is a valuable contribution to their collection, ensuring that memories of those medical staff who have served our nation in that region are preserved and honoured. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Ryan Electorate: Queen's Birthday Honours</title><page.no>30812</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>30812</page.no><name role="metadata">Johnson, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JOHNSON</name><name.id>00AMX</name.id><electorate>Ryan</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI wish to speak in the parliament tonight of the residents of Ryan who recently received awards in the Queen's Birthday Honours List.

Indeed, he became a minister of the federal government, serving as a Navy minister as well as a defence minister. He is, Mr Speaker, as you would know, a brilliant orator, a wonderfully compassionate man and a man who should serve as an inspiration to the young people of this country through his dedication to serving our nation.

Dr Yvonne Burns from The Gap was made an officer in the general division, as was Professor James Dale from Moggill. Mr John Haines was made a member in the general division, as were Professor Greg Seymour and Mr Clifford Thompson. Mrs Moya Condon received the OAM in the general division. </para><para>Mr Bill Deutrom from Brookfield was also recognised for his services to the community and for his dedication to raising funds for the Princess Alexandra Hospital Foundation. He also has a particular passion for taking young students in Brisbane to Sri Lanka, where he has a strong connection, to play cricket and to enlighten young Australians about the challenges of a country such as Sri Lanka. I also want to pay tribute to Beth Johnstone from the suburb of Pullenvale in Ryan. Beth Johnstone received the honour of a medal in the general division. Professor John Mainstone of St Lucia was recognised for his services to education in the field of physics and atmospheric research.</para><para>These are Australians from the Ryan electorate who, through their time, skills, character and integrity, have made a contribution to our community and the country.

These are Australians who can serve as inspiration for our fellow Australians, and I want to encourage young people in the Ryan community in particular to make contact with these kinds of Australians if they have the opportunity, because they can serve as torchbearers in life and as guides to how one can not only pursue successful careers but equally make a contribution to one's own community and, in the process of doing that, be enriched in one's personal life.</para><para>I also want to pay tribute to Sir Leo Hielscher,<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>who received the AC, and Dr Leigh Atkinson<inline font-weight="bold">,</inline><inline font-weight="bold"></inline>both of whom I have had the great honour of meeting and have an association with.

Whilst I am doing that, I would like to recognise in the gallery tonight someone with the most energy I have ever seen of anybody in my electorate, particularly in relation to the arts, Mrs Lynn Price. I would like to recognise Lynn here tonight.</para></talk.start><para>In the Prime Minister's recent white paper in relation to energy, there was an extraordinary statement by the Prime Minister about renewable energies which has effectively dudded future investment in wind energy in Australia and particularly in my state of Tasmania. The Prime Minister claimed that the ALP's renewable energy policy is not sound economics. Tonight, I would like to show you that the converse is true. The PM has failed to realise that labour-intensive renewable energy creates jobs, creates factories and brings in foreign investment, all of which contribute to the economy. A five per cent MRET, which the ALP is committed toâand I want that clear on the public record: the ALP is committed to a five per cent MRET increaseâwill make a big contribution to the economy since it will provide a market sufficient to create manufacturing plants. For example, in its response to the MRET review the wind industry said that a five per cent MRET is the minimum level required for competitive wind turbine blade manufacture. That has had a significant consequence in my electorate of Braddon. I understand that only next week Vestas-International Wind Technology was going to announce the establishment of a blade manufacturing plant in my electorate, with 280 jobs associated with it when it went into full production. That plant to this point has now been dudded because of the short-sighted policies of this government. </para><para>The PM's startling statement that Australia cannot afford clean energy is groundless. Macroeconomic modelling of the whole of the Australian economy by Charles River Associates, using the Monash MM600+ model of the Australian economy, is very sobering and has shown that an increase from the current target to a five per cent MRET, as the Labor Party supports, would have the following effect on the economy: the cost of electricity would increase by just one per centânot by these horrendous figures that the Prime Minister has been throwing around, trying to support his argument against extending the MRET target. The CRA report goes on to say that it would have no net effect on employment in Australia. It would not lead to the unemployment that the Prime Minister insinuated would occur by increasing the MRET. It would also increase total business investment in Australia by 0.1 per cent, and it would have no net effect on Australian GDP.</para><para>By building up renewable energy, it becomes cheaper. That is a fact. By growing markets you reduce the costs. A report released by the Australian Wind Energy Association this week, entitled <inline font-style="italic">Cost convergence of wind power and conventional generation in Australia</inline>, based on international research indicates that by 2015 wind will be competitive with gas in Australia and by 2020 it may well be competitive with Australian coal. Thereafter, the cost to the economy becomes less and less but only, the report concludes, provided the industry is allowed to grow to sufficient size. The Prime Minister's statement has dudded it, has muted it. Those investments that are now planned will go ahead, but what of the future? It is no good having up-front research and development and investment to make it more efficient if you do not have a market. The ALP's policies use sensible market economics and provide for an affordable build-up of the Australian renewable energy industry. They are not mutually exclusive, and I am aghast at the Prime Minister's backward looking, antihistorical view of energy use in the future. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health: Juvenile Diabetes</title><page.no>30814</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>30814</page.no><name role="metadata">Moylan, Judi, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs MOYLAN</name><name.id>4V5</name.id><electorate>Pearce</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âToday I joined Professor Martin Silink AM, President Elect of the International Diabetes Federation, to officially launch the third edition of Diabetes Information for Schools, the school pack.

The pack that has been launched today has been compiled by an experienced team; it has been compiled in consultation with schools throughout Australia and it is extremely informative.

There is information on how to manage school excursions, exercising at school and education about drugs and alcohol. It is designed in a very friendly and easy to use format and its contents are easy to see. It has an introduction; it tells people what diabetes is, what low blood glucose is and how dangerous that can be if it is not treated, the treatment of a mild to moderate hypo, the treatment of a severe hypo and what high blood glucose is. It has sections on food and diabetes; camps; exercises and diabetes; diabetes treatment at school exam time; and family, other topics and student services. </para><para>I would like to acknowledge the authors of this pack. As I said, they are an experienced team, headed by Professor Silink, and include Mrs Lorna Mellor AM, Ms Marg McGill, Dr Lilian Jackson, Angie Middlehurst, Helen Phelan and Gillian Harris. The pack includes a comprehensive flip chart with a note for parents, diabetes information for schools and a medical alert card. I think the team has done a splendid job. I was delighted to represent the Parliamentary Diabetes Support Group to launch the third edition of Diabetes Information for Schools information pack. I congratulate the authors and everyone involved in it. Can I also say too that we appreciated Abbott MediSense being the sponsors of this kit and for their contribution to what is a very important community initiative.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment: Renewable Energy</title><page.no>30815</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>30815</page.no><name role="metadata">Sidebottom, Sid, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SIDEBOTTOM</name><name.id>849</name.id><electorate>Braddon</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWhilst no other colleagues are here I will take the opportunity to continue some of my comments about the government's decision not to continue to support renewable energies into the future, particularly in future investments which would lead to value adding and the growth of manufacturing in those industries.

I was privileged and honoured to be able to launch this Good Start Breakfast Club program in my electorate at the Goodna state school just last week. It gave me a real pleasure to be there and to see a really good community based program done by a fantastic organisation that makes a real difference on the ground. It is a practical program that makes a difference to young kids' lives.</para></talk.start><para>I want to thank Mr Neil Jenkins, the Goodna state school principal; Mr Greg Goebel, the executive director of the Australian Red Cross in Queensland; Ipswich city councillor Paul Tully; Jeff White, the manager of education services in Ipswich; Alan Clayton, a board member of the Australian Red Cross; and all the teachers, staff and parents who helped out. It was a fantastic morning. I think we fed well over 100 kids. It is only a small school, but we fed well over 100 kids, and they absolutely enjoyed themselves. It is a great program, and I really want to congratulate them.</para><para>It got me thinking about the importance of a good breakfast, of a good quality diet for young people and of Labor's policy about the banning of junk food advertising during children's television programs. We believeâand I am a big supporter of thisâin a total ban on all food and drink advertising during children's television programs. Those advertisements are aimed directly at young children and really give them no choice. That is what they do: they take away choice from kids. It creates a whole heap of unwarranted pressure. All parents would knowâevery single parent out there would understandâand as a parent of three kids I know, about the pressure that young kids put on their parents when they walk past a junk food outlet or want some sugary drinks and so forth, because of the advertising, the bombardment they have received from advertisers, especially during children's programs.</para><para>The government should regulate and play a role. It should help parents and assist them, to give them choices for their childrenâthe choices the parents want to make. That is the assistance that the federal government can give. The sort of nonsense that we hear from the Prime Minister and the governmentâthat is, by doing nothing, we give people choiceâis not true. Ask any parent out there. They want choices; they do not want their kids bombarded by advertisements of junk food and sugary drinks during children's television programs. I wanted to put that on the record because I think it is an exceptionally important issue in the lead-up to the election. I think parents do want choice, and the way you give them choice is by letting them make the decisions about what their kids should eat and the diet of their kids. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Hinkler Electorate: Air Shows</title><page.no>30817</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>30818</page.no><name role="metadata">Neville, Paul, MP</name><name role="display">Mr NEVILLE</name><name.id>KV5</name.id><electorate>Hinkler</electorate><party>NATS</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would like to talk about the air show movement in my electorate. It is not surprising that I should because, with an electorate with the name of HinklerâAustralia's famous solo aviatorâair shows are a very popular event throughout my electorate. I would like to talk about two air shows. The first one is the Queensland International Air Show that was held in Bundaberg last year, attracting around 200 fly-ins and 15,000 spectators. There were representatives of 50 of Australia's leading aviation companies. The air show had everything from old warbirds, ultralights and fighter jets to a Super Constellation. The Bundaberg community got right behind the event, making it a resounding success, so a second air show will be held on 16 and 17 July next year. I would like to compliment Susie Teasdale on the magnificent job she did with the event. It has been a great fillip for charities in my area and, in addition to that, we intend to make it a biannual event. </para></talk.start><para>Today I would also like to talk about the Old Station Air Show, which is held in the Raglan-Ambrose area, in the northern part of the Hinkler electorate, north of Gladstone and south of Rockhampton. This air show has been going for 13 years and it is sponsored by the Old Station Flying Club, which was the vision of Councillor George Creed and his wife, Leonie, who have made their propertyânot surprisingly, known as Old Stationâavailable to the air show. It has a 2,000 metre strip, which is quite unusual in the country. Russell Tidd, the current chairman of the flying club, and his club supporters, with assistance from the Rockhampton Aero Club, the Lions Club and other community groups, ran an absolutely magnificent event. It included a fly-in, a rodeo, a concert and a bonfire on the first day, and displays and an air show, including the Roulettes, on the second day. The show has grown from 40 aircraft to over 220. Over recent years we have seen Caribous; DC3 ultralights; the Jabiru, which is manufactured in Bundaberg; stunt flyers; and American, British, Russian and Chinese warbirds. As Dick Smith, who was the guest of honour at this year's air show, said, `It's a truly Australian air show and one that no Australian should miss.'</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment: Policy</title><page.no>30818</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>30818</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MURPHY</name><name.id>83D</name.id><electorate>Lowe</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Prime Minister's energy white paper has more to do with cynical vote buying; it is not a serious attempt to deliver the long-term, reliable, affordable and environmentally sustainable supplies of energy that Australia needs. The government continues to have its head in the sand on climate change, and its energy policy means that Australia will continue to be the country with the world's highest per capita greenhouse gas emissions. It is beyond belief that the members of the government are unaware of the numerous warnings of the effects of global warming induced by rising carbon dioxide levels. One only has to leave the city to see the scorched earth, the barren pastures and the devastated countryside that is, with little doubt, largely the consequence of global warming. The doubters, the sceptics, the ignorant and the self-servers that control the energy policy making of the government have done Australia a great disservice.</para></talk.start><para>There is now no reasonable doubt that carbon dioxide pollution is causing global warming, and this warming is driving climate change. The increasing temperatures have driven some very significant changes in the weather, not least the serious decline in average rainfall experienced in eastern Australia. Records kept at Exeter in the New South Wales Southern Highlands show that the average rainfall in the period 1950-59 was about 1,400 millimetres per annum. For the first four years of the current decade the average was just 870 millimetres per annum. This is a decline of 38 per cent in 50 years. In accordance with the predictions of climate models that incorporate the effects of global warming, there is little doubt that these conditions will worsen if emissions of carbon dioxide are not reduced as soon as possible. </para><para>The Minister for the Environment and Heritage has admitted that emissions have to be cut by 60 per cent, yet there is no doubt that his advice to cabinet to increase the mandatory renewable energy target as a step in that direction was overruled by a combination of ignorance and, worse, political self-interest. We now have the Prime Minister attempting to argue that he will be reducing carbon dioxide emissions by cutting taxes on fossil fuels and supporting an unproven future scheme to trap and bury emissions from power stations. At the same time the government has cut spending on renewable energy research and undermined efforts to encourage the uptake of solar energy technology by increasing subsidies for diesel.</para><para>Climate change experts warn that we are at a critical point in the growth of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. They warn that higher carbon dioxide concentrations could tip the climate into an unknown regime that could see much of Australia become a desert. While Labor supports technologies designed to allow us to burn our coal more cleanly and efficiently, Australia desperately needs at least an equal effort to be made in increasing the role of renewable energy. The Prime Minister's energy policy is a cynical political fix and fails to deliver the correct balance.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health: Mental Illness</title><page.no>30819</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>30819</page.no><name role="metadata">Bailey, Fran, MP</name><name role="display">FRAN BAILEY</name><name.id>JT4</name.id><electorate>McEwen</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMore than two million Australians experience a mental illness or disorder each year. One in five Australians over the age of 18 experiences a situation that meets the criteria of mental illness, and three to four per cent of Australians experience severe mental illness that significantly interferes with their mental wellbeing and prevents them from being able to fully participate in their community life. When I use these terms `mental illness' and `mental disorder', I am not talking about the sort of occasional bad day that any of us can experience, especially here in this place.</para></talk.start><para>What I am really talking about are, for example, some common mental illnesses, including depression, anxiety, substance use disorders and eating disordersâI think we are all very familiar with the terms `anorexia nervosa' and `bulimia nervosa'. Different psychoses can manifest themselves into feelings of misapprehension, disturbances in perception, disturbances of belief and interpretationâin other words, people suffer from hallucinations or delusion. Dementia is a growing problem, of course, particularly for a number of our elderly. These sorts of mental health problems really interfere with a person's ability to think and feel and with their social abilities. Sometimes these are temporary disorders and sometimes, of course, they last a bit longer. I think it is important that we are aware of some of their symptoms, which can be changes in mood and behaviour, social withdrawal, sleeping problems, not coping with work or study, a loss of energy or motivation, delusions and hallucinations.</para><para>There are a number of ways in which we can promote mental wellbeing. These include talking to friends and family, talking to people who can help relieve stress and anxiety, eating nutritious food, getting adequate sleep, exercising regularly, learning how to relax and, most importantly, seeking help. Sometimes speaking to friends and family is just not enough and professional help must be sought. I am going to be holding mental health forums throughout my electorate, not only raising awareness amongst the general population but actually showing people what sort of help is available and how we can recognise these symptoms. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Medicare: Bulk-Billing</title><page.no>30820</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>30820</page.no><name role="metadata">Hall, Jill, MP</name><name role="display">Ms HALL</name><name.id>83N</name.id><electorate>Shortland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want to bring to the attention of the House, yet again, my concern about Medicare and the inadequacy of the government's MedicarePlus package. In the Shortland electorate we are still seeing a decline in bulk-billing and we are losing more and more GPs. Whilst one additional GP has moved into the area, that has been matched by other GPs leaving the area. I think that it is important to note that the bulk-billing rate at the end of December last year in the Shortland electorate was 51.3 per cent, and that is down from nearly 80 per cent back in 2000. It is very disturbing that this decline is continuing.</para></talk.start><para>With the government's MedicarePlus package, the safety net that is part of that package does not cover administration fees which many obstetricians and specialists are charging their patients when they come to see them. As a result of the medical indemnity crisis and the slow and inadequate response of the government to the problem, many specialists and, in particular, obstetricians have decided that, to make sure that they are properly covered, they need to charge their patients an administration fee.</para><para>I have the details before me of one young woman in my electorate whose obstetrician charged her a $1,350 administration fee. That is an out-of-pocket expense and cannot be deemed as part of the Medicare safety net simply because it does not have a provider number, and I think all members in this House would be aware of that. That is a significant and substantial amount of money that young people have to find when they are starting a family. The government really needs to look at this issue and revisit it. It needs to ensure that people who opt for private insurance so they can have their babies or operations in private hospitals can at least have some ability to claim the out-of-pocket expenses that are being charged by their obstetricians and specialists.</para><para>The other thing that I quickly want to mention is that the minister was in my electorate for the opening of the Toukley medical practice. This is a practice that charges $10 in excess of the schedule fee. The minister stated that that was the way of the future. It shows that the minister has accepted that bulk-billing has gone. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Cook Electorate: Surf-Lifesaving Clubs</title><page.no>30820</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>30820</page.no><name role="metadata">Baird, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BAIRD</name><name.id>MP6</name.id><electorate>Cook</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âRecently I had the opportunity to present awards to a number of fine young athletes from the Cronulla Surf-Lifesaving nippers club. Each Sunday, from September to February, over 650 young people and their parents head down to South Cronulla beach and participate in races, games and surf education. This is a wonderful opportunity for children to be active and healthy in a fun and enjoyable environment. Cronulla nippers has a long and distinguished history. It is the oldest nippers club in the Sutherland shire and was formed in 1907. It is also the largest nippers club in Australia and is highly successful.</para></talk.start><para>The club has won the last seven state championships, which is a record for New South Wales. Six club members have also recently gained entry into the exclusive Sydney branch team, which is a great honour for any nipper. This junior arm of the surf club does vital work in encouraging young people to be involved in outdoor activities while training future volunteers who will grow to perform patrols of the beach, keeping swimmers safe. This year 30 nippers have continued on to the next stage in their surf-lifesaving career, which is known as the cadets. The cadets can perform patrols on the beach, helping to protect the community whilst being a very rewarding and healthy experience for those involved. </para><para>In an electorate like Cook where we are fortunate enough to have many beaches, it is great to see so many young people becoming active and participating in these surf safety programs. All the children who are involved this season should be congratulated, and a special mention must also go to the children who are able to attain the coveted nipper of the year award. The subjunior nipper of the year award went to Eliza Caseceli and James Ryan. The junior nipper of the year award went to Lauren Archer and Jake Little. The nipper of the year award went to Nicola Zagane and Luke Cole. To win this award, athletes have to be successful in carnivals all over New South Wales and to show outstanding talent and sportsmanship. A special mention must also go to eight-year-old Regan Yerbury. This exceptional boy was the state champion<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>in the blue-ribbon gold beach sprint. It is an amazing achievement considering that this was his first year of competition in the nippers carnival.</para><para>This year two members of the club, Maddison Elliot and Jacqui Holland, won medals at the Australian championships. This is a fantastic achievement considering the wealth of talent that comes from all over Australia to participate in the championships. Once again, I want to congratulate all the nippers from the Cronulla Surf-Lifesaving Club and all those who participated in the New South Wales carnival in 2003-04. The nippers give young people great opportunities to get out there and enjoy a healthy lifestyle.

I particularly question whether the proceeds from the sale of SACL to a subsidiary of SCACH are specifically allocated for the purchase of land and other costs in the construction of Sydney airport. The minister has been making a number of spending announcements of late and since 1996 there have been mixed messages coming from the government with regard to the second airport for the people of Sydney. That is my first question.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The second question relates to the implementation of the long-term operating plan, which I ask you about each year at this particular time. I put on record once again that those people who are living north of the airport are receiving twice as much noise from aircraft as we were promised under the government's long-term operating plan. That is against the background that, when the coalition came into government in 1996, they promised the people of Sydney that they would not be selling the airport before aircraft noise problems were solved.</para><para>Notwithstanding the exhaustive number of questions I have asked you in the time that I have been the member for Loweâand I was elected on this issueâyou have replied to me that the long-term operating plan has been substantially implemented. I put to you that that is not correct because, as I speak to you in the chamber, aircraft noise to the north of Sydney airport is running at almost double that promised under the government's long-term operating plan. So those are the two question that I have for you today: firstly, what are you doing with the $5.6 billion from the sale of Sydney airport with regard to the future construction of a second airport for the people of Sydney; and, secondly, what are you doing about making sure that the people who live to the north of Sydney airport only get 17 per cent of air traffic movements? </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>30823</page.no><name role="metadata">Sercombe, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SERCOMBE</name><name.id>QK6</name.id><electorate>Maribyrnong</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAs part of the AusLink package for Victoria there is provision for fundsâwhich are welcomeâto continue the process of upgrading the Calder, which is an important part of the road network servicing the north-west of Melbourne and the north-west of Victoria. The difficulty, however, that I want to raise with the minister arises from the reality that the Calder, at the point where it comes to join the Tullamarine Freeway, which then becomes part of CityLink on its progress into Melbourne, simply becomes a car park at peak times. The interchange between the Calder and the Tullamarine is frankly a disgrace. It is disappointing that, as part of what has been packaged by the government as an integrated process of land transport planning, adequate provision is not made for the interchange between the Calder and the Tullamarine.</para></talk.start><para>This is going to become an issue of increasing importance, because within AusLink it is expected that traffic movements to and from airports in Australiaâand I presume that Melbourne Airport is included in thatâare likely to double over the next 16 years to the year 2020. This interchange is a car park at the moment in peak hours; it is beyond comprehension as to what the circumstances will be at this interchange should steps not be taken quickly to resolve this.</para><para>The government's failure in this arises from a number of things. For example, Essendon Airport, which has been leased by the government, is right at this interchange, yet it would appear that the government has entered into leasing arrangements for Essendon Airport without making provision for the interchange. Engineering advice seems to be that part of the airport land would need to be taken as part of an upgraded interchange. This package, which is supposed to be about integration and careful planning, seems to fall through the cracks on this particular point.</para><para>From the point of view of my constituents, particularly in suburbs like Essendon and Moonee Ponds, the failure to address the extreme traffic congestionâand this is recognised by RACV comments along the lines that this is the worst example in Melbourne presently of major arterial road traffic congestionâcombined with the effects of CityLink and the understandable desire on the part of many motorists to avoid the tolls on CityLink, creates frightful problems in the residential streets of Essendon and Moonee Ponds by rat-running. It would be very welcome to get some response from the minister on this matter.</para><para>I understand that the expenditure to continue to upgrade the Calder over coming years will amount to about $114 million, and it is extraordinarily welcome. However, it does seem to have fairly limited efficacy if in fact that expenditure simply contributes to the car park that occurs where the Calder joins the Tullamarine Freeway on its approach into Melbourne. Melbourne is hosting the Commonwealth Games in a couple of years. This is the major gateway into Melbourne, yet, as I said, it becomes a car park. I would ask the minister to give very careful consideration in the context of his transport planning and AusLink to what is to be done to resolve this ongoing and worsening problem where the Calder meets the Tullamarine. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>30824</page.no><name role="metadata">Ripoll, Bernie, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RIPOLL</name><name.id>83E</name.id><electorate>Oxley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn speaking to the appropriation bill, I want to ask the minister a number of questions and make a number of points. At the moment, the federal government has asked the state government of Queensland to fast-track a study into a possible northern alternativeâthe Dinmore to Goodna loop roadâto half-bypass the Ipswich Motorway. I want to know from the minister whether he is prepared, when that report is finally deliveredâat whatever point the report is delivered, whether it be delivered faster or notâto accept the result of that report.</para></talk.start><para>The minister might understand that I have some concerns about the acceptance by government of proper studies. A number of years ago $4 million was put in by the federal government and the state government combined to do a master plan and study on the Ipswich Motorway project. It was an excellent reportâprobably one of the best reports I have ever seen, in terms of the process, the number of experts and advisers and the breadth of community consultation that took place. Yet the government did not accept the outcome of that report. It did not accept that the best solution to the traffic problems of south-east Queensland is to get on with the job of fixing the road that is the core of the problem. What I want to know from the minister quite simply is: will he be prepared to accept the outcome of this report when it is finally delivered?</para><para>I also want to ask the minister about his level of understanding of the need for an upgrade to the Ipswich Motorway. If people and groups such as the RACQ; the Brisbane City Council, both under the previous administration and under the new Liberal mayoral administration; the Ipswich City Council, both under the former mayor and the new mayor; the state Liberal Partyâthe minister can confer with his colleagues at a state level; and the community all agree that the Ipswich Motorway has to have a full six-lane upgrade, what convinces the minister so forthrightly that that should not take place? I have heard the minister say that there is a possibility that it could happen sometime in the future, but no timetable has been put forward and that concerns me.</para><para>The other question I have for the minister is about the funding in AusLink for Queensland and, in particular, for the Ipswich Motorway and possibly the northern alternative in my electorateâif the northern alternative is even feasible; we do not know that to be a fact. The Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads, Senator Ian Campbell, has said on a number of occasions that it frightens the hell out of him to think about spending $600 million on the Ipswich Motorway. I wonder if he is just as frightened about spending money on a possible road that may not be feasible when estimates from the government are that it could cost at least $400 million. I wonder if that spend frightens the minister.</para><para>There seems to be a discrepancy in the funding figures. I cannot find the money. I have pored over the figures, I have the letters from the minister and I have the breakdown of the budgets right through to budget year 2008-09. From my calculations based on what I have in front of me, there is, for a start, no money for the Ipswich Motorway at all. I think that is generally accepted: the government have not made a commitment to fix or upgrade the Ipswich Motorway. In media releases they have said that they will not exactly fund it but that there is $400 million for the northern alternative if it is to go ahead. I cannot find that $400 million. Maybe the minister could explain exactly where that $400 million is todayâwhere it is actually written down and which budget it is in. </para><para>Taking a broader look at the number of commitments made in AusLink over a five-year period, we see that the federal government in its own calculations has conservatively costed about $2.5 billion worth of projects in Queensland. They are the projects that are outlined in the AusLink documents, yet I can only find $567 million committed over the next five years. Where is the rest of the money? I cannot see that it is committed. Right up until 2008-09 there still is no commitment. That $567 million is the only money that is on the table to carry out five major projects, including a northern link, supposedly the Ipswich Motorway and the duplication of the Gateway Bridge arterial roadâprojects that in themselves could cost up to $1 billion. My question to the minister is: where is the money? Show us where it is in the budget and explain to us why there is a discrepancy between the budget papers and the forward estimates and the projects and costings that you have put forward. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>30825</page.no><name role="metadata">Snowdon, Warren, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SNOWDON</name><name.id>IJ4</name.id><electorate>Lingiari</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMinister, I have two very specific questions that relate to Roads to Recovery and AusLink funds.

I understand that in the initial Roads to Recovery package you provided about $26 million additional resources for the unique requirements of roads in South Australia. There are 9,000 kilometres of roads and unincorporated land in the Northern Territory that have received no assistance from the federal government through Roads to Recovery or AusLink. Minister, I would like to know how you intend to provide these resources and if you intend to provide the resources to address these road needs. Lastly, you have given an undertaking to the Northern Territory Cattlemen's Association that you will provide $20 million over four years for beef roads in the Northern Territory.

Firstly, can the minister confirm that the Badgerys Creek airport site is mothballed and it is still government policy to retain it as an option for a second Sydney airport in the future?

I will then provide a broad overview response. I come firstly to the member for Lowe's points. As I understand it, he is interested in what happened to the proceeds from the sale of Sydney airport. As has been the case with asset sales since 1996, with the limited exception of the money that was held back for things like the Natural Heritage Trust, the proceeds from the sale of Sydney airport went to reducing Commonwealth debt. We inherited a debt of $96 billion. We have reduced that to below $30 billion. That saves Australian taxpayers something of the order of $5 billion a year now in interest on debt. We think that is a good outcome, and that is where the money has gone. We think that is good public policy.</para></talk.start><para>Have we put some of that aside for building another airport? No, we have not for the simple reason that, as I think you are well awareâand the government's position is quite simpleâthere is no need for a further airport at this point in time. The construction of another airport at the moment would be a giant miscalculation because, at this stage, it would be impossible to know when it might be needed and when it might start to be used. It would be impossible to know what sort of airport would be needed, because the current one is fulfilling its functions extremely well and is likely to do so for a very substantial amount of time into the future. In essence, the answer is that, no, we have not put money aside for another airport, because it would be a white elephant.</para><para>When it comes to the LTOP, we believe that it has resulted in a much more equitable sharing of the noise burden in the Sydney area and, indeed, that is overwhelmingly the message I get from residents from around Sydney. It is the case that LTOP targets are not always met. They are targets. There are a range of factors that influence the meeting of those targets and they vary seasonally. As the member would be well aware, wind and weather patterns and so forth influence the use of various runways. I do constantly seek to remind Airservices that they need to strive to achieve those targets and sometimes I would like to see a slightly better performance, I have to say, because I do have a lot of sympathy for people in Sydney who are affected by aircraft noise. But I have to make the point that the fact remains that this is a vastly more superior plan for Sydney's airspace management than was in place when we came to government and it is of enormous benefit to a very large number of Sydney residents.</para><para>I say to the member for Maribyrnong that the state of Victoria has seen something like a 118 per cent increase in its construction budget under AusLink. That is a very substantial injection of funds. Under the old program, you had the national highway system to which we added RONIs. It is worth noting that, prior to AusLink, Victoria had been a huge beneficiary under the RONI program. Of some $2.2 billion allocated across the nation, around $825 million was earmarked for Victoria. We identified a whole series of roads of national importance and sought to help the people and the taxpayers of that state cope with very real road needs.</para><para>I have absolutely no doubt that the member for Maribyrnong has always honestly pointed out to his constituents that Labor had no such programâthere was no RONIâand that under their programs there would have been no assistance for the Calder at all. I have no doubt you point that out frequently and remind your constituents of that. We have in fact committed substantial amounts of money to itâsome $114 million, with up to $82 million to come. When you talk to your constituents I have no doubt that you also of courseâsorry, I am looking at the member for Oxley. My apologies. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>QK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Sercombe, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Sercombe</name></talker><para>âI am more good-looking.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Anderson, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDERSON</name></talker><para>âI will take your word for it. I am sure your constituents agree. I am sure when you have face-to-face meetings with them you also point out that when it comes to RONIs, while we usually provide as a rule of thumb half the money for the states, they are state roads. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> I am sure you also point out that VicRoads are responsible for putting forward priorities, for planning and for process. We seek to cooperate with them and we seek to do it in a way that is sympathetic to the needs of the people who use the roads. Indeed that is the underlying principle of the whole approach that we adopted under RONIs.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Under AusLink we have adopted a completely different approach. There are a couple of points I would not mind making about AusLink. I have been quite interested to note calls from the state ministers which are based around the comment: `We didn't get our fair share. It ought to be done on a population basis or a contribution to GDP basis.' That totally misses the point about the Commonwealth's involvement in transport. As a general principle it is for the states and local government to build the intrastate transport networks that their people need. It is for the Commonwealth, which is not the major provider of infrastructureâit never has been and I do not believe it ever will beâto seek to provide the corridors which give us national interconnectiveness between our capital cities, our ports, our exporting regions and our importing areas.</para><para>If you take the state of Victoria, for example, the Commonwealth perspective recognises that one of the major needs of Victoria is to be properly linked with Sydney. It is a long way away. The problem with the dual carriageway that we need between Sydney and Victoria is that it is overwhelmingly in New South Wales. Is it in the interest of Victoria to have that dual carriageway? Of course it is. Is the money expended in that state? No, it is not. But nonetheless, who wins out of it? All of us. And AusLink seeks to establish those corridors which need to be developed in the national interest in terms of the infrastructure projects that will deliver the best national outcomes for jobsâpreservation of existing jobs, creation of new jobsâexport performance, the creation of prosperity, safety and amenity. That is really what we are seeking to do. It is, of course, strategic. It is strategic in the sense that at last we now have a seamless interstate track.</para><para>AusLink will be seen by future historians who look at these issues as the final cracking of one of the major failings of our forefathers. At the Adelaide constitutional convention of around 1890 they had four items on the agenda. One was the powers of the Senate and what they ought to be. Depending on how you see the Senate, they got that roughly right. They gave them the power to deny supply but not initiate it. Another was post and telegraph. I think we can all thank the good Lord that they decided it ought to be national, otherwise we would have had eight or nine Telstrasâthat would have been just terrific! Two areas where they baulked, though, concerned what were seen as the transport corridorsâthe rivers and the railways. For protectionist reasons they wanted the transport corridors kept in state hands.</para><para>We need a national approach. We have it with rail, with the successful conclusion of the lease negotiations in New South Wales, with Michael Costa. I do not mind saying, on a bipartisan basis, that he was very pragmatic and very easy to deal with. He made a very sensible and, I thought, interesting observation when we signed the lease. He said, `Sometimes they talk about two political partiesâmain groupingsâin this country, but I do not think they are coalition and Labor; they are sensible and non-sensible politicians.' His attitude, I would have to say, was quite enlightened. We negotiated a deal with him and with the unions satisfactorily, and who wins? Australians. Why do I mention this again in the context of AusLink? Because, as we get more dual carriageways connecting our major cities, we will be able to ensure that they are not immediately choked by freight. A decent chunk of the freight volumes that are so rapidly growing in this country will now be diverted to rail. I think that is very advantageous in terms of economic outcomes, environmental outcomes, amenity and congestion. It is a very welcome breakthrough. </para><para>The member for Oxley raises some questions, and I do understand them, in relation to the vexatious issue of traffic volumes in south-east Queensland in general and on the Ipswich Motorway in particular. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted) </inline>What I can best indicate to you is that Senator Ian Campbell and I are quite sincere in wanting to findâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

It is something that I am sure his constituents enjoy and for which they owe their appreciation to the Liberal and National parties in government. There are some issues in your unincorporated areas in the Northern Territory. I am not going to canvass those now. I have had several meetings with affected stakeholders, and we will try and find a fair and reasonable way through those issues. AusLink does see around a 40 per cent increase in funding for construction on the highway system and so forth up there, and I am sure that that is welcome as well.</para><para>I now come to the member for Batman.

In relation to the issue of depreciation for trucks and buses, you ask us to overturn the determination. There is not one yet.

It is clearly earmarked for rail upgrades in northern New South Wales, and they are developing a finalised work package now. That will be made available when it is completed. I do not think we have it yet, but it is for a whole series of upgrades on that North Coast area, which at the moment is pretty decrepit. Gradients are unsatisfactory; there is a lot of bridgework that needs doing; there is a lot of curvature that needs attention; and it has to be said that even this amount of money will not entirely solve the problems. And that is over and above the very large amount of money that was already earmarked as part of the $872 million preannounced for replacement of old sleepers and so forth from Maitland north to the border, which runsâfrom memoryâinto around $150 million worth of work in its own right.</para></talk.start><para>The $872 millionâthe very great bulk of itâis overwhelmingly for expenditure in New South Wales. It was attached, of course, to the lease arrangements with New South Wales, and there was a recognition of the very seriously run-down nature of the track right across the state. It is earmarked for such projects. I think there is $175 million or so going into the 700 kilometre section that runs from Parkes to Broken Hill. That section alone will chew up a large amount of money as we seek to replace overhead structures that prevent double stacking and to replace sleepers that will not carry the sorts of trains we need to carry. When we have finished the work, it will be capable of handling 1,800-metre trainsâand double stacked, at that.</para><para>You want further advice on where the underwritten borrowings are at. They will be drawn down as they are required. At the moment, having signed the lease, there is a mobilisation process going on which it is estimated will take some three months while they put the new management structures in place and so forth. The first priorities will be in the Hunter Valley, for very obvious reasons: we have a serious problem there with the rail network not able to maximise coal exports. Two-and-a half per cent of the world's shipping fleet has been involved in shipping coal out of Newcastle. At one stage there were 60 ships there standing to, and that is a very serious problem. The Port Waratah coal loader is one of the world's best; it was the world's best and it would still be one of the world's best. It can handle up to 100 million tonnes a year but the rail network, even after cooperative approaches to reform, can only put about 85 million tonnes through. We will be doing some work that will bring that back up to 100 million tonnes a year. I am quite happy to provide further details on their intended drawing of those borrowings as they come on stream.</para><para>I note that AusLink saw another $500 million or very close to that allocated for other rail projects, including in your home state. Something that your home Premierârightly, I have to say, because we supported itâwas very keen to do was to fix up port access, and Dynan in particular. I think these measures, the first really serious attempt at tackling a decrepit rail system that we have seen on a national basis for many decades, will serve the country's transport infrastructure needs extremely well. I would make only one plea, and that is that no-one drop the ball now. We nearly let rail die altogether in this country but, with a doubling of the estimated freight task coming at us over the next 20 years and an estimated tripling of the number of trucks on our interstate highways, it is incredibly important that we do not drop the ball on rail reform this time, and that rail must carry a fair burden of freight. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>30831</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MARTIN FERGUSON</name><name.id>LS4</name.id><electorate>Batman</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âCan the minister confirm that AusLink provides for the involvement of the private sector, including the potential use of tolls?

I will keep them reasonably succinct. Firstly, I want to ask him whether he has actually fully read the Ipswich Motorway master plan study report. It is a very comprehensive and excellent document. If a person reads that report fully and looks at the diagrams and the phasing in, a person would not then make comments such as some of those made by the minister, because they are dealt with in the report. </para></talk.start><para>I will address the issues that the minister raised in his response to my earlier questions. On the issue of eight lanes, to say that four lanes plus four lanes is better than six lanes is completely erroneous. Let me put it very simply. The Ipswich Motorway will remain as four bad lanes running at reasonably the same capacity they are running at now even if, hypothetically, the northern alternative is built. That will be a separate road which will also have four lanes. I have another road that runs parallel to it which has two lanes. Should we then, under that principle of adding lanes on and saying there are eight lanes, now call it 10 lanes? I have another road a bit further south which has another two lanes. Should we call it 12 lanes? The principle that some people are applying to this, that it will be eight lanes rather than six, is false.</para><para>Ipswich motorway when it is fully upgraded to six lanes will be a proper, true, modern, safe six-lane motorway. But it is not simply adding on two lanes. The imagery is that we just tack two lanes onto four. No, it is a complete redevelopment. In parts, it will be 10 lanes; in the bottleneck areas, it may be even more. There will be service roads on top of the six lanes, which will actually make it eight lanes. If you actually read the report, you will see that it is not just a simplistic case of tacking on two lanes. No-one ever adds a separate road, another road, and counts that in the lanes. It is not an eight-lane solution; it is four lanes, plus another road with four. If there is an accident on the motorway, it is still only four lanes with an accident, just like it is now and it cannot be fixed. If there is an accident on the new road of four lanes, it would be the exact four same lanes. It is not eight lanes. That is my first point.</para><para>I have explained the comprehensive nature of the report and that it is not just simply a case of tacking two lanes onto four to make it six lanes. It really is more comprehensive than that, and it includes service roads. The claim that I keep hearing from government is that supposedly it is too difficult to build: `It is just too hard to build.' If we can build the M1 to the Gold Coast, surely we can build the Ipswich motorway. Why is that so different? The case has been put forward that it is just too hard to build. The imagery that the minister and others put forward is that somehow one day the bulldozers will turn up; the traffic will be stopped; the road will be torn up; and eight years later we will let the traffic go through again. That is just silly and the minister knows that. What you do is you build service roads and phase it through over a number of years to make it work. If the engineers and the people who are tasked by us to give us the reports and the advice say that it can be doneâdone on time and delivered properlyâthen it can be done. I am not a road engineer or an expert; nor is the minister. The minister must take the good quality advice which is contained in the reports.</para><para>I want to move on then to the quality of reports and advice. The minister said that he would actually look at that when the reports were delivered. I cannot find a better quality report and advice than that contained in the Ipswich motorway master plan study report. It is a sound document. The minister needs to look at it in detail. He needs to look at phase 1, phase 2, phase 3 and phase 4 et cetera to see how to stage it through to make it work so that there is no chaos. Traffic moving slower does not mean it is chaotic; it can actually be safer to move slower.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Anderson, John, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83E</name.id><name role="metadata">Ripoll, Bernie, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RIPOLL</name></talker><para>âThe minister laughs, but obviously he has no comprehension of traffic flows. Fast moving traffic on an unsafe road is actually dangerous. It is lethally dangerous. Slower moving traffic can give you an average quicker time overall to your destination than fast moving traffic that bottlenecks and waits for an hour. It can travel fast, 100 kilometres all the way to the bottleneck, and then it just stops. That is not efficient. What is efficient is perhaps a slower speed all the way along, but a constant and safe speed. Safety here is one of my key imperatives. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The minister talked about the money for the project. He said that it was all in there; that it was not in the budget but that it was in AusLink. That is what I am reading from: the totally new AusLink program. I have here the estimates from the government. The minister can see it; it is in my hand. It is from the minister himself. It says, `Brisbane urban connectors. Five projects: Brisbaneâduplicate gateway, motorway and bridge; Brisbaneâurban corridor; Ipswich motorway capacity upgrade; Ipswich motorway-Logan motorway interchange; Brisbaneâurban corridor traffic management.'

If you have a separate document, Minister, that shows something different for those five projects under the Brisbane urban connectors, then show me where it is. In 2006-07, there is $80 million; in 2007-08, $235 million; and in 2008-09âthree elections awayâ$222 million. To me, that is a shortfall of $1.927 billion.

I understand the maintenance allocated to the states to be $300 million per year for each of the five years. Will that maintenance money also be expected to be spent no longer just on the maintenance of the National Highway but also on all transport links provided for under AusLink?

It is a very important one, and the government has shown its disdain for this industry by leaving it off the table in the so-called free trade negotiations that took place with the United States of America recently. </para></talk.start></continue><para>We have a budget with certain increases in expenditure. The overall increase in expenditure come largely from the sugar packageâit is some $444 million. The point I have made is that it is the fourth sugar package since 1998. During its time in office the government has not been able to come to grips with the structural changes and the uniqueness of this particular industry. Of course, here we have dropped into the last budget before the federal election what I have called the government's 30 pieces of silver, thrown at the industry to basically buy their silence up to the election.</para><para>As far as the sugar industry is concerned, they have gone through difficult periods recently and nobody would begrudge the industry the moneys that the government has allocated. Given the past failures of the government in this industry, and I have sat with canegrowers, they certainly see that they are entitled to these moneys that have been allocated by the government in the budget. But as far as the sugar industry is concerned the failures of the past have been compounded by the presentâthe government's failure to win any concessions at all on sugar in the free trade agreement with the United States.</para><para>You cannot gain a concession for sugar if you take the industry off the negotiating table. That is simply what has happened in this so-called free trade agreement. We had a lot of rhetoric from the government and I would be interested in the minister's comment with regard to this industry: we heard a lot of rhetoric about how important sugar was as part of the deal. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> At the first sign of heat in those negotiations the government caved in. For all the minister's rhetoric and that of other Nationals members in Northern New South Wales and Queensland who said there would be no deal and that sugar was on the table and that they were going to negotiate a deal for the industry, we know what sort of a deal it was. The government dropped the industry, which is one of Australia's most significant regional and rural industries, off the negotiating table completely.</para><para>Let us look at that agreement and the meat industry. The meat industry has expressed to me that it is concerned at the tonnages that were negotiated, the types of beef that have access, the long phase-in periods and, of course, the safeguard provisions. Of course we have a Senate committee examining these propositions and the moneys in this budget that go to the meat and sugar industries. The primary producers think they are quite entitled to the support they receive from the Commonwealth government because they have been dudded in this so-called free trade agreement with the United States.</para><para>There was a reason that sugar was dropped off the table so unceremoniously by the government; we are really talking about presidential elections later on in the year. I wonder about a government that cannot negotiate in Australia's national interest. It has to do deals on agriculture and sugar in the American President's interest. I think that is an important point to make in the context of the budget consideration and the amount of moneys that have been allocated. I say quite openly to the House: I do not think I have seen a more spineless negotiation than this one. We had all the rhetoric from ministers and members of The Nationals about the tough deal they were going to do on sugar. The reality is they are a soft touch. That is the reality: you were a soft touch in those negotiations. The Americans knew it. That is your age-old problem: you cannot negotiate when you are on your kneesâand I have made that point in the House a number of times. </para><para>In this budget a number of programs have been cut. Funding to Landcare will be cut in 2004-05 and again in 2005-06. Funds from these cuts are to be allocated to aquaculture and the quarantine task. We are quite proud of the Landcare movementâthat great relationship struck between farmers and the communityâbecause it was instituted by a Labor government. We are quite pleased that the government has continued the funding of that movement during the period that it has been in office. The farming community, having put so much into the program over a long period of time, views with some concern the fact that the government has chosen to cut funding in 2004-05 and again in 2005-06.</para><para>I note also that there is a cut to the FarmBis program, which is a key program designed to assist farmers to upgrade their skills. If we look at the productivity increases of the sector over quite a significant period of timeâlet us take the last two decadesâit has been quite extraordinary. It is not a fact that is appreciated by the general communityâthat is, just how productive Australian farmers have become. They are now very sophisticated businesses, operating in difficult commercial and climatic environments. We really do have to take our hats off to the sector for the significant increases in productivity that have come over the passed two decades.</para><para>An essential part of that, of course, is the way in which the sector undertakes its skilling and the support that governments provide to farmers to become more proficient and efficient to cope with the changed environment they now find themselves in. In the 2001 budget, the minister announced funding of $166 million over four years but, once again, the minister's inability to negotiate properly with the states has seen that funding and, with it, training opportunities for farmers evaporate. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> In this budget, a rebadged FarmBis has been allocated just $66.7 million over four years.</para><para>Not only have we the failure of programs that relate to individual industries like sugar and dairy; we have the minister's failure to negotiate successfully with state Labor governments on many of these issues. I say to the minister: Labor ministers in the past have had to cope with coalition state agricultural ministers, and they have done it quite well, achieving significant advances in the provision of structural adjustment packages for industry and negotiating with state governments over a wide variety of issues. I am wondering why the minister has not been able to conclude many of these negotiations. I am sure he would say that it is all the fault of state Labor ministers, but I talk to them on a regular basis and I have an understanding of what goes on in these negotiations that take place. The minister has to bear a significant part of the responsibility for the situation that has evolvedâthat is, a significant underspend over time on a key program for the rural sector.</para><para>A program designed to assist in regional reconstruction, the Agricultural Development Partnerships program, has appeared in budgets for a number of years with little or no money spent. Once again the minister has failed to properly deal with the states to get this funding onto the ground. I cannot see the point in having a program in the budget year after year and having these significant underspends. I should say to the House that there are such things as hollow logs in departments and little places where you park money so that you can then shift it about. I would be interested in the minister clarifying for the House the reasons we have had a program like the Agricultural Development Partnerships program that he has sponsored in successive budgets, yet he has not been able to get significant amounts of that allocation out onto the ground. I would be interested to hear from the minister an explanation of why he has not been able to get on with the states in negotiating many issues related to the sector and in particular why this program has had a significant underspend over a long period of time. </para><para>Another expenditure issue in the budget relates to live exports. Once again, this is an area of spectacular policy failure by the minister. The minister was advised in October 2000 that the live animal export sector was in need of major reform. I would like to hear from the minister his explanation as to why he ignored the recommendations of his independent advisory group in 2002âthe independent reference group that reported to him on the need for major reform in this particular sector. The minister received similar advice in the report provided to him in 2002 by that independent advisory group, but he once again failed to act. He owes the House an explanation as to why he largely ignored those recommendations. In that 2002 report a key recommendation to the minister from the independent reference group was that he implement the recommendations made to him in the 2000 report. We know that he did not take substantial action, and this particular industry was allowed to drift. I can recall, being in this portfolio many years ago, when I had the live exporters in my office telling me how things were all very well in this particular industryâ <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>30838</page.no><name role="metadata">Truss, Warren, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TRUSS</name><name.id>GT4</name.id><electorate>Wide Bay</electorate><party>NATS</party><role>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn view of the fact that the time that has notionally been agreed for these estimates is just about to expire, I should respond to some of the issues that the shadow minister has raised.

I am not seeking to cut the shadow minister off either. I just thought I should respond to a few of the issues. This has obviously been the biggest budget for agriculture in Australian history. The shadow minister is right to acknowledge that a part of that is due to the expenditure for the sugar package and the expenditure for drought assistance, which is obviously very substantial. Honourable members will be interested to know that the first $73 million of payments to sugar farmers are being paid this week and next week, so this expenditure is certainly getting on the ground.</para></talk.start><para>I will comment just briefly on the Landcare funding. Landcare funding is in fact committed for four years in this budget, and there is an extra $80 million. The shadow minister talks about cuts, but in fact there is $80 million over the four years in extra funding to secure the future of Landcare.</para><para>Let me talk briefly about the shadow minister's comments about the US free trade agreement and his concern that sugar was not part of the package. The government agrees that it is unfortunate that sugar is not part of the package; we would have wished that it was. But there are very substantial benefits to other farmers from the US free trade agreement. So the real challenge for Labor and particularly for the shadow minister is whether he is going to stand up for the farmers of Australia and support the US free trade agreement. All the state governments are supporting the free trade agreement because they know that it means significant benefits for our country. But the sector that perhaps gains more than any is the agricultural sector, with at least $1 billion a year in benefits to farm exporters, coming to beef, sheep, dairy, fruit and a whole range of commodities. So it is absolutely essential for the farmers of Australia that this agreement is supported. </para><para>I would have actually expected that by now the shadow minister for agriculture would be speaking out publicly, demonstratingâlike Labor state premiersâthat he recognises the benefits of this agreement for Australian farmers and therefore that it must be supported. I think it is time that the shadow minister stood up, announced his support for the US free trade agreement and made it clear to the doubters around the shadow cabinet table that in fact this is something that must be done for Australia and in particular for agriculture.</para><para>The second thing that he mentioned frequently was the difficulty that the Commonwealth has in negotiating agreements with the states where there are shared funding arrangements. The ADP program followed the old Regional Partnerships program, and states were willing partners to that program, but for some reason or other they have gone on strike in relation to the Agricultural Development Partnerships program. I thought it was a good program. It was designed to identify and help areas that are suffering particular disadvantage in agriculture, where there may be a need for structural change. State and federal governments would put some money into a fund to help that industry or that community drive its own reform.</para><para>Sadly, except for South Australia, the states have not been prepared to participate in that programâand I will make a comment about why later. South Australia, though, has embraced it over recent times. We have approved a number of programs in South Australia, and I think they are all going to work very well. Sadly, though, I agree with the shadow minister: there is no point in keeping on putting money in the budget for ADP programs if the states refuse to take it up. So we have given up. Instead, we have introduced a new program to try and introduce these sorts of reform measures in association with industry organisations. We think we will be able to enter partnerships with industry organisations where state governments have not been prepared to cooperate.</para><para>I will also talk about FarmBis. This is a case where I am criticised because the Labor states have not been prepared to put up their share of the FarmBis program. Again, there has never been any questionâI do not think any of the states have even arguedâthat this is a fifty-fifty program. In fact, when it comes to promoting these programs, the states try and take 100 per cent of the credit and do not give any acknowledgement to the federal government. But the reality is that, over the years, the states have consistently declined to put up their share of the money. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> One by one, the statesâparticularly Western Australiaâlargely withdrew from the program last year. South Australia cut their allocation. Tasmania underspent. New South Wales overspent, and I was happy to provide additional Commonwealth money to help back up the New South Wales program. I offered similar money to Queensland, where the funds had been exhausted, but the state chose not to take it up.</para><para>So this year in the budget we have made a realistic estimate of what we think the states are likely to take up under FarmBis, and it is a lower figure than we had put in the budget previously because it is quite clear that to put in larger numbers would be futile. Sadly, I have to say that it seems unlikely that the states will even take up the money that we are offering them this timeâthe $66.7 millionâbecause Tasmania have allocated $0 in their state budget for FarmBis; the Queensland budget came out this week with a record $2 billion budget surplus and yet they have allocated $0 for FarmBis; and Victoria have slashed their budget allocation for FarmBis in half. So it looks to me as if we will not even spend the $66 million, and I think that is most disappointing. </para><para>We come to the issue of why it is that Labor state governments are not prepared to take up these matching programs. The simple reason is that Labor have no commitment to rural areas. They do not care about regional communities. I mentioned the Queensland budget yesterday in which there is a $2 billion surplus, yet the agriculture department has had its budget slashed. In a budget where there are surpluses and Labor are boasting about record expenditure, the Labor Party have slashed their expenditure in agriculture. The Queensland minister is going to sack 100 staff and slash the expenditure in the state's contribution to Biosecurityâan area for which he is always criticising the Commonwealth. Labor are not interested in agriculture, they are not interested in rural communities and they try to make these programs fail.</para><para>I feel sorry for the shadow minister because he has to wear the fact that he has a whole team of state Labor ministers already in office, so everybody knows what Labor think about agriculture, what they do about agriculture and the way they slash expenditure. Of course, everybody expects that a Labor government, if it were to come to office at the federal level, would do exactly the same thing. We have evidence of that already. The only policy announcement we have had so far from Labor about agriculture is that they are going to abolish the BRS and slash funding to ABARE. The Leader of the Opposition has made it clear that he hates FarmBis, he hates the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme and he hates a whole range of other programs currently in place for agriculture. He has even threatened to eliminate drought relief in recovery years. The farmers of Australia know that, if they elect the Labor government, they will get the same kind of treatment as they get from all of the state Labor governments: essentially, no sympathy, cuts in budgets and a failure to take up the offers of Commonwealth funding that are provided to them.</para><para>Finally, I comment briefly on live exports, which is the last issue that the shadow minister was speaking about before I interrupted him. Yesterday, we debated live export legislation in the House and I responded to the same allegations that the shadow minister has made today, so perhaps he might like to read <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> and then he will know that the government did in fact respond fully to the reference group reports on live trade in 2000 and 2002. There were 20 recommendations in all, 18 of which have been implementedâthe others could not be implemented for sound legal reasons. So we have responded to the issues of concern that have been raised, and the legislation that was passed by the House of Representatives yesterday takes another step towards ensuring that this trade is appropriately regulated and that we have in place appropriate mechanisms to ensure that the trade proceeds and delivers good animal welfare outcomes.</para><para>There have been demonstrable improvementsâand I think both sides of the chamber have recognised the contribution that industry and others are making to achieve the kind of animal welfare standards that the community has a right to expect. We will need to work constructively on those issues in the months ahead, and I am certainly prepared to do that. This is an important budget for agriculture. It makes significant advances. It puts in place a blueprint for future assistance for industry in trouble and it particularly helps industries to take control of their own destiny and make sure that they can plan confidently for the future.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>30840</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Gavan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR</name><name.id>WU5</name.id><electorate>Corio</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI will conclude my remarks, which I preface by saying that I was not aware that we were under time constraints. I apologise to the minister if I did curtail his opportunity to speak. On the live exports issue, what we are really facing here is a systemic failure of policy over a long period of time. That is why you have this legislation in the House and that is why the Keniry report and those series of recommendations were produced. The horse is running out in the paddock as far as that issue is concerned. </para></talk.start><para>I think the minister is on shaky grounds when he criticises the Labor Party for any attack on regions. After all, one of the government's first acts when coming to power was to abolish the regional development program, and the office of regional development to boot. The minister criticises me and the Labor Party for not having an interest in agriculture. The government certainly did display its interest in agriculture and a significant industry in that framework of agriculture in Australiaâthe sugar industryâwhen it dropped it off the negotiating table for its own narrow political purpose at the free trade agreement negotiations.</para><para>The minister has been talking about reforming drought policy for years, but really nothing has happened. There are a number of sensible changes to the exceptional circumstances drought program agreed with the states in May 2002 but really nothing has happened since, because the minister has tried to tie those changes to cost-shifting from the Commonwealth to the states. He has another discussion paper on drought to be discussed at the next ministerial council meeting. I think the minister owes the House and the rural sector an explanation as to why he will not introduce the sensible changes to the national drought policy that have already been agreed and negotiated with the states. </para><para>The member for Franklin is not here, but he has requested that I ask a question. Tomorrow sees the House Standing Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry start its first day of inquiry into the impact on agriculture of pest animals. The member for Franklin would like to know what moneys are in this budget in the field of eradication of pest animals to ensure that there is a consistent national approach to solving this problem which is a huge cost to primary producers. </para><para>The final matter that I wish to discuss relates to quarantine. I note that the minister has allocated some additional funds to quarantine in this budget. But I think we have to ask the question that is being asked by pork producers, apple growers and banana growers: just how effective is quarantine administration in this country? There is a disturbing lack of confidence by many primary producers in the quarantine process and I think it is important for the minister to spell out for the House just how he sees the philosophical direction the quarantine process is taking. There is a view out there among certain primary producers that the quarantine service that he is administering is more interested in creating pathways for foreign producers to get their produce into Australia than it is in protecting Australian industry with effective and appropriate levels of protection to which they are entitled under the rule of the WTO. I would appreciate some comment on that. </para><para>Another important aspect of this budget that I think fails country people, particularly farmers, is that of health and education services. I know that is not the direct responsibility of the minister, so I cannot expect him to answer that. Rural areas are among the most disadvantaged in Australia when it comes to these services. In the death throes of this government as we go to the next election, I would hope that the minister would at least try to convince his ministerial colleagues of the importance of health and education services to farm families. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>30842</page.no><name role="metadata">Truss, Warren, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TRUSS</name><name.id>GT4</name.id><electorate>Wide Bay</electorate><party>NATS</party><role>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI will respond just one more time so that we can move on to the next item of proposed expenditure. I was asked four specific questions. I will try to respond to each of them briefly. In relation to drought policy, the government have made very significant enhancements to drought assistance, within our capacity to do so. There is an agreement between Commonwealth and states underpinning exceptional circumstances assistance, but we have provided significant help on top of what is available through those EC arrangements and that, in my view, has added to the complexity of the arrangementsâwhich I would prefer was not the case. It has certainly meant that hundreds of millions of dollars has been paid to Australian farmers that could not otherwise have been provided. We have sought to respond flexibly and as best we can within the constraints of the current agreement.  </para></talk.start><para>It is beyond dispute that the cost of drought assistance measures has shifted enormously over the last four or five years from the states to the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth now meets about 96 per cent of the cost of EC and most of the states have walked away from their own drought assistance programs entirely. There is nothing in Victoria and virtually nothing in South Australia and Western Australia. New South Wales and Queensland still have some transaction subsidies. There is nothing in Tasmania from the state government. So, in fact, the states have walked away. They are seeking to shift all of the responsibility onto the Commonwealth. The only thing the states do is criticise because the Commonwealth is not doing enough to pick up the slack in the areas that they have vacated. I think drought assistance does need to be a partnership and that is what we are trying to negotiate at the present time.</para><para>Regarding the question concerning pest animals, I am happy to provide detailed information to the committee. In fact, I am aware of a submission that is being prepared for that committee to help them with their work. Just a few days ago, however, I made an announcement of significant funding for pest animal projects funded out of the NHT. We have been doing that now for quite a number of years and we will do so again in the future.</para><para>Regarding quarantine, the government's commitment to maintaining our borders is clearly demonstrated by the $600 million boost in quarantine expenditure announced three years ago. That has doubled the number of quarantine staff. It has enabled us to inspect 100 per cent of mail and containers and well over 80 per cent of passengers and their baggage on arrival. That is a massive increase from what applied when we came to office. I think that most people, whilst they are naturally sometimes inconvenienced by that higher level of intervention, appreciate that it is important in maintaining our pest- and disease-free status.</para><para>I think the shadow minister's comments were more reflecting the role of Biosecurity Australia than the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service because he seemed to be commenting more about import risk analyses and the principles which underpin them. I want to emphasise that there has been no change in Australia's appropriate level of protection, no change in the way in which we administer those sorts of arrangements and no alteration in the standards. It is still absolutely the highest non-negotiable priority of this government in dealing with those issues to keep our nation free of pests and diseases, to keep out of this country the pests and diseases we do not have and to ensure that, when we allow products to come into this country, it is only under the sorts of terms and conditions which will secure our pest- and disease-free status.</para><para>Whenever an import risk assessment is undertaken, it is led by a team of the best experts we can muster. Naturally, Biosecurity Australia cannot have on its staff experts on every single issue, so they need to call on outside expertise which frequently comes from state departments or academic institutions with special skills in that area. The three import risk assessments that the shadow minister has referred to have all been conducted under those criteria. </para><para>The difference that has occurred under this government is that there is now a much more open and consultative process. There are opportunities for industry to participate. All of the submissions are open for public scrutiny. That is why we now have these public consultation periods which are going on at the present time, where individuals who question the science that is underpinning the proposed recommendations have the opportunity to have their say and put forward their arguments. I encourage those who have concerns about any of these proposals currently open for public comment to take advantage of this opportunity so that their views can properly be considered. We will not as a government compromise our quarantine standards or do anything which might put at risk our freedom from pests and diseases.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>30843</page.no><name role="metadata">Georgiou, Petro, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GEORGIOU</name><name.id>HM5</name.id><electorate>Kooyong</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMr Deputy Speaker, I would just note that there was a notional agreement of about 20 minutes.

I want to make reference to some issues on the broadcasting side of the portfolio and the recent controversies that have occurred with respect to the government's administration of the Australian Broadcasting Authority and continuing interference in the ABC. The Prime Minister loves to try to control things; he loves to try to ensure that everything in the sphere of government reflects his ideology and his view of the world. This can be seen in the way the government has dealt with both of the most important organisations in the communications portfolio. It is fortunate that the resignation of Professor David Flint as head of the ABA has created an opportunity for a fresh start for that organisation. Indeed, there will also be a fresh start based on its merger with the Australian Communications Authority, which both the government and the opposition support.</para></talk.start><para>Professor Flint was of course an old mate of the Prime Minister's back in law school in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Only shortly after he was appointed as head of the ABA in 1997 he was already showing a complete disregard for his responsibility as a very important umpire in the broadcasting regulatory sphere. On 26 November 1997, he publicly criticised <inline font-style="italic">Media Watch </inline>for criticising Alan Jones. The next day he sent Alan Jones a copy of that speech, which in turn triggered the now infamous stream of correspondence between Professor Flint and Alan Jones which has ultimately led to Professor Flint's resignation. A couple of years later he gave a speech to the Sydney Institute, again praising Alan Jones. There was a further exchange of letters culminating in the now famous letter revealed on <inline font-style="italic">Media Watch</inline>, in which Professor Flint described Alan Jones in glowing terms, such as:</para><quote><para>Alan ... you have an extraordinary ability of capturing ... the opinions of the majority on so many issues.</para></quote><para>When <inline font-style="italic">Media Watch </inline>disclosed this letter it became apparent that Professor Flint was entangled in an extraordinary array of conflicts of interest which ultimately completely undermined his ability to properly fulfil his responsibilities. As a result of this behaviour, the ABA as a regulator and a very important umpire in our broadcasting system had lost any skerrick of impartiality. Playing favourites with the very people he was regulatingâin fact, one of the key people who has been the subject of ABA inquiriesâmeant that Professor Flint, in endeavouring to be both an umpire and a regulator, as a result had become something of a national joke.</para><para>The scandal worsened when it was revealed that Professor Flint had failed to disclose this correspondence while involved in investigating Alan Jones on behalf of the ABA on three occasions. When asked why he did not disclose the correspondence, Professor Flint said that he forgot, despite the fact that in the first inquiry he wrote the letters to the man he was investigating only months previously. Such an oversight by a crucial umpire is completely unforgivable. Despite withdrawing from the first investigation as a result of rather foolishly appearing on the Alan Jones program, he then went on to preside over two further investigations into Alan Jones, one of which, the second cash for comment investigation, ultimately ensnared John Laws and referred him to the Director of Public Prosecutions but exonerated Alan Jones on a rather dubious technical basis.</para><para>Because his deal with Telstra was structured through the company in which he was a shareholder rather than directly with him, he was able to escape through a very strict interpretation of the new cash for comment laws. Labor will correct this loophole and Labor will stamp out cash for comment. Because John Laws had failed to structure his arrangements in the same way as Alan Jones he fell foul of the cash for comment laws, whereas Alan Jones did not, even though they were doing essentially the same thing. It is understandable that John Laws feels aggrieved about this situation. I think he has every right to feel aggrieved. </para><para>Professor Flint's last stand at the estimates hearing recently showed that he had completely failed to understand his responsibility as a very important adjudicator in our political and broadcasting world. Despite his having taken up membership of the Wentworth branch of the Liberal Party and actively campaigning for a candidate for preselection, despite his continued involvement in a variety of issues and public debates, such as the war in Iraq, where he was sitting in judgment in the ABA on allegations of bias against the ABC <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> and despite his continued entanglement with Alan Jones, Professor Flint saw no problem with continuing in the role of chair of the ABA, even though an ever-growing section of the issues, institutions and organisations which he was responsible for regulating was falling outside his capacity to regulate because of perceptions of bias. Throughout this, the Prime Minister refused to take any action, refused to indicate his unhappiness with Professor Flint's performance and refused to do anything that could correct the obvious damage that was being done to the Australian Broadcasting Authority as an institution.</para><para>The second issue in the portfolio that I want to touch on very briefly is the ABC, which again came into the spotlight late yesterday with the resignation of Maurice Newman, a board member of the ABCâwhich I regard with some regret. The ABC has been subject to relentless assault by the Howard government in the pursuit of its ideological agenda. John Howard once described the ABC as `our enemies talking to our friends'. There is no question about what John Howard and his cohorts in the Liberal Party think of the ABC. That is why they have appointed people like Michael Kroger and Ron Brunton to the board of the ABC and that is why they have bludgeoned the ABC board into paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for continuous monitoring of alleged ABC bias, outside election campaign periods when that monitoring traditionally has occurred.</para><para>This so-called advice from the government came from a staff member of the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts and, sadly, the ABC caved in. Leaving aside the question of specific behaviour by either Mr Newman or Ramona Koval, the staff elected representative on the ABC board, I totally agree with Ramona Koval's concerns about the issue at hand and about the government of the day pressuring the ABC board to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars of taxpayers' money monitoring the ABC for alleged bias at the same time as the ABC is being forced to cancel its digital multichannels, cancel its cadetship program and get rid of a very popular program, <inline font-style="italic">Behind The News</inline>, because of budgetary constraints.</para><para>In estimates a few weeks ago it was revealed that the qualifications of John Howard's infamous appointment to the ABC board, Ron Brunton, were described at the time by the government as consisting of the fact that he had written extensively on issues that were sometimes covered on the ABC. I responded to that by saying that Chopper Read would qualify to be on the ABC board if that were the credential which entitled you to appointment to that position. Ron Brunton wrote what was described as an essay to the managing director of the ABC, criticising the <inline font-style="italic">Media Watch </inline>program and seeking to put pressure on the ABC management to change the way that <inline font-style="italic">Media Watch</inline> operates. It is significant, of course, that <inline font-style="italic">Media Watch</inline><inline font-style="italic"></inline>played a central role in exposing the disgraceful behaviour of Professor Flint as head of the ABA. There is a clear circle, a clear connection, between the key players, all of whom are about pursuing the agenda of the government, the agenda of John Howardâthe agenda of attacking the ABC and protecting people in the favoured circle of the Prime Minister. </para><para>The ABC, fortunately, resisted the assault by Mr Brunton as a board member and defended <inline font-style="italic">Media Watch</inline>, but the great tragedy of this is that the ABC is perpetually in this positionâperpetually on the back foot, perpetually seeking to defend its integrity and its independence against relentless assaults by the government. It is about time these assaults ceased. Labor will introduce a new board appointment system to guarantee that we no longer have political stooges of the kind of Michael Kroger and Ron Brunton on the ABC board or, indeed, any Labor equivalents of that kind, and that the board appointments we see will be people of genuine merit who have a significant background in and commitment to public broadcasting, with an important role to play on the board. So I call on the government to ensure that the replacement for Maurice Newman is not another ideological zealot or political head kicker who is there to attack the ABC.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>30846</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MURPHY</name><name.id>83D</name.id><electorate>Lowe</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMinister, I would like to raise a few matters. One relates to the <inline ref="R1924">Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002 [No. 2]</inline> and what is happening with that bill at the moment. I understand it is in the Senate, and I have asked questions on notice about whether that is going to be put up for a second vote. It potentially could become a double dissolution trigger, because that bill would allow Mr Packer to buy Fairfax and Mr Murdoch to buy a free-to-air television network. On behalf of the constituency in my electorate of Lowe, I put it to you, Minister, that that is a great assault on the public interest and on the future of our democracy, because of the incredible concentration of media ownership if that were to pass. The first question I want to ask you is: what is happening with that bill?</para></talk.start><para>The second thing is that there was a report in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> newspaper, in the media section, on 20 May 2004, saying that the commercial arm of ABC Enterprises is putting $5 million, raised through corporate treasury, into children's programming which carries a commercial product spin-off, such as videos, toys, games, CD-ROMs, DVDs, books and the like. I believe that children's programs should be commissioned on the basis of their creativity and innovation and not because they have a bankable business plan.</para><para>The third thing I want to raise is that I noticed that the shadow minister, my colleague, made reference to Rehame monitoring the ABC for bias. Minister, I am wondering what you are going to do about that. I put it you that there has been a history, on both sides of politics, of claims of bias by the ABC. I would suggest that, if the opposition or the government are screaming about the bias of the ABC, that is a symptom of the ABC doing its job. I believe that having a watchdog, indeed a snoop, like Rehame at the moment monitoring the ABC compromises the independence of the ABC. I can point to people in the past, like Neville Wran, Bob Hawke and Paul Keating, who have complained about the ABC. I think it is a serious issue and I would like to know what you are doing about that.</para><para>Finally, I note that the Telecommunications (Low Impact Facilities) Determination 1997 was amended in 1999 to include the possibility of the co-location of one or more facilities on an original mobile telephone facility or on what is called a public utility structure. Minister, in light of the ongoing descent throughout Australia of the proliferation of mobile telephone facilities that are determined to be low impact facilities under the Telecommunications (Low Impact Facilities) Determination 1997, will you seek a further review of this determination in order to minimise the ongoing risks to persons of sustained long-term exposure to potentially harmful effects of low-level radiation from such facilities? When reaching your decision to conduct a further a review of this determination, will you implement the precautionary principle which states, `Lack of full scientific certainty ought not postpone measures to mitigate against non-negligible and foreseeable risk of harm,' as is the case here? </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>30847</page.no><name role="metadata">Williams, Daryl, MP</name><name role="display">Mr WILLIAMS</name><name.id>7V5</name.id><electorate>Tangney</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âSince the member for Lowe is here and the member for Melbourne is not, I will deal with the member for Lowe's issues first.</para></talk.start><para><inline font-style="italic">Honourable members interjecting</inline><inline font-style="italic">â</inline></para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>7V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Williams, Daryl, MP</name><name role="display">Mr WILLIAMS</name></talker><para>âNot an unreasonable course of action, I would have thought. In relation to the media ownership bill, the views of the member for Lowe are very well known and have been often repeated both in this Committee and in the House. We know where he stands, and I regret that he has a paranoid view about the intentions of the government. The government does support relaxing the foreign ownership and cross-media ownership laws. As I understand from the member for Melbourne, the Labor Party does as well; certainly the Democrats do. It is just that there is disagreement about the extent and nature of the relaxation. That bill, as the member for Lowe is no doubt aware, has passed the House of Representatives. It is currently in the Senate and is subject to the Senate's program. We are willingâand have expressed our willingness on many occasionsâto talk to any senators who are happy to see the bill passed either as it is or in a form that would be acceptable to the government. At the moment, there are no offers outstanding.</para></talk.start></continue><para>On the question of the commercialisation of the ABC, or the commercial arm of the ABC, it is important that the opposition understands that the ABC are not subject to direction by the government. The government provide funding. In effect, it is almost like a one-line budget, as is provided for courts. The board of the ABC and the management of the ABC make decisions. As long as they act within their charter and their self-imposed codes and guidelines, there is no role for the government, except by legislative amendment. We see no necessity to interfere by legislative amendment, or otherwise, within the government's limited capacity in relation to that matter. On the subject of Rehame, it was the board of the ABC that decided that they would do what has been done in relation to previous electionsânamely, to engage an external monitor of possible ABC bias. The only difference in this particular case is that the board decided to do it in advance of the election rather than at the time of the election. That is within the discretion of the board, and the government have no role in relation to that decision.</para><para>The subject of the proliferation of mobile phone towers is one that has some concerns for the community. Other telecommunications towers are also causing concern. For example, we are likely to see an increase in the number of wireless towers for broadband. The carriers have the capacity to engage in discussions to share those facilities. My inquiries of carriers indicate that they in fact do have discussions. In some cases, it is consistent with a business plan only to run their own towers, but in other cases it is not.</para><para>On the question of community concern, the low-impact towers or transmitters are in fact just that: low impact. They are monitored and regulated by the ACA, the Australian Communications Agency, and they are monitored and regulated by ARPANSA, the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Authority, which is within the Health and Ageing portfolio. The sorts of complaints that arise in the community are understandable, but there is no medical research evidence to suggest that the standard applied is in any way inadequate. In fact, some of the complaints I have seen reported on by the ACA indicate that the level of emission is less than one per cent of the standardâand the standard is regarded as safe from a community point of view. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline><inline font-style="italic"></inline>There is some misinformation in the community regarding that issue. Perhaps we need to tell the public a bit more about the level of safety that is accorded to them. </para><para>Turning to the member for Melbourne, there was nothing much in his comments that related to the budget. I can only take it that the opposition regards the communications, information technology, arts and sport budget as an outstanding one.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>2K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Brough, Mal, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Brough</name></talker><para>âThat is the logical conclusion.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>7V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Williams, Daryl, MP</name><name role="display">Mr WILLIAMS</name></talker><para>âIt is the logical conclusion, as the minister said. On AGIMO, the combination of the ABA and the ACE, the government is very pleased that the opposition has determined to support that. As I have explained publicly in the past, we envisage a merger of the institutions. It is not presently contemplatedâdo not read too much into the word `presently'âthat there would be any changes in the functions to be performed by the merged institution. It would simply be an aggregation of the functions into one body rather than a separation into two.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In the course of his reference to the position of Professor Flint, the Chairman of the ABA, whose resignation will take effect from 2 July, the member for Melbourne resorted to asserting that the ABA has lost any skerrick of authority. These issues have been canvassed extensively in Senate estimates, and there is no point in going over what has been said in relation to them. But I will take up the issue of the ABA's impartiality. It has at all times been the case that decisions that have been questioned in relation to Professor Flint have not been decisions of Professor Flint alone. They have been decisions of the board and there is absolutely no basis for suggesting that those decisions were not determined on the basis of an impartial and objective assessment of the material before the board, and the board itself has said as much.</para><para>As to the so-called relentless assault by the government on the ABC, I note that it is not the Howard government alone that had things to say about the ABC. The Hawke and Keating governments also had things to say about the ABC, and things were said about appointments made by the Labor Party to the ABC board as well. The situation we have found ourselves in now is one that does cause the government concern. We have a very experienced director, who is the chairman of the Australian Stock Exchange, resigning on the grounds that corporate governance principles cannot be maintained within the board of the ABC. The suggestion is that, because board members are not totally trusting of each other, the board may become dysfunctional. This is a serious matter. We have asked the ABC board to advise the government on the manner or possible means by which these issues of concern can be addressed.</para><para>When it comes to the point that a senior, experienced director of the standing of the chairman of the Stock Exchange says that corporate governance is not in accordance with appropriate standards, then we do have an issue that needs to be dealt with. Primarily, it is a matter for the board and hopefully they will be able to resolve it. But there have been long-standing difficulties with the position of the staff-elected director. The position that the government takes is that all directors, no matter what the manner of appointment, have the same duties toward the corporation and the same duties under law as directors of the corporation. </para><para>As to the defamatory comments about individual members of the board, I do not propose to say anything more than that we reject them. The government has appointed people of high standing who are conscientious and take their duties extremely seriously. I hope that the present situation can be resolved as soon as possible.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>30849</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MURPHY</name><name.id>83D</name.id><electorate>Lowe</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would like to assure the minister that I am not paranoid. I might be obsessional about the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill. I must correct the misrepresentation in your reference, Minister, to the ALP's position on cross-media laws. Your position is to allow a media proprietor under that bill to own newspapers and television stations in the one market. That is not our policy, Minister. I want to make the point again, because it is very serious legislation, and ask whether you are going to put it up for a vote.</para></talk.start><para>I want to make a point very briefly. At the risk of repeating myself, because I will keep talking about this right up to the federal election, the Murdoch company has a stranglehold on print media in Australia with the exception of Fairfax. The Packer family has a stranglehold on its dominant commercial network with an audience reach of up to 70 per cent, as well as 65 magazines of which 30 are the top-rating magazines, not to mention their online services. Minister, you are prepared, under that bill, to allow Mr Packer to take the other significant print media, Fairfax, and allow the Murdoch family to take a free-to-air television network when they have a stranglehold on print media.</para><para>Senator Brian Harradine, when this legislation was last put to a vote in the Senate, moved a very sensible amendment to expose the real agenda of the government. I am quite proud to be obsessional about this bill because it is a great threat to the public interest and the future of our democracy. One day, Minister, the media proprietors will turn on the government, like they turn on all governments and oppositions when it suits them. I will give you one example in regard to Mr Murdoch. He has a right to express a view. He came out and supported the war on Iraq for Mr Bush, Mr Blair and Mr Howard. That is his right. But every one of his newspapers in the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom had uniform editorial support for his view. I repeat again: he who pays the piper calls the tune. </para><para>You cannot tell me that a media proprietor does not have influence. Just go and have a talk to the member for Calare about his statements made in the House in relation to the time that he worked for Mr Packer and Mr Packer's interference in news bulletins. I think that this is a very serious matter and I think both sides of parliament should be working towards diversifying media ownership in Australia in the public interest and for the future of our democracy. If we allow the existing arrangements to continue where media proprietorsâand I am talking about the two principal proprietors in Australia at the momentâcan hang onto everything that they already have, and you are prepared to give them even more, then I think that is absolutely scandalous and the people of Australia have to know about it. As I said, I will keep talking about it and the Labor Party will keep talking about it up to the election.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>30849</page.no><name role="metadata">Ciobo, Steven, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CIOBO</name><name.id>00AN0</name.id><electorate>Moncrieff</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak on the budget appropriations for the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts.

In relation to the television black spots program, I can say that this program is on track to meet the government's target of fixing between 200 and 250 television black spots around Australia. To date, new services have commenced in 194 black spots, a further 41 retransmission facilities are awaiting construction and five projects are being assessed in preparation for funding consideration. A further nine projects are being finalised by their respective coordinating bodies. To date, some $22.8 million has been expended from the program, with a further $3.2 million committed to projects.</para></talk.start><para>Some of the black spots appear not to be capable of being fixed by an analog solution because frequencies are unavailable or the defined area could not be fixed with a single retransmission facility. The government has therefore developed a further program: the television black spots alternative technical solutions program. Solutions available under this program include digital retransmission facilities and direct to home, or DTH, satellite reception equipment for individual homes. DTH satellite solutions have been implemented in two locations and more have recently been recommended as the solution for a further four locations. Digital signal testing conducted in three locations revealed good digital signals, negating the need for a solution, while testing in 10 other black spot locationsâincluding the Gold Coastâhas resulted in further work being undertaken to assess the viability of digital retransmission as the solution. Testing is still being conducted in five other locations.</para><para>The extension of the refundable film tax offset to the production of television series is a measure which should provide a boost to the television industry in Australia. The decision makes Australia competitive with the New Zealand scheme and ensures that Australia remains attractive as a destination for offshore productions. The extended offset is designed to encourage television series productions of a size and scope unfamiliar to our local television industry. I expect these large-budget series will provide Australian personnel not only with ongoing employment but with opportunities to experience the innovative production techniques, new media and production concepts often associated with high-value productions.</para><para>The extension of the offset to include large-budget television series will be of significant value to the Australian production sector. The extended offset will build on the success of the current scheme by strengthening Australia's competitive position as an attractive venue for offshore production. It will provide major economic and employment benefits and opportunities for Australian actors, crews, studios and production services. In extending the offset to large-budget television series, the government is maximising the opportunities for the Australian film industry through ongoing production activity. Large-budget television series are by their nature able to deliver longer term employment, training and business opportunities to the Australian film industry. I am sure the member for Moncrieff, who has a keen interest in this subject, will see the production houses in his area benefit significantly from the extension of the offset. The government also obviously continues to investigate ways of stimulating the film and television industry in Australia. </para><para>Proposed expenditure agreed to.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Department of Empl</inline><inline font-weight="bold">oyment and Workplace Relations</inline></para><quote><para>Proposed expenditure, $1,810,522,000</para></quote></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>30851</page.no><name role="metadata">Bevis, Arch, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEVIS</name><name.id>ET4</name.id><electorate>Brisbane</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI will be very brief. There is only one matter I want to raise, although some of my colleagues who may arrive shortly may have other issues. Whilst there are obviously a lot of things in the workplace relations portfolio on which there is disagreement between the government and the opposition, one area I wanted to comment on and perhaps seek some views from the minister at the table on is with respect to individual agreementsâAWAs.</para></talk.start><para>I notice that again in this parliamentary fortnight the government has been responding to dorothy dixers about this issue and referring to the number of AWAs entered into in Western Australia. Previously, figures of the same sort have been used. Every time those figures have been used, the minister appears careful to refer to them in the context of the total number of AWAs signed. Of course, that has no bearing whatsoever on the number of people currently having their employment regulated by AWAs.</para><para>I wonder whether or not the government and the minister would be willing to actually tell the public not how many AWAs have been signed but how many of those that have been signed are still active. In the normal efflux of time an AWA that was signed a few years ago will have run its courseâwhether its term is 12 months, two years or whateverâand be no more. It is like saying that since 1901 there have been `X' awards entered into. It does not really tell you a great deal about what is happening in Australia today or what people are choosing or desiring as their means of regulating their employment.</para><para>Apart from the normal efflux of time, there are also examples where AWAs have ceased to exist because the people are no longer employed in those enterprises. As they move on a new employee walks in the door, and so one position could have a number of AWAs entered in the books for it but in fact only cover one full-timeâor even part-time, for that matterâemployment place in any given year, with multiple people having gone through a revolving door. In areas where there is high turnover and casual employment that is quite a common event.</para><para>So the figure the government chooses to use repeatedly is a dramatically inflated figure which is deliberately misleading and unfortunately often repeated. I want to use the opportunity available in these less formal discussions on appropriations in the Committee to see whether or not the government would decide to in future use a more honest tally so that we can have an informed and genuine disagreement rather than a contrived disagreement, which has tended to be the basis upon which the government has wanted to conduct the debate about AWAs.</para><para>In fact, the department's own statistics that I have been able to get over the years on this indicate that AWAs are used by an extremely small percentage of the work force or employersâthat is, a very small percentage of the work force have their conditions regulated by AWAs.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AN3</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Brendan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Brendan O'Connor</name></talker><para>âLess than three per cent.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ET4</name.id><name role="metadata">Bevis, Arch, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEVIS</name></talker><para>âLess than three per cent?

But I will happily bow to the advice given that it is about three per cent. </para></talk.start></continue><para>It is not the means preferred by many employers or employees. In fact, there are more people on unregulated common law individual contracts than there are on AWAs. Those people who prefer to have an individual contract overwhelmingly choose to have a common law contract and not a regulated AWA. It might be helpful for the debateâto say nothing of being more honestâif the government chose to use those figures rather than the exaggerated reference to every AWA that has ever been entered into. I am interested to hear the comments of the Minister for Employment Services on that.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>30852</page.no><name role="metadata">Brough, Mal, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BROUGH</name><name.id>2K6</name.id><electorate>Longman</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Employment Services and Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn answer to the member for Brisbane, just to give you some idea of the quantum, there are about 12,000 additional workers every month taking up AWAs. We have put an additional $2.8 million into the Office of the Employment Advocate because there is a higher take-up rate. I know from my own experience back in the electorate that small business in particular wanted the flexibility and the employees wanted the flexibility. It interests me why the ALP is so passionately opposed to giving people choice at the workplace, to be able to have certified agreements, common-law agreements or AWAs, and why the ALP would want to be hell-bent on removing them when people in fact are embracing them. The reality is that they are under threat. They are under threat by state governments and they are under threat by a national Labor Party government. But the coalition remains absolutely committed. As I said, the reason we have had to appropriate additional funds for the Office of the Employment Advocate is simply because of the increasing number of Australian workers who are choosing to take up AWAs and the flexibility that they provide. As I said, about 12,000 workers a month are taking up AWAs currently.

I am not sure how many AWAs have been created in the last 12 months or in the last month. I am happy to take the advice of the minister on that. The question of course that remains unanswered, that the department has at its disposal but does not want to tell the public, is how many AWAs cease to have effect. There may well have been 12,000 created in the last month, and it could well be that 10,000 people who were previously on AWAs are no longer regulated under AWAs. The whole point of my contribution was to try and inject some honesty into this debate so that the Australian people could have before them the true facts and make the judgments.</para></talk.start><para>I would also invite the ministerâI assume he has departmental officers with himâto provide some advice as to the percentage of the population who have their employment currently regulated by AWAs; the percentage who have their employment regulated by certified agreements, union or non-union; the percentage who have them regulated by awards and those who have them regulated by common-law agreements.

This is about an ideological position which is union-supporting, which is nothing more than saying that individuals should not be able to have the capacity in order to draw up arrangements which suit their flexible needs and the needs of the business. It really is a dinosaur approach, because business has changed so much and so have the needs of families. Families are wanting to embrace a more flexible workplace. One of my own family, an apprentice, recently entered into an AWA and, as part of that, was able to cash out two weeks' leave, get an additional increase in the hourly rateâthings that suited him and suited the employer. </para></talk.start><para>The bottom line here is: why have the opposition such a fixation on something which they deem to be such a minor portion of the labour market? The reality is that they understand that this is what the market wants and that the Labor Party and the unions are hell-bent on preventing people having that choice. We know they aid productivity. We know they aid flexibility in the workplace. We know that they will add ultimately to extra jobs.

It relates to the employment services area of government policy. A 17-year-old student in my electorate was seeking work at a local restaurant as an apprentice chef. He wanted to apply for work and was told that he could not apply because he did not have a Job Network card. He and his father then contacted Centrelink to ask whether he could get a Job Network card so he could apply for an apprenticeshipâwhich was his aspiration, his dreamâand he was told that he could not get a Job Network card because he was still at school.</para></talk.start><para>When this matter came to my attention the concern we had was that if he were to leave school to get a Job Network card and then were not successful in applying for work, he would not be earning or learning, to use the recently quoted phrase.

The reality is that, if someone is in full-time study, they can use the Job Network to lodge applications et cetera through the AJSâthe Australian Job Search. Apprenticeships are actually under a different department, but there is no restriction whatsoever on anyone with or without an employment numberâthe correct term escapes meâbeing able to apply for an apprenticeship. There is a 1800 number which I will give you afterwards. I am happy to contact the fellow and put him in contact with either direct employers or any number of group training schemes. I am not sure where he is locatedâI take it he is in your home town.</para></talk.start><para>In south-east Queensland today, for argument's sake, as we speak, we are 300 apprenticeships short; we just cannot fill the places. We do not make any excuse for the Job Network and the services that we provide being predominantly allocated to those who are unemployed and looking for work. If you are a full-time student, you can still access the systemâyou can access the kiosk, the databases, the jobs, the data matching et ceteraâand you do not require a job seeker number to do that. However, in the instance that you relate, if that has occurred and this fellow wants to apply for an apprenticeship, it is easily overcomeâand it should be overcome. He does not require a Job Network number or a job seeker number in order to apply for apprenticeships at all, under any circumstances. So give us the fellow's details afterwards and we will get it sorted out for you. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>30854</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Brendan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR</name><name.id>00AN3</name.id><electorate>Burke</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI thank the minister, but I am concerned that the advice given to this individual may be given to other constituents of my electorate or indeed to constituents of other electorates. I am not sure whether it is about fixing just this particular problem; my broader concern is that Centrelink would advise a potential job applicant that he was not in a position to apply for an apprenticeship because he was still at school and therefore did not have a Job Network card and so could not apply. My fear is that he and others given that advice will leave school, apply for work, not be successful and find themselves neither in education nor in employment.

To be more specific, I ask the minister: what is the government doing to ensure that the departments are not inducing students to leave school; and why is it the case that students, certainly of that age, are not in a position to be treated the same as other job applicants? It seems to me that we should not be creating a system that would allow a person to fall between the cracks, and that is what could happen in this instance and indeed in other instances. What is the government doing in this regardâin the broader sense, not just for the individual?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>30854</page.no><name role="metadata">Brough, Mal, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BROUGH</name><name.id>2K6</name.id><electorate>Longman</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Employment Services and Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThere are a couple of things. Firstly, from your own perspective you should find out from the school that he attends whether they have school based apprenticeships and traineeships. This is a great initiative, something that is leading directly to people staying at school, completing year 12 and doing traineeships or completing the first year of their apprenticeships. It is Commonwealth funded and it has been well supported by many schools. So do that first and foremost because that actually addresses the real problem, which is people falling through the cracks. They can establish those issues.</para></talk.start><para>Secondly, the Department of Family and Community Services run Centrelink, not the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations. I have an agreement with this department to be the gateway; obviously we will take up the issue that appropriate information be provided. Thirdly, full-time students all have the full suite of employment services. This is the first timeâsince Job Network 3 came inâin the history of any government of any persuasion or any time that everybody gets the full suite of employment services. It means that those individuals would be put on a continuum and, from 1 July, they will be required to attend and do three weeks full time at the Job Network, which is hardly advantageous when they are at school. </para><para>So the best place for them until they get a job is school. They can actually, whilst they are at schoolâthis is the crucial point: do not leave schoolâput their resume, what we call their profile, onto the AJS, Australian Job Search; they can have any matches. In this particular instance or any other instance where they are looking for an apprenticeship they can say they are looking to be a pastry chef in the town of Bendigo and surrounds, for argument's sake, and those are the only jobs that will be sent to them, so they will know about the availability of those jobs. They are not required to have a job seeker number to do that.</para><para>Any time that there is a lack of information going to an individual is a concern. Quite clearly, you have articulated it one way; how it was told to the consultants may put a slightly different spin on itâI do not mean that in a derogatory way.

If you go back to 1996, when the government undertook to get the books back into balance and redress the very large deficit that we had, at that time the budget of the Department of Defence was quarantined from any cuts. No-one would have known at that time that, by 1999, we would have been so extensively engaged overseas in East Timor and ultimately in Afghanistan, Iraq and the Solomon Islands. Clearly, those were good decisions at the time. Since then, we have continued to build on defence expenditure.</para><para>The key measures include a $1.8 billion increase in the Defence budget over the next four years. Personnel are so very important to our performance as a Defence Force and to the security of our nation. I would highlight that we have increased in a major wayâby $243 millionâour rental assistance scheme to ADF members. We have increased by $113 million over four years a program to remediate outdated living-in accommodation, which I am sure everyone would agree was in some areas well overdue. There is an $80 million increase in the funding for military personnel in general over four years to ensure that personnel are remunerated at rates appropriate for maintaining a modern and highly skilled military work force.</para><para>Clearly, terrorism is on the minds of most Australians as it is for most people in the world today, as it is on the news almost nightly. We cannot for one moment take our minds or eyes off the key issues here. We have $47 million being injected over four yearsâthat is, an additional $47 millionâfor initiatives to enhance defence counterterrorism measures, including extra funding for defence intelligence and $7.2 million for defence intelligence to support the government's critical infrastructure protection initiative. </para><para><inline font-style="italic">A division having been called in the House of Representativesâ</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Sitting suspended from 12.37 p.m. to 12.48 p.m.</inline></para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>2K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Brough, Mal, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BROUGH</name></talker><para>âThere are a couple of other issues: the government's continued commitment to Operation Catalyst in Iraq, which is about the stabilisation and reconstruction of that nation and for which we have allocated an additional $131.6 million over three years; $20 million for the continued ADF presence in East Timor, which I visited recentlyâand clearly they are going to need some considerable continued support from the international community, well beyond their election, which they had not so long ago; and additional funding of $16 million to continue Operation Relex II, the ADF's contribution to our border protection. The few comments that I have heard from the opposition to date really do raise the question of their understanding of defence matters, when there are issues such as their border protection coastguard; statements that our frigates are not capable of operating in blue water, which is just ridiculous beyond words; and statements about sailors having to jump 10 metres into the water, which would mean they were jumping off a bridge.

Firstly, has his attention been drawn to the report on the Solomons by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade? What has he or his government done in relation to calling for a review by the end of this month on the deployment of troops there? Does his government accept that? Is a review under way? I would be grateful for any advice that he might have.</para></talk.start><para>I also want to raise the issue of reserves. I concede that this government passed important legislation some years ago. I think it was 10 years overdue, but I congratulate them on having done so. But they have made a number of statements and changes in relation to the Reserve and I have tried desperately to follow the thrust and understanding of those changes. In relation to the high readiness reserves, as a former serving officer I ask the minister: don't some of the skills that an individual has derive from joint training? How can someone be a high readiness reserve and yet, as an individual, that aspect of their training is not in a team? In relation to the formation of the ready reaction force, which is a blend of reserves, is it the case that they have to assemble at a common point before they are deployed on whatever activity the government directs them to? Could the minister please tell the House: how long does it take for them to be assembled into their blended unit? Is it a matter of hours, days or weeks? How is that built into any contingency? Is it unreasonable to ask how many Army Reserves are currently categorised as high readiness reserves?</para><para>In relation to the budget being brought down, how many extra reserves does he anticipate will graduate to the high readiness unit? Given the ready reaction force is a blended high readiness unitâthere are the commandos, and stepping aside what I call the glamour units: medicos, lawyers and northern reconnaissanceâare any other Reserve units proposed to be high readiness units or is that the one exception? I talk to people in the Reserve and in the Defence Reserves Association. Why haven't you or any of your predecessors ever made a ministerial statement about the reserves? Don't you think they deserve a ministerial statement? I think that what they and the people of Australia deserve is an overall and comprehensive statement about the role of the reserves and the changes that you have made. We know that you utilise them in slots in the regular Army, and there is nothing wrong with that, but reservists should be more than that. We know that they are underequipped and undertrained. </para><para>Last but not least, Minister, could you tell the people of Australia whether your army model is now based on deploying one and training up one? When you were in the armed services it was based on three: one deployed, one resting and one training up.

We will start with the Solomons. The mission is essentially a civilian effort supported by a substantial military component. The role of the military component is to provide security support to the participating police force, as you would be aware. We continue to operate alongside New Zealand, PNG, Fiji and Tonga. We currently have about 428 ADF personnel and another 200 coalition personnel deployed to the Solomons. The government's consideration of the future of the ADF's commitment to this mission will involve consultation with the Solomon Islandsâobviously it is a sovereign nation and it is their issueâand the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands principals and other troop-contributing nations. We remain committed to providing ADF support to the mission for as long as it is neededâand I think that is the key pointâto make sure there is a stable and ongoing future there. Clearly, the majority of that requirement involves policing, structure-building, assisting with bureaucracies et cetera.</para></talk.start><para>I take it that the honourable member is aware of 7 Brigade and the fact that it is a `blended' brigade, for want of a better term, where regulars and reserves participate across infantry, artillery and engineering. As such, that may be the key that you are maybe not aware of, and if you want a brief I would be happy to provide it. The readiness that we are looking at is varied, depending on the capability that different reserve units and individuals are able to reach. The highest readiness, other than `deployable now', is, for example, when the rifle company deployed to Timor. They were over there for six months and they trained up for about six months prior.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>QI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Price, Roger, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Price</name></talker><para>âI am talking about reserves in counter-terrorism.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>2K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Brough, Mal, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BROUGH</name></talker><para>âJust in the counter-terrorism role?

We have provided financial support to employers. We have Commonwealth Public Service leave guidelines. We have private sector leave guidelines. We are always trying to promote the need for reserves. The last five years have indicated that the traditional mode of reservists is not necessarily going to fit the bill into the future, and Chief of Army has put out a working paper. We continue to look at Defence as a whole, as an evolving science, if you willâthat is what the military isâand at the elements within that, whether they be regular or reserve, and how they can most effectively fulfil their task.</para><para>As you pointed out, some of those could be in fulfilling capability gaps. Some of those could be in having subunits that are able to deploy in their own right. It is not one answer; it is an evolving circumstance through which we are to ensure that we are capable of having one goalâthat is, to defend our nation, whether it be here or abroad, and our interests. The reserves have a very significant role to play in that. That has been recognised by the government's many policy initiatives over the last number of years, and I thank you for pointing out that some of these initiatives should have happened much earlierâperhaps even under another government. That is not to say that there is still not a lot more to be done. </para><para>As far as making a statement in the House is concerned, I think actions speak much louder than words. However, I do take your point that the reserves look to see that leadership, and that it is important.

It relates to the differential now between the CSS, the PSS and the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefit Scheme. The reversionary benefit conditions differ. You would recall that there is a differential in the schemes with those who come onto the scheme after they turn 60: under the first two schemes there is a period of three years; under the DFRDB there is a period of five years.

The department could not give me an assurance that the information as provided by the Ubon Group had been considered. They could not say yes or no. So, in faith, given what I said at that meeting, I formed a three-man committee. They are actually meeting nowâand when I say now, I mean last week and this weekâto take information directly from the Ubon Group. I have made it very clear to them that I have no preconceived position. In their determination I want them to look at whether there is new information; whether it fundamentally changes the decisions that have been taken; and, if so, whether they make a recommendation for the logistics medal. As I or my staff have said to them, they are the criteria. It is not whether we think it is right or wrong or whatever else. If that is the case then that will obviously be what will flow from there.</para></talk.start></continue><para>With the new medal group I undertook not to make the names of the eminent persons known for the simple reason that, as has been the case with many members of parliament, there have been a lot of individuals and groups wanting to make representation. I can absolutely assure you that they are people that you yourself in this position would employ to do such a task, from across the services with both active service and long service. I have asked them to take a look not at the specific request being made by the new medal group but at whether or not we recognise service appropriately and a range of other things. For argument's sake, one of the issues I asked them to look at which has worried me for some time is: do we appropriately acknowledge people that have in fact been killed in training? That is just to give you an example. They have reported their views back to me, and I am undertaking some deliberations.</para><para>In regard to your last issueâand I hope I am on the right track, because I do not have the detail with me; I will go back and check afterwards, but will try and help you hereâmy understanding is that in the event of an elderly veteran marrying very late in life, not for once impugning the motives of the veteran, our aim is to ensure that there is for all intents and purposes a real relationship and that bona fides have been obtained so as not to benefit someone that has not helped that veteran or who does not have a truly marriage-like and loving relationship.

But that appears to be the constraint we are under, so I will be very brief and just try and headline a couple of things that I think are particularly important. As one of those people who for some years has advocated increased expenditure on defence in real terms, I note that there is an increase in defence expenditure. Unfortunately, that increase in defence expenditure has come at a big cost. A lot of that expenditure is designed to deal with the increased tempo. There is some increased capability in some areas, but that is largely offset by reductions in capability in other areas.

A lot of it is going to meet the cost of the increased tempo in deployments. It is also interesting to note that, whilst there is another $650 million for personnel, that actually does not provide one more person. We will not end up with one more military person out of the $654 million. I understand where the money has been allocated, and there is no argument with that. But I think that, in looking at the budget, we need to understand that it is not providing increased manpower on the ground.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I am particularly worried that a large amount of capital investment that was planned is now being deferredâ$884 million of capital expenditure has now been deferred out beyond 2007-08. Taken together with the money that had already been deferred prior to this budget, we are looking now at $2.23 billion worth of planned capital investment in defence that this government said it would spend but has now deferred off into the never-never. That has an impact on defence capability in a very significant matter. Two areas where that is happening are the retirement of our FFG frigates early and the withdrawal from service of two minehunting vessels and also the early departure of the F111s.</para><para>That brings me to the other point I want to make some reference to. I have been very critical of the government's decision not to proceed with the normal evaluation program for replacement of our F18 and F111 aircraft. There is no air study being undertaken. That is a major error. That is distinct from whether we get involved in the JSF research program. I support that. What I do not support is, at that same time, deciding we will not even evaluate the suitability of either the JSF or any other aircraft for our purposes. It is a major error. The acquisition of this next-generation aircraft will be the biggest single acquisition in dollar terms and strategic terms that this country has made since 1901. It is likely to cost between $15 billion and $20 billion for that one acquisition. More than the entire defence budget for one year will go on that acquisition of one capability.</para><para>Yet there is not a program in the government to evaluate the aircraft that we should get for that money. It is an enormously dangerous process that this government has embarked upon. I note commentary of a lot of people about that issue, including that of ASPI, who make the observation that, if the JSF development does not meet our requirements, Defence does not seem to have any contingency plan other than restarting the capability selection process halted by the JSF. That in my view would not be an option. If we get to 2012 and people find that we do not have the capability we need, it will be too late to start doing the evaluation then. That is why the process that was commenced should have continued.</para><para>Inexplicably, and without recourse to parliamentâthere was a press release from the minister's officeâthe government decided that it would discontinue that process of evaluation. That is unprecedented. We conduct a process of evaluation for virtually all other forms of acquisition of major equipmentâas we should. Indeed, Australia is looked on as a discerning buyer. Those people who sell to us use the fact that they sell to us as a marketing tool elsewhere, because in the world our scrutiny of these things is seen to be of a high standard. But in this, the most important acquisition of all, there is no such scrutiny. The ASPI document to which I referred, which is entitled `A big deal' and which was published earlier this year, also makes reference to the problems being encountered with transfer of technology and notes that `even as close an ally as the UK has highlighted serious problems in accessing the necessary US technologies that will ultimately support the JSF'. </para><para>We have, without evaluation, put all our eggs in one basket for the most critical acquisition this country can make. We are at the same time retiring the F111s early. We are for the first time creating a capability gap where for a period of some yearsâpotentially up to eight yearsâwe will not have air superiority in this region. That is a position that I will continue to fight against. I think it is monumentally stupid and I do not understand why any governmentâpolitics asideâwould want to go down that path. But that is exactly what the government has done by its combination of the decisions I just referred to and its early retirement of the F111.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>30861</page.no><name role="metadata">Brough, Mal, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BROUGH</name><name.id>2K6</name.id><electorate>Longman</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Employment Services and Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want to respond to the member for Brisbane's question. I made reference to the Chief of Army's paper on the reserves. He is proposing to publish that in the <inline font-style="italic">Army Journal </inline>in mid-July. For the member's information, also in relation to the same issue, I said regarding the high-readiness reserves that it was 28 days notice to report; it is actually 14 days. Then they are tasked on their specific operations. The training period will vary according to those tasks.</para></talk.start><para>I respect the member for Brisbane's views on some of these issues. Some are not founded in fact, but his concern that there should not be capability gaps is certainly understood. I think we sat on the same committee when talking about the Oberon class submarines and the Collins class coming in. We looked at whether we would have a gap there, and it was of great concern to me. It should be of concern to people that we do not. The government has made a commitment that the F111s will remain our primary aircraft for deterrent. They will remain in the air until such time as the joint strike fighter comes online.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ET4</name.id><name role="metadata">Bevis, Arch, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>2K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Brough, Mal, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BROUGH</name></talker><para>âThe government have made a commitment that the aircraft will remain in service until such time. At this stage we are expecting that it will be out of service in 2010-12, as I recall. I will clarify that in a moment for you. But if there were to be substantial slippage then you could not afford to have a capability gapâyou are rightâand we would not allow that to occur.</para></talk.start></continue><para>With regard to the capital works program, the bottom line is that fewer funds are required in the early years of the program to fulfil our DCP. As such, that goes out from 2004 to 2014. The government have made a commitment of some $18,000 million in capital works. This is an incredibly large commitment. It encompasses things such as the new Abrams tanks, the new ship program with the air warfare destroyers and the amphibs, just to mention a few. If you do not remain at the cutting edge of technology with the best equipment, you are going to put at risk not only individuals but the nation. The commitment that this government have shown with the increase into the forward estimates and into the capital works, outlining directly to industry what we need them to be able to achieve in the nation's interest, shows that we are serious about the security of the country. </para><para>I just want to clarify the point about the F111s. I want to reiterate that it is the government's clear intention never to allow a capability gap. Options need to be looked at and they will be looked at. No decisions have been taken because the progress of the joint strike fighter still continues. We are mindful of the issues raised by the member for Brisbane and will ensure that the nation's security is not put at risk through a capability gap, whether that be through the use of FA18s and midair refuellers or the introduction of the new fighters.</para><para>Proposed expenditure agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>30862</page.no></debateinfo><para>Mr CAMERON THOMPSON (Blair) (1.38 p.m.)âI move:</para><motion><para>That the Main Committee do now adjourn.</para></motion><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health: Mental Illness</title><page.no>30862</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>30862</page.no><name role="metadata">Byrne, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BYRNE</name><name.id>008K0</name.id><electorate>Holt</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want to discuss how we treat mental health and how we fund the provision of mental health services in our community, particularly with respect to the budget. All of us here would agree that the most disadvantaged amongst us are probably those with mental illness. We see them on the streets. If you look at the statistics you will see that 20 per cent of the population, according to the Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing, experience a mental health problem or illness each year. Three per cent experience serious mental illness, including psychotic disorders like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Of great concern is the fact that 14 per cent of Australian children experience mental illness. That is a concern for the population of the City of Casey, which has 40,000 children aged between zero and 12. Youth Services in that area, and other organisations that provide services to youth, are talking about an epidemic of undiagnosed depression, particularly, and other mental illnesses.</para></talk.start><para>Mental illness makes up 13 per cent of the total disease burden and nearly 30 per cent of the non-disease burden. Worst of all, in 2001 2,454 persons died of suicideâ10.6 years of potential life lost. The vast majority of suicides involve persons with untreated mental illness. We spend seven per cent of our health budget on the provision of services to those with mental illnessâthat is, $2.56 billion a year. Concerningly and very disturbingly, other First World countries spend between 10 and 14 per cent of their health budget on the provision of services for those with mental illness. This is a disgrace. When you consider that 62 per cent of people with mental health disorders do not actually get treatment or utilise health services and that 38 per cent of those with mental illness access services but predominantly access GPs, we have a very worrying situation. That is reflected in my region, with the number of people who approach my office with difficulty in accessing psychiatric services.</para><para>One would expect, particularly given the $52 billion that was announced in the budget, that there would be some additional funding to mental health services, but I regret to inform this chamber that not one extra cent of funding has been providedânot one word and not one cent. That was confirmed in a press release put out by SANE on 13 May 2004. My time is short and I want to give other speakers an opportunity. Given the scope of the problem in this community and the concerns that people, including carers, haveâthe lives lost, the loss of quality of lifeâthe fact that no additional funding has been given to mental health services in this budget is an absolute disgrace. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Roads: Ipswich Motorway</title><page.no>30863</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>30863</page.no><name role="metadata">Thompson, Cameron, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CAMERON THOMPSON</name><name.id>84C</name.id><electorate>Blair</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âYesterday I raised in the House major discrepancies in state government plans to dig up the Ipswich Motorway for eight years to build a six-lane road. The Queensland Minister for Transport and Main Roads, Paul Lucas, has admitted that traffic data used to legitimise this dangerous, costly and substandard proposal was incorrect. Instead of using actual average weekday traffic data for the motorway, the Queensland main roads department discounted this figure by 20 per cent. This is a scandal. As a result, $10.6 million of taxpayers' money has been spent on a politically inspired planning and consultation process that was built on a lie.</para></talk.start><para>I want to quote from the final Kellogg, Brown and Root study which was used by the state government to advocate its dangerous plan to dig up the Ipswich Motorway, which will disrupt more than 100,000 vehicles every day for eight years. This section is headed `National Highway Standards'. Under section 2.3, `Level of Service', it states:</para><quote><para>The National Highway guidelines suggest that a 20-year life should be planned for the project from the time of construction and the level of service is `unlikely to be below level of service `B' for more than 100 hours per year'. Phase One of the planning has established the number of traffic lanes and associated service roads, local links, and interchanges to meet level of service `C' in 2011. With additional initiatives put in place subsequently, the operation of the Motorway should not fall below level of service `D' in 2021. This variation will require the approval of the Minister as it is not believed practicable, or desirable, to achieve any better standard.</para></quote><para>That paragraph shows conclusively that the plan the Queensland main roads department produced was not within the national highway guidelines. It did not have a 20-year life, as required; it planned levels of service that are substandard, even on the day of completion of the project; those levels of service were to deteriorate further; and there were no projections at all beyond year 17. The report acknowledges that these achievements are far below the national highway standards and then says that it is not practicable or desirable to achieve anything better.</para><para>The state government report says all that when we in fact now know that the figures it is based onâthe assumptions that are usedâare scandalously optimistic to the tune of 20 per cent. What does that mean? It means that any prospect that it would be possible to build a six lane road on the existing Ipswich Motorway alignment has been swamped. It has been swamped by the massive flow of trucks and cars through the corridor and, until there is an alternative route for traffic, there is just no chance that an upgrade can proceed. Knowing this, the state government failed to respond. Its political goal was to avoid talk of an alternative route at all costs, so it cooked the books. It discounted the real traffic numbers by 20 per cent. It did so to make a project that was physically impossible appear plausible and it tried to dump the whole mess on the Commonwealth so that, when construction delays and traffic chaos boiled over, it would be the Commonwealth government that would have to try and find a way out.</para><para>In closing, I restate again the discrepancy that I referred to in the average weekday traffic numbers. In its plan, that state government assumed that the motorway would carry 80,000 vehicles a day in 2004. The Queensland transport minister, Mr Lucas, has since revealed that actual average weekday traffic on the motorway in 2003 was 99,000 vehicles a day. That discrepancy is a scandal and is something that requires serious answers from the state government. The expenditure of $10.6 million in taxpayers' money has hinged on it and a whole lot of chaos has been the direct result of it. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Leggatt, Delwyn Bernice </title><page.no>30864</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>30864</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Brendan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR</name><name.id>00AN3</name.id><electorate>Burke</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThis afternoon I have great pleasure in informing the parliament that a good friend and renowned community leader in Bacchus Marsh Delwyn Bernice Leggatt has been rightfully honoured by being offered an Order of Australia. Del, as she is known to many of her friends and no doubt to almost everyone in Bacchus Marsh, has been an extraordinarily active member of the local community. Her tireless public contributions include being councillor at the shire of Bacchus Marsh from 1985 until 1994; being the shire president from 1989 until 1991; being councillor of the newly constituted municipality of the Mooroobool shire between 1996 and 1999 and being its inaugural shire president; being a board member at Bacchus Marsh hospital from 1987 to 1998 and president of the board in 1997; and the many other positions she held locally.</para></talk.start><para>The list of her civic responsibilities and achievements only tell half of the story of Del. Del is also a proud and longstanding member of the ALP. Having represented a union at the party state conference and held positions on the local ALP branch, Del to me is the epitome of a decent local citizen. She wears her politics on her sleeve and is an active but not uncritical party member and you always know where you stand with her. If it is not already apparent to all, let me say Del Leggatt will always stick her neck out for her beloved Bacchus Marsh. Given the abolition of the electorate of Burke at the forthcoming election, I will not be in a position to represent Bacchus Marsh, but I do want to place on the record my acknowledgement of this honour bestowed upon Del and my appreciation for her unflinching support for me and my pursuit in representing Bacchus Marsh.</para><para>Question agreed to. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Main Committee adjourned at 1.48 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate></maincomm.xscript></hansard>
