The Leader of the Opposition comes into this place saying, `I am the friend of small business.' If his policy were to be legislated and come into force, he would not be the protector of small business; he would be the destroyer of small business.</para><para>I say to the Leader of the Opposition that we will look at that recommendation in the report. But I invite the Leader of the Opposition to look again at the consequences of his pro-union objection to the secondary boycott provisions which are now in the Trade Practices Act. These secondary boycott provisions were put into the Trade Practices Act by the then minister for business and consumer affairs in 1977. They were a very good set of amendments. They were taken out by the Labor Party at the behest of the trade union movement when Labor got into office, and we put them back in again. As far as I am concerned, while ever the Labor Party supports the removal of the secondary boycott provisions of the Trade Practices Act, it is no friend of Australian small business.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Agriculture: Sugar Industry</title><page.no>25513</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>25513</page.no><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CAUSLEY</name><name.id>4K6</name.id><electorate>Page</electorate><party>NATS</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is directed to the Prime Minister.

I think we would all agree that the Australian sugar industry is in a parlous state—and it is in a parlous state through no fault of its own. It is a victim of a corrupt world trading system, not a victim of its own inefficiency or indeed of its own unwillingness to adjust to substantial change.</para></talk.start><para>Substantial domestic reform will be needed, and I have already commenced discussions with representatives of the industry. I have been greatly aided in that endeavour by the advice that I have received from the government members' sugar task force, of which the member for Page is a member—a task force including a number of members of the Liberal Party and The Nationals. We do recognise the difficulties facing the sugar industry. Cabinet has already considered the matter and will give further consideration after some additional discussions that I will have with the industry and the Queensland government in the days and weeks ahead. </para><para>In the mean time—not only in response to a genuine need but also as an earnest of our determination to give practical help to the industry—we do want to help those in most genuine need, and I announce today that the government will provide income support to sugar cane growers and harvesters who are experiencing financial hardship. From today, assistance will be available for 12 months, which will help ease the financial situation of those hardest hit by the current situation. Assistance will be paid at rates equivalent to the Newstart allowance. Canegrowers or harvesters interested in applying for assistance can contact Centrelink from today to register their intent to claim. Eligible recipients will receive payments backdated to today.</para><para>This support is in addition to the $15 million the Australian government provided in income support in the 12 months to September 2003, as part of the $120 million sugar industry reform package. To ensure that the assistance is provided to those who need it most, income and assets tests similar to those used in the previous package will apply to the new package. A further estimated $5.6 million will be available for business planning support so that growers who qualify to receive income support will receive business planning support.</para><para>I make two further points. We see this very much as an immediate response to the genuine need. It of course will not be the last word in relation to the government's assistance to the industry. I welcome the fact that the Queensland government has now reached agreement with the industry for some further changes to the Queensland legislation. When that is passed, it will lay the basis for some very sensible changes and reforms to the industry. I will meet, as I say, the representatives of the industry in the weeks ahead to have further discussions but I know that members on this side of the House who are interested in the sugar industry will welcome this not only as a genuine measure to help people in need but also as an earnest of our long-time commitment to find sensible, constructive, reformist plans and solutions to the Australian sugar industry.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Education: University Funding</title><page.no>25514</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>25514</page.no><name role="metadata">Latham, Mark, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LATHAM</name><name.id>K26</name.id><electorate>Werriwa</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Prime Minister.

I cannot help but contrast the courage of the British Labour Prime Minister in dragging his party kicking and screaming to support necessary reform with the weak failure of the current Leader of the Opposition to recognise that if we are ever to get policy for universities in this country on a sound footing we need to be honest enough with the student population of this country to say that the sorts of reforms this government has enacted are necessary. I remind the Leader of the Opposition and those who criticise the government that under the new reforms the average contribution of a student in a HECS funded place will be 28 per cent of the total cost of his or her education. In other words, 72 per cent of the cost of educating somebody at a tertiary institution will be provided by the government or will come from private sources. </para></talk.start><para>I ask any Australian who brings a fair-minded approach to this issue to suggest that that is unreasonable and unfair. It is the sort of tertiary education funding system that should have been adopted years ago in many European countries. Compare and contrast the parlous state of German universities, once the pride of the university world. Germany contributed so much in this area but there was the failure of governments in Europe and around the world to grasp the nettle and to recognise that you cannot go on forever pretending that you can provide essentially free university education. Ultimately, what the Labor Party is saying to the young of this country is that it is unreasonable to ask them to contribute 28 per cent of the cost of giving them a degree which is going to enable them to earn infinitely more money in their working lives than the rest of the Australian population.</para><para>We have obligations to university students. We also have obligations to the future trades men and women of this country. We have obligations to the 60 or 70 per cent who do not go to university. We have obligations to the working men and women who pay their taxes and never see those taxes used to educate their sons and daughters in universities. I think what we piloted through the parliament at the end of the last year was an example of a government willing to undertake courageous long-term reform. We eschewed the populism of the opposition. I simply say to the Leader of the Opposition, who once said that he was an admirer of Tony Blair: have a look at Tony Blair's courage and feel ashamed of your own lack of courage.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Intelligence: Weapons of Mass Destruction</title><page.no>25515</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>25515</page.no><name role="metadata">Baldwin, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BALDWIN</name><name.id>LL6</name.id><electorate>Paterson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.

I know that the people of Paterson have been very well served by him for a very long time. The unanimous passage of the mandatory United Nations Security Council resolution 1441 on 8 November 2002 demonstrated the international community's conviction about Iraq and its weapons of mass destruction. It recognised:</para></talk.start><quote><para>... the threat Iraq's non-compliance with Council resolutions and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and long-range missiles poses to international peace and security ...</para></quote><para>The parliamentary joint committee's report, which was published yesterday, confirms that the government was right to believe that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and weapons of mass destruction capabilities before the war. The findings of the Iraq Survey Group, which was headed by Dr Kay, who resigned some weeks ago, since the war ended have revealed dozens of weapons of mass destruction programs in Iraq, and those programs confirm the assessments of Australian intelligence agencies. I appreciate the point that actual stockpiles have not been found. As George Tenet, the head of the Central Intelligence Agency said the other day, we will just have to wait and see in relation to the stockpiles, but the programs were clearly there.</para><para>Are there any alternative views? The Labor Party, as the Prime Minister and I pointed out to the House yesterday, were running around the country saying that Saddam Hussein did have weapons of mass destruction, and now they are running around the country claiming that he did not—although I notice that they never quote the Iraq Survey Group saying that he had weapons of mass destruction programs; apparently those programs do not matter to the opposition. The member for Griffith now says, `Well, you see, we had intelligence briefings provided by the government and so we just went out and parroted what we heard at the intelligence briefings; so when we said that there were weapons of mass destruction programs, that was all the fault of our intelligence agencies.' Quite apart from anything else, I think it is a pretty disrespectful and appalling thing to suggest that our intelligence agencies are just some sort of political cipher of the government, which is the implication of what he said. </para><para>But the second thing I would point out is that what the member for Griffith said—and it will not come as a shock to the House to hear this—was not actually true. The first briefing that the member for Griffith had from the Office of National Assessments on Iraq and weapons of mass destruction was on 25 September 2002, so I am advised, yet on Brisbane radio on 12 July—months before he ever had a briefing from the Office of National Assessments on this matter—he said:</para><quote><para>... it's a reasonable matter of public record that Saddam Hussein still possesses some chemical weapons and biological weapons capability.</para></quote><para>Then on 21 September he told <inline font-style="italic">Lateline</inline>:</para><quote><para>... Iraq's foreign minister is a liar. Iraq plainly possesses chemical and biological weapons agents and there's some evidence that those agents have been weaponised.</para></quote><para>But hang on, this was before the ONA briefings. So he is out there at the doorstop telling everybody, `The ONA has been sexing stuff up and telling me all sorts of false things,' but actually he was saying these things before he even spoke with ONA about this matter. </para><para>The member for Hotham is now the shadow Treasurer and is still a very powerful figure in the Labor Party. I am told he is the puppeteer of the puppet called the Leader of the Opposition. I think it is interesting that on 15 January 2003 the member for Hotham said:</para><quote><para>I do believe that he—</para></quote><para>Saddam—</para><quote><para>has still weapons of mass destruction because there's no evidence to demonstrate that he got rid of that which he had, that pile of things that was established that he had back in 1999.</para></quote><para>Now hang on; who established in 1999 that Saddam Hussein had what the member for Hotham called a `pile of things'? It was none other than His Excellency the Governor of Tasmania, Richard Butler. The then Leader of the Opposition was not quoting our intelligence agencies as his source; he was quoting the Governor of Tasmania.</para><para>Let me conclude on this point. The current Leader of the Opposition, in answer to a question on Radio 2UE on 12 January this year, said:</para><quote><para>Well I think they—</para></quote><para>that is, the government—</para><quote><para>made a mistake going to war in Iraq. Now whatever the reason or motivation was, I think it was a mistake.</para></quote><para>I think that fundamentally differentiates the government from the opposition. If the Leader of the Opposition's policy had been pursued, then today in power in Iraq would be Saddam Hussein—a man who not only presided over weapons of mass destruction programs and used these weapons against his own people and his neighbours in Iran but also whose regime was responsible for, as discovered since, 300,000 bodies in mass graves in Iraq. If the Leader of the Opposition's policy had been pursued, then that regime would still be in office today. The fact that we got rid of that regime and you wanted that regime to remain in office is an argument that between now and polling day we would be happy to have. </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Trade: Free Trade Agreement</title><page.no>25517</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>25517</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Gavan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR</name><name.id>WU5</name.id><electorate>Corio</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Minister for Trade.

He said that the deal must `not undermine the ability of Australian governments to provide and regulate essential services in health and education, including the PBS'. We have made it very clear that we have defended that position. His second point was that it must `not undermine the capacity of Australian governments to protect Australian culture by regulating for local content in the future delivery of audiovisual products'. That was point 2. We have protected that position. We made that very clear.

I know how closely he follows international relations issues, whilst at the same time working very hard in his own electorate down there on the Mornington Peninsula. What happened in Iraq last year with the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's brutal and barbaric regime did send a clear message to the world about the seriousness of the issue of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the determination of the international community nowadays to enforce international laws on nonproliferation.</para></talk.start><para>I think the sending of that message has been very important in encouraging Libya to make the decision it made to disarm of weapons of mass destruction. I think it has been significant in influencing consideration within Iran to become more forthcoming with the International Atomic Energy Agency, and it is clear that other countries, such as Syria and North Korea, are considering their options a great deal more carefully than they did over a year ago. Importantly, this has also opened up a wealth of information on the black market in weapons of mass destruction. The revelations in particular by Dr Kahn from Pakistan on the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction materials have been very important, and the progress that has been made there is not to be underestimated.</para><para>I welcome very warmly the agreement that was recently concluded in Beijing, just in the last few days, on North Korea's nuclear weapons program. Not to overclaim for what has been achieved, this agreement does institutionalise the six-party talks process. There will be a third round of talks, hopefully held before the end of June, and a working group is to be convened to prepare for that meeting. As I say, the outcomes, whilst modest, are positive signs that a peaceful and lasting resolution can be achieved, although I have no illusions that it is going to be a long process. We, as I think honourable members interested in international relations will know, have been contributing and contributing as much as we possibly can to the six-party talks process. I sent a high-level delegation led by Murray McLean from my department to North Korea at the end of January early February, urging them to participate in the six-party talks, and it was a very successful visit.</para><para>In order to encourage North Korea's continuing engagement with the international community, I have now instructed Australia's ambassador designate to North Korea, Alan Thomas, who is also the Ambassador to Beijing, to travel to Pyongyang and to present his credentials. This will open up another channel for Australia to press North Korea on the key issues involved, including issues beyond North Korea. Now we look to North Korea to demonstrate good faith by engaging in talks and to commit to a complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantling of its nuclear weapons programs. </para><para>Let me say in conclusion that the government is not alone in understanding the importance of our action in Iraq to the nonproliferation regime around the world. The member for Brand, who I think on the other side of the House is the most qualified member to understand and focus on these issues and has a real interest in them, on 1 March—just yesterday—said, `Countries such as Libya have clearly become more accommodating.' And that is right. As a result of what has happened in Iraq, the global nonproliferation regime has taken one giant step forward. If, on the other hand, the international community, particularly the Americans, had backed down in the case of Saddam Hussein and Iraq, the consequences I think for the global nonproliferation regime would have been very serious because it would have shown that the international community at the end of the day was not really very serious.</para></answer></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DISTINGUISHED VISITORS</title><type>Distinguished Visitors</type><page.no>25519</page.no></debateinfo><para>The SPEAKER (2.28 p.m.)—I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon His Excellency Dr Dimitrij Rupel, the Foreign Minister of the Republic of Slovenia.

I can inform the House that the balance of payments for the December quarter were released today. They showed a narrowing in relation to the current account deficit by some $81 million and a narrowing as a percentage of GDP from 6.2 per cent to 6.1 per cent. Having said that, that is still a significant current account deficit. The improvement in the figures was led by export volumes, which rose 3.3 per cent; in particular, rural goods and in particular a 43 per cent rise in cereal and grain exports. This is Australia coming back from the worst drought in 100 years. However, rural exports are still almost 10 per cent lower than pre-drought levels. So they are coming back, but we are not back to pre-drought levels. </para></talk.start><para>Imports increased 4.4 per cent in the December quarter and, despite the improvement in the current account deficit for the quarter, figures suggest that net exports detracted 0.5 per cent from GDP growth. We will be getting the national accounts tomorrow. The net foreign debt increased to $374 billion. As a percentage of GDP that is 49 per cent. That is where it was 12 months ago. But the debt-servicing ratio is still quite low; not as low as the 20-year record that we had earlier, in the June and September quarters, of 8.3 per cent but still low at 8.7 per cent.</para><para>I can also inform the House that retail trade figures for the month of January were released today, with nominal retail trade increasing by 0.7 per cent to be 8.8 per cent higher than a year ago. This is consistent with the record consumer confidence that the consumer surveys are reporting.</para><para>The Australian economy continues to perform as one of the stronger economies of the developed world, supported by low inflation, low interest rates, growing employment and an unemployment rate which has been below six per cent for four or five months, having weathered the worst drought in Australia's 100-year records. But the importance of economic management goes on. We did not get through the Asian financial crisis, the US recession and the drought by resting on our laurels. We worked hard at consistent economic policy. It is important that all Australians recognise the importance of economic management and policy. We would not, for example, want to get our budget into the kind of deficit that the Americans are now experiencing—or even the British and most of Europe and certainly Japan.</para><para>That disciplined economic policy is required to see Australia through these difficult times. That is the kind of leadership which this government has been giving over the last eight years. It is the leadership we intend to give. It would be easier to do that if the opposition would vote for sensible economic reform. The member for Werriwa, the Leader of the Opposition, has an opportunity to prove that he is different from the member for Hotham. He could prove it by voting for the government's economic reform. We call on him again to do so in relation to disability support pensions, pharmaceutical benefits, unfair dismissal, labour markets and the reforms that are necessary to set Australia up for the great demographic change which is coming.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Trade: Free Trade Agreement</title><page.no>25520</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>25520</page.no><name role="metadata">Brereton, Laurie, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BRERETON</name><name.id>5T4</name.id><electorate>Kingsford Smith</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Minister for Trade.

The answer is that the government has a very wide-ranging and comprehensive set of policies undergirding regional industries and jobs in regional areas. It is worth reminding ourselves of some examples over and beyond the bedrock issue of very sound economic management and industrial relations reform—not least of all on the waterfront, to the great benefit of our exporters. We have not only retained the diesel fuel rebate for agriculture and mining but also overseen massive reductions in the effective fuel excise rates for transport in this country, to the great advantage of our export and regionally based industries. While we take greenhouse gas emissions seriously, we have refused to sign the Kyoto protocol because we think it is a flawed approach and it would cost a great number of regional jobs.</para></talk.start><para>We have a clear policy on Sydney airport, which includes guaranteed regional access. We have a wide range of regional programs, two of which were, interestingly, singled out last week by the New South Wales Minister for Regional Development, David Campbell, who described them as invaluable and tried to beat up a case that we would have to abandon them under the free trade agreement—which, as he knew, was not right. But he did describe them as invaluable, and that is not surprising when you look at the sorts of things we have been achieving. For example, we have now helped to place 900 mobile phone towers in rural and regional Australia, with 98 per cent of the population of Australia now having phone coverage; and, in over 300 towns, through the rural transaction centres, we have put back face-to-face banking for people in rural areas. As the Prime Minister said, we are a strong supporter of the people in the sugar industry and the communities that depend upon that great industry. We recently announced a continuation of the Roads to Recovery program, which was very widely welcomed in rural areas. It would be remiss of me not to mention the $1 billion that we have committed to regional Australians in the worst drought in 100 years. </para><para>I was asked about alternative programs. We recently had a new Leader of the Opposition come to the realisation that there were some regional marginals out there and that he would like to capture some of them. It is about time the Labor Party took these regional seats seriously. Before he contemplated his regional tour, the Leader of the Opposition did the obvious thing and went along to the Labor spokesperson for regional affairs, the member for Batman, and said, `I'd like a copy of our regional policies.' The member for Batman said, `Our what?' `Our regional policies,' the Leader of the Opposition said. `We need to convince people in regional Australia that we take them seriously—and you have been in the shadow portfolio for how long? I would like our regional policies.' The member for Batman said, `The previous member for Dickson, Ms Kernot, promised that she had it almost ready and that it was in the top drawer, ready for me to dust off, when I became the minister. I have had a lot of trouble pulling anything together since then.'</para><para>`Well,' says the Leader of the Opposition. `That is a bit of a problem. What can we talk about out there, when I go out into the regions? When I go up to Tamworth or up to the north coast, what am I going to talk about? They like roads out there.' The member for Batman says, `The problem with talking about roads is that they have introduced a program called Roads to Recovery, which the bush loves, and we call it a boondoggle.' `Perhaps we could talk about communications—that's a good one,' the Leader of the Opposition says. `I don't know about that one,' says the member for Batman. `We closed down the analog phone service, we closed down the bush's mobile phone service, and they put it back. So maybe we have not got too much to flog on that one.' </para><para>`What about banks?' says the Leader of the Opposition. `A lot of country people have lost their banks.' `I don't know,' says the member for Batman. `I don't think the coalition's record is too bad there either. Across Australia, 318 small communities have got back face-to-face banking services because of the coalition's activities.' `Oh,' says the Leader of the Opposition. `What about fuel taxes?' The member for Batman says, `Their record is pretty good there too. They have not only retained all the benefits of the diesel fuel rebate but also extended it massively for transport. But we are proposing to take it all back again from the mining industry to fund social programs.' `Well, there's climate change,' says the Leader of the Opposition. `We could talk about climate change.' `No, I don't think you ought to do that,' says the member for Batman, `because when you were campaigning for the seat of Cunningham, you said, “No, we shouldn't sign Kyoto, because it would cost 10,000 jobs in Wollongong.”' But now the new Mark Latham says we should sign it. </para><para>On the face of all of this, he says, `Perhaps we could talk about sugar.' That is not a good idea, because the shadow minister for community relations—the shadow minister for hugs—has gone a bit sour on the sugar industry and says, `No, they have spent hundreds of millions of dollars on it and they should not spend any more. We don't love the sugar industry.' So do you know what the Leader of the Opposition decided he should talk about? I could not believe it. I find, in my own home paper, the <inline font-style="italic">Namoi Valley Independent</inline>, the amazing little subheading `New Labor leader says he's an ethanol supporter'. The article goes on to say, `Latham signals support for ethanol industry. On his “opportunities for all” coach tour of the north-west last week, the opposition leader said the Labor Party had always supported an alternative fuels industry in Australia, and it would continue to do so.'

As the member for Canning knows, this government has created labour market conditions in which small business—which is, after all, the backbone of the Australian economy—has been able to prosper. The workplace changes that this government has put in place have had the objective of making it simpler for small business to operate, rather than the complicated and complex system that the Labor Party supports of workplace relations in Australia written by industrial lawyers for industrial lawyers and union bosses. An example of this is the improvements in the unfair dismissal laws, where we again want to make it simpler for small business to operate. </para></talk.start><para>These are laws which the Australian Labor Party have voted against—not once, not twice, not three times and not even four or five times but on 39 separate occasions. The Australian Labor Party's platform is an attack on small business. The Australian Labor Party wants to reintroduce in Australia a complicated and complex award system that will mean intervention in every minute of every day for every worker in this country. The Australian Labor Party wants to destroy casual employment in this country, even though it benefits tens of thousands of people, particularly young people. The Australian Labor Party wants to give unions in this country and the big union bosses the right to step inside the door of every business in this country, even those that do not employ unionists. The Australian Labor Party wants to abolish junior wage rates in awards and, most astonishing of all, it wants to award government contracts to union-friendly firms. In other words, this is code for saying that, if you do not employ union members as workers within the firm, do not bother applying for government contracts. </para><para>This is not just rhetoric; this is signed and sealed Labor Party policy. As the Leader of the Opposition said at the end of January, once the platform is adopted it is binding on everyone in the party—from the new greenhorn recruit out in the branches of my electorate right through to the federal parliamentary leader. It is signed and sealed Labor Party policy attacking small business. No wonder the former Leader of the Opposition, the member for Brand, said `We never pretended to be a small business party.'

I congratulate her on the 10-year campaign she has waged against Labor's rent rort. It is quite interesting that in the private member's debate yesterday not a single Labor member defended the Centenary House deal, for the simple reason that it is indefensible. The essential facts of the rent rort are these: the Labor Party is getting more for an undistinguished office in suburban Canberra than a landlord would get for top quality leasehold offices in downtown Manhattan. The commercial tenant is paying $314 a square metre but the Labor Party is getting $871 a square metre. This is the $36 million free gift from the taxpayer. This is the Labor Party's secret `weapon of mass remuneration'. This is the stinking dead cat at the heart of the Labor Party's finances which the Leader of the Opposition will not do anything about it. The Leader of the Opposition has won the world's greatest jackpot, only this was no lottery; this was a sure thing.</para></talk.start><para>The Labor Party keep saying they cannot do anything about the rent rort because they cannot afford it. They say they cannot afford it, even though they have converted the nine per cent mortgage with Macquarie Bank into a six per cent mortgage with Westpac. Westpac knows something about the Canberra property market. They have just put out their latest Australian property office market outlook for 2004-06. Blow me down if it does not forecast rental growth for property in Canberra of just 2.5 per cent, prepared to the guaranteed nine per cent that the Leader of the Opposition is getting under Labor's rent rort. This is not in the past; this is now. This is not Paul Keating's rort; this is Mark Latham's rort, because he is the beneficiary. This is the Leader of the Opposition's rort, because he is the beneficiary. In 2004, the Leader of the Opposition is getting $3.9 million above market rates. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—The Leader of the House will resume his seat.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83L</name.id><name role="metadata">Gillard, Julia, MP</name><name role="display">Ms Gillard</name></talker><para>—Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order, and I think you are anticipating my point of order.

Obviously in the honourable member's electorate and in quite a number of others drought has been the dominant theme in agriculture over the past 12 months, but it is encouraging to note from the outlook conference that the prospects look better for the year ahead than they did this time last year. The predictions are that, following a record winter grain crop, led especially by Victoria and Western Australia, grain farmers will be beginning to recoup some of the losses that they have incurred over the previous poor seasons. </para></talk.start><para>Assuming average seasonal conditions, farm production is forecast to increase by two per cent in the year ahead across beef, wheat, wine, wool, dairy and horticulture. This demonstrates once again the strong resilience and capabilities of Australian farmers to bounce back once a drought is over. However, the prospects for farm prices in the year ahead are a little weaker as a result of increased competition on the world markets and, of course, the strength of the Australian dollar. However, in spite of those factors, Australian exports are expected to increase by four per cent, to $25.3 billion, in 2004-05 and in real terms by 12 per cent, to $28.3 billion, by 2008-09. Those are encouraging figures for agriculture, which has played a tremendous part in the economy, particularly in the second half of last year, when a 17.3 per cent growth contributed enormously to our national economic development.</para><para>Australia's agriculture industries have of course been greatly assisted by the policies of this government. Getting rid of taxes on all our exports—in a country that exports two-thirds of everything that we produce—has made our industries much more competitive. But when times get tough we have also been willing to assist. This assistance includes more than $1 billion in drought assistance and, in another example today, the Prime Minister indicating our willingness to support cane farmers with some of their basic family needs as they go through a period of difficulty. Unfortunately, the industry does not enjoy the same support from those opposite. At the very time when the Leader of the Opposition was in North Queensland being shown what a sugar cane looked like, he had the member for Melbourne condemning farmers in Queensland and condemning this government for providing any assistance at all to the cane industry. So it is pretty clear where the message is in Melbourne and Sydney. It is only when the Leader of the Opposition gets to Cairns or Townsville that he has any sympathy for the industry at all. So we are looking forward to some kind of a response from the opposition to support the government in its package of assistance to the industry. We will stand by farmers.

The report that has been tabled by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD has proved beyond any reasonable doubt that the Howard government exaggerated the intelligence information it received to politically justify its decision to go to war with Iraq. This is now an established fact in the political debate. This is not a Labor Party conclusion. It is not a partisan political conclusion. It is the bipartisan and unani-mous conclusion of the joint parlia-mentary committee on intelligence, chaired by the Liberal Party.</para></talk.start><para>Some have questioned why we went down this road of supporting this form of parliamentary inquiry. The reason was simple: we wished to construct an agreed evidence base for the debate about the government's past actions. We also wanted to have a base on which recommendations could be made for the future so that we could get the intelligence bases right for our future war against terrorism. The committee has done a commendable job: first, it has now been established that the government did exaggerate the Iraq WMD threat; second, it has now been established as a matter of fact that there was also intelligence failure; and, third, there will now be an independent commission of inquiry to deal with the future. These are the proven facts to emerge from this report. </para><para>The government's response to this has been what I can only describe as hyperactive spin control: first of all, a briefing out of the press gallery over the last couple of weeks that `we, the political arm of government, did not have a problem, only the intelligence community had a problem'—hence that remarkable brief delivered by certain advisers to the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline> among others—and then, on top of that, the frantic exercises in spin control by `Tony O'Leary Enterprises' up there in the press gallery, whizzing around to make sure that everyone had got the line. What we had was spin control on spin control. They sought to control the spin on the war by exaggerating the Iraqi threat, and now they seek to control the spin on having been outed for their spin control on the war. That is what they are up to. But when we peel it back, when you peek underneath, when you actually look underneath, at what has gone on here, we see a very unattractive performance by this minister on Iraq of the dance of the seven veils.  </para><para>We have had a few veils on display here over the last two sitting weeks. We had Danna Vale the week before last with a remarkable performance on veterans' entitlements and we had Mark Vaile today with a remarkable performance on the status or non-status of the free trade agreement with the United States—whenever that might be agreed to, though we have been asked to support it in advance of that happening—but these two veils pale into insignificance compared with the seven translucent veils of our foreign minister, Mr Downer, in his defence—the Howard's government's defence—of taking this country to war with Iraq. When you peek beneath these veils, it is not a pretty picture at all. Veil No. 1 on the part of the minister is the government's defence, `We did not sex anything up.' This is a minister who uses the terms `sex up' and `sex' in this debate with worrying levels of repetition. The charge being levelled by this minister against himself is, `We, the political arm of government, are off scot-free unless a committee established, as a matter of evidentiary fact, that either I the minister or my advisers sat down and physically doctored documents.' That is what it is all about. </para><para>Can you picture Alexander up there in the office with all the advisers sitting down with their texta colours, their white-out, and in comes the stuff from ONA, scribble, scribble, scratch, scratch, until you produce a satisfactory document. The minister and his advisers are not that dumb—that is not what it is all about—though we wait with interest the Andrew Bolt outcome and what that will show. No, the challenge here is to tell the Australian people the whole truth, the whole picture, accurately and completely. They are the terms used in the parliamentary inquiry report. That means telling the Australian people the doubts about the Iraqi WMD threat as well, not just shading it up.</para><para>When we look at this evidentiary basis, this document, this report, we see demonstrated 12 specific occasions on which the government have misled the Australian people by being selective in what they put out to the Australian people. To allay any doubt on this score, if you think this is some grand rhetorical flourish, I draw the attention of honourable members and the public to sections 2.40, 4.40, 4.82, 5.16, 5.17, 5.20, 5.21, 5.22, 5.23, 5.27, 5.29 and 5.32 and the second reference of 5.29—12 specific occasions on which the Howard government exaggerated the Iraqi threat. This is not Labor's conclusion, this is not a partisan conclusion, but the unanimous conclusion of the parliamentary inquiry. </para><para>Let us look at some specific examples. Exhibit A is an ONA report of 2001 which says that the scale of threat from Iraq WMD is less than it was a decade before. Then in 2002 we have the minister saying, `I do not think there is any doubt about Saddam Hussein having stockpiles of biological and chemical weapons. There is a very grave concern that he has been enhancing those stockpiles in recent years.' And what does the parliamentary joint committee conclude? It says: </para><quote><para>Therefore, the case made by the government was that Iraq possessed WMD in large quantities and posed a grave and unacceptable threat to the region and the world, particularly as there was a danger that Iraq's WMD might be passed to terrorist organisations.  </para></quote><para>The parliamentary committee concludes `This is not the picture that emerges from an examination of all the assessments provided to the Committee by' ONA and DIO. You cannot have a clearer conclusion unanimously by the parliamentary committee that this matter was not taken on the basis of the advice which had been provided by the intelligence agencies. That is exhibit A. For exhibit B we turn to what DIO had to say in October 2002:</para><quote><para>DIO assesses that Iraq's capability to deliver a CBW agent in any substantial quantity to be restricted—the delivery of an agent by ballistic missile ... would probably only result in limited casualties. This suggests that, in the short term, Iraq's capability will be limited to a weapon of mass effect rather than a weapon of mass destruction. </para></quote><para>What does the Prime Minister say here in this parliament in February 2003? He says: </para><quote><para>... my purpose today is to explain to the House ... why Iraq's ... possession of chemical and biological weapons and its pursuit of a nuclear capability poses a real and unacceptable threat to the stability and security of our world ... </para></quote><para>What does the parliamentary committee say? It says:</para><quote><para>... there appears to be a gap on the matter of immediacy of threat. Assessments by Australian agencies about possible degradation of agents and restricted delivery capability cast doubt on the suggestion that the Iraqi `arsenal' represented a `grave and immediate' and a `real and unacceptable' threat. </para></quote><para>That is exhibit B. Go to exhibit C. We have Mr Downer saying in the parliament in March 2003, on what was then a UN Security Council veto, that the veto denied the Security Council any further role in disarming Iraq. But he goes on to say:</para><quote><para>Australian intelligence agencies provided hardly any explicit assessment on the question of the immediacy of the threat posed by Saddam Hussein.</para></quote><para>Time and again, exhibit after exhibit, we find that what this minister has done in his presentation and in relation to the Prime Minister's presentation is look at an intelligence report and then, when it comes to public presentation, excise the doubts and the uncertainties—in other words, present a magnification of the threat that exists.</para><para>To allay any further doubt about the specific accuracies in relation to the Prime Minister's claim that Iraqi WMD represented a real and unacceptable threat—as claimed by the PM on the eve of the war—what did the head of the Defence Intelligence Organisation say in this report? The head of the DIO—not a member of the Labor Party; the head of the DIO—said that the Prime Minister's judgment was `not a judgment that DIO would have made'. This is a direct assault on the credibility of the case which the government put into the public domain.</para><para>If there are any doubts overall on this, I draw honourable members' attention to section 5.20 of the report, where it says that ministerial statements plainly were more strongly worded than most of the Australian intelligence community judgments. In other words, the government exaggerated. They gilded the lily; they shaded it up; they did not tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Why? Because they wanted to magnify the nature of the Iraqi WMD threat to justify the political case, when they had already taken the decision to go to war. That is what it was all about.</para><para>Mr Downer, the foreign minister, says he is vindicated by this report. I do not know what language the foreign minister understands on these matters but, as I read this report, there are 12 specific examples of clear indications—by way of what the report has said—of the intelligence being, on the one hand, over here and the government saying something on the other hand, as well as the concluding observations in the report that this simply does not stack up. </para><para>But I said there were seven veils. That was the first—that is, that we did not sex anything up. We will dance through the others, because this is, on the minister's part, a dance of the seven veils. We then had the Saddam Hussein defence. What does the minister say there? He says, `It doesn't matter if we got WMD wrong. Why? Because we got rid of Saddam Hussein.' Minister, point me to one sentence in your memorandum of legal advice where there is one reference to eliminating a dictator as being your legal justification for going to war—one sentence. No, Minister, point me to one word. Find me a single word that argues that, prior to going to war, this was the basis for going to war. Minister, this is a post facto rationalisation—and you know it.</para><para>Howard defence No. 3, the third of the veils, is the second Pearl Harbour argument—that is, we need to pre-empt in case we are going to be attacked. That rests on first-class intelligence. Does anyone now believe, based on this report's findings, that we have had first-class intelligence on Iraq? The case has been established entirely to the reverse. Then, last night, to the embarrassment of the government, the chairman of the parliamentary committee, Mr Jull, said that the conditions which have been outlined in the report—conditions relating to a pre-emptive attack—were not met as far as his judgment was concerned. Frankly, Minister, on that matter, your third defence falls apart.</para><para>Then we come to the other element of the dance of the seven veils, which is called `blame the intelligence community'. If you had looked at the press in the last several weeks, you would have seen that the thrust of the briefing was: `the spooks are in trouble but the government is okay; the spooks might have got it wrong, but we the government didn't exaggerate anything'. I will remind the minister of one thing: the Westminster principle. Who was it who said in this House in an intelligence debate back in 1995, `The simple fact is that ministers under our system are responsible for departments and agencies within their portfolios'? That was this gentleman, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in a debate with Senate Evans about responsibility for actions and activities within the Australian Secret Intelligence Service. In other words, Westminster then—owning responsibility for what your agencies do rather than kissing it goodbye.</para><para>In eight years of Howard government, you have been responsible for the structure of your intelligence services, and here is your central failing: when you embarked upon a policy of global pre-emption with the United States, you did not engage in a parallel restructuring of the Australian intelligence services to give them the resources and capabilities to look at new theatres of potential military operation. The bulk of our intelligence agencies' resources are concentrated in our own immediate region—and this government decides to focus on Afghanistan and Iraq. When it comes to Iraq, when we get to the lead-up to the war, how many analysts in the Office of National Assessments does this government have working on Iraq related matters? A total of three analysts—and then not even full-time—were supposed to consume and independently analyse the totality of the global intelligence product and make some independent assessment of it. Minister, you have got to be dreaming!</para><para>Defence No. 5, the fifth of the seven veils, is: if you can't blame the spooks, blame the Yanks and the Brits. They say that 97 per cent of the intelligence came from offshore. Well, that is terrific. The purpose of ONA is to vet the offshore product—and, based on what I just said, you had three officers within ONA whose job it was to do that. You did not equip them with the capacity to do that. </para><para>Defence No. 6 is the one I love most of all: blame the opposition. The sixth of the seven veils is that it was our fault that the government took us to war based on false intelligence. This is terrific—the ultimate Orwellian triumph as far as your truth management in this entire exercise is concerned. It was the opposition's fault, honourable members, that we were foolish enough to believe what the government said to us at the time—it was our fault and not theirs. It was our fault that we believed the intelligence briefings that we were given at the time—our fault and not theirs. Minister, what language are you speaking?</para><para>The seventh of the seven veils, as the minister has said, is: why would we need a royal commission? Minister, how can you read this report and not conclude that we need an independent commission of inquiry to restructure our intelligence services in the future and to ensure that we have confidence that your government will not politically manipulate intelligence information in the future? I would suggest that the case for that is now rolled gold and clear for everybody who reads this report with any clarity and objectivity. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

If this were such a big issue for the Labor Party, instead of an issue inspiring mock indignation, wouldn't they have moved censure motions or submitted MPIs on Iraq and weapons of mass destruction? I may be wrong, but I think this is the first MPI we have had on this issue for a very long time. In the end I think that the core issue of debate here is about Iraq and Saddam Hussein's regime. That is the only issue that really matters. When the Leader of the Opposition, on radio 2UE<inline font-style="italic"></inline>on 12 January, said, `Well, I think they made a mistake in going to war in Iraq. Now, whatever the reason or motivation was, I think it was a mistake,' he was making a point that we as a government profoundly disagree with.</para></talk.start><para>Essentially, when it comes to the next election in this country the public, insofar as they reflect on events that have come and gone, will make this judgment: do we think that this world would have been a better place if the regime of Saddam Hussein had remained in power, with its weapons of mass destruction programs, its appalling record of human rights abuse, its slaughter of some 300,000 of its own citizens, its use of chemical weapons against its own people—the Kurds—and its use of chemical weapons against its next-door neighbours? The public will judge whether the world would have been a better place if that regime had remained in office or whether the world is a better place without it. That is ultimately what this boils down to.</para><para>The opposition can huff and puff all they like, trying to find little quotes here and there, sexing up bits of information—as they so often do—and trying to claim that these are issues of enormous and monumental importance. But ultimately the only issue of importance is whether the people of this country think that we as a nation have done the right thing in overthrowing and getting rid of the evil regime of Saddam Hussein or whether the world would have been a better place if it had implemented the policy of the Labor Party and Saddam Hussein was still in power. That is the core issue. </para><para>The parliamentary joint committee report vindicates the government's use of intelligence in making the case for action against Iraq. The bipartisan report confirms that there was no evidence that political pressure was applied to agencies and there was no overt pressure from the government to change assessments. I tried to explain this on the radio this morning. It is obvious that the government would not try to change assessments. These are classified assessments that come to the government. They are not written for publication; they are assessments that we read in the privacy of our offices. Sure, from time to time we use material from these assessments—of course we often use material from the assessments—but the actual assessments physically come to us in classified form. The government would not have any motive—let alone have done it—in getting our intelligence agencies to modify the assessments they make. The point I make here is—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83T</name.id><name role="metadata">Rudd, Kevin, MP</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—The member for Griffith seems to forget that he was warned by the Speaker before the MPI.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4G4</name.id><name role="metadata">Downer, Alexander, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DOWNER</name></talker><para>—People like the member for Griffith impugn the integrity of our intelligence agencies by suggesting that the people in our intelligence agencies are somehow politicised and are not professional after all.

It has to be said that there is a limited number of the so-called anti-war commentators—as they might call themselves—who share that view. We see the articles from time to time. The member for Griffith looks at people in the gallery with a wry smile. It says it all. The fact is that the intelligence agencies of this country do an extraordinarily good job. The fact that we facilitated the cooperation by ONA and DIO with the inquiry simply demonstrates that we are quite happy to be transparent about these issues.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The opposition spokesman says there should be a royal commission. He was calling for a royal commission before this inquiry was even complete. The opposition spokesman is not to be taken seriously. To call for a royal commission before an inquiry has even been finished demonstrates the point that he never stops playing political games. The public are right on to that. There is not a serious point to be made.</para><para>We have to understand that one of the assumptions on which the arguments used against the Australian, British and American governments are built is that actually Saddam Hussein had nothing to do with weapons of mass destruction. These people accept that he was a human rights abuser; I am not saying that people in the Labor Party, the anti-war lobby or the media thought that Saddam Hussein was a great guy—of course they did not. But they seem to think that, since the war is over, we can now safely conclude that Saddam Hussein had no worse a record on weapons of mass destruction than the Prime Minister of Samoa.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LN6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hatton, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Hatton</name></talker><para>—That's false.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4G4</name.id><name role="metadata">Downer, Alexander, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DOWNER</name></talker><para>—The member for Blaxland says that is false. If that is false, it must be true that Saddam Hussein has a bad record on weapons of mass destruction. But that is not what we are hearing from the opposition. The fact that the Iraq Survey Group has found that Saddam Hussein maintained weapons of mass destruction programs is something that they quickly sweep over. They do not want to tell the Australian public that Dr Kay and the Iraq Survey Group have found that Saddam Hussein did indeed maintain dozens of weapons of mass destruction programs. That was revealed in the interviews and the investigations that have taken place since the end of the war. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Sure, we all understand that the stockpiles have not been found and we all know what George Tenet has said about that. On 5 February he said, `The Iraq survey group is nowhere near 85 per cent finished'—and David Kay had said that it was 85 per cent finished. The fact that Saddam Hussein still had weapons of mass destruction programs—and you can convert such programs into actual weapons within a very short period of time, which is demonstrated by the DIO report that has been quoted constantly in the last couple of days—apparently does not matter. Apparently, according to these people, it does not matter that Saddam Hussein was found to have weapons of mass destruction programs and also, according to Dr Kay, was in clear breach of Security Council resolution 1441.</para><para>I hear the Leader of the Opposition say—it is one of his constant platitudes—that the opposition's foreign policy is built on three principles: the alliance with America, relations with Asia, and the United Nations. Everybody is in favour of those things. But, if the United Nations is so important, why does it not seem to matter that the Kay report has demonstrated that Saddam Hussein was in breach of Security Council resolution 1441, which was an enforceable and mandatory Security Council resolution? Why do they avoid ever mentioning that? Why is that not germane to this debate?</para><para>This debate has to be very much about the quality of the person who used to lead Iraq: the endeavour by Saddam Hussein to circumvent United Nations inspections, the endeavour by Saddam Hussein to maintain weapons of mass destruction programs, and the record of Saddam Hussein in using those weapons against his own people and his neighbours. You would not think from listening to the member for Griffith that any of those things mattered. I do not mind what the member for Griffith or other members opposite say; for me, those issues and the human rights issues to boot are profoundly important.</para><para>There will not be a day between now and the day I die that for one minute I will regret the decision we took to participate in the overthrow of the regime of Saddam Hussein. It was and always has been a difficult issue politically. But I and my colleagues in the coalition know that, if it were not for us and the Americans and the British, the regime of Saddam Hussein would still be there today. He would still be there with his weapons of mass destruction programs. He would still be there abusing human rights—and that is the policy that is supported by those opposite: to have left him there in office. That is a debate that we are happy to have between now and polling day. We will have it over and again, and we are happy to do that.</para><para>Today is one day after the publication of that report and the opposition spokesman has asked only one question on this issue. What could be the explanation for the opposition spokesman getting only one miserable question up on this issue? I suspect there is a very clear explanation for that and it is not just tied up with the personal relationship between the opposition spokesman and the Leader of the Opposition; I think it is much more to do with the fact that the opposition knows in its heart only too well that the arguments I make here today are arguments that so many of the good people in this country agree with.</para><para>Let me finally make this point about the opposition: the opposition spokesman on foreign affairs, the excitable and garrulous member for Griffith, was out there arguing before the war that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction.

The former Leader of the Opposition gave the game away because his source—one of the important sources often quoted by the government and others, which is fair enough as it was one of the opposition's main sources—was the 1999 UNSCOM report on the inventory of undiscovered and unknown weapons of mass destruction components. And who drew up that inventory? None other than Richard Butler, well known to many opposite, the Governor of Tasmania.

I would like to acknowledge the tremendous work done by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD in looking at this issue of weapons of mass destruction; I think it is a very profound report. It contains only three recommendations, but they are fundamental; and, in the best traditions of the parliament, it is a unanimous report. Chaired by the member for Fadden, the committee has some big hitters, I must say, on the Labor side. But I commend all the committee members for the work they have done.</para></talk.start><para>Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, you may remember another report, but I have never seen a report so extensively leaked to the media prior to its tabling. I think on the Labor side and perhaps even on the government side there are few doubts about where the leak came from. I want to make it quite clear that I accuse no member of the committee of leaking it. The only other group of people who had the report of course were the ministers. But I will leave that aside. I think it is a tragedy to see such a fine report extensively leaked to the press and to see nothing done about it. And this is not some mere incidental item, of passing interest to the Australian people; this is a report on our intelligence agencies, this is a report on the probity of our ministers in dealing with the advice that they received from our intelligence agencies and this is a report that was extensively leaked to the newspapers before its release. It is an utter disgrace. But I think it gives a clue that the ministers in this most serious matter—where, more than any other ministers, they have special responsibilities because of the trust they hold on behalf of the parliament and on behalf of the Australian people—have not been open and honest with the Australian people. </para><para>The Minister for Foreign Affairs was in here saying, `Labor, you accused us of unfairly influencing the intelligence agencies'—the DIO, the Office of National Assessments, ASIS; that that is what we accused the government of. We did not accuse the government of that. We have never accused the government of unduly influencing the agencies. In fact, the committee say that they questioned the heads of the intelligence agencies, and they said that they were not subjected to that sort of pressure. So why the minister should come in here and say, `Look, this vindicates us,' because they have been found innocent of something we never accused them of—and that hinges the whole argument—I will never understand.</para><para>The Minister for Foreign Affairs says we should be pleased that Saddam Hussein, a dictator, is no longer in Iraq; Saddam Hussein, who persecuted minorities and majorities in Iraq, is no longer a dictator in Iraq; Saddam Hussein, who used chemical weapons on Kurds in Iraq, is no longer there; and we should all be pleased.

When there were qualifiers in there, they were never enumerated. In the latter part of his speech on this MPI, the Minister for Foreign Affairs talked about the inventory of chemical weapons that the Prime Minister used to go to war.

It is interesting that our intelligence organisations probably performed a little better than our US and British counterparts, but they still got it wrong, and that has to be an issue of concern. When I said that there was no political interference, there is one fact that the committee draws upon that I think all members and the Australian public should be conscious of. That is that the Office of National Assessments—which, admittedly, as the shadow minister for foreign affairs pointed out, had three people working on the Iraqi brief; three part-timers—on 12 September made a statement that there was no firm evidence of new chemical and biological weapon production but then on the next day, on the 13th, issued an assessment that Iraq had almost certainly been working to increase its capability to make chemical and biological weapons. In 24 hours, what changed?</para><para>But the equally important question is: what did the Prime Minister do in regard to this 24-hour turnaround? What questions did he ask that led to such a dramatic flip-flop? What questions did the Minister for Foreign Affairs ask that led to such a dramatic flip-flop? What did the Minister for Defence ask of those assessments that resulted in such a dramatic flip-flop?</para><para>This is a very important MPI. It goes to the heart of national security. Already, we have had the intervention by the shadow minister for foreign affairs about what constitutes military pre-emption being valid under international law. The answer is that you must have clear evidence of weapons of mass destruction existing which constitute a real and present danger. The committee found the truth: that that did not exist.</para><para>I want to say to the House that I have just come back from Indonesia and that they are very interested in John Howard's ideas on military pre-emption. I accept that Iraq does not normally constitute a high priority area for us getting raw intelligence about. But certainly Indonesia does. If the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Prime Minister are going to continue to repeat their determination to have military pre-emption against terrorists in our region, it is utterly critical that intelligence has to be bloody better than what it was. It has to be a lot better.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

The first of those questions is whether or not there was a misuse of intelligence informing the judgments, developing the decisions and leading to the actions which the government took. Secondly, there is the core question which really underpins this whole debate: was there an essential justification for the action, which the Australian government participated in, of helping to oust the regime led by Saddam Hussein, Uday Hussein, Qusay Hussein and the Baathist regime? Those are the two questions. </para></talk.start><para>In looking at those two questions, let me begin with the first issue, of whether or not there was misuse of intelligence. I want to begin with four simple quotes. The first is from the member for Griffith on 24 September 2002 on <inline font-style="italic">Lateline</inline>:</para><quote><para>There is no debate or dispute as to whether Saddam Hussein possesses weapons of mass destruction.</para><para>He does.</para></quote><para>I remind the House that these are the member for Griffith's own words:</para><quote><para>There's no dispute as whether he's in violation of UN Security Council resolutions.</para><para>He is.</para></quote><para>The second quote is from the then Leader of the Opposition and current member for Hotham. On ABC Radio on Thursday, 14 November 2002 he said:</para><quote><para>What was disturbing was the regime saying that they didn't have any weapons of mass destruction. Well, I don't believe that.</para><para>We know they have weapons of mass destruction ...</para></quote><para>The third quote is from someone not reliant in any way upon the Australian intelligence system or the international intelligence which passed through it but who was perhaps the world's single greatest expert on the condition within Iraq in relation to weapons of mass destruction: Richard Butler, the current Governor of Tasmania and the former head of the UN Special Commission on Iraq, which was charged with seeking Iraq's weapons of mass destruction capability. His words on 15 September 2002 on the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday</inline> program were:</para><quote><para>The greatest threat against the non-proliferation regimes in nuclear, chemical and biology that exists today is the regime of Saddam Hussein. And we are threatened by that.</para></quote><para>That was from Richard Butler, former head of UNSCOM. The fourth quote—and this is a captivating piece of information that is rarely acknowledged—is from the head of the Iraq Survey Group, David Kay, who did not give a clean bill of health on everything, who was robust in what he said. His words on NBC on 27 January 2004 were:</para><quote><para>... I think at the end of the inspection process we'll paint a picture of Iraq that was far more dangerous than even we thought it was before the war. It was of a system collapsing. It was a country that had the capability in weapons of mass destruction areas and in which terrorists, like ants to honey, were going after it.</para></quote><para>He draws a picture of a country which had more than was expected, although not everything that was expected, and that had links to terrorists units, cells and groups. Those relate to some of the veracity of this debate. What is the background we see there? We see that throughout the different sources of information there was a unified agreement and belief that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction programs. And it did. The facts have been borne out: Iraq had a sophisticated and developed weapons of mass destruction program, the facts of which were exposed throughout the 1990s.</para><para>In looking at the question of truth and the use of intelligence, what we find from the parliamentary joint committee report is a very simple conclusion, ultimately: that in relation to the Australian government's actions there was no pressure on the intelligence agencies, that there was no pressure to change assessments, that there was ultimately a fundamental verification of what was said. </para><para>I go back to David Kay, the head of the Iraq Survey Group. They did not find everything that was expected; that is absolutely true. But they have found many things which far exceeded that which they had ever expected to find, and that is a frightening reminder that we went with a purpose, we pursued that purpose and that purpose has been borne out in fact and empirically. There are three key points from David Kay, the head of the Iraq Survey Group: (1) that there were extensive concealment efforts in Iraq, (2) that it was more dangerous in Iraq than we thought before the war and (3) that there were dozens of weapons of mass destruction related programs in Iraq. Those are the facts, the realities, the findings, the empirical truth of what was the case and what has been discovered since the conflict in Iraq. We see that all of that goes to this point: here we had a brutal regime which was pursuing weapons of mass destruction capability.</para><para>This leads to the second great issue in this debate: was there a fundamental justification for the actions taken by the United States, by the United Kingdom led by Tony Blair, and by the Australian government? There are three critical reasons, which are linked, each of which, in their own right, would have been sufficient justification but which together form an undeniable base for the action. I say this knowing that 20, 30, 40 years from now what I say today is something for which I should be held to account.</para><para>The following are fundamental reasons why this action was justified. First, there was a weapons of mass destruction capability, and there was a program which was highly developed and had been developed over a period of years. You start with the fact that there was use. You have Halabja in 1987: 5,000 people were exterminated using poison gas, within Iraq, by the Iraqi regime. That is use, possession, ownership, extermination. Second, in the conflict with Iran, there was exactly the same pattern. Third, in 1995, after declaring themselves to be entirely free of weapons of mass destruction, we found that there were defections from within Saddam Hussein's own family, and 8,500 litres of anthrax and botulin toxin was released, and other chemical agents were exposed—all of which had been denied, all of which had been concealed, all of which had escaped the awareness of the UN Special Commission.</para><para>In 1998, the UNSCOM chief, Richard Butler, on leaving Iraq pointed to hidden and undisclosed amounts of VX nerve gas, chemical munitions, anthrax, sarin. Those were real, and those were the findings—not of Australia, not of other individual countries but of the international community. In 1999, troops surrounded Kerbala, wearing white chemical suits, sending a very powerful message to the Shiites and Marsh Arabs in the south. Iraq had clear terrorist links to the MEK—the Mujaheddin al-Khalq—the Palestinian Liberation Front, the Abu Nidal organisation and Ansar al Islam; and this is irrespective of al-Qaeda. So even if there was never any contact, there were four core groups with terrorist histories, links and activities closely integrated with the Iraqi regime. And that builds on the fact that there was a highly sophisticated program in relation to weapons of mass destruction. </para><para>Finally, this was a regime which, in the last 20 years, had an unprecedented record of human rights atrocities: 300,000 deaths, including extermination of the Marsh Arab population, the Shiite population and the Kurd population. Amnesty and Human Rights Watch found instances of beheading, machine-gunning, burying people alive, eye gouging, electric shocks, pulling of fingernails. Those were the stock in trade of this regime. So there were costs of action and costs of inaction. The costs of inaction were the continuation of the weapons of mass destruction programs, the continuation of the links with those four terrorist organisations, and, perhaps above all else, the continuation of the human rights abuses which led to the extermination of 300,000 souls. So, at the end of the day, was the intelligence misused? No. At the end of the day, was there a just cause? Absolutely. There was a just cause. It was a difficult choice between action and inaction, but I say this: I have only one regret in relation to this debate, and that is not that we acted but that we did not act sooner, that we waited for a decade whilst 300,000 souls perished. The Australian government was fundamentally justified in its actions. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Hon.

The agreement has resulted in several amendments to the bill. These replace the Senate amendments disagreed to by this House on 19 August 2003. The amendments clarify appeal rights. The Australian Industrial Relations Commission will also be required to apply a strict no disadvantage test when there is a transmission of business and an order is sought seeking to vary the application of a certified agreement. There is an exception to this requirement where the transmission is part of a reasonable strategy to deal with a short-term crisis in, and to assist in the revival of, a transmitted business. In return, the government has also agreed to hold an independent review of the transmission of business laws in late 2005. Among other things, this review will examine the best approach for identifying whether a transmission of business has occurred, as well as the effectiveness of the commission's new powers to deal with transmitted certified agreements. Finally, I would like to thank the Australian Democrats for their pragmatic and constructive approach to this legislation. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>25547</page.no><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Dr EMERSON</name><name.id>83V</name.id><electorate>Rankin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The primary purpose of transmission of business provisions in industrial law is to ensure that conditions of employment are maintained on the sale or transfer of a business. Without such provisions, employers would be able to get out of terms and conditions of employment by simply changing the company's name. The government has sought to remove these protections for employees. The government's <inline ref="R1532">Workplace Relations Amendment (Transmission of Business) Bill 2002</inline> seeks to give employers the right to avoid their obligations in respect of certified agreements if they are selling or buying a business or even if such a sale is merely likely.</para></talk.start><para>The bill was amended in the Senate, with the government accepting amendments insisted on by the Democrats but not those insisted on by Labor. Consequently, Labor remain opposed to this bill as amended. In respect of the Democrat amendments, we acknowledge that they improve the bill by limiting somewhat the commission's discretion to depart from existing arrangements. The amended bill now requires that additional criteria be satisfied before the commission can exempt employers from enterprise agreements on transmission of business. There now has to be agreement of the parties to the agreement, agreement of the majority of employees affected, a finding that the employees would not be disadvantaged in relation to their terms or conditions of employment or a finding that the exemption is part of a reasonable strategy to deal with a short-term business crisis.</para><para>While this amendment addresses some of Labor's concerns in relation to the exemption of businesses from agreements, it does nothing to address the primary issue of when a transmission of business is defined as occurring in the first place. Unfortunately, the current transmission of business provisions in the act can be avoided by clever corporate restructuring. The Democrats have acknowledged this deficiency in the bill as amended. However, they passed the bill on the proviso that the government has committed to review the operation of these provisions in mid-2005. Labor are not satisfied by this commitment. Frankly, we do not trust the government, nor do we have any basis for doing so. We cannot support the relaxation of transmission of employee entitlements without being satisfied that the primary definition of transmission of business is adequately settled.</para><para>I go now to Labor's amendments, which would have addressed this issue. They strengthened the notion that a deal is a deal and that employment obligations should not be avoided by the sale or reorganisation of a business. Labor's amendments would have addressed this by broadening the test of transmission of business and requiring that the commission consider whether the activities of employees in businesses have been transferred. Labor's amendments also specifically ensured that employment conditions were preserved if a ship was transferred offshore and brought back again. Sadly, the government's only response to this issue was to facetiously precede these provisions with the heading `MUA—here to stay' when the bill was first in the Senate. Not surprisingly, the government did not insist on this amendment when the bill was returned to the Senate. </para><para>In conclusion, Labor remain opposed to this bill, as amended, because we are still concerned about the narrow definition of `transmission of business'. We feel that the existing definition does not take account of many business transfers where employees could reasonably expect to retain their conditions of employment. I observe that this is one of nine industrial relations bills in the Senate in this sitting fortnight. It makes you wonder what the government has been doing. It clearly has no third term agenda.</para><para>We learned today that the government does not even have a deal on the US-Australia free trade agreement, but it expects Labor to sign the deal. The minister is doing a little on the government's agenda, but no-one else seems to be. I do not want to damn him with faint praise because what he is doing is mischievous and inimical to the interests of working Australians.</para><para>The only legislation in this parliament seems to be the nine industrial relations bills that are sloshing around in the Senate. This bill has come back with a message from the Senate. We remain opposed to the bill. We recognise that the Democrats have made some improvements but, frankly, we cannot trust the government to protect the interests of the working men and women of this country.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>25548</page.no><name role="metadata">Andrews, Kevin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDREWS</name><name.id>HK5</name.id><electorate>Menzies</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is somewhat ironical that the Labor state minister for workplace relations can trust a federal coalition government to provide for the workers in that state. I think that says more about the federal Labor Party than anything else. The reality is that members of the Labor Party have dealt themselves out of these negotiations. They are implacably opposed to the government's move to make more flexible workplaces and give people choice, which leads to more jobs, higher wages and greater security for Australian families. In contrast, the Democrats were prepared to enter into reasonable negotiations with the government. As a result, we have their agreement for this legislation.</para></talk.start><para>In relation to the definition of `transmission of business', I say to the member for Rankin that there is currently a case in relation to the Health Services Union Award of 1993, which is to be heard in the High Court, involving Gribbles Radiology Pty Ltd and the Health Services Union. If the decision of the High Court in that case, after the High Court has heard arguments and has come to a conclusion about it, still leaves some uncertainty about the definition, we propose to have an inquiry. That is a commonsense and sensible way forward. I therefore urge the House to support the <inline ref="R1532">Workplace Relations Amendment (Transmission of Business) Bill 2002</inline>.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>25548</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Brendan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR</name><name.id>00AN3</name.id><electorate>Burke</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am also concerned with the amendments which have been acceded to by the Democrats. I think the Democrats have, in good faith, looked to improve the policy of the government in this area; however, having looked at the legislation very quickly and briefly, I have concerns about the practical application of the <inline ref="R1532">Workplace Relations Amendment (Transmission of Business) Bill 2002</inline> if it were to be enacted in the workplaces of the country. The issue of transmission of business has been one of great importance to the community since Federation. Provisions of transmission of business have been in place since the enactment of the 1904 act. However, what has occurred in the last 20 or more years in the workplace is that there has been another mechanism by which employers have looked to obviate their responsibilities under the federal law regulating industrial relations. </para></talk.start><para>In the last 20 years, the use of outsourcing and contracting out was deemed to be an area that would not be covered by transmission of business. From the early 1990s onwards, the judiciary looked at whether the provisions of the act were being properly interpreted. In the late 1990s the Federal Court of Australia found that, in many instances, there were employers deliberately attempting to evade their industrial obligations—award or enterprise agreement provisions—by selling off all or part of a business or by outsourcing fundamental or discrete parts of organisations. That has led to many workers being shortchanged in what was owed to them.</para><para>I have looked at some of the amendments which have been accepted by the government and the Democrats. These amendments are somewhat vague, which concerns me. For example, one amendment says that, if there were agreement of the parties to the agreement, transmission of business provisions could be avoided. Many instances where transmission of business may apply would involve new employees and an employer. New employees will agree to a set of conditions, even if they are inferior to what would bind an employer, if they were not to be employed and if they did not accept those conditions. I have concerns if the transmission of business provisions did not apply if agreements were to occur, given that, in practice, the agreement may not be between the employer and existing employees but quite possibly between an employer and potential employees.</para><para>I am also concerned if there were a finding that the employees would not be disadvantaged in relation to their terms or conditions of employment and what disadvantage test the minister is assuming would be used. If it is the no disadvantage test currently in the act, that test would apply only against the award, not against the agreement. As we all know, that no disadvantage test definition is a misnomer. It does not apply to conditions or to provisions of enterprise agreements; it applies to awards which are far inferior, in most circumstances, than the enterprise agreement that may have been transmitted. I seek assurance that that is not the definition being applied to this bill.</para><para>I am also concerned if there were a finding that the exemption is part of a reasonable strategy to deal with a short-term business crisis and what that could mean. What circumstances would allow a company to evade their industrial obligations? Why is it that a company is able to prevent a law applying to it when it is paying its work force, but cannot prevent a law applying to it when it is paying another company, paying the government payroll tax or paying other fees and charges that it may have to pay? Why would the government allow an employer to evade a contract? (<inline font-style="italic">Extension of time granted)</inline></para><para>In effect, that is what is happening here. There is one law for the workers of this country and another law in which the government wishes to allow employers to evade their responsibilities. But I do not see that capacity to evade other obligations taking place elsewhere. I therefore think that that exemplifies this government's intention to diminish the capacity of Australian workers to receive a decent income.</para><para>I am very concerned that this bill, if enacted, is going to start a spate of applications to the commission to allow employers to evade their lawful obligations under the act. It sends an awful message to the community. It says: `We will give you as many reasons as we possibly can'—as the government is attempting to do for employers—`to find an excuse not to pay your work force.' It says: `We are going to diminish a principle that has been upheld in the federal industrial relations system for decades so that we can allow you to evade your obligations to your work force or to your prospective work force.' Whilst, I think the minister does not accept that that is the case in theory, unfortunately, in practice I think there is a great chance of that happening. </para><para>I noticed that the minister did make reference to a matter before the High Court, and I too await the outcome of that matter; I think it is of great significance for the nation and the Australian work force at large. However, I do think the minister should make clear whether or not this bill, if enacted, will provide the capacity for employees to miss out on their current wages. I am not convinced by what has been said. I would like to look at the amendments in detail and perhaps at the regulations, if there are any, as to how they would apply. But, at first glance, it concerns me that this area, which is so important to the security of people's employment and employment conditions is going to be overturned. Unfortunately, I think the Democrats have not got it right on this occasion. I am sure they had the best of intentions, but I am really concerned that thousands, if not tens of thousands, of Australian workers would be left far worse off as a result of the enactment of this bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>25550</page.no><name role="metadata">Andrews, Kevin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDREWS</name><name.id>HK5</name.id><electorate>Menzies</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The honourable member for Burke is being unnecessarily alarmist. Under section 149 of the Workplace Relations Act, the commission already has the power to order that the new operator is not bound by an award that bound the former operator. There was no similar provision in relation to certified agreements, and this bill puts in place a similar provision and gives the commission power which it had in relation to awards. The amendment makes it clear that, when an order is sought before the business concerned has been transmitted, the commission must take into account the terms and conditions of employment that apply or will apply to the employees of the incoming employer. So this amendment addresses the concern raised by the Democrats that orders arising from a transmission of business situation may be strategically used by employers to avoid their obligations. The government has met that concern raised by the Democrats.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>25550</page.no><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Dr EMERSON</name><name.id>83V</name.id><electorate>Rankin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I join the member for Burke in expressing alarm, as I did in my first contribution, about these particular provisions. In the message that has come from the Senate, there is now a situation where the commission can exempt employers from enterprise agreements on transmission of business where there is a finding by the commission that the exemption is part of a reasonable strategy to deal with a short-term business crisis. I join the member for Burke in pointing out that the government always seems to put working people last. We understand the need to try and salvage a business if it is subject to a downturn in market conditions, but why is it the case that employees have to bear the brunt of any such downturn? Other creditors presumably do not have to bear it, but the employees are the first to be put off. Their conditions are subject to great threat under this legislation. This is just an ongoing display by this government of the ranking of employees. In situations where businesses are not travelling very well, we know that they like to rank employees very lowly in relation to employee entitlements with the rather inadequate GEERS scheme—except for the mightily adequate arrangements that were put in place for employees of the Prime Minister's brother. </para></talk.start><para>We have heard from an experienced practitioner in the member for Burke, who has cited a number of cases of businesses avoiding their obligations to employees throughout the 1990s. He is obviously very well versed in this area, and I think his legitimate concerns have been dismissed in typically contemptuous style by the minister. Our concerns remain, and this debate, in which I understand the member for Burke will be contributing further, reinforces in our minds the need to oppose this legislation, thereby protecting the interests of the working men and women of this country, which is something the government finds totally alien.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>25551</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Brendan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR</name><name.id>00AN3</name.id><electorate>Burke</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to say something in response to the minister. I am aware that the two separate sections in the Workplace Relations Act, section 149(1)(d) and section 170MB, are both provisions that go to the transmission of business. Section 149(1)(d) refers to the federal awards and how they would bind future employers in certain circumstances. Section 170MB mirrors section 149. However, it does not provide the capacity for the commission to seek a determination, and therefore did not allow the commission to determine whether a matter should be arbitrated or not. The point I am looking to make is that the one thing that has evolved over time, certainly judicially, with respect to transmission of business—and this was seen in a spate of federal court cases—was that there was a need to redress the consequences of employers outsourcing discrete parts of their businesses, thereby evading their industrial obligations to their work forces. I was making the point that the judiciary has already worked out that it is grossly unfair that you can outsource a discrete part of your business and thereby evade your industrial obligations. I thought I was making that perfectly clear.</para></talk.start><para>The Federal Court quite rightly in a number of cases have declared that that is not reasonable, and indeed determined that in many of these circumstances—I am not saying in all the cases that went before the Federal Court but in the majority of cases—outsourcing should be deemed to be a transmission of business. I think that a government that was concerned about consistency in law and protecting the rights of the employer and employees would provide protection to employees to prevent those employees losing entitlements by nefarious means, by unfair and inequitable means. </para><para>Unfortunately, whilst this bill has been improved somewhat, I have to say that in practice, on the ground, out of this place in workplaces across the country it will be able to be abused and it will be abused by a minority of employers. This will not only be to the detriment of those employed by that minority of employers, it will also be to the detriment of the fair and reasonable employer, because if you allow employers who want to do the wrong thing to get an advantage, they not only get an advantage over their own work force but they get an advantage over the other employers who choose not to take that route.

This is the third patch-up job that the Howard government has engaged in on the medical indemnity issue. There is another one to come and, by the minister for health's own admission, this series of patch-up jobs will last two years at best. What we know is that the series of patch-up jobs has caused a great deal of uncertainty in the community and amongst doctors, and of course it has cost the taxpayer hundreds of millions of dollars. It did not need to be like this—a crisis with patch after patch after patch put on it. A competent government would have defused the medical indemnity crisis before it became a crisis. But when it comes to health, the government we have does not care, is not interested and, when it tries things, is far less than competent.</para></talk.start><para>Back in 1991 the then Labor government established a review of compensation and professional indemnity arrangements for health care professionals, headed by senior bureaucrat Fiona Tito. The report on these issues was handed to the then minister for health, Dr Carmen Lawrence, the member for Fremantle, in January 1996, barely a fortnight before Paul Keating called the 1996 election. The Tito report, as it became known, provided a careful analysis of the arrangements in existence to provide for patients injured through negligence or misadventure. The report identified an array of major problems including, amongst others, that public data was not available on adverse events and negligence actions; many treatments had an inadequate evidence base and were not sufficiently outcome focused; neither health professionals nor health care consumers had access to adequate information on the risks and benefits of treatment options; patients did not have adequate access to their own health care records; the system was plagued by poor communication, particularly if an adverse event had occurred; programs designed to improve quality were poorly designed and not sustainable; there was no guarantee of adequate government funded assistance for people with severe disabilities, and the assistance provided was often poorly coordinated; health care consumers faced significant difficulties in accessing the tort system in cases of negligence; there was no providential scrutiny of the medical defence organisation industry, allowing longstanding inadequate funding of liabilities by medical defence organisations; there was no requirement for health care businesses to hold professional liability cover or cover for their institutional non-delegable duty of care, and laws pertaining to insurance requirements were unclear; there were concerns about the work force effects of indemnity in specific areas of medical practice such as obstetrics.</para><para>You would have thought that a competent incoming minister for health, getting a report that pointed to an array of major problems as detailed and severe as these, would have done something. You would have thought that a competent minister for health would have looked at that report, at that list of what was wrong with the system, and would have done something. But a former minister for health, Dr Michael Wooldridge, did not do anything. He allowed the report to sit on his desk, allowing all of these major problems with the health care system to just sit. Let us remind ourselves what we are talking about here: a failure to have proper scrutiny of medical defence organisations that had inadequately funded resources for the long-term claims that they were going to face; severely injured people just getting patch up mixes of care rather than systemic care; treatments being provided to people for which there was no real evidence focus. All of these things were wrong with our health system—poor treatment for people with severe disabilities and an emerging liabilities crisis for medical defence organisations—and Minister Wooldridge just sits. </para><para>What is even more shocking is that he sat because he preferred to just sit. You could perhaps forgive incompetence—perhaps he was doing other things in the health system—but he just sat because he preferred to. In fact, he is proud of just having sat and watched the medical indemnity crisis emerge. When speaking at the University of Melbourne in April last year, Dr Wooldridge fessed up to this and said:</para><quote><para>As Minister, I was accused of doing far too little on medical indemnity. That's completely unfair. I did absolutely nothing whatsoever.</para></quote><para>This is a Howard government minister proud of his record of doing absolutely nothing. I suspect that there are a number of current members of the frontbench who could go out and make that statement today—and make it truthfully, because we know that this government has completely stalled on the domestic policy agenda.</para><para>Because Minister Wooldridge was sitting and sitting and proudly doing absolutely nothing, the medical indemnity crisis gathered a head of steam. We know the medical indemnity situation came to public attention and caused a crisis that even this government in its incompetence and arrogance could not ignore: in May 2002 UMP and its wholly owned subsidiary, Australian Medical Insurance Ltd, went into provisional liquidation—they collapsed.</para><para>UMP was the largest medical insurer in Australia. It provided cover for about 60 per cent of medical practitioners nationally and 90 per cent in New South Wales. UMP's capital reserves foundered in the face of unprecedented large insurance payouts; a $30 million loss arising from the collapse of HIH as one of UMP's re-insurers—and the role of the Howard government in the HIH crisis is now a matter of record and history; a claim-spike ahead of the introduction of the new health care liability act; and higher capital requirements imposed by APRA. The failure of the management of UMP to properly price products must also be acknowledged.</para><para>Even the Howard government in its incompetence and arrogance could not afford to sit any more when 60 per cent of medical professionals nationally no longer had insurance because UMP had collapsed. We see a government finally startled into action, finally knowing that it needed to do something. So the former minister for health, Senator Kay Patterson, and the current minister for revenue, Senator Helen Coonan, are told to go out and do something. What they do is try to put together a patch-up job, because this government never does anything systemic or to a quality level to address a crisis. It has got a crisis and it says, `What are we going to do? We are going to scurry around and we are going to put the biggest patch we can find over it and hope that it is going to hold.' In its scurrying around, the Howard government said that it would pick up the unfunded liabilities of UMP, that it would recoup from doctors the amount that that was costing the government, and that recouping would be done through the now infamous IBNR levy—the incurred but not reported claims levy. Called the `incurred but not reported claims' because the substantial liabilities of UMP were going to arise from claims that had occurred—for example an adverse medical outcome or misadventure—but had not been reported before UMP collapsed and when the person to whom that had happened later made a claim, obviously a source of funds was needed to draw down upon.  </para><para>So the first patch is put in place by ministers Patterson and Coonan—Minister Patterson in her capacity as then Minister for Health and Ageing—and what they say is, `We'll pick up the liabilities of UMP and we'll get the money back from the UMP members through the IBNR levy.' They also say that there needs to be prudential regulation of the medical defence organisations and that prudential regulation be put in place. Of course, Labor supports prudential regulation being in place. In fact, if it had been in place at the time that a prudential issue was first pointed to by the Tito report, much of what followed probably would not have happened.</para><para>Another part of what happened at that time was that the government decided that medical indemnity cover must be provided through a contract of insurance, and that has changed the medical indemnity system in this country. There was the mutuality model, which enabled medical defence organisations to offer claims incurred insurance—that is, if you were a doctor and you paid your MDO, any claim that was incurred in that period, whether or not it was reported in that period, would be covered by your MDO. There was then a movement to the contract of insurance model, which meant that you could only get coverage for claims made during the period that you were paying your premiums.</para><para>I accept that there would now be severe difficulties in trying to take the model back to a model of mutuality and allowing claims in the curved coverage for doctors. But one does wonder whether, in the unseemly haste of trying to put a patch over the UMP issue and with the patchwork that Senator Patterson and Senator Coonan were engaged in—crashing around, desperately trying to find a solution to the medical indemnity crisis and enforcing the medical defence organisations to move to a contract of insurance model—the baby was thrown out with the bath water. As we now know, a lot of what needs to be done to resolve the medical indemnity crisis relates to the circumstance that exists when doctors are no longer practising or having any adverse event being reported but needing to be covered by the premiums they paid when they were practising doctors. So the whole issue about the need for run-off reinsurance—for doctors in retirement and no longer practising needing some separate form of cover—has arisen because of the way in which the industry was moved across to an insurance model. If we all had our time again, we might think about whether that was a wise course. Certainly the Howard government might think about whether that was a wise course; but I suspect that, if it had its time again, it might have got the Tito report off the minister's desk and done something.</para><para>That was the first patch, and we know that the first patch unwound in spectacular fashion when levy notices started hitting the desks of doctors in August and September last year, and specialists throughout New South Wales in particular started putting their resignations in at public hospitals, saying, `If that's how we're going to be treated by a Howard government, which doesn't know what it's doing, then we're not going to work as doctors any more under those circumstances.' Faced with the medical work force marching off the job in New South Wales, the Howard government was again stung into action—because nothing they have ever done in this area has been a result of thoughtful planning—and had to do something. </para><para>The new minister for health, Minister Abbott—in a flight of panic, negotiating with the AMA and desperate to get doctors back to work—cooks up a scheme whereby there will be an IBNR levy moratorium. Minister Abbott's first version of this scheme is to say to the doctors, `Hey, guys, what about I put a moratorium into place—you don't have to pay money now, at least not as much money now—and we put the whole issue off until after the next election? We're really only interested in a political patch now and we'll worry about the substance of it later.' Fortunately, the doctors were awake to the Howard government's lack of strategic approach—and they are probably awake to the fact that the last thing Tony Abbott will be after the next election is minister for health—so they said, `No, we actually want something done now.'</para><para>So the second patch-up is Minister Abbott's IBNR levy moratorium to stop doctors paying the bills, or to at least stop them paying all the bills, while he puts in place a ministerial review panel, which he says he will chair. That process—the ministerial review panel—does go on. Basically, the legislation before the House today deals with some, but not all, of the matters coming out of the ministerial review panel. What we know is that there will be a further series of legislation—a further patch, even on top of this patch—and, endearingly, Minister Abbott conceded that he expects the whole thing to last for about two years because that is as long as it is good for.</para><para>The panel recommended that one of the earlier patch-ups—the high cost claims scheme—be changed. This is a claims scheme to assist with meeting the costs of claims that are substantial in nature. The original figure was for claims over $500,000; the panel recommended that that be reduced to $300,000. So there we have a patch on a patch, and that has been achieved by regulation. Then the panel recommended, because of the issue I referred to about run-off cover, that there needed to be a government backed run-off reinsurance vehicle, funded by a charge over medical insurers. It would be this vehicle that people would look to when they reported a claim made against a doctor who had subsequently gone into retirement or was out of the medical work force for other reasons. It is that patch that we are going to see in future legislation. The details of that patch are not available now.</para><para>The third thing that the panel recommended was that the existing premium subsidy scheme be replaced by a premium support scheme to be paid to medical insurers for doctors whose actuarially assessed premiums passed a trigger percentage of private medical income. This is in this package of legislation. Once again it is a patch on a patch, because the original Howard government plan was to subsidise the ongoing medical indemnity premiums of doctors in nominated high-risk specialty areas like neurosurgery, orthopaedic surgery and the like. That has not found favour with the doctors or with the panel, so now the premium subsidy scheme will apply to all doctors and their eligibility for it will be triggered if their medical indemnity insurance hits a certain percentage of their income, being 7.5 per cent of gross private income. </para><para>This is a very substantial gain for the doctors. Under the new premium support arrangements the standard premium for a New South Wales orthopaedic surgeon with under $200,000 in medical income will fall from $40,000 to $20,000. As you are probably aware, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, most orthopaedic surgeons earn more than $200,000 in medical income a year, I venture to say. So a more realistic example is probably the standard premium for a New South Wales orthopaedic surgeon with a $475,000 income, which will fall from $67,000 to $42,000. All up this initiative is costing taxpayers $24 million. It is a patch on a patch.</para><para>Then there is the very vexed IBNR levy. `They are going to levy them.' `No, they're not going to levy them.' `There is a moratorium.' `They've got to sort it out.' So the panel has sorted it out for them, and in response to the panel's findings the Howard government is now going to replace the IBNR levy with what will be known as the UMP support arrangements. Under the old IBNR levy, if you were a member of UMP at a specified date then you owed the system an amount figured from the medical indemnity premiums that you paid. Of course, that did not have any flexibility in it for people who were then working full time but had since withdrawn from the work force or for people who were then practising in a high-risk specialty but were no longer doing so. So it was a flawed scheme.</para><para>The government has now moved to say, `Let's replace all of that so that doctors who were members of UMP in 2000 and have medical incomes above $5,000 a year will pay whichever is the least of the former IBNR annual levy— two per cent of gross private medical income or $5,000.' There are some other changes that apply relating to how long you were a member of UMP. This is an arrangement which means you can stand back and ask, `What has happened with the money here?' The current IBNR liability that the Howard government estimates came from the UMP collapse is $483 million. Of this, $233 million will be covered by the high-cost claims scheme and levy exemptions funded by the Howard government. That is all taxpayers' money. Of the remaining $250 million, $120 million will be paid by the Howard government and $130 million will be paid by doctors through the run-off reinsurance vehicle and the UMP support arrangements.</para><para>All in all, the Howard government, out of this series of desperate patches and carry-on—a crisis that need not have happened—has basically stepped up to the plate to use taxpayers' funds to pay three-quarters of the estimated UMP liability. I suspect that Australian citizens who are also Australian health care consumers might want to ask themselves whether paying three-quarters of $483 million for a crisis that did not have to happen—it only happened because of Howard government incompetence—is what they would most like to see expenditure of precious health funds on, or whether they would like to see it invested in the local public hospital, in supporting bulk-billing or in paying for vaccines for children, because none of those things are going to happen. But, of course, hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money has gone into this.</para><para>One knows that a government is truly desperate for a solution when a conservative minister—and a conservative minister for health—actually flirts with trying to resolve all of the medical indemnity issue by moving to a single national insurance scheme for doctors. From a government that is, as it tells us, opposed to big government, opposed to monopoly provision and certainly opposed to expansion of the public sector, so desperate was this minister for health that he was actively in the cart for a nice big old-world style solution—a nice big public sector solution. He was going to have a single national insurance scheme for doctors. Whatever the merits of that—and there may be people who want to debate the merits of that—you would have to say you are a pretty desperate conservative minister when you decide that what you really need to do is build a single national insurance scheme for doctors. Unsurprisingly, this move was apparently squashed by Treasury and by a number of medical defence organisations. </para><para>There we have it: a series of patches on patches. This is the latest of them. What I can absolutely guarantee to this House is that we will be back. We will be back to legislate the run-off reinsurance vehicle. The patches on the patches have not finished yet. And then, according to the minister for health himself, we will be back in two years because he reckons that is all the life that this has got in it. When you actually look at this course of events it should hardly surprise us, because the Howard government history in health is one of patch and failure. They have done it in the medical indemnity area. Now, of course, they are doing it to Medicare overall. The original view of this government, in line with the Prime Minister's often stated goal of the 1970s and 1980s, was to unwind and destroy Medicare. They wanted to do that in this term by sitting idly by—as they had with the medical indemnity issue—as Medicare died and as bulk-billing fell because the Medicare rebate became less and less connected with real health costs and there was less investment in it.</para><para>It was only because of Labor campaigning on the bulk-billing crisis that any health statement was made by this government. They would not have made a major health statement in this period of government if it had not been for Labor campaigning on bulk-billing. As we know, the first statement they were startled into making was the so-called A Fairer Medicare package from last May. We now know of course that the so-called A Fairer Medicare package was so spectacularly bad that it led not only to the death of the package but also to the end of a health minister. You do not often come up with a government initiative that is so spectacularly bad that the package ends up stone dead and the health minister that auspiced it is moved on in unseemly haste. But of course that is what happened with the first Medicare patch. Now we have the second Medicare patch before the Senate, and we will find out its fate probably over the coming sitting fortnight.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>8K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Fitzgibbon</name></talker><para>—And the fate of the minister.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83L</name.id><name role="metadata">Gillard, Julia, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GILLARD</name></talker><para>—Yes. As we know, the Minister for Health and Ageing is not really doing much about health; he does a lot about other things. The second Medicare patch is in the Senate. We will find out in this fortnight whether or not that patch sticks. But my message about that patch remains: how desperate would you have to be to cover up your failure to invest in Medicare that you design a so-called safety net costing $266 million? When you look at it in detail what you can say about it is that 97 per cent of Australians will be worse off under it because they will not get anywhere near the so-called safety net, but they will experience additional health costs caused by the collapse of bulk-billing and the price inflation effects of the sham safety net. Ninety-seven per cent of Australians will be worse off. Of the three per cent who are notionally better off, the architect of Medicare, Professor John Deeble, has said, `Half of them are better off under the current arrangements.' So $266 million is being spent to notionally make 1.5 per cent of Australians better off and, of that $266 million, $72 million is wasted in administration. How desperate a health minister would you have to be to think that a scheme as crazy, ineffective and wasteful as that was anything like a solution? Of course, we know it is not a health solution; it is a political solution because the minister for health wants something to cover up the intention to destroy Medicare, and the sham safety net is it. As he gets about the business of destroying Medicare, he can at least have the political spin which says, `Don't worry about me destroying Medicare, because I have got you a sham safety net.' The message from Labor, well and truly, to senators who say that they believe and support Medicare is, `Do not vote for the sham safety net. Do not be complicit in this fundamental undermining of Medicare.' </para></talk.start></continue><para>I want to conclude by noting one other very important patch and failure job in which this government has engaged. Of course, that is the patch and failure job with private health insurance. We were told that the lifetime rating scheme was going to boost private health insurance membership and keep it up and growing. The reverse is true. Whatever spin the minister puts on the membership statistics, the truth—and everybody knows it—is that every time we get private health insurance holding statistics, every time we get the numbers of members in private health insurance, they have gone down. Membership has most particularly gone down in the younger age ranges. These are the members who are most needed in private health insurance because they are subsidising the cost of the older members. The government says it prides itself on private health insurance affordability and it promised to put downwards pressure on premiums. We know what happens every time, and it happened last Friday. It happens every year. You can set your watch by it. It should be marked in the calendar like Christmas. We know that what happens every time is that the conservative minister for health, in this case Minister Abbott, puts a great big tick on increases to private health insurance premiums, as he did last Friday. Private health insurance premiums are going up and up.</para><para>We know that increases in private health insurance premiums are hard to sell. The private health insurance industry has had a little bit of expert assistance in selling these private health insurance premium increases because they have had the former director of the Liberal Party and the current pollster of the Liberal Party working out how to sell the message for them. The unanswered question is whether Mr Abbott has engaged in having that kind of assistance provided to him as well, and we will be expecting Minister Abbott to answer the question that he effectively took on notice at question time today. We believe it is inappropriate for the government to be in league with the private health insurers to get Liberal Party advice, paid for by the private health insurers, as to how to snow the Australian public about a private health insurance premium rise.</para><para>I conclude by moving the second reading amendment that stands in my name, namely:</para><para>That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</para><para>“whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House condemns the government for:</para><para>(1)	failing to act to prevent the medical indemnity crisis and engaging in a series of political fixes not long term solutions to the medical indemnity crisis; and</para><para>(2)	allowing a health crisis to develop including medical indemnity and insurance arrangements”.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">(Time expired) </inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>jen10000Jenkins, Harry (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)The DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Jenkins)—</name.id><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Mr Jenkins)</inline>—Is the amendment seconded?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83V</name.id><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Dr Emerson</name></talker><para>—I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>25560</page.no><name role="metadata">Baldwin, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BALDWIN</name><name.id>LL6</name.id><electorate>Paterson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Today I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1990">Medical Indemnity Amendment Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R1991">Medical Indemnity (IBNR Indemnity) Contribution Amendment Bill 2004</inline>.

But these two bills relate to medical indemnity, and they go straight to the heart of the medical indemnity problem—that is, the need for patient confidence in a health system where they have the right to seek recourse for medical negligence and the need for doctors to be able to be confident that they are covered by their insurance if they are sued for medical negligence.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Our government is investing $620 million over the next four years in medical indemnity. These two bills will put into force the government's new medical indemnity measures that were announced on 17 December last year. They do address the problems still facing doctors and they will build on our past measures. But we need to understand something, and we need to be sympathetic towards doctors, in that medical negligence is something that has grown over time, with the court system way out of whack. Huge amounts of money in compensation, a growing volume of litigation and the troubles of UMP and HIH have all had a massive impact on the premiums paid by doctors. The measures introduced in these bills will help doctors get on with the job of caring for patients and providing medical services to our local communities, with affordable medical indemnity. That is what it is really all about. It is about providing service to our community through doctors.</para><para>These two bills provide the basis for the government's additional medical indemnity measures, in that they will contribute $181 million from now until 2006-07 towards meeting the costs of medical indemnity, making it more affordable for our doctors. Our doctors do not have leasing agreements as in the case of Centenary House. These are people who work in the community and pay rent. Fortunately, not many of them have the Labor Party as landlords. Our original measures, introduced in 2002, were developed to address the medical indemnity industry's long-term viability and the affordability of medical indemnity premiums for doctors. The government have continued to enhance this package of measures by extending financial protection to doctors for the costs of claims beyond the level of their indemnity insurance, increasing the number of categories of doctors who are eligible to be exempt from the incurred but not reported liabilities contribution and putting a moratorium on the amount payable under IBNR contributions for 18 months.</para><para>These bills address two matters: the issues regarding the current IBNR scheme contribution and reducing its cost to doctors, and the continuing issue of affordability of medical indemnity insurance. I know, as I speak to the doctors in my electorate in the Hunter Valley, that they are concerned that their payments are blowing out. They have concerns about the future viability and affordability of insurance to meet those claims. The government have stepped in and provided that level of protection. For example, under the new premium support scheme we will pay 80 per cent of the costs of premiums over and above 7½ per cent of a doctor's income. If we look at the high-cost claims support scheme, we will now cover 50 per cent of the payments over $300,000.</para><para>But we need to see more doctors. We have just heard the member for Lalor talk about the lack of doctors and what that is doing to our community. I would put to the member for Lalor that she should talk to some of the training providers at universities. She would find out that the lack of doctors today is the direct result of Labor Party policy, because the time frame for a doctor to go to university, have their training and be put out in the marketplace is between eight and 12 years. This government has only been in office for eight years, so the lack of doctors that we have seen in the last eight years is because of Labor Party policy. The only policy they seemed to want to work on was how they could rort another deal on Centenary House—how they could take $36 million from the taxpayer and put it into their pockets. For each and every member—including the member for Hunter, who is jumping up with another frivolous point of order—that would work out at about $560,000 in their pockets— </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>8K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Fitzgibbon</name></talker><para>—Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order on relevance.

I am bringing it back to doctors and how the Labor Party, in its previous term of government, ignored the real concerns of the community. As I said, the reason for a lack of doctors in our community and why bulk-billing is down is that the Labor Party, when in government, did nothing to train an adequate number of doctors. The member for Hunter knows that. The member for Hunter knows that he and his Labor Party are directly responsible for it.</para></talk.start></continue><para>What do the Labor Party come up with as offers? There are two people in my community who are also involved in the community of the member for Hunter—that is, Dr Arn Sprogis, who is the head of the Hunter Urban Division of General Practice, and Dr Chris Boyle, who is the chairman of that body. Dr Chris Boyle, in a letter to the editor of the <inline font-style="italic">Examiner </inline>after the member for Werriwa's visit to our electorate, where he announced what he was going to do in relation to doctors, said:</para><quote><para>Sir, I was very interested to read what the ALP policy on the Medicare bulk-billing team is (<inline font-style="italic">Examiner</inline>, February 12). It does not involve new GPs. It simply involves moving GPs from private practice to public service—not one new GP, simply moving the deckchairs on the <inline font-style="italic">Titanic</inline>. Being a public service facility, I assume that means that the service will be fully funded and resourced so that all the GP has to do is turn up and work from nine to five. All the staff, the nurses, the building, the computers, the insurance and the entire infrastructure would be provided by government. No wonder it is possible to then bulk-bill, because the cost of the service will be heavily subsidised through the government. To bulk-bill and be in private practice is very difficult to do now because the rebate has failed to keep up with the cost of providing the service.</para></quote><para>I accept that. He continues:</para><quote><para>This is why bulk-billing is in decline, and this has not been addressed by the ALP's policy. It has been partially addressed by the government's MedicarePlus policy, but even that is a stopgap measure that will only help for two years.</para></quote><para>I acknowledge that. Dr Chris Boyle then says:</para><quote><para>Both sides of politics should start to have a real think about health policy and come up with some realistic solutions and stop playing politics with the nation's health.</para></quote><para>I agree with that. He goes on:</para><quote><para>Mickey mouse ideas like Medicare bulk-billing teams are irrational and no way is it the sensible sustainable approach that is required. </para></quote><para>That was written by Chris Boyle, of Raymond Terrace, who happens to be the chair of the Hunter Urban Division of General Practice. But he is not a single voice. He is supported by his CEO, Dr Arn Sprogis, the head of the division. He questioned where the doctors would come from. An article in the <inline font-style="italic">Examiner</inline>, by Rebecca Biesler, said: </para><quote><para>Dr Sprogis described the promise as a joke in poor taste. `If Mark Latham thinks he can find two doctors to come to Raymond Terrace, it shows how little he knows about health,' he said. Doctor woes had proved how hard it was to get a doctor in the area.</para></quote><para>It goes on to say:</para><quote><para>Dr Boyle said the government was pinching doctors from third-world countries already struggling to meet the demands for medical service but refused to allocate more university medical places in Australia. `Bulk-billing is not the issue,' Dr Boyle said. `The real issue is access to doctors. There just aren't enough of them to go around. Bulk-billing was not viable for doctors as the Medicare rebate was too low. The only reason bulk-billing is on the agenda is because it started to bite hard in the marginal electorates.'</para></quote><para>Dr Boyle and Dr Sprogis have summed it up in one. The former Labor government failed to train enough doctors, to have in the marketplace now and over the last eight years, to address the bulk-billing problem. The Labor Party can sit there and sprout on—but it is not putting university places in. We will not see the fruits of the education of the people that enter university this year to become doctors for eight to 12 years. What has happened? It is the Labor Party who has failed the people when it comes to bulk-billing. When the Labor Party came out with its policy, Dr Arn Sprogis was interviewed by Warren Moore on 2HD, on 28 October. Of Labor's Medicare policy, he said:</para><quote><para>I think it's one of the most bizarre notions I've seen in the 12 or 13 years I've been in this game. I think the Labor Party's lost the plot completely to be quite honest.</para></quote><para>But in the discussion with Cameron Williams on 2HD on 19 November when speaking about the Howard government's MedicarePlus program he said:</para><quote><para>I think it in all a good package. It gives some certainty to the public. I think it will be widely accepted by the public and I think Tony Abbott is on a winner.</para></quote><para>I do not think any government will always have it 100 per cent correct on medical policy, because it is a shifting market. We can talk about expenditure; we can talk about a range of things. But the reality is that you have to address the situation here and now, today. Our MedicarePlus package, which is up in the Senate now, provides a safety net that is being refused support by the Labor Party. A commentator in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> on 12 February, Sue Dunleavy, said that any type of safety net was `sorely needed'. If someone offered you a bag of lollies, would you say, `No, I am not taking it until you give me two bags'?</para><para>That is what the Senate is saying on the Medicare safety net. Some 170,000 sick and chronically ill Australians who will qualify for the $266 million safety net program are paying hundreds and sometimes thousands of dollars on medical bills with no help from Medicare and health funds. They would be happy with any money they could get to help with the bills. Labor, Democrat and Independent senators want the government to spend more money on health—that is great. However, they should not hold the chronically ill who will benefit from this safety net to ransom to get the extra money. </para><para>We need to address the situation in relation to doctors. We need doctors to feel comfortable in the community so that they can do what they do best, and that is to provide professional, quality health care to our communities. I look at the way the member for Hunter, the member for Lalor and all the other members on the other side carry on and complain. If they were seriously committed to health, they would firstly pass the Medicare safety package in the Senate. Secondly, they would hand back the $4 million this year. And the member for Hunter is on his feet again because he is embarrassed about the $4 million he is going to rip off from the taxpayers this year. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed.) </inline>What has happened is that the member for Hunter is extremely embarrassed that he is one of many on that side who has his hand in the taxpayers' pocket for $4 million this year.

This legislation—the <inline ref="R1918">Medical Indemnity Amendment Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R1917">Medical Indemnity (IBNR Indemnity) Contribution Amendment Bill 2004</inline>—is the third bandaid solution applied by the government to deal with the medical indemnity insurance crisis. The Minister for Health and Ageing has already indicated that there is another bandaid to come. It seems appropriate, as we are having a health debate, that the government is liberally using bandaids out of the packet. There are plenty more to come—and many have been applied already. It might be a little understandable if the government is using bandaids to deal with some of these health issues, but they are the most expensive bandaids that the people of Australia will ever see—</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>849</name.id><name role="metadata">Sidebottom, Sid, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Sidebottom</name></talker><para>—And have to pay for.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83V</name.id><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Dr EMERSON</name></talker><para>—or have to pay for, as the member for Braddon has pointed out. I will refer to the cost of these bandaids—the most expensive packet of bandaids, which has run into hundreds of millions of dollars already. Indeed, these costs never needed to be incurred, because the problems of medical indemnity insurance were identified as early as the mid-1990s. Those problems were not only identified but also comprehensively documented in the Tito report. That report was delivered to the previous Labor government a fortnight before the calling of an election. You would think that the incoming coalition government would be grateful for all the work that had been conducted in preparing the Tito report and for the findings of that report. But, instead of utilising the report—instead of even reading the report—the then health minister, Dr Wooldridge, shelved it. He shelved it and boasted about it. He boasted about the fact that he did nothing in relation to solving the medical indemnity insurance crisis in this country. </para></talk.start></continue><para>It is not unusual for Liberals to boast that they have done nothing. They have a born to rule mentality. I think many of them come into this parliament believing it is their right to be here—not to represent their constituents and certainly not to represent the people of Australia. The former health minister, Dr Wooldridge, speaking at a Melbourne university gathering in April 2003, said, `As minister I was accused of doing far too little on medical indemnity. That is completely unfair. I did absolutely nothing whatsoever.' What an indictment on a health minister—boasting that he did absolutely nothing to deal with the medical indemnity insurance crisis which was drawn to the attention of this government as an emerging crisis back in 1996. Instead of apologising to the Australian people for his failure to do anything about it and the fact that he put the Tito report on the shelf, he boasted about how he did nothing whatsoever.

I draw your attention, Mr Deputy Speaker, to page 491 of <inline font-style="italic">House of Representatives Practice </inline>and particularly the rulings of Speaker Aston and Speaker Snedden, whose rulings were that, if there is a reflection relating to dishonesty—and this reflection was one relating to dishonesty—it cannot be excused because it is made against an unnamed set of members.

I was pointing out that the former minister for health, Dr Wooldridge, not only boasted about his complete unwillingness to do anything about the medical indemnity insurance crisis but also told <inline font-style="italic">Meet the Press</inline> before the last election that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme was sustainable. He was asked in detail about the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Obviously, the journalists in question were onto the caper that the government might pull the swiftie of saying that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme was sustainable before the election, only to come into the parliament after the election and increase the cost of pharmaceuticals to the working men and women of this country.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Surprise, surprise—what did they do? Dr Wooldridge said that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme was sustainable. The government then came into parliament after the last election and did exactly what it was believed they might well do—the government put to this parliament a bill to increase pharmaceutical costs to Australian consumers. Of course, that is now a double dissolution bill. The moral of the story is: do not believe Dr Wooldridge. I might add that it calls into serious question his credentials as a health minister, just as this crisis calls into serious question the credentials of the current minister for health as a minister of the Crown.</para><para>The fact is that UMP collapsed, and it was a collapse that was waiting to happen. The government's first response to that collapse—a response not of anticipation but of reaction—was to apply the first bandaid, which was to pick up the unfunded liability of UMP and to get that money back through a levy called the IBNR levy—that is, liabilities incurred but not reported. Those levy notices, we may all remember, started arriving in August and September last year. The medical work force, in response to getting the shocking mail saying that they were up for thousands of dollars, withdrew from the work force, most particularly in New South Wales. Doctors in New South Wales began walking off the job because they got these shock notices from the government.</para><para>The government then had to respond to the crisis. What was its response? The Minister for Health and Ageing, who was new in the saddle, implemented an IBNR moratorium, the purpose of which—just as it was the purpose of the previous health minister—was to get the government past the next election. That is what this health minister tried to do. This is the Liberal way: do not fix something; just try to scrape past the next election. But the AMA were awake to the caper. They insisted on a more comprehensive solution, and therefore required the government to establish a review panel, which it did. Today's legislation is the first instalment in response to the recommendations of the review panel that was established. </para><para>Even the minister has conceded that the whole scheme that is being put in place through this particular bill and further bills to come will last for the grand total of two years. It is clear that doctors have done pretty well, because the Liberals have not wanted to create too much of a fuss with the AMA and the doctors. But the fact is that they should not trust this government. The cost to taxpayers has been $233 million plus another $120 million—a total of $353 million, which means that taxpayers have funded three-quarters of the UMP liability. Some $353 million has been allocated to deal with a crisis that the government could have prevented if, back in 1996, the then minister for health had read the report instead of putting it on the shelf and boasting later that he did absolutely nothing about it.</para><para>This is a crisis that could have been averted. Instead of averting it the government let it fester and fester and then applied three very expensive bandaids costing a total of $353 million. That is well over $100 million per bandaid. I hope they do not have a big box of them there, because at $100 million a go this is the most expensive box of bandaids the Australian people will ever have to buy. It is therefore worth asking within the health arena: to what alternative uses could this money have been applied? I have only another few minutes, but we could spend half an hour talking about the alternative uses of $353 million of taxpayers' money in the health arena.</para><para>I want to focus on one in particular, and that is the pneumococcal vaccine. The pneumococcal vaccine for all children would cost in the order of $100 million a year for this government to cover, but it is refusing to do so. It is saying that it will cover the cost of pneumococcal vaccine for those children who are at risk. I say that all children are at risk of pneumococcal disease. It is not widely known, but more children contract pneumococcal disease than meningococcal disease, and more children die of pneumococcal disease than of meningococcal disease.</para><para>An independent expert advisory committee that has been advising Australian governments for years on vaccines recommended that the government cover the cost of pneumococcal vaccine. The government's response? For the first time in the post-war era a government has said it will not cover the cost of a recommended vaccine for all children in Australia but rather that it will cover only selected children. It is an outrage that this government would put at risk the health and even the lives of children by refusing to cover pneumococcal vaccine costs. It means that parents are confronted with the cost of $435 for this vaccine. This is a disease that obviously can lead to death, but even those children who survive are often disabled through vision impairment, the impairment of hearing, delays in development and even the loss of fingers and toes through septicaemia.</para><para>This government, during or before the budget, should reverse its cold-hearted decision and fund the pneumococcal vaccine. In my own electorate of Rankin, 2,000 signatures have been gained on petitions which I have tabled, and more will be tabled in the future. Jill Leonarduzzi of Regents Park has been very active in obtaining these petitions. I pay tribute to Jill: she is the grandmother of a young girl who contracted this disease and has been severely disadvantaged. Fortunately she did not die, but she has been severely disadvantaged as a result of contracting this disease. It is not the Australian way for a government to refuse to implement the recommendations of its own advisory committee as to which vaccine should be made available free of charge for children in this country, but that is what this government has done.  </para><para>It is a government that has very warped priorities in relation to health. It has presided over a collapse in bulk-billing around Australia. It will not do anything to arrest the decline in bulk-billing. It will not fund the pneumococcal vaccine. But I can give this commitment to the people of Rankin: I will continue to advocate strongly on their behalf—on behalf of the parents of Rankin and the parents of the children of Australia—for the funding of pneumococcal vaccine, because it is totally unacceptable that this cold-hearted government has refused to do so. It has now put itself in the position where it has had to cough up $353 million of taxpayers' money to try to deal with a crisis through bandaid solutions that it could have averted if the then minister for health back in 1996 had not been so bone lazy in ignoring the report that was available to him, in allowing a crisis to develop and then boasting about it. That minister was a disgrace and this current health minister wants to debate anything in this parliament other than health. That is how sincere they are about Medicare in this country. The Prime Minister said back in 1987 that he would take a scalpel to Medicare. He has been doing that in his eight years in the prime ministership, and at the next election we will throw him out so that the people of Australia can get decent, affordable health care. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>25570</page.no><name role="metadata">Moylan, Judi, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs MOYLAN</name><name.id>4V5</name.id><electorate>Pearce</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the <inline ref="R1990">Medical Indemnity Amendment Bill 2004</inline> and the cognate bill, the <inline ref="R1991">Medical Indemnity (IBNR Indemnity) Contribution Amendment Bill 2004</inline>. I listened with interest to some of the comments from the member for Rankin, and I have to say that he has not really explained the history of the worldwide crisis in the insurance sector which gave rise to the need for the government to step in and resolve this crisis. I believe the public are well served in our Minister for Health and Ageing having consulted widely and stepped in to avert what could have been a very serious crisis with implications for the public. </para></talk.start><para>We all know that there was a worldwide insurance crisis. That deepened after September 11 2001, and there was a knock-on effect that no government could have prevented. Prior to that the medical profession was running its own insurance system, and nobody could have predicted or foreseen those terrible events that had a very major impact on the whole insurance sector. Of course the affordability of insurance has become a very big headache for many professionals, but for the medical sector it has reached crisis point with the threatened collapse of United Medical Protection, which is the only medical defence organisation currently participating in the IBNR scheme.</para><para>One of the key areas of concern was the IBNR scheme, covering `incurred but not reported' liabilities—that of course is what `IBNR' stands for. The UMP support payment arrangements replace the IBNR contribution. I know that people in my electorate were greatly relieved that the government stepped in to strengthen the medical indemnity situation; without government intervention it might have been difficult to retain current levels of medical practitioners and medical services.</para><para>In both outer metropolitan areas and rural areas there has been an acute shortage of medical practitioners. The federal government's response to this—the rural and outer metropolitan doctor scheme, designed to provide incentives for doctors to locate to areas with a GP shortage—has begun to have a very positive impact, one which might have been negated by a crisis in the medical indemnity insurance industry. Undoubtedly there would have been wider ramifications if the government had not acted, so I think the member for Rankin is quite wrong; I think the Australian public expected the government to do something about this, and if that was the way in which we maintained a high level of medical service to our communities then that was money well spent. </para><para>In addition to incentives for doctors to locate to areas outside the inner metropolitan area, the government have made provision for additional university places in faculties of medicine. This will, along with the short-term measures that the government have taken, ensure a long-term easing of the current GP shortage. We certainly did not need to add to those difficulties by not responding to the medical insurance crisis.</para><para>There were a number of reasons for the crisis in medical insurance, as I said. While there has been a tendency for public debate to focus on blame and counterblame, the fact is that the court decisions awarding very large payouts for events that occurred decades ago were one of the major concerns regarding the viability of medical indemnity schemes, increasing premiums and making medical insurance unaffordable for GPs. So, while there were a number of reasons why this crisis occurred, that was certainly one of the factors.</para><para>It is of vital concern to the public that medical indemnity insurance remains affordable for doctors so that they can continue to provide medical services. This bill gives legislative effect to the government's new medical indemnity measures, building on past measures. In 2002-03 the government legislated to provide a secure prudential and financial framework for the medical indemnity industry and for doctors.</para><para>Elements of the government's response to the medical insurance crisis included: introducing a single billing arrangement for doctors so that they can receive one bill from their medical indemnity provider, which certainly helps to simplify things; linking the UMP support payment to the doctors' capacity to pay, making these payments more affordable for doctors; bringing medical indemnity cover under the supervision of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority; ensuring that cover is available through general insurers under contracts of insurance, providing certainty of cover for doctors; and a $181 million investment by the government between now and 2006-07 to ensure affordability of medical indemnity insurance for doctors.</para><para>The government's response also included: underpinning the UMP's unfunded incurred but not reported liabilities—that is, the IBNR claims—and removing the very real threat of permanent liquidation for UMP; funding half the cost of all claims in excess of a $500,000 threshold through the High Cost Claims Scheme, limiting the financial pressure on doctors' premiums; removing the element of personal liability for the amount of any claim which exceeds their level of insurance provided they have $20 million worth of cover under the Exceptional Claims Scheme; the provision of direct financial assistance to obstetricians and neurosurgeons; working closely with state and territory governments in pursuing tort law reforms to reduce the volume and cost of claims against doctors; establishing the Medical Indemnity Policy Review Panel; and introducing a moratorium on the IBNR contributions, capping them at $1,000 per annum for 18 months to December 2004.</para><para>The Medical Indemnity Policy Review Panel played a very important role in advising the government on the issues around insurance. The government have adopted some of the panel's recommendations, including: reducing the High Cost Claims Scheme threshold further, to $300,000, and introducing a new, broader based Premium Support Scheme to replace the Medical Indemnity Subsidy Scheme. Under the Premium Support Scheme more doctors will be assisted with their medical indemnity costs than under the medical indemnity scheme. Further panel recommendations adopted by the government include replacing the IBNR levy with UMP support arrangements and establishing a run-off reinsurance vehicle to provide free run-off cover to certain groups of doctors when they have left the medical work force. I think it has been demonstrated that this government have acted decisively, quickly and responsibly to manage a very difficult issue—the increasing cost, uncertainty and adequacy of medical indemnity insurance.  </para><para>This bill gives legislative effect to the new UMP support payment arrangements and provides a broad framework for the Premium Support Scheme. The Premium Support Scheme will replace current subsidy arrangements that will continue to operate until 30 June 2004. It will cover 80 per cent of the medical indemnity costs incurred over a 7.5 per cent threshold. It will also provide increased support for procedural GPs working in rural areas. That is certainly important in an electorate like Pearce, which has very large rural community. We do have some extremely capable and good doctors in our wheat belt. In fact, some of those have come to the area as a result of the government's incentive scheme for rural doctors. To lose them because the government failed to act on such an important issue as medical indemnity insurance would not have served the people in the rural areas of my electorate.</para><para>I am in close touch with the Central Wheatbelt Division of General Practice, and they do a mighty job in providing member doctors to look at the range of health issues across the electorate, ensuring that there is a comprehensive medical and health service available to people living in those areas and regions. I have had the privilege of working with the two chairs: Dr Gogna, who came in as an overseas trained doctor and who has really endeared himself to many in the community and who has worked very hard to improve and move forward medical issues and medical health provision within the rural sector; and the now chair, Dr Frank Kubicek. Under him, that consultative process continues.</para><para>Our minister is always very responsive to the suggestions and ideas of these doctors. To have ignored this problem of medical indemnity would have caused endless difficulties for doctors working in rural areas, and I am glad to see that the provisions of this legislation take into account some of those rural area issues. The minister has foreshadowed further legislation to implement the run-off reinsurance vehicle, and this scheme is being developed in consultation with the medical profession and the insurance industry.</para><para>Success in reducing medical claims in future will depend on the cooperation of medical practitioners, who will need to continue to improve their own risk management in their individual practices. That is obviously a very important factor in ensuring that the premiums do not blow out further and in being able to manage the medical insurance issue in the longer term. I know our minister is working very closely with the sector to ensure that all of these features are taken into account in the design of the system.</para><para>Designing a medical indemnity scheme that provides a fair outcome for litigants and reasonable insurance premiums for doctors and the maintenance of medical services at a level the public have come to expect does require a very comprehensive and consultative approach. I believe that our minister for health has approached this issue with great determination and with a willingness to consult with all those within the sector. The government has, with the minister's guidance, been able to avert what may have been a very serious crisis in the provision of medical services. </para><para>Rather than condemn the government, I think the member for Rankin should be thankful that his constituents will continue to receive a high level of medical care from our practitioners because we have resolved the problems with the medical indemnity insurance system. As I said, this worked very successfully over a number of years with the medical profession running its own insurance system. It was not appropriate for governments to intervene in those circumstances.</para><para>But there are circumstances beyond the control of medical practitioners and beyond the control of the government. Because of those circumstances, it has been necessary for the government to step in, to be responsive, to go through the consultative process and to ensure the funding is there to provide to the Australian public a system with a level of medical care that the public have come to expect. I commend and congratulate our minister for the work he and his department have done to ensure that we can continue to have good medical services.

Rather, I reflected on the legislation that we have before us here and the abject failure of this government to resolve the issue. Even this legislation is not the last word on medical indemnity insurance within this House. This government threw our health system into chaos with its failure to act to resolve the medical indemnity crisis. The Howard government, through a series of health ministers, did nothing as the crisis in medical indemnity went from bad to worse and then to a situation where the entire health system was verging on collapse. It created a situation of uncertainty for everybody: uncertainty for the doctors, uncertainty for Australian families and uncertainty for the health system—which the Howard government brought to the brink of collapse.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It is important to note that the one thing that is really important for a health system is that the people of the nation can have faith in it. It is important for the patients to have certainty that the system will deliver to them, and it is important for the doctors to have certainty that they will be covered for medical indemnity insurance. This government have handled the situation very badly. They have grossly mishandled it, I have to say, and they have demonstrated to us on this side of the House and to the Australian people just how incompetent they are when it comes to matters of health care and providing health services and certainty to the Australian people. </para><para>Within the area that I represent in this parliament, the Central Coast of New South Wales, 11 doctors resigned because of the uncertainty created by this government. At least one of those doctors has not returned, and this has created quite a void in services on the Central Coast. Furthermore, doctors have been so intimidated by the medical indemnity insurance situation and frightened about their ability to cover the extra costs it has imposed on them that they have been forced into charging additional fees—which places health care outside the financial ability of many Australians.</para><para>I think I should go through some of the background to this legislation and some of the bungling that has taken place in relation to it. I want to share with the House the feelings of doctors and people in the area that I represent. In November 2001, UMP collapsed, and it had an estimated liability of $460 million. That was incurred liability, not purported. The government agreed to take responsibility for UMP's IBNR liabilities. The cost of the bailout was to be passed on directly to UMP members and former members by the now infamous IBNR levy. It is important to note here that in New South Wales the majority of doctors were insured with UMP, so that had a bigger impact in New South Wales. As members would be aware, that is where the electorate of Shortland is.</para><para>The Howard government put in place a plan. We are always hearing about `a plan' or `a new approach'—`We'll get it right this time.' They put in place a plan to recoup $580 million over 10 years from doctors who were members of UMP as at 30 June 2000. That led to the mass resignation of doctors in August and September last year when they received their IBNR levy notices. The levies were extraordinarily high and made the ongoing practice of medicine unviable for doctors in many areas.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hockey, Joe, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Hockey</name></talker><para>—Because of your laws!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83N</name.id><name role="metadata">Hall, Jill, MP</name><name role="display">Ms HALL</name></talker><para>—I am sure the minister would be most grateful for the action taken by the New South Wales government, because the New South Wales government were responsible for acting initially and saving the system in New South Wales.

As I was saying, when doctors received their notices it led to mass resignations in New South Wales, particularly on the central coast of New South Wales, the area that I represent in this parliament; and nothing the minister can say will change that fact. That situation was badly handled and it still leaves a lot to be desired, Minister.

That panel came out with recommendations which have been encompassed within this legislation.

It really is an indictment on their performance as a government. The Australian people know just how poor their performance has been in the area of medical indemnity insurance and in health generally.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I will quickly turn to some of the problems that have been experienced within my own electorate of Shortland. One of the local hospitals—Belmont Hospital, a fine hospital—within the electorate has been placed in a situation where it has had to consider the ongoing viability of providing maternity services. This is directly related to the issue of medical indemnity insurance. The government's inaction has created a situation where there is quite a chronic shortage of anaesthetists within the Hunter, to the extent that anaesthetists have even been flown from South Africa on a rotating basis to make up the shortfall within the local area.</para><para>Doctors are frightened about taking on the more dangerous specialities, and this legislation deals with and addresses that to a large extent. But there has been so much angst and heartache within the community caused by the inaction of the government. One specialist who lives within the Shortland electorate has spent a lot of time detailing to me the weakness of the government's approach. This specialist is a Liberal voter. He has come to me and said that, because of the way the government have handled this issue, he will be thinking twice about voting for them.</para><para>This has been a problem for GPs too. They have felt very uncertain about the handling of the issue and about their futures. If there is one thing that people involved in the health system need—be they doctors or health service providers—it is certainty. Under this government, we have had a regime that works on disaster and crisis management. That has been their approach to medical indemnity insurance and, for that matter, to all matters relating to health. They have overseen a collapse in bulk-billing in Australia. Bulk-billing has declined by an enormous rate. In the Shortland electorate, since 2002 bulk-billing has declined from over 78 per cent to 51.3 per cent. In the adjoining electorate of Dobell, bulk-billing has declined from 83.4 per cent to 58.2 per cent. </para><para>These figures represent real hardship to the people that I represent in this parliament. These figures show that people can no longer go along to their doctors and expect them to bulk-bill. The average difference between a doctor's fee and the rebate for people living in the area I represent in this parliament is $7 to $13. In some cases it is more. I have heard of an example of one medical practice within the Shortland electorate that has taken to charging an extra $5 for Saturdays, and I know that many practices charge after-hours fees. This is all making it less and less affordable for people to go and see a doctor when they need to.</para><para>I am absolutely disgusted with the government's refusal to release quarterly bulk-billing rates. I have been able to track the decline in bulk-billing in the Shortland electorate. Since 1998 bulk-billing has been declining in Shortland. Since this government came to power, they have pursued the destruction of Medicare, and that has manifested itself in the decline in bulk-billing.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AN0</name.id><name role="metadata">Ciobo, Steven, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Ciobo</name></talker><para>—Rubbish!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83N</name.id><name role="metadata">Hall, Jill, MP</name><name role="display">Ms HALL</name></talker><para>—Nothing any member on the other side of this House can say will change that fact.

That is not good enough, and I am going to make sure everyone in the electorate that I represent, the electorate of Shortland, is aware of the massive cover-up by the government.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Over the last two years there has been a constant upward movement—a 15 per cent increase—in health insurance premiums. This year we are going to be faced with an average increase of 7.5 per cent. Whilst at my local shopping centre last Saturday, I had people coming up to me who had already made calculations as to whether or not they could afford to maintain their health insurance. Overwhelmingly people were saying that they can no longer afford it. They were very upset; they felt that they had been duped by the Howard government. The Prime Minister promised the Australian people lower health insurance premium rates and he has not delivered on that promise.</para><para>We have the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate and we have government members of a Senate committee suggesting that maybe we should move to 40 per cent. This money is going directly into the pockets of big business, into the health insurance industry. The people of Australia want not only affordable private health insurance rates but also treatment in a private hospital without having to pay the enormous gap. One gentleman I spoke to at the local shopping centre had to pay $1,827 for an anaesthetist. He received approximately $570 back from Medicare and approximately another $160 from his private health insurance company, leaving him out of pocket by over $1,000. This is hardly a system that is working for the average Australian person.</para><para>The Howard government is destroying the health system. Little by little it is undermining the confidence Australians have in our health system—be it the doctors' confidence that they will be able to afford medical indemnity insurance or that the medical indemnity insurance they have is sustainable, or be it in the patients' confidence that they will be adequately covered by the medical insurance of the day.</para><para>Australians lack confidence in the government's ability to ensure that bulk-billing will survive and in the Howard government's ability to ensure affordable private health insurance.

There are many ways in which the Australian public health system could be improved if the Labor Party put aside the scheme that is currently operating in respect of Centenary House and their fake concern with private health insurance premiums increasing and dealt with the issue at hand. We could put more taxpayer dollars into making sure that we continue to operate a world class health system if we did not have to waste money on propping up the Australian Labor Party through the Centenary House rort. </para><para>The bills before the House today, the <inline ref="R1918">Medical Indemnity Amendment Bill 2004 </inline>and the <inline ref="R1917">Medical Indemnity (IBNR Indemnity) Contribution Amendment Bill 2003</inline>, go to the core of ensuring that our health system continues to operate effectively. These bills demonstrate the way in which the Howard government has responded to the problems that have arisen in the past several years with regard to medical indemnity. The problems that arose with medical indemnity were not foreseen on the radar. They arose, unfortunately, as a consequence of the collapse of UMP and of changes in the insurance marketplace. Some very significant payouts have been made against doctors to patients because of doctors' negligence. Many of these problems have arisen because Australian society has become more litigious.</para><para>The bills currently before the House try to stem some of the haemorrhaging that has been occurring in this sector as a consequence of these very large payouts. The reality is that there are many examples in which doctors have been placed on the back foot as a result of their MDOs—medical defence organisations—trying to respond to the various pressures that are now arising in the private medical protection insurance industry. The bills currently before the House have two key purposes. They are to make amendments to the `incurred but not reported' indemnity scheme, which was legislated for in the Medical Indemnity Act 2002. In the short-term, these amendments will ensure that the financial burden placed on doctors, under the IBNR scheme, will be lessened. The bills also put in place arrangements for what was formerly known as the blue sky scheme, which is now called the exceptional claims scheme.</para><para>With respect to the background of the medical indemnity problems, I highlight that the provision of medical indemnity to cover doctors in Australia has really had problems since early 2002. These problems effectively contain three key elements. The first, as I mentioned, was the collapse of the MDO UMP—which is also Australian Medical Insurance Limited—in May 2002. Prior to entering into liquidation, UMP, or AMIL, provided indemnity to approximately 60 per cent of medical practitioners nationally. On 14 November 2003 the Supreme Court of New South Wales released UMP/AMIL from provisional liquidation, thereby enabling the business to go back into normal operation.</para><para>The second key element is the fact that MDOs have not, in the past, made sufficient provision for `incurred but not reported' claims. It has historically been the case that MDOs provided their members with `claims incurred' cover. Under a `claims incurred' policy, doctors were insured against injuries to patients brought about through conduct which took place during the term of the policy. Patients' claims could be notified to the MDO at any time—for example, during the term of the policy or once the policy had lapsed; that could be a period of up to five years after the policy had lapsed. Also, incidents which occurred during the term of the policy gave rise to claims that were reported to the MDO after the policy had lapsed. These are referred to as `incurred but not reported' claims. The third element of the problems that have arisen in the medical indemnity industry is the significant increases in medical indemnity premiums for doctors. These have largely been a consequence of the significant payouts that have arisen as a consequence of our more litigious society. </para><para>The government has put in place a range of measures to address the medical indemnity problems. These include: the Commonwealth acting as a guarantor for claims arising out of medical procedures provided by doctors covered by UMP and AMIL; Commonwealth funding for the IBNRs of doctors that were members of MDOs as at 30 June 2002, where the IBNRs were unfunded—to date, the only MDO that is regarded as having had unfunded IBNRs is, of course, UMP, or AMIL; Commonwealth reimbursement to providers of medical indemnity insurance of 50 per cent of insurance payouts that exceed $500,000, where the incident has been notified on or after 1 January 2003—that is, the exceptional claims scheme; premium subsidies to obstetricians, neurosurgeons and procedural general practitioners who undertake Medicare billable procedures; and, finally, measures to ensure that providers of medical indemnity insurance are subject to the same prudential regulatory requirements as other general insurers and this includes prudential supervision by the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority. These are the ways in which the government has been proactive in providing a solution to a problem which was not of our making but which this government has been called upon to solve.</para><para>I was recently fortunate enough to have the Minister for Health and Ageing, the Hon. Tony Abbott, visit my electorate of Moncrieff. On this occasion, I made sure that the health minister had the opportunity to sit down face to face with a number of the Gold Coast's leading doctors to discuss the various problems that have arisen in the industry. I know that as a consequence of these discussions the doctors are more fully informed about what this government is doing to solve the problem. In addition, the doctors were also provided with a first-hand opportunity to put their thoughts directly to the minister. The reality is that this government's response to the medical indemnity problem has been founded on consultation with industry. The response has been good—it has been the response that the industry has called for—but, more importantly, it has been a bipartisan response between the federal coalition government and the various state Labor governments. The reality is that many aspects of reform continue to be made. We need to ensure that there are legislative changes as we grow accustomed to the continuing changes that are occurring with respect to medical indemnity. Having said that, this is yet another piece of the puzzle in which this government has undertaken to ensure that we solve many of the problems with respect to medical indemnity. I commend these bills to the House and urge the Labor Party to support them.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>25579</page.no><name role="metadata">Andren, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDREN</name><name.id>KL6</name.id><electorate>Calare</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There is no doubt that we need to provide for our medical practitioners the medical indemnity cover that the <inline ref="R1990">Medical Indemnity Amendment Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R1991">Medical Indemnity (IBNR Indemnity) Contribution Amendment Bill 2004</inline> promise. Already, our medical practitioners and the provision of medical services to ordinary Australians have been stretched to a point that spells crisis for the long-term wellbeing of our health system. In regional and rural areas like Calare, it is already nigh impossible for many people to either afford or access some specialists, especially if they already experience the disadvantages of having little money or no transport and the daily burden of pain or failing health. I am not here to defend some specialists over issues like gap payments in private hospitals, but I will defend them very strongly on this indemnity issue. Already, in regional and rural areas such as Calare, services provided by medical specialists are stretched and any disincentive to continue practice, such as the recent IBNR fiasco, could be devastating for rural health services. </para></talk.start><para>The likelihood of a litigious action looming out of left field many years after retirement is obviously a huge disincentive to specialists continuing practice. In many cases they are nearing the age of retirement and some are tempted to take the wiser option, if you like, of an early retirement. It is going to cost rural communities dearly if indeed they take that path and we have not put in place measures to ensure that they are not unfairly sued at a later date. </para><para>In May 2002, despite warning signs years earlier, Australia's main medical defence organisation went into liquidation, leaving some 60 per cent of Australia's medical practitioners, most of whom are in New South Wales, without medical indemnity cover. The lower premiums that had been achieved by taking into account only declared and reported claims left bone-dry a well of reserves to pay for the yet to be claimed liabilities. And of course as time went on those unclaimed liabilities mounted until the tail came back to sting the profession, and doctors and specialists were suddenly left with no cover. </para><para>Last year, faced with the urgent prospect of doctors and specialists having no choice but to walk away from their professions because they did not have cover, this House passed the Medical Indemnity Act 2002 and the Medical Indemnity (IBNR Indemnity) Contribution Act 2002 to avert the crisis. Under those pieces of legislation the government had to indemnify the sinking medical defence organisation UMP for some $460 million worth of unfunded incurred but not reported claims. This allowed UMP to shake off liquidation and to fund those IBNRs of doctors who had paid for that cover at 30 June 2000. An undertaking was made to reimburse medical indemnity insurance providers 50 per cent of insurance payouts that exceed $500,000, where the incident has been notified on or after 1 January last year under the new High Cost Claims Scheme. Subsidies were promised to offset those already exorbitant premiums for obstetricians, neurosurgeons and procedural general practitioners who undertake Medicare billable procedures. Finally, medical indemnity insurers were also to be brought under the same prudential regulatory umbrella as other general insurers. This includes the prudential supervision by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. </para><para>This is all very well, and in order to pay for this urgently needed fix a large part of the indemnity covered by government would be recouped through a levy imposed on the members of the MDO. In essence, this levy could almost be seen as a retrospective payment of the amount of insurance that government should have ensured was being paid in the first place. The levy was worked out as equalling but not exceeding 50 per cent of the member's annual subscription for the 2000 financial year and it was deemed that this levy would be paid for 10 years. But for a profession that can pay premiums of up to $70,000 a year and more and for those GPs whose costs in running a practice are not recognised in the totally inadequate Medicare rebate they receive another 50 per cent on top of that premium for the next 10 years was a huge incentive to walk away from the profession. Not surprisingly, the solution offered was seen as a piece of quackery, a bandaid solution that the profession rejected. </para><para>Again Australia faced a continuing crisis, one among many crises our declining health system seems still to be facing. These bills put in place a number of measures to enable MDOs to afford the cost of those medical insurance payouts, to extend subsidies towards the cost of rising medical indemnity premiums across all specialties, to replace the unpopular IBNR levy with a UMP support arrangement and to provide cover for certain groups of doctors who have left the work force. So from July 2004, while the levy and terms of the moratorium still apply, there are changes to the IBNR levy and its place in the framework within this new Premium Support Scheme. At the conclusion of the moratorium on 31 December, at the end of this year, doctors who do not qualify for exemption from payment of the levy will pay the lesser of their original IBNR bill, two per cent of gross Medicare billable income or $5,000. Eligible doctors will only pay a contribution for the length of their membership of UMP, with a minimum of one year, and will pay no contribution beyond the 2008-09 financial year. They will not have to pay any contribution if they earned less than $5,000 in Medicare billable income in the previous year. There are also a number of available exemptions from the payment.  </para><para>The new Premium Support Scheme will cover 80 per cent of a doctor's medical indemnity costs that exceed 7.5 per cent of their gross medical income. These costs include the cost of premiums, the IBNR and the run-off cover to be offered. Doctors will not have to jump through administrative hoops to apply for the PSS, as it will be provided directly through the insurer. From 1 January this year, subsidies for procedural GPs performing Medicare billable procedures in rural, remote and metropolitan area classifications 3 to 7 will be increased from 50 to 75 per cent of the difference between the cost of their premiums and the premiums of non-procedural GPs. This will certainly help doctors in my electorate of Calare and indeed throughout the country, particularly in regional areas with their higher costs and workloads. The high cost scheme will now reimburse MDOs 50 per cent of an insurance payout over $300,000, previously $500,000, and up to the limit of a practitioner's insurance. </para><para>These bills go a long way to addressing the immediate concerns of the affordability of premiums and security for our medics. I note that the Australian Medical Association cautiously welcomes the package. But we must remember that the cost of this to the taxpayer will be $181 million and there are no long-term guarantees. It is big ask of the Australian taxpayer, and I really do question the long-term viability of the Australian medical indemnity system. While the package provides for greater regulation and control of medical defence organisations, the bottom line is that our medical indemnity system, like our public liability system, remains in the hands of the marketplace. Still the provision of our health care and the activities of our communities remain at the behest of insurance providers, and the provision of profits and the vagaries of the marketplace dictate the security of our health carers and our community activities.</para><para>Any solution that does not address the shaky framework on which our protection from litigation hangs remains at best a loosely applied bandaid, likely to peel off under the constant pressure of litigation, rises in the cost of living and litigation legal costs. We still have seriously injured people who are not guaranteed the compensation that will cover their needs, because they must prove someone else is at fault. We still have those who do not have the money to chase compensation and those whose legal and medical fees or lack of financial training have eroded the money desperately needed to provide their care for the rest of their lives. We still have young, catastrophically injured people being parked in the first aged care facility that will take them, because the money is not there to pay for them to be cared for in their home or the facilities do not exist for young people in this condition. And still we have people receiving huge payouts for their terrible injuries, but with the emphasis on `payout' rather than provision—provision of suitable rehab, provision of proper respite care, provision of staged rather than lump sum payments and provision of victim oriented service—with no provisions for where those vast sums of money go should the injured die soon after the payout. </para><para>Over two years ago I stood here and argued that to ensure the long-term health and security of those injured or those sued for perceived fault and to ensure the wellbeing of our communities, the Commonwealth must take responsibility away from the profit driven marketplace in this of all areas of public need. The talkfests continue as to how we drive down insurance premiums and how we best provide for public liability, and we see in the ACCC's recently released second monitoring report that public liability premiums continue to rise, despite the modifications, caps and tort law reform that have been mentioned elsewhere in this debate. So we must ask: what will happen with medical insurance?</para><para>I continue to wonder, as I have for the past couple of years, at the lack of scrutiny directed at the insurance industry itself and its crucial role in this insurance crisis. With the idea of a long-term, no-fault scheme providing lifelong care for people with catastrophic injuries being promoted again by the likes of the AMA and Premier Bob Carr, I again argue, as I have for two years, for the Commonwealth to seriously consider the New Zealand accident compensation scheme as a possible solution. This scheme provides accident insurance for all New Zealand citizens and residents and temporary visitors to New Zealand. It is now run on a fully funded basis, and its unfunded liability, which accumulated under its previous pay-as-you-go basis—which, as I understand it, incidentally, was outsourced to private industry—has been reduced consistently through the payment of separate levies charged to fund those IBNRs in the same way the medical indemnity levy discussed previously was designed to do here in Australia. Under this scheme, all New Zealanders pay a small premium into one of seven accounts, with the government funding the costs of injuries to people who are not in the paid work force. The scheme provides cover for injuries, no matter who is at fault. However, importantly, it leaves open the right to sue for criminal negligence. It provides for the cost of the consequences for those injuries, such as home and vehicle modification, counselling, job retraining et cetera.</para><para>Recently in the Evans shire there was a case which resulted in a huge payout of $16 million to a road accident victim. That victim has sadly passed away, and it raises the question: to what purpose is the balance of that money applied? Surely it is not for the benefit of anyone in terms of medical protection or rehabilitation. How much better could we use the money that is provided through those sources for proper rehabilitation facilities, care facilities, respite care and so on, so that we have enough nurses out there in the community to care for these people, rather than an excessive payment, half of which seems to be skimmed off for the legal fraternity and—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AMM</name.id><name role="metadata">Hartsuyker, Luke, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Hartsuyker</name></talker><para>—Making rich relations.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>KL6</name.id><name role="metadata">Andren, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDREN</name></talker><para>—`Making rich relations', I hear the member say.

But it certainly does raise the question of where the balance of this money goes and for what purpose. </para></talk.start></continue><para>I believe the New Zealand scheme eliminates the slow, costly and wasteful processes of using the courts for each injury. It provides timely care and rehabilitation, and it minimises personal financial loss by paying weekly earnings compensation. Why can we not look at this model? There is nothing in the Constitution preventing the Commonwealth from dealing with premiums for any Commonwealth insurance schemes. It would seem that federal legislation is not only possible, but desirable. Doctors and others I speak with all over my electorate and elsewhere strongly support such a scheme, but it seems a government dominated by lawyers will not countenance such a scheme. I wonder why?</para><para>An injury compensation scheme would deal with injuries and the consequences thereof. It would remove the courts and the need to prove fault to ensure that an injured person's needs are met for as long as necessary. A scheme such as this would separate the issues of compensation for injury from the issues of criminal, seriously negligent or deceptive conduct. Those issues would continue to be dealt with in a legal setting. I cannot see a more reasonable or logical process than that—except I suspect that there is a sense within this government that it is akin to something like socialised insurance or that there are some strange ideological feelings that we would be going back down a path of government intervention in the marketplace. Well, government intervention in the marketplace for the good of all and the targeting and effective use of resources is what we should be about—not getting hung up on some government involvement in providing the sort of services that most fair-minded people demand.</para><para>I support the bill but agree with at least part of the opposition's second reading amendment; that this legislation is no longterm solution. We will be visiting it again and again in catch-up legislation as the years go by—an expensive option at $180 million a pop, as this bill represents. It can only achieve the desired result through a no-fault scheme that circumvents the legal system, allowing of course the criminal negligence cases. As for the recurring theme in this debate of the Centenary House rort—which I expect to hear of in every debate as we head into the election—I would be very wary, if I were a government or opposition member, of using the abuse of public funds as an election-year weapon. The public are not mugs.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>25583</page.no><name role="metadata">Hartsuyker, Luke, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HARTSUYKER</name><name.id>00AMM</name.id><electorate>Cowper</electorate><party>NATS</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I note the comments of the member of Calare on the importance of the insurance system providing for care and that a large payout is not always going to result in appropriate care. Appropriate care is what we should be focusing on in this very difficult issue of medical indemnity insurance. The fact that a person can receive a very large payout and regrettably pass away after a short period of time raises questions as to the appropriateness of that payout to the needs of the person. And it is the needs of the person that should always be paramount in the medical indemnity debate.</para></talk.start><para>The <inline ref="R1990">Medical Indemnity Amendment Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R1991">Medical Indemnity (IBNR Indemnity) Contribution Amendment Bill 2004</inline> are government measures to tackle problems in the medical indemnity insurance market. They follow the recommendations which were made by the Medical Indemnity Policy Review Panel in December last year. The panel adopted a cooperative approach to the problem and brought together key stakeholders including government, medical and legal professionals. It comprised the Minister for Health and Ageing; Senator Coonan; John Phillips, former Reserve Bank Deputy Governor; Nancy Milne, an insurance law specialist from Clayton Utz; Dr Bill Glasson, the AMA president; Dr Andrew Pesce of the AMA; Professor Don Sheldon of the Council of Procedural Specialists; and Dr Sue Page of the Rural Doctors Association. </para><para>The measures are welcomed by the Australian Medical Association. Dr Glasson, the association's president, said that the issues of affordability and security have been addressed by these measures. The medical indemnity insurance problem has been of great significance to the community and of great concern to the medical profession, much in the way that public liability has been of great concern to the wider community. In days gone past, when you went into business or launched a career in medicine, the issue of insurance was not foremost in your mind as you embarked on a career. But, regrettably, these days any aspiring doctor, professional or businessperson has to contend with the very real prospect of very large insurance premiums when they commence their business. Many people have left their businesses or professions as a result of these high insurance premiums, and many community groups have been forced to cancel functions and events as a result of the continuingly high insurance premiums.</para><para>The reality is that society is becoming more litigious. This is both the perception we get from reports about massive compensation payouts for claims which seem somewhat unwarranted, and also the reality of the fact that insurance premiums are rising rapidly as businesses guard against being sued. It is an important fact to note that it is the community as a whole that bears the cost of litigation. Doctors and other professionals, community groups and businesses pay for it through premiums. The government pays for it, which means the taxpayer is paying for it. The consumer pays for it by way of increased fees and charges which businesses have to levy in order to make a profit.</para><para>I believe the ability of lawyers to advertise has exacerbated the problem. There is an aggressive pursuit of plaintiff business by some law firms and practitioners. I believe the `no win, no fee' arrangement and aggressive, unsolicited marketing techniques have created the perception that there are gains to be made out there by people going through litigation. It does not help the standing of the legal profession, nor does it really assist genuine claimants who have genuine causes of action and are seeking recourse. I am pleased that in New South Wales this type of advertising has recently been restricted, and I hope that that trend will continue.</para><para>We must be careful to ensure that genuine claimants have adequate recourse. The tort law system developed on the basis of the relationship of duty of care—breaches of that duty and damages caused by breaches of that duty. These are sensible principles, but I think they have been corrupted and carried to an unreasonable extent, well beyond the ratio decidendi that was laid down in earlier common law. A great deal of the problem is the claims that are settled out of court. They are often those claims at the smaller end of the spectrum and they add to the cost of our premiums. Insurance companies tend to settle claims rather than defending them because the high cost of defence means it is not worth while.</para><para>It has been said that if you fall off your chair at home it is bad luck, but if you fall off your chair in a supermarket, you are entitled to a payment. I think this litigious attitude is what we desperately need to overcome. It must be realised that accidents happen; sometimes they are caused by negligence, but other times they must be accepted as purely unfortunate events.</para><para>I have met a number of doctors about the problems caused by issues associated with medical indemnity insurance. They appreciate the need to compensate, through payments, for wrongdoing and negligence caused by malpractice, but they also cite their frustration at the increasingly litigious nature of our society and the tendency to embark on the blame game. There appears to be an expectation that when a medical procedure does not produce the desired result it is someone's fault—either the doctor, the hospital, the equipment manufacturer or whoever. The community does not appear to accept that, despite the best efforts of all concerned in a procedure, things can go wrong. When something goes wrong, apparently someone must pay. This community attitude comes at great cost. The litigious mentality that there is always someone to blame, or that someone will sue, is causing a great cost to our community. Thankfully this government has taken a leading role in tackling these problems by pursuing solutions with professional, business and community organisations. The civil liability acts in the states, which have changed negligence laws, along with other measures, are certainly good progress and will help. </para><para>The collapse of United Medical Protection, or UMP, created a great deal of difficulty for doctors who were members of that medical defence organisation. The government was quick to respond to this problem and agreed in 2002 to take over the unfunded liabilities for claims across the medical sector which had not been lodged—the incurred but not reported, or IBNR, claims. As at June 2003, the cost of IBNR scheme liabilities was estimated to be in the order of $480 million. The government's medical indemnity review panel was established to look into concerns which arose from these measures, including the cost to doctors and the ongoing issues relating to the affordability of medical indemnity insurance. The panel's recommendations have been largely adopted in these bills which build on the 2002 measures.</para><para>Under these arrangements, the government's funding of IBNR claims will not be affected. The United Medical Protection support payment scheme replaces the IBNR scheme. The new scheme calculates the payments on a different basis. Under item 23 of the Medical Indemnity (IBNR Indemnity) Contribution Amendment Bill 2004, the maximum amount payable by a practitioner will be $5,000 per annum, to be collected through medical indemnity insurers, rather than the Health Insurance Commission—item 25 of the Medical Indemnity Amendment Bill 2004. Doctors and health professionals can receive a low-income exemption from the support payment.</para><para>Schedule 4 of the Medical Indemnity Amendment Bill also puts in place a framework of premium support to subsidise premiums for some specialities, like obstetrics and other areas. The premium support scheme will also assist rural procedural GPs. The premium support scheme is being established to replace the current medical indemnity subsidy scheme arrangements. Under the new arrangements, if a doctor's medical indemnity costs exceed 7½ per cent of his or her gross private medical income, the premium support scheme will kick in to cover 80 per cent of the indemnity costs incurred over the 7.5 per cent threshold. The scheme will also help rural procedural GPs by funding 75 per cent of the difference between their premiums and those for non-procedural GPs in similar circumstances.</para><para>The need to simplify for doctors the support arrangements relating to United Medical Protection is acknowledged in this legislation. It introduces a single billing system and it changes the basis of the UMP support payment to link it to the doctor's capacity to pay. </para><para>There is a significant commitment of public funds—in the order of $620 million over the next four years—to tackle the issues and put solutions in place. I look forward to the continuing changes with respect to the negligence laws and insurance premium levels. Making doctors' insurance affordable keeps doctors in business at affordable prices for patients—and that has to be good news for the community.</para><para>Just for a moment, I would like to consider the Medicare safety net. Unfortunately, our Labor opposition is once again pursuing its strategy of mindless opposition in holding back that very important reform—the Medicare safety net. We want to see that legislation passed. I call on members opposite to pass that legislation—to convince their Senate colleagues that the provision of a safety net is a very important thing for the community, that it is not inconsistent with any policy positions that they might have, and that they should pass that legislation.</para><para>I also note the member for Shortland's concerns in relation to bulk-billing. A major element in relation to bulk-billing is the supply of doctors. We could certainly train a lot more doctors if we were not having substantial public funds diverted to pay the rent on that terrible Centenary House—which has been very much the subject of discussion.</para><para>Before concluding, I would like to turn to another issue of mindless obstruction in the Senate, and that is Labor's obstruction in relation to the reforms necessary to the Trade Practices Act with regard to public liability. The New South Wales Treasurer, Michael Egan, has described the action of the Senate as one of the biggest obstacles to law reform on this very important issue. The public liability issue is very much a parallel issue with medical indemnity. It is one of the last changes to tort law that has been drawn up by the federal government to complement the work of state Labor governments. The changes before the Senate would close important loopholes in the Trade Practices Act and underpin the state level tort law reforms.</para><para>Michael Egan has certainly been throwing his weight behind the federal government's attempts to get this legislation through the parliament. Backing this legislation is most noteworthy, and I call on members opposite to talk to their Senate colleagues and get this important trade practices legislation through the Senate for the benefit of the community. I commend the bills to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>25586</page.no><name role="metadata">Schultz, Alby, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SCHULTZ</name><name.id>83Q</name.id><electorate>Hume</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It gives me great pleasure to rise tonight to speak on the <inline ref="R1918">Medical Indemnity Amendment Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R1917">Medical Indemnity (IBNR Indemnity) Contribution Amendment Bill 2004</inline>. It is very pleasing from my point of view that something is finally being done about this very serious issue—despite the strongarm tactics of the AMA in the early throes of this particular issue, under the chairmanship of its president, Dr Bill Glasson.</para></talk.start><para>I refer to the second reading speech that Minister Abbott made on 17 December 2003, when he referred to the government's announcement of new medical indemnity measures, including a contribution of $181 million towards the cost of medical indemnity for three years, making the cost of medical indemnity more affordable for doctors. More importantly, it will assist in ensuring doctors are able to concentrate on using their considerable professional medical skills to assist Australians requiring vital medical assistance in the knowledge that the litigation mania which drives elements within the community will not force them out of the public health system. I do not think anybody would argue against that.</para><para>Medical indemnity cover for doctors has been in crisis since early 2002, when a combination of litigation, greed and the collapse of Australia's primary medical defence organisation, UMP/AMIL, saw doctors at the mercy of huge claims, and escalating medical indemnity costs and facing the possibility of financial ruin. It needs to be said that all of these problems came out of the disgraceful and unprofessional way in which that particular medical insurance organisation was handled. It was the doctors' own organisation that was incompetent in terms of not being able to manage an insurance situation with medical indemnity as professionally as it should have done. </para><para>Nevertheless, the risk and uncertainty this crisis caused, particularly with regard to incurred but not reported claims, saw doctors threatening to remove their services and mounting a public campaign through their federal organisations in an attempt to convince government that taxpayers' funds were needed to ensure doctors were not only able to have confidence in medical indemnity insurance coverage but also able to afford the cost of premiums.</para><para>During that time the doctors were getting a little bit of stick from the journos who were aware of the muscle flexing of an industrial union, which at a meeting with Dr Bill Glasson I likened to the days of the BLF when Norm Gallagher was in control. I reminded him that if he wanted to do something constructive about his members' concerns about medical indemnity he had better stop trying to be the Norm Gallagher of the Australian Medical Association, as their president, and concentrate on people such as me in the community who did have sympathy with the problems of the doctors—even though it was their own doing. We were very concerned about the position that many doctors found themselves in. I did not appreciate the use of the big-stick approach by the AMA when it threatened to campaign in marginal coalition seats instead of undertaking a sensible, conciliatory approach to their problem, which, as I said, was one to which the AMA was the contributing factor.</para><para>As I mentioned briefly before, many of the journos that were switched on to this issue did not play politics but saw it for what it was. In the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> of Wednesday, 17 December 2003, Janet Albrechtsen wrote an article about the issue. The article was headed `Give medicos a dose of their own medicine: Dr, heal thyself—if not, the Government (read: we taxpayers) certainly will'. In this article she said:</para><quote><para>Doctors had better polish up on their Latin. Nothing too difficult, just a few choice words: quid pro quo. After two days of special cabinet meetings this week, we still haven't heard exactly how the Howard Government will dole out millions of taxpayer dollars to stop doctors striking early next year.</para><para>But this much we know: we, the taxpayers, are going to be shafted—big time. We may as well lie back and, given we can't enjoy it, then at least extract some concessions, get something from doctors in return for the payola. This is the only hint of an upside in what looks destined to be a short-term fix.</para></quote><para>She went on to say:</para><quote><para>Doctors may shelter under a veneer of respectability as members of the “healing profession” and all that jazz. But take away the stethoscope and they are just another bunch of renegade unionists throwing their muscle around. In fact, the Australian Medical Association is the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union of the professions. It has so much power that even new Health Minister Tony Abbot has caved in to many of its excessive demands just to shut doctors up and keep them at work.</para><para>To be fair, Abbott was dealt a dud hand after a few decades of legal and medical vandalism. Enterprising lawyers and sentimental judges trying to do “justice”—never mind the law—left the community with a large dose of injustice in the form of an unsustainable system. Add to that a club mentality where doctors, operating under a cosy cartel, were loath to weed out even the serially negligent among them. </para></quote><para>Without reading all of the article, I think Ms Albrechtsen touched on the problem very eloquently. It is no wonder that an article by Morgan Mellish of 11 December 2003 in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> quotes Helen Coonan as saying:</para><quote><para>“It is not fair that taxpayers should be asked to wear the costs of the mismanagement of a private company owned and operated by doctors.”</para><para>That was assistant Treasurer Helen Coonan in September.</para></quote><para>The articles went on. In the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph </inline>of Friday 10 October 2003, an article headed `Doctoring a crisis,' written by David Penberthy, had this to say:</para><quote><para>“The doctors had an insurance company, their insurance company was unable to meet its financial obligations and it was owned by the doctors,” he said yesterday ...</para></quote><para>Mr Penberthy was quoting the Treasurer, Peter Costello. He went on to state:</para><quote><para>This isn't an argument but a statement of historical fact with which the AMA is deeply uncomfortable.</para><para>As such, the doctors' rhetoric has homed in on the Government's failure to act, rather than addressing the cause of the issue.</para><para>In terms of the tactics, the AMA has led specialists through a fortnight of increasingly hysterical street theatre where, like some well-heeled cult, one by one they threaten to resign from key hospitals in areas of greatest need.</para><para>It's worth comparing this approach with that of other unions, such as police, ambulance paramedics and firefighters who, in the rare event of industrial action, are desperate to reassure the public there are no risks to their safety or security. The AMA has inverted this by playing on the fears of public patients with dire warnings that people will go without care unless the Government steps in.</para><para>Shame on them. The point is not whether professionals would let things get to that stage. The point is that their rhetoric suggests things could—which, if you're a sick person, uneducated in the manners of ambit claims and industrial hyperbole, is just another thing to worry about.</para><para>On the final point, fairness, the breathtaking thing about the AMA position is that they want 100 per cent of this stuff-up to be solved by you, the taxpayer. Their 7-point plan to end the indemnity crisis is predicated on taxpayers covering all medical costs awarded for negligence claims lodged six years after a medical mistake.</para></quote><para>Those articles eloquently sum up the points that I made to Dr Bill Glasson in the meeting in this place with a number of backbenchers, where he held that industrial gun at the heads of people like me. He did not hold the gun at my head, because he had not threatened to campaign in my electorate. I invited him to do so in order that I could expose him for what he was: just another union thug using fear and apprehension in the community—including small children and aged and elderly people with sicknesses—to try and extract money from the taxpayer over an issue that his organisation, through its profession, had let get out of control. He was looking for a rescue package from the very people that he was threatening with that industrial gun.</para><para>Having said that, I also have a very good relationship with many doctors in my electorate of Hume, and I did understand the anxiety which was driving doctors in this direction. I also acknowledge and appreciate the impact any withdrawal of medical service would have on the most vulnerable communities, such as rural and regional communities. Nevertheless, from day one the government has responded admirably in recognising the plight of doctors resulting from the medical indemnity crisis by underwriting UMP's unfunded incurred but not reported liabilities claims by an injection of $485 million of taxpayers' money and by introducing a number of safeguard initiatives aimed at ensuring that doctors can continue to offer their professional skills to the public. </para><para>I commend the new minister coming into the Health portfolio on the way in which he went about trying to solve this issue in a very difficult climate—not only a difficult climate from a political point of view but also, more importantly, a very difficult climate in the whole health system right throughout Australia. What did he come up with? He came up with a number of packages after further consultation, which I note have been the subject of some criticism by members of the ALP in this place. One wonders whether at some stage the ALP will start thinking about the way some of these decisions by organisations such as the AMA are affecting the very people that they are allegedly representing as members of parliament or whether they are just going to go down the ideological path of being disruptive and obstructive of anything and everything that the government puts up to assist the community.</para><para>This was one issue that I would have thought members of parliament would have had some very real concerns about, because it was hurting people in the community who needed some assistance from politicians in an environment where the taxpayer looked like making a very significant contribution towards what I have already described as a crisis that was created because of the mismanagement of a doctors insurance program, which the doctors themselves should have picked up and done something about in the very early stages. Nevertheless, that is history, and the government has approached the crisis as a very important issue in the community that should not have been allowed to go on as long as it did and has attempted to fix it very quickly.</para><para>Through the Medical Indemnity Amendment Bill 2004 and the Medical Indemnity (IBNR Indemnity) Contribution Amendment Bill 2004, the government has come up with a number of measures that need to be implemented to make sure that we come out of this with something positive which will allow the medical system and, more particularly, the hospital system to settle down and allow doctors to get on with their job and become the respected professionals they always have been in the general community.</para><para>The government's original package of legislation in 2002 was developed to address the medical indemnity industry's long-term viability and the affordability of medical indemnity premiums for doctors. The government has continued to enhance this package of measures by extending financial protection to doctors for the cost of claims beyond the level of their indemnity insurance, which is called the exceptional claims scheme. The government has also increased the number of categories of doctors who are eligible to be exempt from the incurred but not reported liabilities—commonly referred to as the IBNR contribution—and has put a moratorium on the amount payable under the IBNR contribution for 18 months.</para><para>The Medical Indemnity Amendment Bill 2004 and the Medical Indemnity (IBNR Indemnity) Contribution Amendment Bill 2004 address two matters: firstly, a number of issues regarding the current IBNR scheme contribution, including reducing its cost of doctors; and, secondly, the continuing issue of the affordability of medical indemnity insurance. As part of its original package of measures the government introduced the IBNR scheme, and under this scheme the government agreed to take over unfunded liabilities across the medical sector for claims that had not yet been lodged—IBNR claims. As part of the scheme, doctors who were members of medical defence organisations with unfunded IBNR liabilities were to contribute to the cost to the government of meeting those liabilities over time.</para><para>Currently, United Medical Protection is the only medical defence organisation participating in the IBNR scheme. Only UMP members as at 30 June 2003 need to pay the IBNR contribution. The current cost of the IBNR scheme liabilities is estimated to be $480 million at net present value as at the time of its introduction on 30 June 2003. The medical profession, of course, responded adversely to the introduction of the IBNR contribution, citing anomalies with its application and general affordability as concerns. In response, the government established a medical indemnity policy review, which reported to the Prime Minister on 10 December 2003. The arrangements set out in the bills reflect the government's response to issues associated with the IBNR contribution. </para><para>I am not going to go through all the benefits that flowed as a result of that action by the government, but the doctors, through their industrial union, the AMA, want to think very seriously about the type of people that they put in charge of that organisation to negotiate with government. It does not matter whether it is a coalition government or a Labor government; the reality is that the government—indeed, the parliament and its members—is handling taxpayers' money and it has to handle it very responsibly. It is incumbent upon doctors, as it is upon all professional organisations and individuals, to ensure that they undertake to carry out any work, whether or not it is in overseeing an insurance company that is looking after their problems with indemnity, as professionally as they are expected to by the taxpayers and not expect taxpayers to bail them out for all of the problems that they create as a result of their incapacity to professionally handle those organisations.</para><para>In closing, I thank the House for the opportunity to make a contribution to this debate. More importantly, can I say how gratifying it is from my point of view as a federal member for a rural area to see all of the concerns and problems that sprang up as a result of the initial action taken by doctors on this issue disappear, the system now settle down and patients get a little bit more confidence in doctors as they go to hospitals and surgeries to get the professional treatment they have always taken for granted. For me personally it is very pleasing to see the wonderful work being undertaken by specialists and doctors throughout the medical profession—I am a classic example of the wonderful expertise and professionalism we have come to expect from doctors, and the world-class treatment such as I got when I had an unfortunate accident in November last year.</para><para>I say to doctors: please think very seriously about the people that you put in charge to voice your concerns to the government—running around with a big stick is not the way to go. And they pick the wrong person when they come and wave a big stick at someone like me, because I have come out of a heavy industrial background and I can assure you if anybody comes at me with a big stick I stand there, take the stick off them and let them know that I am not going to be intimidated by that sort of action. It is not constructive and it is not in the best interests of people in general. I thank you for the opportunity to make this contribution.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>25590</page.no><name role="metadata">Washer, Dr Mal, MP</name><name role="display">Dr WASHER</name><name.id>84F</name.id><electorate>Moore</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The insurance industry has been in turmoil throughout the world in recent years as societies have become more litigious and the global landscape has changed, particularly since the appalling events of September 11, 2001. Insurers faced ever-increasing pressure from soaring claim costs, while weak economic activity in Europe and the US meant that insurers received lower returns from international equity markets, which led to funding shortfalls.</para></talk.start><para>The problems in international markets were also reflected in Australia. A significant withdrawal of capacity was experienced in some areas of insurance, whilst in other areas insurers were increasing premiums, limiting their coverage or in some cases doing both. For example, in 2001, premiums in the hard-hit classes of public liability insurance and professional indemnity insurance increased by 24 per cent. These difficulties were felt all the more throughout Australia because of the collapse of Australia's second largest insurer, HIH. The collapse of HIH early in 2001 had a catastrophic knock-on effect for United Medical Protection, UMP, which insured more than 50 per cent of the nation's doctors against medical indemnity. HIH reinsured UMP, whose collapse early in 2002 sparked the medical indemnity crisis. </para><para>Medical indemnity cover has been offered to doctors in Australia for more than 100 years through medical defence organisations, or MDOs, which are mutual associations of doctors. Traditionally, MDOs provided cover on a claims incurred basis, meaning that doctors paid a premium for a year and knew that they would be covered forever for an incident in that year. But, following pressure from the reinsurance market, MDOs moved to provide cover on a claims made basis. Under this system, doctors have to maintain cover by continuing to pay annual premiums to the same indemnity provider. If doctors wish to change providers or leave practice, they have to purchase run-off cover.</para><para>The Howard government has already implemented a number of measures to alleviate the problems associated with medical indemnity insurance, and the <inline ref="R1990">Medical Indemnity Amendment Bill 2004</inline> builds on those earlier initiatives. In 2002-03 the government legislated to provide a secure prudential and financial framework for the medical indemnity industry and for doctors. For the first time, organisations offering medical indemnity cover were brought under the supervision of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority.</para><para>The government has also invested substantially in medical indemnity. It has taken on the liability to fund some $485 million worth of UMP's unfunded incurred but not reported—IBNR—claims, which were threatening to put UMP into permanent liquidation. Other measures include a scheme to provide assistance with high-cost claims, and direct financial support for doctors undertaking high-risk specialities such as obstetrics and neurosurgery. The government has also continued to work closely with the state and territory governments in pursuing tort law reforms to reduce the volume and cost of claims against doctors. I will come back to the subject of tort law reforms in a few moments.</para><para>These and other past initiatives built a solid foundation to ensure the long-term viability of medical indemnity, but they still left doctors with financial challenges and, in some cases, almost prohibitive costs for their medical indemnity insurance. The aim of this bill, together with the <inline ref="R1991">Medical Indemnity (IBNR Indemnity) Contribution Amendment Bill 2004</inline>, is to address some of these problems—particularly those of affordability—to ensure that the nation's doctors continue to provide vital medical services to the Australian community.</para><para>One of the features of the current arrangements for medical indemnity is that increased competition between MDOs, combined with pressure from lower risk doctors, has led to increased risk ratings for different sectors of the profession. This means that there are now considerable differences in premium prices between high- and low-risk areas of practice, which are in turn leading doctors to withdraw from particular specialties and so adding to work force problems.</para><para>As a result of the continuing difficulties within the industry, the Medical Indemnity Review Policy Panel was set up late in 2003 to conduct a review of medical indemnity affordability, sustainability and the IBNR levy. The panel reported to the Prime Minister on 10 December 2003, and it is on this report that the Medical Indemnity Amendment Bill 2004 and the Medical Indemnity (IBNR Indemnity) Contribution Amendment Bill 2004 are based. </para><para>One of the key features of these bills is the funding of half the cost of all claims that exceed a $300,000 threshold through the High Cost Claims Scheme. The previous threshold was $500,000. This will further reduce medical indemnity providers' costs and so limit the financial pressures on doctors' premiums. Another key feature is the introduction of a new, broader based scheme, the Premium Support Scheme—PSS—to replace the Medical Indemnity Subsidy Scheme. Under the PSS more doctors will be assisted with their medical indemnity costs than under the Medical Indemnity Subsidy Scheme.</para><para>The bills will also replace the IBNR levy with UMP support arrangements. Under the previous arrangements, the IBNR contribution was specifically linked to a doctor's past risk profile, irrespective of their capacity to pay. However, this created significant anomalies, which the government now proposes to rectify. The government will now fund three-quarters of UMP's pre-2001 liabilities, with only the remaining quarter to be recouped from doctors by affordable contributions under the new UMP support arrangements.</para><para>Under the new arrangements, doctors who were members of UMP as at 30 June in 2000 will pay whichever is the least of their original IBNR annual levy, two per cent of their gross Medicare billable income or $5,000. The legislation now links payments to a doctor's ability to pay. No doctor will be required to make payments under the UMP support scheme for more than six years, and the doctors who were members of UMP for less than six years before 2000 will only be required to make a payment for a number of years equal to the number of years they were members of UMP.</para><para>Another important aspect of these bills is the Premium Support Scheme, or PSS, which will receive additional government funding of $100 million over four years. At present, through the Medical Indemnity Subsidy Scheme, the government provides funding to assist certain high-risk specialties with the cost of their medical indemnity premiums. The current arrangements only apply to neurosurgeons, obstetricians, procedural GPs and GP registrars undertaking procedural training, and do not take into account doctors' incomes. The PSS will provide funding for 80 per cent of a doctor's medical indemnity costs if these exceed 7.5 per cent of his or her gross income. The PSS will be provided directly through a doctor's medical indemnity insurer so that he or she does not have to make a separate application. This scheme will come into full operation on 1 July 2004.</para><para>These extra measures, added to those already implemented, mean the government will now contribute a combined total of some $620 million over the next four years to meet medical indemnity claims. The Howard government has shown true leadership in brokering new medical indemnity solutions. Action taken has reassured doctors and the community that the government takes this issue seriously and is prepared to make tough decisions to achieve a satisfactory outcome for doctors and stakeholders, which in turn will restore confidence to the Australian public.</para><para>But these measures alone will not be enough to fully restore confidence. It is essential that the states and territories make sweeping tort law reforms. The recent medical indemnity crisis has not been brought about solely by problems within the insurance industry. The present tort system is adversarial in its process, rather than seeking to provide equitable compensation to plaintiffs, correct mistakes and deter negligence. For doctors, litigation is a very public punishment. The current tort system, where the determination of issues is carried out in an adversarial forum, makes it less likely that doctors will receive constructive criticism. Rather, the system appears to punish defendant doctors. </para><para>The reality of the current system is that doctors and patients are set against each other and patients are encouraged, in order to achieve optimum compensation, to maximise any deficiencies in the care given by the doctor. Increasingly, medical negligence cases cease to reflect a mistake made by a competent but fallible doctor but seek to portray the doctor as incompetent or derelict in their duty to the patient.</para><para>This situation clearly has an adverse effect on doctor-patient relationships and has a significant impact on a sued doctor, not only professionally and economically but also psychologically. Sued doctors are also more likely to avoid certain categories of patients. General practitioners who have never been sued live daily with the threat of litigation hanging over their head like the sword of Damocles. It is the most significant source of stress in most doctors' lives. Having been a GP in my electorate of Moore for more than 26 years, I can vouch for that.</para><para>It is of even more concern that the current tort system has led to a situation where many medical practitioners structure their practices around procedures to avoid being sued. This practice has become known as a `defensive medicine' program. Some instances of defensive medicine include increased referrals or follow-ups that are not clinically warranted and diagnostic tests that are not clinically indicated. Some doctors even avoid patients, treatments and procedures thought to increase the risk of an adverse outcome and litigation. And none of this is good for the patient.</para><para>Increased reliance on medical technology increases health care costs unnecessarily, and avoidance of high-risk patients and illnesses reduces the community's access to health services. Diagnostic tests and treatments that are not clinically indicated carry their own risk of side effects and iatrogenic harm. But of even more concern than that is the breakdown of trust between doctor and patient. Doctors who are wary of their patients are less likely to establish the mutual trust that is necessary for optimal patient care. Clinical decisions made for reasons of self-protection compromise both patient care and doctor integrity.</para><para>As it stands, the current tort system fails to achieve its aims of optimising the quality of patient care by offering equitable compensation, correction and deterrence. Instead, through its actual effects of punishing defendant doctors and introducing mutual mistrust and antagonism into the doctor-patient relationship, it has made doctors focus more on avoidance of litigation than on improvement of patient care. Fundamental changes are necessary to the tort laws governing medical negligence. Patients and their lawyers must also fundamentally change their approach to making a claim for compensation. Until tort law reforms are put into place, the volume and magnitude of medical negligence claims will continue to put pressure on medical indemnity.</para><para>The <inline ref="">Medical Indemnity Amendment Bill 2004</inline>, together with the government's previous legislation, will help to alleviate problems within the industry and provide certainty and reduce medical indemnity costs for doctors. Although there will be a large cost to taxpayers, the benefits for the community through the ongoing provision of quality medical services will far outweigh the costs. Finally, I ask the opposition parties in the Senate to pass the tort law reform legislation to close the loophole which allows people avoiding state law reforms to use parts of the Trade Practices Act to recover damages for personal injury—which was never the intent of the act. I commend the bills to the House. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>25594</page.no><name role="metadata">Tuckey, Wilson, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TUCKEY</name><name.id>SJ4</name.id><electorate>O'Connor</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is with great pleasure that I join this debate on the <inline ref="R1990">Medical Indemnity Amendment Bill 2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R1991">Medical Indemnity (IBNR Indemnity) Contribution Amendment Bill 2004</inline> and express my support for the proposals involved. Nevertheless, I think it is worth putting on the record what the government have been forced to do—at a cost to the Australian taxpayer—because the nation and its legislatures have failed to properly address issues that are fundamental to public liability. We have had plenty of warning. The United States of America has to spend 12 per cent of its GDP on health matters, and there is significant evidence that the three per cent differential with Australia, at about nine per cent, has arisen as a result of the plaintiff lawyers and litigation which are endemic in that nation. As a consequence, in certain states of America where the state legislatures have addressed the problem of plaintiff lawyers and litigation there has been a massive reduction in the cost to the taxpayer, because capping and other legislative measures were implemented that made it less profitable for plaintiff lawyers to participate. In that nation, things got to the point where you could not get into outpatient care without being confronted by someone with a clipboard who would go through a checklist to see what services you had whilst you were in hospital, in the hope of finding something on which there would be grounds to sue.</para></talk.start><para>Australia took a terrible fright in that regard. The evidence is legion in many areas of local governments suffering huge costs—local pony clubs closing down et cetera—and nowhere has it been a bigger issue than it is with medical indemnity. In reading the minister's second reading speech, my attention was drawn to the fact that this legislation, plus the other packages that the government has improved, will cost $620 million over the next four years. A noted economist called Friedman shocked the world when he reminded us, `There is no such thing as a free lunch.' In other words, in the end, someone will pay. The person who lines up in response to an advertisement that says, `Your first legal interview is free. Come to me and I won't charge you if I fail to get you money,' thinks that they are going to gain by that process; but the fact is that their children, their relatives and their neighbours will pay for it—through increased insurance premiums, in this case.</para><para>The interesting thing about the free lunch is that the $620 million sandwich—which this government proposes, quite properly, because our political processes have failed to address the system—will come with no meat. It will just be two slices of bread for the person who suffered some sort of injury or difficulty arising from, say, a medical procedure. Why? Because the meat is to be extracted by the administrators of an insurance fund, which we quite properly are propping up, and by the plaintiff lawyers who say, `The first interview is free; but mate, it's going to cost you plenty in the long run.' I think I am correct in quoting Premier Carr from New South Wales, whom I would credit with taking a more positive approach to this issue than anybody else in Australia at the political level, when I say that his argument was that about 70 per cent of the claims that are processed under these principles go to the lawyers. In other words, it is not only the meat but also the butter that disappears from the free lunch. The person who has suffered—or who believes they have suffered—an injury gets precious little. What is the purpose of that? </para><para>We would be told by people on the opposition benches that New Zealand has a better system, and that is called a no-fault insurance system. I do not agree with that either, because it does not take away entirely the tendentious claim. It is my view that, if there is a genuine injury, it would be better to look at it on equity and economic grounds and say that the Australian welfare system in a generous fashion attends to the needs of people who suffer in the process of being born, being operated upon or tripping over in a public facility for which local government has a responsibility.</para><para>In my early years in this place—there is nobody here at the moment who was here at that time, and it was not in this building—I became part of the then Standing Committee on Road Safety. We conducted an inquiry into vehicle licensing. It was the Year of the Disabled, and we thought we should extend the inquiry to the licensing of disabled drivers. We visited a hospital where they had a training program for such people. It was interesting to me—and this is fundamental to this debate—that a number of paraplegics were being taught to drive cars which had all the amenities on the steering wheel. They were mostly workers compensation or road trauma beneficiaries who had got settlements from one of the many insurance operations that we run. But one individual got home from work one day, climbed up on the roof of his house to fix a cracked tile, slipped and fell down over the adjoining fence to his neighbour's place—and he was in the same condition. He did not have a new car. He did not have all the bells and whistles. He had a second-hand car and was struggling on a pension.</para><para>That is the inequity in the system. Make sure you get injured at work. Make sure there is something that you claim or a medical practitioner who can be taken to court and accused of negligence. I think that is unfair. I think that is wrong. I think the guy I am talking about who fell off his own roof is entitled to a better deal out of the welfare system, while many of those who are not paraplegics are getting benefits from the system that we nationally accept and, through the efforts of plaintiff lawyers and others, are getting a better deal than might be fair.</para><para>We in this House are well aware—we would be fools otherwise—that this system is corrupt. It is not always corrupt, but there is plenty of evidence of people who plague the system—people who, for example, get Aunty Jane to say she ran her car into nephew Smith and then claim for injuries they do not have. We know that within the workers compensation area and all the other areas there is abuse of the system. That would be less attractive if the dollars were not so big. That is another downside of a system that, in the first instance, provides a lump sum. We know that some of those quite legitimately receiving lump sums see them eroded by relatives or neighbours and end up back on the welfare system anyway. So, all in all, the system does not work.</para><para>Tonight we are dealing primarily with these sorts of issues as they relate to medical practitioners. I was most impressed when the current president of the AMA, Dr Glasson, pointed out to me where the system fails. The failure deals with the definition of negligence. To me, a medical practitioner who is negligent, for instance—and this is a pretty graphic example—is one who gets you in the hospital and cuts off the wrong leg. We read jokes about that. I think it is negligence when, for instance, you are injected with excessive quantities of morphine and you die. There is not much we can do for you thereafter. The fact of life is that that is negligence, and I believe the question thereafter should be: does that doctor have a right to practise? But we do not ask that. We say: `Ring up your insurance company, plead negligent and pay the money.' In other words, we have a system that backs up true failures in the system—although let me say that I think in Australia they do not occur very frequently. </para><para>So what are all these settlements about? A sum of $20 million was paid for a child born 20 years ago, because the doctor had one of two options and chose the wrong one. That is not negligence. In this very place we are confronted with taking one option or another from time to time and under significant pressure. Say a doctor, having treated a woman during her pregnancy, is of the view, because he has no reason to think otherwise, that a normal birth will be okay. At the death knock, halfway through that process, he comes to the conclusion that a caesarean is necessary—but it takes half an hour to get an operating theatre in place and in that time the child suffers brain damage. Is that negligence? I do not think it is. But there has been judgment after judgment in our courts that says it is.</para><para>This legislation certainly does not fix that. It just says the Australian taxpayer will pay whatever the courts decide if it exceeds certain amounts of money. I do not criticise that, because this depends on the support of state governments. I know—I got some information on this—that the Ipp committee raised this issue and came up with what they referred to as the modified Bolam principle. A number of states have responded; my state of Western Australia still has a draft bill. I have read their comments over there, and they are more inclined to look after the plaintiff lawyers than people in these circumstances. It is patently silly to think that a case can be prosecuted 20 years after the event and yet, whilst there have been efforts—my schedule tells me where people have cut those periods down—there are still opportunities of that nature.</para><para>But who pays? Do people believe there is some miracle angel out there that sends the money? The minister in his second reading speech has quite properly told us—and I congratulate him for his compassion and his assistance in keeping medical practitioners in business—that we are going to spend $620 million of taxpayers' money to keep a medical insurance process in place, because there will still be inappropriate and gigantic claims relative to events that I do not think were negligent.</para><para>I do not think a local government authority is negligent because it failed to put a sign up saying, `If you are an inexperienced driver, don't drive here.' You can imagine how much notice a driver would take of that sign. There was a case in Western Australia which, to the great credit of the judge, was chucked out of court. A person who, tragically, is a quadriplegic fronted up demanding compensation. A local authority did not tell her that she should not have been driving on a particular road because she lacked the experience to do so. On that occasion the court found properly, perhaps through the conservatism of the judicial system in Western Australia. That was not the case in New South Wales where a fellow, to show off to his girlfriend, jumped into shallow water and became a quadriplegic. The ratepayers of a particular council were up for $10 million because a bloke was an idiot.</para><para>I do not see that the community should have to pay those sorts of sums, but I am prepared to accept that once a person, maybe through their own fault, has become a quadriplegic the community must give them care, and sufficient income to survive. I think we as a community would be much better off if we accepted people as welfare propositions where there is genuine evidence that a person, at whatever level, needs our assistance, rather than going through the process of propping up insurance entities, which have administrative costs and  are typically adversarial. If Premier Carr is correct, the larger proportion of the money that is supposed to help someone in need goes to legal firms. The legal firms were doing very nicely out of the process. Some of them have had to amalgamate, simply to achieve economies, because there has been some tort law reform. </para><para>If we cannot get the states to be sensible, it is time it became a requirement of the national-states medical agreement that state governments clearly define what is negligence in the medical area and, for that matter, in other areas. I do not think that would be too difficult. I have given examples in my speech. </para><para>I have one leg shorter than the other because I drove a car into some trees one night. The incident occurred at a point on a road where the seal dropped from 20 feet to 12 feet. I knew that, and I drove inappropriately. I did not sue the local government authority, although I probably could have. I was the driver and I knew I was at fault. I did not ask the community to back me up.</para><para>In Western Australia a woman, who was training a few people on a town oval, got a settlement of $70,000 or $80,000. She was the coach and turned her ankle whilst running around telling them what to do. Surely if there was a duty of care, it was for her to make sure that her pupils did not turn their ankles. There is no such thing as a free lunch and, when a person chooses litigation to establish their claim, there is no meat in the sandwich—the lawyers get that.</para><para>We are doing the right thing but it is a bandaid measure. I do not think this is an issue for adversarial politics. There is a better way. It is about time we approached each other, got together and worked it out to the benefit of the community. People who suffer injuries, whether at birth, through a hospital procedure, in a motor car or at work, must be reasonably cared for to the level of their injury or loss of income. I do not think that propping up medical insurance, and everything else, is the answer. We must change the law and make it clear.</para><para>You cannot blame an employer, who is working in an area remote from another workplace, because some idiot does not take reasonable precautions in their workplace. They should do that in their own interests. We should address all these issues in the law so that our judiciary have a fundamental understanding of them. It is pretty tough on the judges. A judge is there looking at the disadvantaged person and thinking, `How can I help?' They forget how many other people will go without to support that decision. This is something for government. We must look after those in need, but we should not have all these convoluted processes and the legal profession should not be the major winners.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>25597</page.no><name role="metadata">Abbott, Tony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ABBOTT</name><name.id>EZ5</name.id><electorate>Warringah</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Health and Ageing</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We are debating the Medical Indemnity Amendment Bill 2004 and the Medical Indemnity (IBNR Indemnity) Contribution Amendment Bill 2004 not because we want to spend $620 million and not because we want to help plaintiff lawyers to continue to live in the manner to which they are accustomed. We are debating this legislation because there has been an explosion of tort law litigation in this country which has particularly affected the medical profession and, as a result of that explosion, many doctors were considering withdrawing from practice. While the federal government cannot deal with tort law reform, it certainly can deal with insurance. That is effectively what we are doing now.  </para></talk.start><para>I thank all who have contributed to this debate. I should single out my opposite number, the member for Lalor. Her speech, stripped of its ritual abuse of the government and of ministers past and present, was not a bad precis of developments in this area over the last decade. She did move a pious amendment but, as I understand it, the opposition do not oppose this legislation. I am grateful for small mercies. The opposition did not say what they would do to solve this problem. They said simply that, if they were in power, we would not be in the current position. It is easy to say that. The Tito report was delivered just a couple of weeks before the former government went out of office, so medical indemnity insurance must join the list of things the opposition would have fixed if only they had had another term.</para><para>What we are doing tonight is addressing legislation that implements most of the recommendations of the Medical Indemnity Policy Review Panel. That review panel sought affordable premiums for doctors, it sought to have the government take on the long-term care costs of catastrophically injured patients, it sought to restore medical indemnity insurance to a claims incurred basis and it sought to deal with the IBNR levy. The government has responded very fully to the recommendations of that review panel and, in so doing, has substantially addressed the desires of the medical profession, as expressed by the medical members of that review panel, to address those four key grievances.</para><para>The government is introducing premium support. If a doctor's actuarially calculated medical indemnity premium exceeds 7.5 per cent of private medical income, the government will pick up 80 per cent of the gap. We are extending the High Cost Claims Scheme to cover 50 per cent of all claims over $300,000, and this substantially addresses the long-term care issue. We are negotiating with the medical indemnity insurers to create a run-off reinsurance vehicle, and this will cover claims against former doctors who have been out of the profession for three years and doctors who have retired or are permanently incapacitated. We have replaced the IBNR levy with the UMP support scheme, under which doctors who are former members of UMP, or who were members of UMP at the relevant time, will pay two per cent of their Medicare income or $5,000 or their former levy amount—whichever is the least. Those UMP support payments will be paid in conjunction with the standard premium and will be capped for six years. Doctors who are over 65 and who are permanently retired or earn medical incomes under $5,000 will be exempt from UMP support payments.</para><para>This is a good package of legislation. It reflects the work of the Medical Indemnity Policy Review Panel. I want to thank all those who served on that panel. I particularly thank the medical members of the panel: Dr Bill Glasson, President of the AMA; Dr Andrew Pesce, the AMA's indemnity specialist; Professor Don Sheldon, Chairman of the Council of Procedural Specialists; and Dr Susan Page, President of the Rural Doctors Association of Australia. I also thank the lay members of the panel: John Phillips, a former Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank; Nancy Milne, the insurance partner at Clayton Utz; and my friend and colleague, Senator Helen Coonan, the Assistant Treasurer. The panel met frequently, it consulted widely, it cogitated deeply and, I think, came up with a very good slate of recommendations. </para><para>There are two recommendations which are not addressed by this legislation but which are worth mentioning in the course of this debate. There is a recommendation for further tort law reform. The New South Wales government has done well, and all credit to Bob Carr for what he has done in this area, but I do think it is necessary to consider further measures such as the interposition of medical assessment panels to determine whether there has been professional misconduct, or something which does not satisfy the ordinary professional standards of medicine, before it goes into the courts. Obviously, for its part, the medical profession does need to ensure that they have proper risk management strategies and programs in place. These are two recommendations of the panel which are not dealt with here but are certainly worth mentioning.</para><para>I should also mention that one of the recommendations of the panel was to have a further review in about 15 months. That is something the government certainly will do. One matter which the review at that time will consider is whether there is some merit in moving to a doctor-controlled monopoly medical indemnity insurer for this country. While we were part of the panel, we certainly received evidence that there would be significant administrative savings from a move in that direction.</para><para>In conclusion, it is important that the existing medical indemnity insurers lift their game. Over the last few years, these insurers have not always served their members well. Considerable evidence was found by the panel of a loss of faith between doctors and at least some of the medical indemnity insurers. They have to lift their game. There are some encouraging signs that they are starting to do so, and I am pleased about that. That is one of the matters which the government will reconsider in 15 months time.

In fact, I will have to declare a conflict of interest in that I actually on occasions use this product and therefore might benefit from this piece of legislation in some very small way. Paraquat is a contact herbicide to control broadleaved weeds and grasses and it is a very suitable herbicide for using around young vines. You cannot use glyphosate, because glyphosate herbicides, while they are much more effective, are too effective and will kill young vines. So I have on occasions used paraquat to control weeds in my vineyard.</para></talk.start><para>The issue at stake is the safety features that are attached to this product. When I was using this product I took advice from the research manager of the viticultural section of the CSIRO, Nigel Steele-Scott, who told me that this was a very effective contact herbicide; in fact so effective that some people may have used it on occasions to kill their grandmothers.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>0V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Slipper</name></talker><para>—Did you?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>83U</name.id><name role="metadata">Cox, David, MP</name><name role="display">Mr COX</name></talker><para>—I did not have a grandmother who I wanted to treat in this way; I just had 10 acres of weeds in the vineyard.

This bill, in the words of the explanatory memorandum, will amend the Customs Tariff Act 1995 to insert a new additional note to chapter 29 of the tariff section. That amendment would allow the chemical paraquat dichloride, with an added emetic—or vomit inducer—to be removed from chapter 38 and instead classified under subheading 2933.39.00 in chapter 29. What that does is remove the five per cent import duty on paraquat dichloride imported in a form which contains the emetic. This move was foreshadowed by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration in this House on 27 March 2003. On that occasion the parliamentary secretary, who is in the House at the moment, said:</para></talk.start><quote><para>This amendment corrects an anomaly in the tariff that sees paraquat dichloride with an added emetic, which is a safety agent that induces vomiting if swallowed, attract a duty rate of five per cent whereas paraquat dichloride without an emetic receives a duty rate of free. The purpose of the emetic is to achieve the same safety outcome as the addition of other allowable anti-dusting, colouring or stenching agents, which do not attract import duty.</para></quote><para>The 2003-04 budget papers tell us that the government will remove, with effect from 1 April 2003, the five per cent duty, and that this measure will result in a revenue reduction of $500,000 a year in perpetuity. That is, the importers of paraquat dichloride into Australia will receive a half million dollar windfall as a result of the passage of this legislation. The bill now before us seeks to remove that five per cent duty retrospectively—with effect from 24 March last year. But the Attorney-General gave no reason for the changed date of effect—from 1 April 2003 to 24 March 2003—in his second reading speech last month, preferring instead to engage in some light-hearted banter with the Speaker, saying:  </para><quote><para>This chemical, and Mr Speaker I am sure you are familiar with it, is commonly used as a herbicide.</para></quote><para>Prompting the Speaker to acknowledge:</para><quote><para>I am in fact more familiar with it than with text messaging.</para></quote><para>But I wonder just how familiar. Familiar enough to know that paraquat dichloride is banned, or severely restricted, in no less than 11 countries? That it is banned in Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Austria, and has been since as far back as December 1983, because of its high acute toxicity, risks of irreversible health and environmental effects, and potential for accidents during handling? Familiar enough to know that the governments of six industrialised countries in Europe have notified bans and restrictions under the 1998 Rotterdam convention on prior informed consent? Familiar enough to know that the European Union considered totally banning its use as recently as March last year? Perhaps even familiar enough to know that the United States Environmental Protection Agency allows its purchase and use solely by certified applicators?</para><para>Paraquat dichloride—or simply paraquat—is a chemical which honourable members should know about, if for no other reason than the fact that the World Health Organisation has dubbed it `the only highly toxic herbicide of the post-war years'. Paraquat was first identified as a herbicide by ICI in 1955 and marketed in the 1960s. It has been surrounded by controversy ever since. The major manufacturer of paraquat is a company called Syngenta, which controls about 20 per cent of the global pesticide market. The company describes paraquat, sold mainly under the trade name Gramoxone in over 120 countries, as the world's second-largest-selling agrochemical.</para><para>When first marketed, the dark brown colour led to paraquat products being mistaken for drinks like coffee or cola, particularly when decanted to other containers—a common practice in developing countries. It was also used widely to commit suicide, as we heard mentioned by the previous speaker. Since the late 1980s, Syngenta has added various safety agents to formulations such as paraquat. These include a blue pigment, a stenching agent to give it a strong and deterring odour, and an emetic to induce vomiting if swallowed. In 1996, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation—the FAO—developed a specification for active ingredient concentrates, requiring an effective emetic and blue-green colorants and encouraging the addition of other safety measures, including stanching agents and thickeners. Now we have the government moving in this bill to abolish the duty on a chemical containing an emetic—something which should have been compulsory back in 1996. It makes you wonder, doesn't it? Why the delay? And why is there still no compulsion?</para><para>According to the European Union risk classification, paraquat dichloride is very toxic by inhalation, toxic in contact with skin and toxic if swallowed. It is irritating to the eyes, the respiratory system and skin, and there is danger of serious damage to a person's health by prolonged exposure. A 1997 study in Malaysia, for example, revealed the adverse effects of paraquat and other herbicides on workers in small plantations—fingernails dropping off, nosebleeds, rashes and irritations of the skin, eyes and reproductive organs. Yet in that country just last year chemical distributor ICI was running a publicity campaign proclaiming: </para><quote><para>Paraquat and nature working in perfect harmony ... It's a FACT. PARAQUAT is environmentally friendly.</para></quote><para>Companies were also giving away baseball caps, golf balls and drums of free product with large purchases, rather than offering free safety equipment, which would have been more appropriate. Of course, there was local outrage at such misrepresentation and promotion, especially in light of the fact that the WHO regards paraquat as one of the world's deadliest chemicals. This campaign nevertheless shows the level to which the chemical companies are prepared to go to sell their products, especially in developing and third world countries, where safety regimes are often not as stringent as in other countries—and I hope the member for Kingston, when he made use of paraquat on his local vines, followed the appropriate safety regimes. As a result of the WHO's concerns, the Malaysian government has legislated to completely ban the use of paraquat by 2005. If only the Australian government showed as much concern for its citizens and did the same.</para><para>Paraquat dichloride has been criticised for its adverse impacts on workers since it was first introduced back in the 1960s. Its high toxicity and lack of antidote lead to serious ill health, and even death, from exposure. A 1999 South African study found that the lung capacity of workers exposed to paraquat was consistently 10 to 15 per cent lower than a reference population. The greatest risk of serious or fatal accidents to workers is during mixing and loading, where contact with the concentrate occurs. But fatalities have also been reported due to prolonged contact with diluted paraquat spray during application. Drift from spraying paraquat has also caused health and environmental problems. A 1993 study by the California Environmental Protection Agency identified health problems—including an increase in coughs, eye problems, diarrhoea, irritation, headache, nausea, rhinitis, throat infections, breathing problems, unusual tiredness and wheezing—after spray drift passed over the town of Hollister. A 2001 study in Costa Rica, conducted by the Central American Institute for Studies on Toxic Substances, concluded:</para><quote><para>Regulatory agencies have not fully recognized either the inherent toxicity of paraquat for human beings...</para></quote><para>But there is more. Paraquat has been ranked as very persistent in soils by a Cornell University environmental risk index in the United States. In Germany, the product is restricted to use once every four years on field crops, based on its potential to accumulate in the soil. Syngenta claims that the product is safe and has many benefits. They say:</para><quote><para>The product acts quickly, is rapidly inactivated in soil and won't contaminate ground or surface water ... If you follow the instructions, you are safe. That's why we do not discuss a ban on the product.</para></quote><para>Yet paraquat is labelled a potential groundwater contaminant by the California Department of Pesticide Regulation because it has the potential to move into groundwater, based on its water solubility, ability to bind to soils and long half-life.</para><para>It is not as though this is new information for us here in Australia. The parliament has been made aware of the extreme dangers of paraquat on numerous occasions in the past. For example, the chemical was used in Vietnam, and in 1982 questions were asked in this place regarding its effect on the health of Australian service personnel. I think it is appropriate that we make mention of this today, with the announcement regarding TPI payments. In the 1994 agricultural and veterinary chemicals bill debate, Senator Bell of Tasmania pointed out: </para><quote><para>We have a situation where voluntary helpers, assisting in projects conducted by Landcare and Greening Australia, are being given containers of such fearful chemicals as paraquat. Having given of their time voluntarily, they are coming home with severe nosebleeds occasioned by the notorious anticoagulant paraquat.</para></quote><para>Why then has there been the echoing silence within this place since 1994 on the dangers of paraquat dichloride? There is no doubt that paraquat dichloride is hazardous to human health and to the environment. But rather than banning it as it should do, this government is hell bent on making one form cheaper by abolishing the five per cent duty on the version of paraquat containing an emetic. This once again begs the question: why the delay in the first place? As I have already outlined, an emetic has been voluntarily added by the major manufacturer since the 1980s, and the FAO introduced a specification requiring an effective emetic in 1996. So why has it taken until 2004 to remove the five per cent impost?</para><para>I take no pleasure in saying this, but I think we have caught the government in bed with its chemical mates again, just like we did with the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Bill last year. Last year it was Chemical Trish; this year we have Chemical Phil. Why else would it take as long as 20 years, or eight at the minimum, to recognise the need for an emetic safety factor? Also, why the change in date of effect from 1 April 2003 to 24 March 2003? What happened in that week to make the government change its mind? Why has this bill been presented in such an off-hand and cavalier manner? At a time when there is increasing public concern about multiple chemical sensitivity, why isn't paraquat dichloride being banned altogether?</para><para>It is not as though there are not other effective weed management techniques that do not involve deliberately introducing toxic chemicals into the environment. Multiple chemical sensitivity is an increasing problem within our community, costing Australia millions of dollars each year in related medical and welfare expenses.</para><para>Just last month I attended the Illawarra chronic fatigue syndrome support group in my electorate of Cunningham and saw first hand the results of multiple chemical sensitivity—or `chemical AIDS' as it is called—of which CFS has been cited as perhaps one manifestation. When toxic chemicals attack the immune system, they can have a devastating effect. I heard one story of a young girl who has been bed ridden for seven years as a result of chronic fatigue syndrome which may or may not have been brought on by chemical poisoning. We just do not know what the effect is of some of the toxic chemicals we are introducing into the food chain and into the air we breathe.</para><para>When we are told of the many adverse effects of a chemical such as paraquat dichloride and we fail to take action to ban it, and instead continue to promote it and allow it to be used as a herbicide throughout the country, then this is nothing less than criminal. The worst of it is that the introduction of GM crops is reported as being likely to result in the increased use of these so-called old fashioned, more toxic herbicides such as paraquat.</para><para>This parliament cannot continue to bury its head in the sand over this issue; it is one which we must address. The South Australian task force on multiple chemical sensitivity is holding a public protest in Adelaide in a fortnight's time, on 17 March, calling for a national multiple chemical sensitivity prevention, treatment and disability access strategy. The task force believes that the failures of governments and chemical regulators to address the problem of chemical injury have led to large numbers of people with MCS and related illnesses. I am one of nine members of this House who have been emailed by task force convenor Peter Evans asking what action we are taking to address the problem of MCS at a national and international level. How do I refute his suggestion that we are: </para><quote><para>...deliberately maintaining a state of ignorance and denial that an extremely serious public health crisis even exists, with large numbers of people disabled from so-called `safe' chemical exposures.</para></quote><para>How indeed, when the government brings legislation like the Customs Tariff Amendment (Paraquat Dichloride) Bill before this House—a bill which is handing half a million dollars per annum back to the chemical companies; a bill which is making one of the world's most toxic chemicals cheaper; and a bill which is therefore likely to lead to the increasing use of paraquat in this country.</para><para>The government has once again missed the point. In the interest of all Australians I call on the Prime Minister to ban paraquat dichloride altogether. We should not forget the tragic death of a 54-year-old Maryborough man after exposure to paraquat in 2000 and the earlier death, in or around 1990, of a carpenter who ingested paraquat thinking that it was coca-cola. He died three days later of multiple organ failure, because there is no antidote to paraquat. We have had these tragedies in our country because of this chemical. As I have pointed out, there are alternatives. While I understand the government's desire to rectify an apparent tariff anomaly, I cannot in all conscience support a bill which perpetuates the use of a highly toxic chemical that has demonstrable adverse health and environmental impacts.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>25604</page.no><name role="metadata">Katter, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KATTER</name><name.id>HX4</name.id><electorate>Kennedy</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Unfortunately, and sadly, I have had a lot of experience with suicides, as probably most members of this House have. The young male suicide rate in Australia, if not the highest in the world, is amongst the highest and has been so for probably 10 or 15 years. There is something seriously wrong here.</para></talk.start><para>If you go to the library and ask for the reasons for suicide, they will probably give you a handout from the health department where they tracked deaths of 15- to 25-year-old males over a 30-year timeframe. If you placed the graph for the rise in suicides over the graph for the rise in unemployment, the lines were almost identical. We know the reason—it is because there is no hope out there; there is no work even though the government make it their duty to skite all the time. We are talking on the <inline ref="R1984">Customs Tariff Amendment (Paraquat Dichloride) Bill 2004</inline> and sadly paraquat is one of the favoured methods of suicide in north Queensland. Like strychnine, it is readily available and can be used for that purpose. We are very pleased to be looking at any moves that that will overcome this problem and I would have thought that there were other ways of attacking this problem, as my esteemed colleague from Wollongong was saying, than giving the companies a free kick. I am not complaining about that because a lot of farmers buy it, but if you think those savings are going to be passed onto the farmer you would believe that the abominable snowman lives in Bedourie. I doubt whether farmers are going to receive any benefits from it, but undoubtedly there is a benefit initially for the companies that produce this stuff.</para><para>Let me return to the problem that has precipitated this, which is basically the suicide problem. This very evening, before coming down to this chamber, I spent 2½ hours on the telephone speaking with somebody who felt that there may be the possibility of a suicide. So it is very real. I get letters probably once a month. I spoke to Alf Messina, a trader in rural products, and he told me that over a recent period of time there were three cases of people committing suicide by taking gramoxone. He said it is a very serious issue indeed in Far North Queensland. In one two-week period recently there were three suicides in the sugar industry.  </para><para>The sugar industry does not use gramoxone a lot these days because of the trash blanket approach to farming, where you do not have the necessity that we once had for weedicides. The trash blanket innovation, as you are well aware, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley—being very experienced and having many generations in the industry—and many other innovations that are of a superior standard than we have had before which have been introduced in the sugar industry have enabled us to avoid the use of weedicides to a very large degree. For those who are not familiar, the trash blanket is six, eight and, in some cases, 12 inches thick. Nothing can drive up through that huge trash blanket, except that very powerful—the most powerful of all plants—sugar plant. The sugar plant is able to come through but nothing else is. The trash blanket has very effectively replaced a lot of the weedicides that were once used in the industry.</para><para>The suicide issue is very personal to me. There were three young men who committed suicide in the town of Hughenden in the space of 18 months when I was a state member. I vividly recall three cases that took place. A cattleman who was going to shoot some calves in a drought situation—he had a meeting with the bank that week—turned the gun on himself instead of the calves. A few months later, the brother of a very close friend of mine—we played football together for many years—who also had problems with the bank took strychnine. That is a terrible way to die—as is taking gramoxone.</para><para>Gramoxone is irreversible, in the sense that, once you take it, you die a really terrible agonising death over three days. We had a case in Far North Queensland. I did not know the family but I knew their neighbours very well. The neighbour said it was a terrible way to die. The person was a young man with everything before him and he had three young children. He was in the sugar industry and he saw no hope—but of all the ways that one would choose to die!</para><para>The effect of gramoxone is irreversible, so the idea of putting an emetic in with it is an excellent thing to do. But, like my worthy colleague here from the Wollongong area, I would have thought that the way to attack this would be to ensure that there was no gramoxone available anywhere without the emetic in it. I do not know why we are so taken with this economic fundamentalism that we have to provide a carrot instead of what is a big stick—an emetic. People are dying. Why would you fool around with providing a very low-level incentive when in fact you could pass legislation and put in the emetic in the first place? It is quite extraordinary to me.</para><para>Third World countries throw this stuff around like confetti. There is no necessity, nor any pressure upon them, to do the right thing via a trash blanket because they have such super cheap labour in those countries and they do not really have to be internationally competitive. This government has to live with the eternal shame of allowing bananas into Australia. Those bananas are coming in from the Philippines, where paraquat is put on the ground like the rest of us put fertilizer on the ground or like we would put a lawnmower over the ground. And who is using it? Mr Dole, Mr Del Monte and Mr Chiquita—the United Fruit Packaging Company of America.</para><para>If the United Fruit Packaging Company does not sound like a Spanish name or Del Monte or Dole do not sound like Spanish names—or Philippine names—it is because they are all American companies. The companies that produce bananas are not Philippine companies; they are American companies. So the American companies will sprinkle this stuff like confetti at a wedding all over the ground, we will bring those bananas in, we will be told that none of those bananas will have paraquat on them, and some people will suffer as a result of that irresponsibility. </para><para>I am not here tonight to talk about the 23 diseases they have that we do not have which will be sold on the shelves of our supermarkets. We appreciate what Coles and Woolworths have done. They have acted in a far more responsible manner than the government has on this issue. They might also be conscious of the fact that their customers may not like bananas coming in from the Philippines with paraquat all over them. Maybe they have some respect for their customers. Not only will the bananas have paraquat on them, they will also have many diseases and many spores that we do not have in this country. Those banana peels will be thrown onto rubbish heaps and those spores, bacteria and diseases will proliferate in this country—a country which, at the present moment, has a clean green image. Obviously if you bring things into this country from countries that throw paraquat around like we sprinkle salt on our chips you are going to deal with people who are very irresponsible indeed.</para><para>We are treating a symptom here in a most peculiar manner. We are attempting to suppress the symptom, and we are doing it with a most peculiar free-market, fundamentalist approach by dangling some sort of a carrot because we are not game to actually tell a big chemical company what to do. We are not game to tell oil or chemical companies what to do. In fact, it is very hard to find any way in which this government—or, I might add, the previous government—has stood up at all to the big corporations on what they want. We believe what they tell us and we do what they tell us to do. We act in accordance with their wishes at all times. In the end, the effect is suicide.</para><para>In North Queensland, we have seen the previous government and the current government do untold damage to the prawn and fish farming industry; the grape industry; the peanut industry; the tobacco industry, which they have closed down completely; the timber industry, which they have almost closed down completely; the durian industry, which is in a very serious situation; the fishing industry, which they have almost closed down completely; and the rice industry. Now we have terminal inaction with the sugar industry being left out of the free trade agreement and the decision last week to allow bananas into this country, in spite of the government's own body rejecting it totally last year.</para><para>There are some 13 mainland Aboriginal communities in Queensland in which some 20,000 or 30,000 Australians live. In those areas they are not allowed to own land, to own businesses, to own cattle or to own anything. When the possibility of earning a living is taken away, people lose hope. When they have no hope, people—as they do on the American Indian reserves—simply drink themselves to death or destroy themselves in some other way. It is an ugly truth, but it needs to be told. A lot of suicides happen in those areas and those communities. When you take away a person's right to make a living—whether it is in the prawn, fish farming, grape, peanut, tobacco, timber, dairying, fishing, rice, durian, sugar, or banana industries—it is not surprising that they take gramoxone and kill themselves.</para><para>By suppressing the symptoms—as we are attempting to do here tonight—instead of attacking the causes, our conduct is reprehensible in the extreme and will be remembered in the history books as the years pass by. And so it should be remembered. If we unleashed all of those sentiments which were once abroad in this country and which are in our national anthem when we sing, `Golden soil and wealth for toil,' that would be a joke. Where is the golden soil and wealth for toil? It is a classic case of the very well-worn joke: child cruelty is giving your kids the farm. </para><para>Turning back the clock, in 1985 we expected to make $2,000 million from the prawn and fish farming industry. Many of our young people go to university and study marine science in the hope of having a job in this new and wonderful industry. Greenies—and I am not one, but my worthy colleague from Wollongong is—say that they do not like people trawling on the Great Barrier Reef or wherever. I acquiesce in that view, but the government has said, `All right, you can have prawn and fish farms.' When we started in 1985 we expected to catch up with Thailand and make $2,000 million a year in North Queensland by 2000. We have a longer and much more suitable coastline than Thailand. We did not get to $2,000 million, we did not get to $1,000 million and we did not get to $100 million; we only got to $55 million. Thailand was making $2,000 million way back in the year of Our Lord 1985.</para><para>We import into this country $233 million worth of prawn product every year. In Thailand, there is hope, excitement and very rapid economic growth. If you check up on where our growth is in the GDP area, you will see that it is in wholesaling, retailing, banking and financing. That is where the growth in GDP has occurred in this country. Going back to Thailand, it was making $2,000 million in the year of Our Lord 1985. It now makes over $8,000 million a year, and this country is still importing $233 million worth of prawns.</para><para>On many occasions in this place we have pleaded for the ethanol industry, which would return hope and growth to our sugar industry, clean up our environment, dramatically improve the health of people in the cities and give hope to our young people instead of the hopelessness that they confront now which makes them take this most deadly chemical. The young man in the electorate that I represent, to whom I referred earlier, had three young children and everything to look forward to. It took him, I think, three days to die a most terrible and painful death. Presumably he took that chemical knowing that its effect was irreversible. What sort of hopelessness and pain must these people be experiencing to cause them to take this step? There is a sort of free-market fundamentalist approach to this act. Are we going to dangle an economic carrot rather than quite rightly apply the stick to the chemical companies for not having put in the emetic in the first place?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>25607</page.no><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SLIPPER</name><name.id>0V5</name.id><electorate>Fisher</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Given the lateness of the hour I will be particularly brief in summing up the debate on the <inline ref="R1984">Customs Tariff Amendment (Paraquat Dichloride) Bill 2004</inline>. I have listened with great care to the comments made by my friend the member for Cunningham and the members for Kennedy and Kingston. The Customs Tariff Amendment (Paraquat Dichloride) Bill 2004 contains some very minimal amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995. The bill provides for the classification of the chemical paraquat dichloride with an emetic added for safety reasons in section 29 of the Customs Tariff Act.

It is a story about an area in the electorate of Shortland—a suburb called Windale, which in 1999 was identified as possibly the most disadvantaged area within the whole of Australia in a study that was conducted by Tony Vinson called `Unequal in life'. It looked at all the factors of social disadvantage—things such as long-term unemployment, low income, early school leaving, unskilled workers, low birth rates, child abuse, psychiatric hospital admissions, criminal convictions and so on. When those factors were weighed up Windale was found to be a very disadvantaged community.</para></talk.start><para>Four years ago the New South Wales government initiated a community renewal scheme in Windale. This scheme is now being managed by the Windale community. The management committee is responsible for supporting unemployed people, aged people, youth and sporting groups. Representatives from all these sectors of the community are involved in the management committee. They utilise the skills of members of the community and they are very much involved in mentoring and supporting each other through the community. The mentoring is conducted one-on-one, in groups or informally and is designed to meet the needs of the community.</para><para>I would like to pay particular attention to a program called Alcazar that is being run through the Windale Public School at the school community centre. This initiative involves a mentor program, which is an early intervention program for children who might experience challenges in kindergarten. The program began two years ago and is still running. The children in this program have had challenging behaviours where they may act out, including exhibiting violence, shyness and many other types of behaviour. The program trained people from the local community to mentor specific children and their families. The mentoring was initiated through a support playgroup and other activities.</para><para>In the first year, 10 children and their families anticipated. The children represented a variety of backgrounds and had a variety of challenging behaviours. Alcazar was able to initiate the program to build relationships with children and their families, and the outcomes were phenomenal. Of the 10 children that went to the preschool program, eight went into kindergarten and all but one were promoted to year 1. The one not promoted remained in kindergarten and successfully completed it last year. This program was implemented again in 2003 and it will be conducted again in the future. Another program that is being run through Alcazar is the home start program, which operates with local residents trained to mentor and support young parents and their families. There is another program called `engaging fathers'. This has had some amazing outcomes, where many fathers participating in programs at Alcazar are playing a very important part within the Windale school. They participate in the breakfast club and in various community groups and committees that operate within the school. </para><para>This shows how important it is to build the capacity of communities to give support to families in need. It also shows how important mentoring is and what an asset it is to the community. Without these mentoring projects there are a number of families within this area that would not have achieved the outcomes and would not have the hope for the future that they now have. This mentoring program has been phenomenal. The cooperation and the fine work of everyone involved with Alcazar should be recognised. I would particularly like to recognise the work of Wendy Lawrence, who is a very dedicated and committed worker at Alcazar and the driving force behind the success of the program. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Deakin Electorate: Environment</title><page.no>25609</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>25609</page.no><name role="metadata">Barresi, Phillip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BARRESI</name><name.id>ZJ6</name.id><electorate>Deakin</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This evening I rise to speak about a very important matter concerning residents in parts of Mitcham, Ringwood and Vermont North of my electorate. In the last couple of months it has come to my attention that there is a proposal for a waste transfer station to operate from a site on Heatherdale Road, Ringwood. The operators of the site, Eastern Recycling, have relocated their business from a nearby industrial estate. The new Heatherdale Road location is within an industrial estate; however, unlike the former location the new site is located, according to some sources, 300 metres from existing residential properties. As you can imagine, many of those residents have health fears, apart from concerns about the traffic congestion and noise that go with such a site.</para></talk.start><para>I would like to bring to the House's attention the contempt the state ALP members of parliament have shown the people of this area. In late 2003, the Victorian government made a $450,000 grant to Eastern Recycling for its proposed relocation. However, when faced with a backlash from concerned residents, the state ALP members for Bayswater and Silvan Province went to ground and quickly distanced themselves from the decision. The state member for Mitcham was asleep on the job and not even aware of the issue or the resulting backlash by residents until it was uncovered by my office through a public meeting.</para><para>Of great concern to the residents is how the operator of the facility was allowed to continue to function despite a rejection by the Maroondah City Council of a planning permit application. The operator claimed it was not required and proceeded to open the new facility. This dispute was listed for hearing before the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal and is still taking place. Strangely, the Victorian government's grant was forthcoming during local council objections and the VCAT deliberations.</para><para>I was first informed of this issue by the state manager of the neighbouring Wridgways removalists on Heatherdale Road. He had received little interest from local state Labor MPs when he had raised the issue. It was clear to me that a majority of residents had been kept in the dark by their representatives, including their local government, the Whitehorse City Council. In an attempt to facilitate an open discussion between all parties, I convened a public meeting on 22 January for residents and businesses within the immediate area. Although it was at the height of the Christmas holiday period, approximately 200 people overwhelmingly vented their frustration at the lack of information received on this issue. It caught everyone by surprise, not least of course the representatives in that area. All were appreciative of the meeting having been organised and of the attempt by my office to out the issue. </para><para>At the public meeting two resolutions were unanimously passed—first, that the public meeting endorse ward councillors, nominated residents' representatives and other concerned parties to seek a community deputation from the Victorian Minister for the Environment, the Hon. John Thwaites MP, and the Victorian Minister for Local Government, the Hon. Candy Broad MLC, as soon as practicable, and, second, that the meeting endorse the establishment of a residents action group. Whilst the action group has been established, the deputations are still being sought, and I trust that Minister Thwaites at least has the courtesy to meet the Heatherdale Road Residents Action Group.</para><para>I congratulate local residents Mr Gary Cooper and Mr Dennis Burley on marshalling the local residents into a vocal and concerned residents action group. The residents action group has been vigilant in documenting transgressions by the operator, including noise levels at one, two and three o'clock in the morning, the constant noise of waste bins and dumpmasters coming into the place and the dust and traffic congestion that go with them. The residents are of course concerned for health reasons, particularly about the acceptance by the operators, contrary to their claims, of `putrefaction' material—I think that is the word that is often used.</para><para>Emerging from this issue are the clouded requirements and statutory obligations of waste transfer operators. The design and location of the Eastern Recycling Heatherdale Road site is of concern, as evidently there is a lack of clear and binding planning legislation. Of particular concern is Victorian state government agency EcoRecycle Victoria's detailed <inline font-style="italic">Guide to Best Practice a</inline><inline font-style="italic">t Waste Transfer Stations</inline>. These loosely worded and non-statutory guidelines offer room for potential conflict, which was demonstrated at the Heatherdale Road site. EcoRecycle Victoria is not effectively powered to enforce its own guidelines; rather, it offers general advice and information. I recommend the establishment of a national set of clear and binding guidelines for the management of waste transfer facilities. It is certainly worth considering this issue at future COAG forums. Clearly, modern state-of-the-art waste transfer and recycling facilities are inherently positive for the community. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Howard Government: Performance</title><page.no>25610</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>25610</page.no><name role="metadata">Emerson, Craig, MP</name><name role="display">Dr EMERSON</name><name.id>83V</name.id><electorate>Rankin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On this the eighth anniversary of the election of the Howard government it is timely to assess the government's record on matters of truth. The verdict of any reasonable person is that the government is constitutionally incapable of telling the truth. All Australians recall the Prime Minister's pledge that he would never, ever introduce a GST and they know his famous pre-election distinction between core and non-core promises. Certainly they remember his claim of 9 October 2001, just before the last election, that asylum seekers threw their children overboard. But do they recall the Prime Minister's 14 October 1999 assurance: </para></talk.start><quote><para>There will be no $100,000 university fees under this government.</para></quote><para>Do they recall his false statement in parliament that he did not meet his friend Dick Honan to discuss ethanol? The litany of Liberal lies is seemingly endless. Challenging the Prime Minister for a record number of false statements is the Treasurer. In referring to the legislated tax cuts of the early 1990s the Treasurer told this parliament on no less than 13 occasions that the Keating government:</para><quote><para>... did not pay $1 to one person for one day.</para></quote><para>The Treasurer made this false claim in parliament on 14 May 2003, 11 May 2000, 6 March 2000, 8 December 1999, 13 May 1999, 23 March 1999, 15 February 1999, 9 February 1999, 8 December 1998, 30 November 1995, 28 November 1995, 23 October 1995 and 10 May 1995. The truth is that the first instalment of tax cuts was brought forward—paid early—at a full-year cost of $2.9 billion in 1994-95 dollars. In present day dollars that equates to more than $3.5 billion. Compare that $3.5 billion with the Treasurer's tax cuts announced in the last budget costing $2.4 billion. Not only did Labor pay tax cuts early but they were more than $1 billion greater than the Treasurer's tax cuts announced in last year's budget. But the Treasurer claims no tax cuts were ever paid by Labor. He told the National Press Club on 10 May 2000:</para><quote><para>... there is a very large proportion of the Australian public which has no experience of income tax cuts. If you've been in the workforce for 10 years, you've not known what an income tax cut is. ... And I was thinking back through my own experience of taxation policy, of my own experience and I can vouch for someone who has been in the workforce for about 20 years. Was that whenever we seemed to get to the barrier on income tax cuts, for some reason or another they were never paid.</para></quote><para>That is what the Treasurer claimed. Now for the truth. Labor cut personal income tax rates seven times: in November 1984, December 1986, July 1987, July 1989, January 1990, January 1991 and November 1993. In those seven tax cuts Labor gave back all of bracket creep and more, something this government has never come close to doing. The second instalment of those tax cuts was converted to superannuation co-contributions worth $4 billion which this government, after promising to keep, cancelled in its 1996 budget.</para><para>The Treasurer's incapacity to tell the truth extends to his claims about budget surpluses. He told parliament on 10 May 2000:</para><quote><para>First of all, we put the budget into surplus on a headline basis, which the Labor Party never did. Then we say, `We ought to put the budget into a surplus on an underlying basis', which the Labor Party never did.</para></quote><para>The truth is that Labor produced headline surpluses in 1987-88, 1988-89, 1989-90 and 1990-91. Labor produced underlying surpluses in 1972-73, 1973-74, 1974-75, 1987-88, 1988-89, 1989-90 and 1990-91. The fact is that this government is constitutionally incapable of telling the truth. In the time that I have there is no capacity to go through all of these statements by the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and other ministers.

Somerville is a town built around young families, people involved in trades and in their own businesses, people who commute to the city and people who work on the Mornington Peninsula. There were two overriding messages from the discussions I had with people in these small businesses. First, they had a deep concern about opportunities for youth and the problems of youth unemployment and youth activities within the town of Somerville and, second—this was a related issue—they had a real concern that the much promised Somerville Secondary College, for which so many people fought and for which I was proud to be one of the advocates, may not be delivered on time. The school was promised by the state government 18 months ago after a heavy campaign which involved overturning the education department's own figures once we had gathered together the figures, through the Parliamentary Library, for the town of Somerville. </para></talk.start><para>Since that time the ground has never been broken. Yet the pledge is that the Somerville Secondary College will open for business to take year 7 and 8 students from Somerville in 2005. We know that there are only a few short weeks before we lose the opportunity to allow students in at the beginning of next year. This has created a genuine and real uncertainty for parents within Somerville, Baxter, Pearcedale, Tyabb and the surrounding area who have enrolled their children and who are relying on the availability of the college. </para><para>The college will serve two purposes. Firstly, it will serve as an educational centre for children and youths throughout Somerville and, secondly, it will play a key role in providing a community resource—a community centre—to deal with some of those after-hours questions of youth aimlessness. It will provide social outlets and opportunities for drama, sports and communal activities.</para><para>Against that background, what concerns all of the people who I spoke to is that the school which was promised may not be delivered on time. If that is the case, there will be two consequences: it will be a blow to not only the parents and the students but also the community. The community fought hard for this school, fought hard to preserve the land and then fought hard to win the commitment that this school would be brought into being.</para><para>On behalf of the community, I make this request of and this statement to the state government of Victoria: please start construction of the Somerville Secondary College now. We have only a matter of weeks for this school to begin if it is going to be open in time for students in February 2005. It is a critical window of opportunity. After 18 months, there are all sorts of excuses. But fortunately, and as a surprise, the state government has not been able to blame the federal government because funding has been provided—$1.8 million of federal funding has been pledged to that school. Only this week we received a pledge from the federal education minister, Dr Brendan Nelson, for an additional $1.2 million, taking the total federal pledge to $1.8 million.</para><para>The state has said that it will put in $5 million. Yet when the federal government provided this $1.8 million it decreased its own amount to $3.2 million. So the students can get as much federal money as they want but the town will not be any better off because for every dollar that the Commonwealth puts in the state reduces its own amount by that amount. So we have fought and achieved a commitment of $1.8 million only to see that very amount deducted from the state's pledged contribution of $5 million.</para><para>Two key things have to happen. Firstly, the state must commence construction immediately. No matter what excuse they raise, they have had 18 months to reach the point of constructing a school for the students, the community and the parents of Somerville, Baxter and Tyabb. Secondly, they should provide the full $5 million which they pledged, in addition to the $1.8 million from the Commonwealth. The $1.8 million which they have deducted is the difference between the school having an arts centre, an oval and full facilities and not having them.

In my own community of Wentworth, the percentage of older people is one of the highest in the country. Tonight I will talk about increasing tax benefits for older Australians, particularly those of pensionable age and above. In light of the demographic changes that have occurred in Australia, to which the Treasurer has drawn attention in recent times, the proportion of the population aged 65 and over has increased relatively slowly over the last 40 years. But we are projecting that over the next 40 years this will nearly double, and in 2042 almost one in every four Australians will be aged 65 or over.</para></talk.start><para>I want to propose a measure to the House tonight, and I would encourage those who are looking at budgetary outcomes in the forthcoming round of discussions to consider it. In short, I want to propose that the tax threshold for people of pensionable age and over be doubled and that those benefits accrue as part of the tax cuts which I hope will be introduced at the next budget for all Australians. Of course, a tax cut for all Australians as the dividend of efficient government is, of itself, a priority that all Liberals would agree with, but I would like to see those tax cuts for older Australians given particular priority in the manner that I have mentioned.  </para><para>It has been suggested that there are already provisions in the fiscal arrangements of this country which benefit older Australians in a way that does not assist others. It is true that the SATO scheme—the Senior Australians tax offset—permits an offset of tax liability up to $20,500 for a full dispensation and, thereafter, a sliding scale up to $38,340 for singles and $29,622 for each member of a couple. Those are valuable benefits for older Australians, but the measure that I am proposing is a supplement to that particular measure. What the Treasurer has recently sought to do—and I highly commend what he has done and his recent announcements about these matters—is to encourage older Australians to stay in work and allow them the choice to make a decision for themselves, in their own best interests, to make their lifestyles in their older age more comfortable and more desirable.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER, The</name><name role="display">The SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—It is 9.30 p.m., but I will allow the member for Wentworth to make some concluding remarks.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AMQ</name.id><name role="metadata">King, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KING</name></talker><para>—Thank you, Mr Speaker.

On Tuesday, 20 January the Prime Minister carried out a diversionary tactic, not surprisingly, which became not just a diversionary tactic but a divisive tactic by attacking public schools, teachers in those schools and, by implication, students and their families in those schools with his disgraceful attack on the so-called valueless systems in our state schools and the provision of antiseptic values. He charged that our schools are filled with politically correct teachers and that our curriculum is charged with political correctness. On 26 January on a <inline font-style="italic">Current Affair</inline>, Ray Martin asked the Prime Minister:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Why did you begin this year with such divisive comments about public education?</para></quote><para>John Howard replied:</para><quote><para>Nothing divisive. I was just asked a question as to why I thought an increasing number of people were wanting to send their children to independent schools and I gave some of the reasons. I didn't make a generalised attack on government schools.</para></quote><para>Ray Martin went on:</para><quote><para>What did you mean though ... in terms of `antiseptic' and what are the values missing from government schools?</para></quote><para>The Prime Minister said:</para><quote><para>Well, you know, people come to me and say all sorts of things. And I mentioned some of them. I don't have time on this programme to go through all of them and I'll develop some of the things during the week. </para></quote><para>Ray Martin asked:</para><quote><para>It looks like you've thrown a bit of a cracker and then stepped away.</para></quote><para>The Prime Minister replied:</para><quote><para>No, no. I never throw crackers and step away. I mean ... what I said I meant. Don't think for a minute that I'm stepping away from what I said.</para></quote><para>Ray Martin then asked:</para><quote><para>What's antiseptic mean?</para></quote><para>The Prime Minister said, `Well, you know' and on it went. Ray Martin finally said:</para><quote><para>But don't you seriously think that government schools don't have values?</para></quote><para>The Prime Minister replied that he did not have time to go through it. So I spent some of my own time to find out what the Prime Minister meant by valueless schools, by political correctness in the curriculum and by the provision of an antiseptic atmosphere in our schools. I looked for proof. One of the values that I think is very important is that you provide evidence in a reasoned debate for your argument. Has the Prime Minister said anything since? Not a single word. There has not been a single word to substantiate the disgraceful charges that he levels: `Some people talk to me and I have to report what they say.' We can all bet what happened. He called the reporters in and said, `Listen, cop this. It might divert attention away from the fact university places are not available to students.' So it is about diverting attention, making education divisive and using it as a diversionary tactic from the higher education agenda.</para><para>Of course, on cue, came the Prime Minister's willing acolytes, who are on the Right on anything dealing with so-called values in public education. Of course, the member for Gippsland popped in with some really edifying comments that education in public schools is value-free, hostile or, at best, apathetic to Australian heritage and values—whatever that meant. At this stage, the member for Gippsland was the acting federal education minister. Then there was the member for Warringah—the boxing monk—but you would expect that. I am sad to say that the member for Herbert rushed in with his unsubstantiated comments and Senator Lightfoot rushed in, as he does, to protect the Prime Minister from anyone who might possibly be harassing his presence or his views.</para><para>But it did cause division, not just in the community but also in his own party. That is not something the Prime Minister is used to, but we have seen examples of it more recently. It caused division because enlightened persons such as the members for Adelaide, Hindmarsh, Pearce and Macquarie came out and basically said, `This is arrant nonsense.' To claim that public schools are valueless is the same as saying that private schools are valueless—arrant nonsense. They at least were prepared to stand up publicly and say so.</para><para>So it was not just the superannuation meeting or the Clarke report on veteran entitlements that saw divisions in the Liberal Party caucus room coming to the fore; the same applied to this comment on public education by the Prime Minister. I acknowledge the comments by those members of the coalition who were prepared to stand up to the statements of arrant nonsense by the Prime Minister and those other members I mentioned.</para><para>I thought it was best reflected by the cartoonists—as is their wont. In the <inline font-style="italic">Australian </inline>on 20 January 2004 there was a cartoon which I know I cannot show at the moment but I will try to describe it. It showed our Prime Minister with a sign behind him saying, `Howard's way—a federal government nation-building project.' In front of him is an earthquake fault line, and there is a little sign on the other side of the highway heading off in the distance saying, `Divided country'. That is exactly what those comments did. They were needlessly hurtful, silly comments not substantiated by evidence. </para><para>It was not just me who was disgusted by those comments. Many people throughout Australia—even principals of private schools—thought what a worthless debate the Prime Minister had brought about. I attended a number of school excellence ceremonies and of course the Prime Minister's comments featured at those ceremonies. People were disgusted and hurt by the comments. I would like to quote from an address at an evening of excellence at one of the schools in my electorate of Braddon—and a very good school at that. The principal said:</para><quote><para>I felt that tonight, of all nights, I couldn't let their comments go unanswered or our students and parents think that the schools that have produced the wonderful young people we will see tonight are in any way sub-standard or without values.</para></quote><para>Fancy having to have this discussion in the first place. The principal went on to analyse why they believed the Prime Minister made those comments and said:</para><quote><para>If that is the case—</para></quote><para>that is, to bring about division and diversion—</para><quote><para>I thought I would take the time tonight to explain the values that I think underlie the academic and personal relationships we have at (our school) and ask the question `if not these values, then which?'</para></quote><para>The Prime Minister was asked several times: `What values are you talking about? What values don't exist in our public schools that you believe should exist?' Of course he did not answer. The principal went on:</para><quote><para>Our primary concerns ... are, I think, fivefold and they relate closely to Howard Gardner's view of schools. We are concerned with the truth. Not the truth that gave us `children overboard', `weapons of mass destruction' and now `valueless schools'—but how we determine what is false or misleading and, importantly, what we do with that knowledge. Secondly, we are concerned with beauty and it is from this concern we model not just our arts curriculum but our deep concern and empathy for the environment and the planet, surely the most beautiful and fragile of things that we have in our care. Thirdly, we are concerned with morality—what is good and what is right. This is not the morality of politics but the morality of how people should be treated and treat others.</para></quote><para>He goes on to say, fourthly:</para><quote><para>We are concerned with educational excellence, not only of the academic elite but of all students. This comes from our deeply held views that teachers make a difference and all students can learn. Finally, we are concerned, in State schools with equality. We take everyone into our state school system.</para></quote><para>He says that at their school:</para><quote><para>... alongside the students you will meet tonight—</para></quote><para>and it was a night of excellence, I would remind you—</para><quote><para>with TE scores as good as any in the country, you will find blind students, Downs Syndrome students, homeless students, students with mental illness and physical impairment. You will find students who are poor, students who are rich, students who are black and students who are white. In this melting pot, whose cultural values are the ones we must follow and explore and support? You and I know that we cannot favour one set of cultural values over another but what we can do is support the universal values that make up a decent, just and humane society. We will not play the politicians values game where we somehow favour a set of values held by a small political sub-set. We are concerned with weightier things ... with truth, beauty, morality, excellence and equality, and these threads have run through the education that every student here tonight has received. They own these values because they are also the values of their parents, their relatives, their churches, their friends and their employers. They are also the values of each and every one of their teachers. </para></quote><para>That was in part the address that was given that night in response to the Prime Minister's arrant nonsense on 20 January 2004. But, when I think about the charge levelled by the Prime Minister and then by the member for Gippsland and his minions, I say to myself, `I have had the privilege of being involved in public education for 25 years of my working life.' Were the institutions that I was involved in, the students, the curriculum and my colleagues valueless? Were we politically correct? Did we not teach what we believed was right and wrong and at least teach people to make their own decisions about what was right and wrong? Were we apathetic to the Australian heritage and values? The answer is no, definitely not.</para><para>I did a bit of research, as you do on these matters, particularly when you are made anxious by them. Where better to go than to the government, because it preaches values and principles and traditions—on and on? Of course, our current education minister is very good at that. He just parted with $300,000-odd for values and principles and civics in education—good; so be it. There was a values education study published in November 2003. It had a top 10 hit parade of values. Tolerance and understanding, respect, responsibility, social justice, excellence, care, inclusion and trust, honesty, freedom and being ethical were the top 10 values. The night of excellence report by the principal of my local school, it was replete with that. In that school they do not need to read the values education study of November 2003 to find out what these values might be.</para><para>I looked at the education website in my own state. I said to myself: `I have been out of the system for a while. What exactly is underpinning the curriculum? What is underpinning the important social values in our schools today? What does it mean to be publicly educated in Tasmania today?' What I found on their web site is a really interesting program called Essential Learnings which was kicked off in December 2000—not November 2003 but December 2000—by our then state education minister, the Hon. Paula Wriedt. I looked to that to see what the purposes of the essential learnings were and what the values were that underpinned these essential learnings. And I said to myself, `Will I find values there? Will I find principles that I can subscribe to and that I believe reflect the so-called Australian tradition and values?' So what did I find? It says:</para><quote><para>We are guided by this core set of values.</para></quote><para>This core set of values that underline our essential learnings includes:</para><quote><para>Connectedness, which includes developing a sense of community through friendship, care, compassion, cooperation, acceptance, belonging and sharing.</para></quote><para>I have ticked it for pretty good values—Aussie values too. Another core value is:</para><quote><para>Resilience, which includes recognising strengths and maximising potential; developing self-management, self-confidence and self-respect; and nurturing optimism, perseverance and wellbeing.</para></quote><para>Tick! Another is:</para><quote><para>Achievement, which includes attaining personal success in a range of human endeavours, pursuing individual excellence and displaying pride and satisfaction in personal achievement. </para></quote><para>Tick! Another is:</para><quote><para>Creativity, which includes valuing original ideas, demonstrating enterprise and innovation, and engaging with and responding to the aesthetic qualities of the natural and constructed world.</para></quote><para>There is no economic bottom line there, but aesthetic values—tick! Another is integrity. Now, what does this mean? </para><quote><para>... which includes acting honestly, ethically, and consistently.</para></quote><para>Tick! Another is:</para><quote><para>Responsibility, which includes accepting both individual and collective responsibility and contributing to sustainable community development.</para></quote><para>So values regarding others as well as values regarding the self. And the final value is:</para><quote><para>Equity, which includes developing tolerance and a commitment to social justice—</para></quote><para>Is this the problem area?—</para><quote><para>acknowledging diversity, respecting difference and encouraging distinctiveness.</para></quote><para>Now, that is under threat. It is almost politically correct now not to be tolerant of others. But I gave that a tick, because I think equity is pretty fundamental in our character. So what were the purposes of all these essential learnings? I thought I found some values there, long before the values education study of November 2003. The purposes behind the essential learnings are:</para><quote><para>Learning to relate, participate and care ...</para></quote><para>...	...	...</para><quote><para>Learning to live full, healthy lives—</para></quote><para>in every sense of the word. They continue:</para><quote><para>Learning to create purposeful futures—</para></quote><para>being part of the future, not just for yourself but with others and for others. They continue:</para><quote><para>Learning to act ethically—</para></quote><para>not simply knowing what is right and wrong, but being able to justify it and able to justify moral practices. That is a skill. They continue:</para><quote><para>Learning to learn.</para></quote><para>That is absolutely essential to being a participating citizen. The final purpose is:</para><quote><para>Learning to think, know and understand.</para></quote><para>These are the purposes underpinning the curriculum of essential learnings in Tasmania, based on the values of connectedness, resilience, achievement, creativity, integrity, responsibility and equity. Is this the valueless, politically correct world in public education that the Prime Minister spoke of? Well, if this is valueless, then I am proud to be part of it, and I am proud for both of my sons to have gone through this system of public education. The arrant nonsense that was peddled by the Prime Minister is a disgrace and an embarrassment as is that of all those minions that joined him.</para><para>We had in the House yesterday from the member for Sturt the feigned indignation which the government are renowned for—the wringing of hands and beating of breasts on anything that is pursued by this side. And at this stage, the member for Sturt was attacking the member for Jagajaga. Listen to this hypocrisy! The member for Sturt said: </para><quote><para>The member for Jagajaga should come into this House and apologise for the fear campaign that she, hand in hand with the AEU, has waged, a campaign that has upset parents and children and created division in the community—and all for what? Grubby short-term political gain.</para></quote><para>And on it went. Fancy, they:</para><quote><para>... upset parents and children and created division in the community—and all for what? Grubby short-term political gain.</para></quote><para>The Prime Minister should come into the House and apologise to the people of Australia—to the students, parents, teachers and educators involved in public education and, indeed, in private education—because the implication was that private schools are value-full and public schools are not. He is a disgrace and he should apologise to the people of Australia.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>25622</page.no><name role="metadata">McLeay, Leo, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LEO McLEAY</name><name.id>4I4</name.id><electorate>Watson</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Here we are again, with more appropriation bills. But <inline ref="R1975">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2003-2004</inline> and <inline ref="R1976">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2003-2004 </inline>are, I think, the last will and testament of the Howard government. What a dreary little set of documents they are! As I have observed previously while speaking about appropriation legislation, this government takes the prize for the dullest legislation program I think I have ever experienced in my time in this House. Since the government was re-elected in 2001, we have seen a combination of re-runs of legislation that various ministers failed to have passed in previous parliaments and some lacklustre minor legislation that really does not serve to achieve very much. If ever Australia needed a change of government and an injection of vitality and enthusiasm, it is certainly now.</para></talk.start><para>I have looked at what has been proposed in these bills to see if there was anything to grab the imagination—anything that would be worth debating and that was not just pandering to the dreariness of the government. Amazingly, I found an issue which did strike a chord with me. It is to do with the Australian Federal Police. The Australian Federal Police, as I am sure most of us are aware, comes under the Attorney-General's portfolio. It has an important international role. While the $47 million equity projection proposed in <inline ref="">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2003-2004</inline> is in relation to the deployment of the AFP in Papua New Guinea and operations in the Solomon Islands and people-trafficking issues, there is another role that the AFP is currently performing, and that is on the island of Cyprus.</para><para>Since 1964 Australia has deployed police to Cyprus as part of a United Nations peacekeeping mission. Originally, it was a joint Commonwealth-state arrangement, but now it is just the AFP. Fifteen AFP personnel are currently in Cyprus contributing to the maintenance of law and order in the buffer zone between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities. To give a bit more background: UNFICYP was established in March 1964 to prevent communal violence between the Greek and Turkish Cypriots after there had been a breakdown of law on the island resulting from an attempted coup by members of the national guard and a lot of fighting between the Turkish and Greek communities.</para><para>The role of the organisation was later expanded to include supervision of a ceasefire between the Turkish army and the Greek Cypriot national guard. UNFICYP also includes a civil police component which is called UNCIVPOL. Australia's commitment began in 1964 with 40 policemen of the Commonwealth Police. Police from all states were seconded to the Commonwealth Police, which became the Australian Federal Police in 1979 and had its own personnel. The number of Australian police serving in Cyprus increased to 50 in 1967 before decreasing to 16 in 1975. In May 1988 the first policewoman began service in Cyprus, with many policewomen serving since then. </para><para>As I mentioned earlier, Australia's commitment is currently 15 AFP officers serving for a period of six months. Three Australians—Sergeant Ian Donald Ward, Sergeant Lew Thomas and Inspector Paul Hackett—have died on duty with the Australian Federal Police in Cyprus. I am sure that all members will join with me in paying tribute to these officers. There are always risks involved with this type of mission. I believe that Australia's reputation as a peacekeeper is generally good. While three losses are three too many, I firmly believe that one could realistically have expected there to be a lot more loss of life over the almost 40 years that there has been an Australian police presence on the green line in Cyprus. That it has been contained to three is remarkable in the circumstances. These are dangerous jobs that are fulfilled by our police officers. They are not just overseas jaunts. I have had first-hand knowledge of their work, as I have visited the AFP contingent on the green line in Cyprus up at the airport and along the green line itself on three separate occasions. As I said earlier, their job is not an easy one.</para><para>There have been persistent rumours in recent times that the government is considering withdrawing Australia's AFP contingent from the United Nations peacekeeping force in Cyprus. So strong were these rumours last year that the Cypriot community in Sydney, many of whom live in my electorate of Watson, asked me to try and discover if there was any truth behind the rumours. I wrote to the Minister for Justice and Customs in October last year seeking his advice. I pointed out how much our presence in Cyprus since 1964 has been appreciated by the people of Cyprus on both sides of the green line—which it certainly has been. I also pointed out that the overall cost to the Australian economy has been well worth it in terms of the goodwill created and the excellent reputation earned by our national peacekeepers in Cyprus. Furthermore, I told the minister that I share the concern of the Cypriot community about the future of the Australian Federal Police contingent in Cyprus and I sought his advice about the government's intentions in that regard.</para><para>For some time in the 1990s I was a member of an IPU committee looking at the Cyprus issue. As indicated earlier in my speech, I visited there a number of times, the two most recent occasions being in September 1996 as a member of a parliamentary delegation with my colleagues the member for Grayndler and the member for Adelaide and also in July 2001. While I was there then, I met the Chief of Mission of United Nations operations in Cyprus, the acting special representative of the Secretary-General, Kofi Annan. So for many years I have taken an active interest in Cyprus and in its future. Thus I was more than happy to take up the concerns of my constituents with the minister last year. The reply that I received from the minister in November 2003 confirmed the view that a review would be taking place but gave no indication of a likely time. However, the minister did say that the review would be of all options concerning the Australian contribution to UNIFCYP as well as East Timor, the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea.</para><para>I do not want to read too much into the fact that additional funding is now being sought in these appropriation bills currently before us for the AFP deployment in Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, but obviously a decision has been taken to commit additional AFP resources in those two areas. I hope this does not mean a diminution of our commitment in Cyprus, particularly at the moment when for the first time after many years it seems there will soon be a resolution of the unsatisfactory situation of the divided island. A breakthrough in the United Nations in New York was reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> on 17 February this year. The article said that this breakthrough has: </para><quote><para>... created a real chance of reuniting the island before it joins the European Union on May 1. </para><para>For the first time, the two sides in Cyprus, divided since 1974, have agreed to a procedure that cannot collapse or grind to a halt.</para></quote><para>The article continued:</para><quote><para>Decisive negotiations begin this week in the capital, Nicosia, on a UN blueprint that would reunite the island in a loose federation of two largely autonomous areas with a central government. A deal would involve territory handovers and large population shifts. </para></quote><para>As members would be aware, when the island was divided in 1974 the Cypriot community of Greek descent moved to the south of the island and the people of Turkish descent moved to the north of the island into the Turkish zone that was invaded by the Turkish army. The article continued:</para><quote><para>The breakthrough came when the Greek Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos and his Turkish Cypriot counterpart, Rauf Denktash, agreed that UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan can rule on any disputes they cannot settle before a final deal goes to separate referendums in April. </para><para>Mr Annan said that there was now a real chance that before the first of May Cyprus will be reunited. US mediator Thomas Weston was even more emphatic: “It is almost certain now that there will be a settlement on the island of Cyprus.”</para></quote><para>I could not be more delighted at this news, and I certainly hope that the reports in the newspapers were not overly optimistic. There has been a long history of disputes on the island. There has been a long history of hopeful breakthroughs that do not result in anything. So I hope that now people of goodwill on both sides—the Greek and the Turkish Cypriots—will show an equal generosity of spirit in having the matter settled, because the real hope of any solution lies with the people who live there. The ordinary people in Cyprus want a solution. The Turkish government have to come to the party and insist that they want a solution this time.</para><para>If the Turkish community in the north have their way, they will reunite with their brothers and sisters in the south. We have seen very significant demonstrations in the Turkish ruled zone of Cyprus where Turkish Cypriots have said that they want to reunite the island. We have also seen a lot of Turkish Cypriots voting with their feet by leaving the island. That is not a good thing, and we need a solution. There will be a lot to forgive and a lot to try and forget, but there does need to be reconciliation. While the details might take some time to sort out, it now seems that 30 years after Turkey invaded the northern part of Cyprus there may be a resolution to the situation. It would be a tragedy for Cyprus if, on 1 May when Cyprus becomes part of the EU, only the southern part of the island, which is administered by the government of Cyprus at present, entered the union. The EU have made it quite clear that only the sovereign part of the island, governed by the Cypriot government, will become part of the EU.</para><para>The people in the north of the island deserve the economic benefits that European Union membership will bring them. They have a lower standard of living than people in the southern part of the island and they have a greater need for the economic benefits which will come from Cyprus being part of the EU. The Greek Cypriot part of Cyprus—the southern part of the island—has very few natural resources. Its only major natural resource is its people and their industry and they have shown that, even with the island divided, they have been able to develop a very strong economy in the south built on tourism, banking and services. They are able to hold their heads high, go into the EU and provide the economic stability and advancement that the north of the island requires. </para><para>It will need a lot of pressure by the Turkish government to get the old Turkish Cypriot regime in northern Cyprus to agree to the amalgamation, but if the people who run the Turkish Cypriot regime in the north of Cyprus genuinely have the ideals and the best interests of the Cypriot people at heart, particularly the Turkish Cypriot people, they will ensure that we achieve a solution to this problem now. It would be absolutely stupid if the Australian government chose this time to withdraw Australia's AFP contingent or even think of diminishing it. As previous experience has shown in other difficult international situations, once a solution has been found there is still a lot of work to be done to bed down the new arrangements. A harmonious and successful reunification will take time, patience and goodwill on both sides. The Australian AFP, with its well-earned reputation in Cyprus with both sides of the island over the years, will be in an excellent position to assist for however long it takes to bring peace and harmony to the island.</para><para>While I am pleased to see that AFP personnel are continuing to be deployed overseas and that the government recognises our international responsibility to help preserve stability and security among our near neighbours, I hope that it is not at the expense of our longstanding commitment in Cyprus. When the beginnings of a resolution to the problem in Cyprus seem to be so close—the closest it has been in memory—it would be premature of the Australian government to withdraw our police at this sensitive time. As I have said before, it would certainly not be a popular move from the Cypriot community's point of view, and I know from personal experience that the people of Cyprus appreciate the presence of the AFP.</para><para>We should hope that the minister will see sense, that the government will ensure that the AFP stay in Cyprus and that the AFP can celebrate the reunification of the island in a way which the Cypriot community here in Australia will be proud of and which the Cyprus government will be appreciative of. The people of Cyprus, who have come to know the Australian police there over that long period, would want them to be there to celebrate the reunification of the island. I hope that the minister will continue to maintain Australia's presence in Cyprus.</para><para>In the rest of this appropriation bill, as I said at the beginning, there is very little that the government is proposing that it has not proposed before. There is a lot of dross and very little gold. I was going to speak about some of the decisions that the aviation portfolio have taken, particularly in moving the terminal control units that control along the east cost of Australia to Melbourne, but if I got on to the airport issue I would probably need an extension of time, so I might—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83E</name.id><name role="metadata">Ripoll, Bernie, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Ripoll</name></talker><para>—I'll move it for you!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4I4</name.id><name role="metadata">McLeay, Leo, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LEO McLEAY</name></talker><para>—My colleague here has heard my airport speeches before, and he loves and enjoys them.

More specifically I want to outline a number of failures by the Howard government to address these real issues affecting real Australians. I remind people to cast their minds back to 1996 when that famous phrase `the Howard battlers' was coined. Sadly, they have been forgotten by this government. I believe the Howard government has failed to provide adequate assistance for many Australians and their families, and I know that a Latham Labor government would redress these failings as a matter of urgency. Labor has a proven track record, particularly on the issues of health, education and housing, whereas the government has an ever-growing track record of being strong on the weak, weak on the strong, loose with the truth and—their greatest record of all—the highest taxing government in Australian history. </para></talk.start><para>In general terms, the Howard government is not committed to delivering real assistance for Australian families. Instead, the government's approach is to avoid its mutual responsibilities—and we often hear that terminology used in this place by the government. It is a term that in fact does not belong to this government. It should be a term of respect—mutual responsibility is about what we can all do for each other for the betterment of this place. But the term has been hijacked by the government, and I am offended by that because it is a term that Labor has used, but used in a responsible manner. That is what mutual responsibility should be about. But the government has taken that and put it in the too-hard basket. It is no more evident than in what has been revealed recently by a leaked 130-page cabinet document which was presented to the federal government nearly 14 months ago. This document, which the government has sat on for far too long, presented a range of work and family policy options open to the government to redress some of its own failings. What did the government do with this document? It shelved it—it put it to one side and into the too-hard basket.</para><para>When I asked in question time recently why no action was taken when the government was presented with these policy options, in his response the Prime Minister said that there were more pressing issues to deal with than an options paper about families. I cannot think of any more pressing issue or any issue that should be more prioritised than the wellbeing of families in this country. At the end of the day, no matter what we do as a parliament and no matter what any party does in government, we should first and foremost look after families. If you look after families, you look after all Australians. But the government failed in this area and put it into the too-hard basket. </para><para>I also want to briefly outline a few key issues that presently face all Australians, particularly families. Many families struggle to balance the pressures of work and family life. There is no question about that—that is a known fact. Life has become more complicated and much more of a struggle. Families today are finding it increasingly difficult to obtain child-care places. With the requirement for people to go out to work for that double income to match the lifestyles that families are seeking and the expectations that families have, there is a need for more child-care places. Many of them particularly struggle to find after-school care places. Young families need assistance when it comes to that new addition to their family. We should be encouraging new families and more children, and we should be doing that through policy. Parental leave is an important issue, particularly for people re-entering the work force. I also want to take note of the structurally flawed family tax benefits scheme. All of these issues are interlinked—you cannot separate them. You cannot have a government that decides it is going to deal with one of these issues but not all of them. At the end of the day these issues affect everybody—not only the people in my electorate of Oxley, in Ipswich and western Brisbane, but also the millions of families right across Australia. </para><para>What the government should be doing is presenting the policies by which they seek to address many of these issues and providing real assistance and real solutions. Government do have the power to make a difference—they can effect change. Where there is a will, there is a way. Where there is another incentive and when it is about saving their political hides, the government find no will to take care of family issues and family matters, but they certainly find the will in other areas—and I will come to that in a moment.</para><para>So the Prime Minister was right about these issues—about how families balance the pressures of work and family life—when he said, some 19 months ago, that they were very important, but unfortunately he has just done nothing about them. In fact, the Prime Minister has called these things `barbecue stoppers'. He is right—they are barbecue stoppers, because they are very important issues. We have heard all the talk but we have seen no action. We have had all sizzle but no sausage; we have had all ham but no burger. Interestingly, when it comes to these very important issues about the government saving its own political hide it will sit on a report for a long time, but when it comes to other matters that affect the Prime Minister's election hopes then we find a different Prime Minister. The Prime Minister and the government can fix the political problem of parliamentary superannuation—they can fix that in 48 hours—but when it comes to helping Australian families then 14 months go by and nothing happens. How does the government justify that? How does the government go out into the community and explain that? I am going to be asking that question in the lead-up to the election on every opportunity.</para><para>For 30 years, throughout his career, the Prime Minister has come into this place and defended the parliamentary superannuation scheme, but he backflips on that in 48 hours when he knows that his political hide is on the line. That is the type of person I am talking about. People will and do ask questions about that. But when it comes to helping families and there is a report sitting in the party room, it takes 14 months. And if the report is not leaked and not discovered, nothing happens. This is the tragedy; this is the explanation; this is the definition of this government. This is what this government represents, and that makes me sick. It makes me sick to the bone knowing what this government is truly about. It is not about helping people and families; it is about saving its own political hide.</para><para>I also want to speak about some specifics and highlight just how the government is failing Australian families. I mentioned before half-a-dozen or more of the issues that are prominent in the lives of many Australians. There are some figures and facts that I think are really important to this debate, particularly in relation to the government's failed family tax benefit scheme. There have been 2.9 million incorrect payments—56 per cent of all payments, worth $2½ billion—made in error to families. The percentage of family payment debts remains extremely high. It is unacceptable. Families have an average debt of around $900. I find this unacceptable. It is totally unacceptable that the government does not act to fix up this problem. It will find ways to fix up its own problems but not the problems of the families that it should be helping.</para><para>It has underpaid families an average of $32.50 a fortnight. It underpays them and then thinks it is okay to say, `At the end of the year we'll give you a top-up.' Meanwhile families are suffering. That is why we have those large personal debts and credit card debts—because this government forces people into that position by not dealing with their family tax benefits in a proper way. It is a flawed system that this government should address as a matter of urgency but finds not important enough. It can find the time within 48 hours to do the greatest backflip of all time when it comes to superannuation entitlements for parliamentarians—when it affects them personally—but when it comes to families it cannot find the time. I find this very offensive. </para><para>In relation to the debts it actually gets worse. The total number of family tax benefit overpayments from July 2000 to September 2003—a relatively short period of time—was 1,639,378. That is right—over 1.6 million mistakes. The dollar value of these overpayments in that period was over $1.4 billion. A growing number of families are being underpaid, and I find that totally unacceptable. The total number of family tax benefit underpayments in that same period of time was nearly 1.3 million, with a total value of over $1 billion. And you ask why families are suffering! Why are families hurting? They are hurting because the government is not dealing with their family tax benefits in the proper way. It is a flawed system. It is a system that hurts ordinary families.</para><para>Some government members might giggle a bit and think that this may only affect a small percentage of unfortunate people who might not have a job. That is not the case. We are talking about ordinary middle-class Australian families in which one parent or both parents work. They are finding the system so complex, so difficult, that they come to my office to seek assistance not with the actual benefits but in comprehending the forms. These are people who are in middle management or management jobs and are very literate. I have looked at the forms and I find them very confusing. I do not know how ordinary people can fill out those forms. We see the result of that complication and bureaucracy in the millions of underpayments. We see the result in the hundreds of thousands of families that miss out on an entitlement—miss out on something they are due. It is not fair and it should be corrected.</para><para>But, again, the government cannot find the time. It is not on their list of priorities. On their list of priorities are their political hides. That is the one and only issue on their list of priorities. We find that only 44 per cent of payments are correct, so we are talking about nearly 60 per cent that are not correct. Again, this is just not acceptable. The total dollar value of incorrect payments is $2½ billion. The reason why I highlight these figures is to draw some attention to the quantum—the size, to the actual dollar value, of just how bad this is.</para><para>An on-point example of a real person in my electorate is that of a young woman who came to my office about a system flaw in her payments. She had identified the flaw and notified Centrelink, but the system would not allow the change because it is not built into the computer system. It is not built into the method by which it can be changed. It has to lie there—the documents are not right; this and that are not right. Every electorate office around this country has gone through this. Every Liberal member, every National Party member and every Labor member knows this is right, because we fix the problems. It is the members who end up sitting down, going through the details and fixing the problems in the bureaucracy—the bits that the public servants who are looking after Centrelink cannot fix because they do not have the authority to fix them.</para><para>This is part of the problem with the system. The minister wants all power over what goes on in their own system but accepts no responsibility, so people suffer in a flawed system. We did finally fix this woman's problem. It was a minor problem but it was a policy problem. We fixed it, but she had to put weeks of stress, pain and time into fixing this problem. That is completely inadequate and wrong. This government should go and fix its system first and let people get on with their lives. It should let people go out there and work for a living and look after their families and not have the stress and burden of this government which cannot do its job. It should not let that burden fall on to our electorate offices and on us, as members of parliament, or directly on to the families in our community.  </para><para>I cannot understand how the government continues to allow this to happen year after year and does not prioritise it. I cannot understand why it does not make it a top-level priority in its own party room to say. `This is an important issue we need to fix.' I think that might change. I have got to tell you here and now, Mr Deputy Speaker Lindsay, that this might change. It is going to change because the government is going to start to suffer in the electorates. That is the only thing that this government understands—electoral pain. If they feel enough electoral pain they will react. We saw that this week. They have ignored veterans; they have not come up with the sorts of packages and things that we need to provide to veterans as the proper entitlement that they are due for their service to this country.</para><para>We saw Minister Vale come into the parliament—I have to say she has very little respect, if any, left from the veteran community—with the gall to come in under false pretences and not offer the sort of benefits these people are entitled to. I was ashamed that day for this government and the way it treats veterans. But what did it do this week? It suddenly realised: `Hang on, we've got a fair bit of money stashed away for a rainy electoral day: a $7½ billion surplus. We might have to spend some of that on the people we are hurting the most.' It has twigged to that little problem it has in terms of the veteran community—the veterans just might do something about it if problems are not fixed.</para><para>I am glad to see now that there is an almost $300 million package that will actually go to veterans. But, mind you, the government, as always, has been dragged kicking and screaming all the way to the table and the options—all the way to the payments. It does not want to do this. The veteran community should make a note of this: `The government does not want to give you that $300 million; it is forced to give it to you.' It has been dragged there kicking and screaming because we, as the opposition, go into the parliament day after day and take the government to task. We want the government to be accountable for every single cent that it puts away like a miser in a little stash fund called an electoral fund—that $7½ billion surplus—so that it can have a get out of jail free card come the election. That is what is happening. This year may or may not be an election year, but you will see the changes. I think the community is smart enough to know that this year that is where that surplus will be spent. There is a lot of work to be done and a lot of things that need to be redressed, and this government has had way too much time to do it and has not acted on any of it.</para><para>There were also some interesting statistics that came back to us through the <inline font-style="italic">Weekend Australian</inline> newspaper, acquired through freedom of information requests, which confirmed the damaging 1.3 million mistakes that affected 700,000 Centrelink customers over a four-month period—700,000 Centrelink customers were affected over four months by Centrelink's mistakes. I want to make it very clear at this stage that I do not blame the workers of Centrelink. I do not blame the people that work there at all, because I know the stresses, regulation and bureaucracy they have to deal with and the pressures that come to them directly from the top—from government in Canberra—about the way they have to apply the rules they have been given. It has become such a complex business now, and we see the government making it more and more difficult for public servants to do their job. </para><para>And then what does the government do? I was absolutely shocked a couple of weeks ago when we had ministers come into this place and say that public servants cannot do the job well enough and we need to outsource and privatise it. Of course they cannot do the job well enough if you do not give them the tools and the resources. You can always make life difficult for someone if you want to and if you do not resource them properly. The government should make the system better. It should fix the flaws in the system and properly resource Centrelink. It should do all these things to make life for families easier. At the end of the day that is the goal. The priority of government should be to make life for families easier to the point where they do not have to worry about their Centrelink payments or that extra layer of bureaucracy, so that they can get on with their lives and their barbecue stoppers, as the Prime Minister is so keen to point out.</para><para>The Leader of the Opposition, Mark Latham, has talked about a ladder of opportunity. He has talked about the first rung on that ladder being opportunity for all our infant children. The Leader of the Opposition knows, like all of us, that our children are precious and the foundations of our future and that their development is not an issue to be avoided. Their development should be right up there—the No. 1 priority. It should be on the government's list but it is not. As I have explained before, we know why it is not on that list—that list is crowded by one issue only: the government's re-election.</para><para>Throughout my electorate and many like it across the country, people are trying very hard to balance the pressures of family life and work and, more specifically, people are struggling to find adequate child-care places. People often tell me they struggle not only to find adequate before- and after-school child-care places but also funded places so their kids can be looked after properly in a qualified child-care centre. People also tell me that child care is becoming one of those central issues that make it very difficult for them to continue in their employment. I think that is an issue the government should really pay more attention to. It ends up meaning that those families have to put more pressure on their friends, more pressure on their family and more pressure on the community in order to do the government's job. The community, friends and family end up doing the government's job, because the government refuses to accept its mutual responsibility to families in Australia. There is a crisis in child care that this government refuses to fix. The issue of affordability is certainly high on that agenda.</para><para>In the couple of minutes that I have remaining, I want to mention a specific example of the government's failure—that is, the Job Network system. The Job Network system is now well and truly stuffed. I do not know if I can find any other way to explain it. This system has failed glaringly. It is a revolving door of unemployment for those who remain unemployed. While I acknowledge that unemployment rates are low, not much has changed for those who are in long-term unemployment.</para><para>This system that the government has put in place seems to me to be nothing more than a system which it took away from public servants—it took away its own responsibility as a government to provide a Commonwealth employment service—and gave it to private enterprise. Private enterprise quickly worked out that, to make a profit—something that this government claims to understand very well—they needed customers. Their customers are the unemployed. Of course, as unemployment tends to fall or as there is no renewal of customers, the Job Network agencies fail. And as they fail, the government finds that it has to top them up. What is it doing? It is topping them up to the tune and $670 million per year. It is finding that, if it does not throw in $1 billion extra to keep them afloat, they and the system will collapse and it will be revealed just how flawed this system really is. </para><para>In the few words that I have put on the record today, I have highlighted just a few of the many problems that families and communities face in Australia today. But I really want to draw people's attention to the fact that this government does absolutely nothing about it. It does not prioritise. Labor will do that when it is elected. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>25631</page.no><name role="metadata">Hoare, Kelly, MP</name><name role="display">Ms HOARE</name><name.id>83Y</name.id><electorate>Charlton</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—<inline ref="R1975">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2003-2004,</inline><inline ref="R1976">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2003-2004</inline> and <inline ref="R1977">Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2003-2004</inline> constitute the additional estimates bills for 2004. They provide additional funding requirements since the 2003-04 budget and include total appropriations for the three bills of $14,307 million. This is a net increase of $957 million from the 2003-04 budget, which is two per cent of total annual appropriations. These bills also include savings due to changes in policy or parameter variations totalling $473.4 million. These are outlined in the finance document statement of savings expected in annual appropriations. The Appropriations Bill (No. 3) 2003-2004 deals primarily with measures since the last budget and, in addition to supply, two new clauses have also been added to this bill which will provide a mechanism for the finance minister upon request from portfolio minister to lapse amounts of departmental expense appropriations which are not required.</para></talk.start><para>While we have said that we will support these appropriation bills as we have done every year since 1975, we have moved a second reading amendment that the House condemns the government for its budget waste, mismanagement and wrong priorities which have resulted in a costly Medicare safety net that does not protect families from increasing health costs and declining levels of bulk-billing; inadequate funding and higher fees for students seeking access to higher education; a growing number of families who are financially squeezed in trying to balance work and family and half a million Australians who have been waiting for up to five years to get their teeth fixed.</para><para>We need to restore doctors' services in the Newcastle and Lake Macquarie area. Labor has a plan to save Medicare with a $1.9 billion package to reverse the collapse in bulk-billing and by lifting the patient rebate for bulk-billing for all Australians, no matter where they live or how much they earn. A Latham Labor government will immediately lift the Medicare patient rebate for all bulk-billed consultations to 95 per cent of the scheduled fee—an average increase of $3.35 per visit. Subsequently, it will lift the Medicare patient rebate for all bulk-billed consultations to 100 per cent of the scheduled fee—an average increase of $5 per visit. Doctors will be offered financial incentives to keep treating their patients, without additional cost, and to extend bulk-billing, especially in places like Lake Macquarie and Newcastle where the collapse in bulk-billing is really hurting families. Lifting the patient rebate and introducing financial incentives for bulk-billing will help to stem the dramatic decline in bulk-billing and act to make more bulk-billing available to more Australian families.</para><para>Labor will encourage doctors to bulk-bill. We will make access to health care much easier for families, particularly those families who are under financial pressure. Labor stands in stark contrast to the government's proposals to destroy Medicare, to restrict bulk-billing to pensioners and concession card holders, and to see Australian families pay more every time they visit the doctor. Bit by bit, visit by visit, the cost for Australian families under John Howard will go up. Under Labor's proposals, there are substantial financial incentives for GPs to continue bulk-billing or to improve their bulk-billing performances. We are very confident that our package, when implemented, will firstly stem the serious decline in bulk-billing and then see bulk-billing go back up towards our national objective of an 80 per cent bulk-billing rate. </para><para>The Prime Minister knows his package will create conditions in which it will be easier for doctors to charge gap payments for patients and increase their fees for patients who are already paying private fees. There is the ability for doctors to claim the Medicare rebate directly and to charge a gap payment, and it is being held out as an incentive only for those doctors who agree to do John Howard's bidding for pensioners and concession card holders. As the former President of the AMA, Kerryn Phelps, pointed out:</para><quote><para>What will need to happen is that for doctors to continue to bulk-bill their concession card holders they're going to have to charge their non concession card holders more ...</para></quote><para>The government's package will drive bulk-billing even lower because, while doctors will be given financial incentives to bulk-bill pensioners and concession card holders, they will be given the green light to charge higher fees for everybody else. Australian families who earn more than $32,300 a year are not eligible for a concession card. For them, bulk-billing will effectively end. When they visit their GP, bit by bit, visit by visit, they will be asked to pay more.</para><para>We all know that being able to see a doctor when somebody in the family is sick can be pretty tough. Finding a doctor who is prepared to bulk-bill is almost impossible these days. Part of my job as a federal member of parliament is to help our community gain better access to services, including doctors and Medicare. Labor is the party that built Medicare. Labor believes in Medicare. Under Labor, Medicare was not in crisis; it worked. In 1996 more than 80 per cent of visits to doctors cost patients nothing because the doctor bulk-billed. John Howard, in contrast, has never believed in Medicare and his policies have put Medicare on the critical list. John Howard's policies mean that there are now 21 per cent less bulk-billing consultations each year in West Lake Macquarie and South Newcastle than there were in 2000. This means that greater pressure is being placed on John Hunter Hospital, Belmont Hospital and Wyong Hospital emergency rooms.</para><para>We all know that there are times when a family needs a doctor and that it is now harder to find one. I will relate a personal experience that happened to me during January. We woke up one morning at home and Reg, my husband, found that he could not swallow. We rang his local medical service and they said, `No, the doctor is on holidays. We couldn't get a locum in and won't be able to see you for about three or four days.' I rang another medical service in the area, but the doctor had to go on leave as she had been working hard all year. They could not get a locum in to assist the practice, so the practice in the town had to close down over the break. The advice given to us was to wait at the emergency rooms at the John Hunter Hospital. I would like to think that we are a fairly intelligent family, but on this occasion we decided that we would self-medicate. We looked in the herbal books on the bookshelves, looking for ways to try to alleviate the symptoms Reg had, without having to wait at the emergency room at the John Hunter Hospital. If we as a family have to make choices like that, I can just imagine what other people in the community do. </para><para>In relation to shortages of doctors and bulk-billing, in July last year I expressed my disappointment in this place at the sudden closure of the Wyee Medical Practice in my electorate. I was extremely saddened that the last of the bulk-billing surgeries in the Morisset and Wyee area had closed its doors to the public. The doctors at the surgery were well respected and were the last to regularly bulk-bill patients in the Southlakes area. There are few doctors in the Morisset region who will take on new patients because their books are full. Costs of around $35.50 for a pensioner to visit the doctor are causing many people in our community to turn to our public hospitals for medical attention or they just miss out completely.</para><para>The community of Wyee and Wyee Point have been left without their bulk-billing doctors. This means that many families will just not seek medical attention because the $35 or $44 to visit the doctor is just not there. There is a clear shortage of doctors in the Southlakes area and, with a significant growing population, the pressure placed on our hardworking doctors is mounting. People living in the Southlakes area have been disadvantaged by the closure of the Wyee surgery, which will only add pressure to the existing doctors in Morisset, Cooranbong and Bonnells Bay. We need more doctors in our regions; we cannot afford to see them leave. And we need these doctors to bulk-bill us so all families can access medical attention when they need it. We need a solution to the bulk-billing crisis, and only Labor will deliver a better deal on Medicare for families in the Southlakes area.</para><para>Following the closure of that doctor's surgery in Wyee towards the end of last year, the Wyee community faced the possible closure of the Wyee pharmacy owing to the loss of the doctor. I am deeply concerned that because we are still yet to secure the services of a new doctor the pharmacy may have to close. I have been working closely with the community, including Ibraham and Lobna Gahzi, the local pharmacists to bring a doctor back to Wyee. Whilst our efforts continue, there is increasing pressure on the pharmacy to close. Much of the pharmacists' work is generated by dispensing prescriptions and, without a doctor in town, fewer people are using the pharmacy. Ibraham and Lobna have been great supporters of the Wyee community and it is a tragedy that their business has suffered as a result of the closure of the Wyee Medical Practice. I again call on the government to bring about a solution that will encourage a doctor to come to Wyee. We were advised by the minister that Wyee is a location where an overseas trained doctor is able to access a Medicare provider number. This needs to happen soon before another vital service, the local pharmacy, is lost to the community of Wyee.</para><para>Moving on to dental care, I have received many letters, emails and phone calls on this issue. As I have responded to them, I emphasise that Labor will invest $300 million over four years in a national dental care program to help those half a million Australians currently waiting up to five years to get treatment. Australian dental care will provide well over a million extra dental procedures for Australians—enough to clear the existing backlog and substantially reduce waiting lists. When the Howard government abolished the Commonwealth dental program in 1996, there were 380,000 Australians waiting an average of six months for public dental care. Now there are more than half a million people waiting as long as five years to get their teeth fixed, and many of the people on these lists are elderly.</para><para>Under Labor's plan, concession card holders, such as pensioners, and health care card holders and their dependants will now get free check-ups when they need them and subsidised dental treatments, restorations and dentures. Labor will also provide dental health assessments and ongoing care for everyone admitted to nursing homes and will help Indigenous communities with special dental problems, including lack of water fluoridation and diabetes. Under Labor, the federal and state governments will join together in a great national effort because we know that affordable dental care is as essential as any other medical treatment. State and territory governments will spend $384 million on dental services this financial year for health care card holders and school children. Labor believes that dental care is a national responsibility and, unlike the Prime Minister who simply tries to fob it off to the states, a Latham Labor government will work with the states to fix the crisis in dental care. </para><para>Towards the end of last year, we saw a change in leadership of the federal parliamentary Labor Party. Mark Latham was elected leader and the policies that I have outlined in relation to Medicare, bulk-billing and doctor shortages were released prior to that. So we have shown already that we are a party of positive policy announcements, of policy announcements which have been fully costed and which we know will work to address the ongoing crisis in parts of our community in relation to medical care. </para><para>Throughout January in the lead-up to the Labor Party's national conference which was held in Sydney at the end of January a lot of the media and political commentators and many of those in the coalition government were saying that the national conference was going to be a test of Mark Latham's leadership of the Labor Party. I think a lot of those people would have been sitting back and waiting for Mark Latham to fall at the national conference of the Labor Party. But that did not happen. If that was a test of Mark Latham's leadership of the Labor Party then he well and truly passed it. Following on from that, we had the media commentators as well as the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and leading government ministers and government backbenchers saying: `This is a honeymoon for Mark Latham. This is a honeymoon period for the new leader of the Labor Party.' After three months of that leadership—three months today—that balloon, that honeymoon period, is nowhere near dissipating. I think the government members would be pleased to have a crisis which would maybe put a hole in that balloon. That is not going to happen. If you have seen the energy, the commitment and the dedication from the new Leader of the Opposition, you will know that that is not going to happen.</para><para>In the last month or so, the government have gone into panic mode and we have seen their knee-jerk reactions. We saw that with the response from the Prime Minister in relation to parliamentarians' superannuation. We saw it today in response to the veteran community and the policy announcements to try and shore up their support. I remind the government members and the Prime Minister that the community has a long memory and the community will remember the trail of deceit, the trail of non-core promises and they will ask: `Where are the weapons of mass destruction and the reasons we went to war?' They will remember <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline>. They will remember the children overboard. They will remember Peter Hollingworth. They will remember the never, ever GST. They will remember the no $100,000 university fees. They will remember the reason we went to war was because of the so-called weapons of mass destruction, but now the Prime Minister tells us it was good to get the regime change. The electorate will remember these things. No amount of back-pedalling or spending the budget surplus is going to make them feel any other way.  </para><para>The opposition's amendment to this legislation also goes to the issue of government waste. It was reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> by Alan Ramsey on 18 February following budget estimates in which our two experts—Labor Party Senators John Faulkner and Robert Ray—raised some questions about expenditure on the Lodge. The total expenditure came in at about $140,000 which included 10 armchairs at $23,000-odd, carpeting, painting and new timberwork, design fees, timber removal, curtains, two bathrooms and lighting. The article reports Senator Faulkner saying:</para><quote><para>Is that the full horror?</para></quote><para>And the official replied:</para><quote><para>There is still some carpeting.</para></quote><para>They then moved on to the `retirement lifestyle' of Peter Hollingworth. You would remember that Peter Hollingworth was, as Ramsey reports:</para><quote><para>...[the] former archbishop and tainted governor-general who resigned, under pressure, a year ago after just 23 turbulent months and walked away with an annual pension of $184,000, a car and driver and first-class air travel for life, and an office and secretary—</para></quote><para>thank you very much! Senator Ray, in budget estimates, as Ramsey reports:</para><quote><para>... wanted to know about Hollingworth's 21st-floor office in Melbourne that taxpayers maintain. How big was it? Official: “145 square metres for him and his staff.” How many staff? “One.” Faulkner: “145 square metres for two people? That is bigger than a lot of houses in this country, isn't it?” Official: “I do not know.” Faulkner: “Well, I do.”</para></quote><para>And we all do, too. Ramsey's article said Senator Ray then asked:</para><quote><para>“Were any renovations required?” Official: “There was a fit-out, yes.” Ray: “How much?” Official: “The total cost?” Ray: “Yes.”</para></quote><para>The official said that the total cost of the fit out of this 21st floor office of 145 square metres for two people was $234,000. Those are just a couple of examples of government wastage in this area.</para><para>I referred to the national conference and the various policy announcements which were made there. We also announced the policy of Read Aloud Australia, where parents are supported in reading aloud to their children from day one—because we know that learning begins at day one—and the BookStart program, where every new parent will be offered three new books to read to their children. We also had the announcement that Lindsay Tanner, the member for Melbourne, had been appointed the shadow minister for community relationships. We all know that people out there in the community do not sit around the pub talking about the state of the economy; they sit around the pub talking about the state of their families, the state of their community, their community security, how their kids are going and what is happening in their everyday lives. So I applaud the Leader of the Opposition for making those announcements at our national conference. They were great announcements and there are many more where they came from.</para><para>In conclusion, and because I have referred to the new Leader of the Opposition, I would just like to take this opportunity to salute Simon Crean, the member for Hotham. Simon always had my support. Simon is a good man; he was a good leader. Unfortunately, events conspired against him. I wish him and Carole all the best, all the time. I consider them good friends. We did a lot under the leadership of Simon Crean and I applaud him for that. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>25636</page.no><name role="metadata">Zahra, Christian, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ZAHRA</name><name.id>84H</name.id><electorate>McMillan</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I was appalled and disgusted when I saw in the <inline font-style="italic">Weekend Australian</inline><inline font-style="italic"> Magazine</inline> of 21 and 22 February a reference—to a part of my electorate—which I consider to be full of judgment and prejudice. A number of people in this chamber might have read the article that I am talking about. It was an otherwise excellent piece of writing by a journalist named Stuart Rintoul. It was an article about a very well-known and prominent defence barrister named Colin Lovitt. I thought it was a good piece of writing about Colin Lovitt and it was interesting reading, but I must take issue with a reference that Stuart Rintoul made in his article to what he described as the `rural slum of Moe'.</para></talk.start><para>I am very proud to represent the town of Moe in my electoral district. It is a beautiful town and an absolutely fantastic place to live. It is surrounded by rolling hills to the south and an absolutely gorgeous mountain range to the north. It is a large and vibrant township of about 18,000 people, and it has a magnificent sense of community. I have been proud to have the support of so many people in Moe in my political life for quite a few years, and very proud to count so many people in Moe as my trusted and closest friends.</para><para>I want to say this in the parliament: I think Stuart Rintoul did the wrong thing by making that reference to Moe. It is an uninformed comment and a comment that is full of prejudice and judgment. I say to Stuart Rintoul through this parliament that we really count on people like him in the media to be responsible in the comments they make about towns and districts, because what they say has a big effect on how people perceive the towns, districts and regions in which we live. I think it would be appropriate for Stuart Rintoul and the <inline font-style="italic">Weekend Australian</inline> to apologise to the people of Moe for that reference. It might have been an inadvertent reference, but the damage has still been done. People in Moe are hurt by that reference. It is a reference which is unfair. It is a comment on the people of Moe which is not deserved.</para><para>We all know that when you refer to a slum in an Australian context the general usage of that word is associated with a place like Calcutta where there is desperate poverty and there are awful physical circumstances and people living in horrendous personal situations. We all know that that is what the word `slum' refers to. We know that that reference is unsuitable when talking about a beautiful town and a vibrant community full of good people, all working hard to get ahead, which is what we have in the township of Moe.</para><para>I want to use the time that I have available today to draw attention to the response that we have had from the public schools right across my electorate to the awful comments made by the Prime Minister in relation to the public school system. It might be worth while my reminding the House exactly what those comments were. The Prime Minister said:</para><quote><para>... they—</para></quote><para>talking about the parents—</para><quote><para>feel that government schools have become too politically correct and too values-neutral.</para></quote><para>And the acting education minister, Peter McGauran, said:</para><quote><para>... there is a worrying trend within state schools, that there is a jettison of traditional values and heritage of Australia.</para></quote><para>He went on to say:</para><quote><para>... there is a growing trend that is discernable to parents that too many government schools are either value free or are hostile to, apathetic to, Australia's heritage and values ... </para></quote><para>Those comments are appalling and very uninformed. They are an insult to all those hardworking teachers and support staff who commit themselves so fully and energetically to providing quality education to our students in public schools. Quite a response has been created in my electorate not only from people in the public school system but also from people in the Catholic and independent school systems who were appalled at the Prime Minister's comments and who think that these types of generalisations and stereotypes of schools or teachers are highly inappropriate.</para><para>I have some letters here from schools across my electorate in response to what the Prime Minister has said. I want to read part of what they have said in their letters to me into the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> for the record. One letter is from a rural primary school in the beautiful Latrobe Valley. It says:</para><quote><para>Christian, you must have noticed even in your visits to our school how seriously we emphasise the values of respect and civility to visitors. This is even more so when we are out of the school. The students know very clearly what is expected.</para></quote><para>The principal goes on to say:</para><quote><para>This year at our school, we are launching the You Can Do It program. This actually teaches the indicators research has shown make a successful student and citizen. These indicators are: organisation, academic confidence, persistence and getting along with others. Underpinning these success indicators are a whole range of values: respect for others, respect for property, independence, giving of your best, expectations that tasks will be completed, putting in an effort, planning time, listening to others, tolerance, playing by the rules, thinking first—the list goes on. These aspects of successful citizenship are actually taught. There are specific lessons on these values.</para></quote><para>The principal concludes by saying:</para><quote><para>Christian, can you imagine what schools would be like if tolerance, respect and a conscientious approach to study were not inherent in the values of a school? It would be chaos, and my school is not that.</para></quote><para>I have been to that principal's school on several occasions, and I can guarantee that his school, like so many other public schools in my electoral district, is an excellent school. It provides a fantastic education to all of its students.</para><para>Another letter I have received in relation to this issue is from the principal of one of the large state primary schools in the west Gippsland area. He has written a letter to the Prime Minister which he has copied to me. As principal of his school, he writes to the Prime Minister:</para><quote><para>I am deeply offended by your comments regarding state government schools and their values. As the elected political leader of this country your effort should be constructive and inclusive, not divisive and politically point scoring.</para></quote><para>He goes on to say:</para><quote><para>... it is a large primary school with a strong culture of producing high-quality, well educated students. We operate in a very competitive environment. The whole community sees our school as offering outstanding quality education. The values and heritage enunciated at this school truly reflect the parent community and are clearly stated. Your recent statements not only damage years of hard work and effort but also the image of my staff and their profession.</para></quote><para>This was typical of the response I had from schools right across my electorate in relation to the Prime Minister's comments about public education. I would like to read from another letter I have got, which is from a large public primary school in one of the towns in the Latrobe Valley. The principal wrote to me and said: </para><quote><para>Like you, I was appalled at the indiscriminate demeaning of schools. </para></quote><para>He goes on to say:</para><quote><para>It is unfortunate that the Prime Minister's comments and those of many of his colleagues have in one broad, generalised sweep undermined the work and integrity of teachers and parents who are contributing so much to the growth and development of this nation. I am personally embarrassed because it has taken the focus away from the real issues facing schools today.</para></quote><para>I support that view and I think he has hit the nail on the head. The real issue facing the federal parliament in relation to schools is not some type of false debate that the Prime Minister might want to try and start which relates to his idea of values; it is about where the funding goes that the Commonwealth provides to schools. We have a situation now where the more money schools have the more money they get, which means that poorer districts—mostly in rural areas—miss out. All of the big increases go to the King's School, Geelong Grammar, Wesley College and Trinity College—schools that charge $15,000 or $16,000 per year for just one student to study. Not one single person in my electorate can afford that. The real debate, which was alluded to in that letter I just read out, is about why it is that the Howard government sees fit to give those schools the most money and not adequately fund the public school system and low-fee Catholic and independent schools and recognise the needs of their students and the communities they serve.</para><para>I had many other responses, from principals, school councils and students right across my electorate. I want to read out a response from a principal who leads one of the public secondary colleges in the south Gippsland region. He says that at his school:</para><quote><para>Our core values and expectations are: valuing people, valuing diversity, mutual respect, honesty, trust, resolving conflict positively, recognising and encouraging people's strengths, respecting individuality, fostering a sense of community where we care about everyone. People are encouraged to make positive choices, taking responsibility for actions and achievements.</para></quote><para>His letter goes on:</para><quote><para>We teach these core values and expectations in the curriculum, with a subject known as people skills. This has commenced this year at years 7, 8 and 9. We are a project school for social competencies, which we have called people skills.</para></quote><para>He includes some three pages in his letter that set out in more detail all of the values and skills which his school is teaching its students as it prepares those young people for life. </para><para>There are so many other responses that I have received, from some excellent schools right across my electoral district. I hope that the Prime Minister is listening to my contribution today and hearing first-hand what educators, people who are in the field servicing communities in country areas, actually think of the comments that he made about their schools and the school system, which he has, in one broad statement, demeaned in such a disgraceful way.</para><para>I had the good fortune the other day to get a briefing from the Trafalgar district community association. The Trafalgar district community association are good people who have been working very hard on behalf of the residents and the citizens of Trafalgar and have really been a very powerful force within that community in setting a positive agenda for the town and making sure that things happen when they are planned. I received a briefing from the Trafalgar district community association, from the people from the youth resource centre in the town, from the Trafalgar Chamber of Commerce and from a number of people who are involved directly with the Trafalgar district community association in terms of organising the strategic direction for the town.  </para><para>The group have steered the development of the Trafalgar strategic plan and its sister publication, the Trafalgar action plan. They are two excellent publications, which are the result of extensive work and public consultation that has been done by the people involved in the Trafalgar Community Development Association. I just want to use this public opportunity in the parliament to congratulate the people involved in the Trafalgar Community Development Association for the work which they have done. In particular, I want to congratulate Mick Bourke, who has been their president for quite some time, for the work which he has done and the leadership he has provided to that organisation. </para><para>It is a wonderful town, Trafalgar, and I am absolutely convinced that it has a very positive future. It will continue to have a positive future so long as there are people in the community like Mick Bourke and all the other people involved in the Trafalgar Community Development Association who give so willingly of their time and effort and creativity to ensure that a future for Trafalgar is not something that people take for granted but something that people work towards and plan towards. Well done to Mick and his team and to all of the people who are involved in the Trafalgar Community Development Association.</para><para>I had the opportunity last week to meet with the people involved with the Coal Creek Heritage Village, which is one of Victoria's premier tourist attractions and is located in the southern part of my electorate, in Korumburra. It is an excellent place. I have been there several times and I am sure many other people in the House have been there before as well. You will be pleased to know, Mr Deputy Speaker Wilkie, that it is celebrating its 30th birthday this month.</para><para>The story of Coal Creek is quite amazing and an excellent example of the determination, resourcefulness and cooperation of rural Australian communities. Coal Creek was planned, developed and built by the Korumburra community. The village has benefited from ongoing financial assistance initially from the old Korumburra Shire Council and, more recently, from the South Gippsland Shire Council. However, the vast majority of the original construction was undertaken by volunteer labour, and most of the relics, artefacts and antiques that make up the collection were donated by local residents and families. The day-to-day operation of the village has across its 30-year history relied heavily on volunteers in staffing roles as tour guides and in maintaining the village. Korumburra is a relatively small town, as you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, yet the local community supplies around 30 volunteers per week to keep Coal Creek functioning. It really is a great achievement that the people of Korumburra have been able to keep Coal Creek functioning for so long and have made it such a success.</para><para>Today I want to briefly give some special recognition to a number of volunteers. One standout volunteer amongst a bigger group is Anne Hopwood, who recently retired as a volunteer at Coal Creek after 25 years of continuous services. Anne and her husband run a dairy farm in the Korumburra area and have raised a family of three children. However, she still found time to donate at least a day's voluntary labour to Coal Creek almost every week across the past 25 years. Keith Dunstan is a relative newcomer compared to Anne. He first became involved with Coal Creek around 15 years ago. Since then, he has adopted the village. He is often there seven days per week, feeding the farm animals and tackling all manner of maintenance projects. Keith is also an active member of many of the groups and subcommittees that form the basis of operation and support at Coal Creek. </para><para>When Coal Creek was first suggested, Hugh Henry was a local councillor. He was a member of the original investigative committee and a prime mover in developing and progressing the project. He then took on the role of manager of the village, once it opened, and remained in that position for its first 15 years of operation. Since then, he has been a regular visitor, returning to offer his services across a broad range of areas, including building maintenance and general repairs. Hugh has a wealth of knowledge on the history and original development plans, and he remains only too happy to share that with the current management. There are many other examples of local people who have given so much to the Coal Creek Heritage Village over its 30 years of operation.</para><para>Well done to Ken Joiner, the current manager of the Coal Creek Heritage Village, in making sure that we properly celebrate this 30th anniversary. I would like to place on record the great regard that I have for the many volunteers who have worked so hard over so many years to make sure that Coal Creek is the excellent tourist facility that it is and that the important history of coalmining in and around the south Gippsland district is preserved for future generations.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>25640</page.no><name role="metadata">Griffin, Alan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GRIFFIN</name><name.id>VU5</name.id><electorate>Bruce</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In rising today to speak on <inline ref="R1975">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2003-2004</inline> and cognate bills, I want to raise some particular issues with respect to two reports of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, of which I am a member. One report is entitled <inline font-style="italic">Money matters in the bush</inline> and the other report is entitled <inline font-style="italic">ATM fee structure</inline>. These two related reports went into a range of issues regarding access to, and availability and serviceability of, banking services in rural and regional Australia in particular—although the report on the ATM fee structure had a slightly wider remit with respect to that issue. The reports, on balance, are broadly endorsed by all members of the committee. However, Labor members disagreed with coalition members on a number of issues, and I would like to focus on those particular areas and recommendations. In the first report—<inline font-style="italic">Money matters in the bush</inline>—there was some difference of opinion on a number of recommendations. These recommendations covered issues such as notifications for closure of banks, older person and disability access, accounts, balances provided at EFTPOS, Indigenous communities and banking, and community obligations.</para></talk.start><para>I will just go through some of those recommendations and highlight some of the differences of opinion in order to make the Main Committee more aware of the concerns that were held. Recommendation 3 in that report related to the question of improved consultation and, in particular, a notice period of some six months to be provided if a branch was the only branch in a town that was left and that branch was to close. Labor certainly support that recommendation. It is actually in line with what our policy has generally been with respect to the issue of branch closures. Our belief, though, is that you should not just look at it from a rural and regional point of view in that respect. It is a very significant issue in those areas, but there are also metropolitan suburbs and communities where branch closures and their circumstances are also quite traumatic for local businesses and communities. Therefore, although we fully support this recommendation for rural and remote areas, we also believe it ought to be the case for the community in general and should cover branch closures, full stop. </para><para>Recommendation 4 related to the question of the gathering of data by APRA and concerns about the question of how that was operating. I am going to quote extensively from the committee report in various ways, shapes and forms but, in respect to that matter, Labor members shared the community's concern that there does need to be improved analysis and commentary on the information provided through the points of presence database. While the committee has requested that another government agency and not APRA be requested to do this, Labor members believe that APRA should have a role in analysing and commenting on the data but that this should be done by APRA in conjunction with the ACCC. Given the ACCC's role in assessing levels of competition in the banking services industry, they would bring a good deal of expertise to any assessment of access to banking services. We think that more can and should be done there.</para><para>Recommendation 12 relates to the question of older Australians. Labor supports the priority placed on introducing industry standards to support older Australians and those with disabilities to achieve full and equal access to services such as ATMs and EFTPOS. With respect to recommendation 22 on the issue of expansion of displays of account balances, Labor supports the expansion of EFTPOS facilities to allow for access to account balances. However, there should not be an additional fee for this service and the balance information request should not be considered as a transaction where consumers can only access a limited number of fee-free transactions. It gets back to the issue that we are now at a stage with banking services where, even if you blink at your ATM, you need to respond by paying some sort of fee. The nature of fee payments with respect to this industry has just grown like Topsy over the last few years. It is something that the banks have seen as an ever-growing area for increasing their revenue streams. It is certainly the way that they have been dealing with the benefits of competition that occurred around the Labor government's reforms in that area regarding things like mortgage providers and interest rates.</para><para>Another area where concerns were held related to some of the recommendations not going far enough, particularly with respect to the issue of Indigenous communities. Much evidence was taken by the committee on the difficulties confronting Indigenous Australians regarding access to banking services and financial literacy generally. It is apparent that many remote and regional Indigenous communities lack sufficient basic banking services. In some cases it is not an issue of services previously enjoyed being withdrawn but, rather, of services never having been provided at all.</para><para>As important, the lack of such services is compounded by factors such as remoteness; socioeconomic disadvantage, which in some instances is extreme; poor levels of numeracy and literacy; and, accordingly, low levels of financial literacy, cultural difference and language barriers. Labor members consider that access to basic banking services and minimum levels of financial literacy are preconditions to addressing the disadvantage experienced by many Indigenous communities in remote and regional Australia. There is little point in governments encouraging Indigenous Australians to achieve greater economic independence if the basic building blocks of economic development are not in place.</para><para>Accordingly, while Labor members were generally supportive of the committee's recommendations with regard to Indigenous Australians, we also made the following additional points. In relation to recommendations 24 and 26, Labor members see a need for a multifaceted strategy to improve the financial literacy of Indigenous Australians which is coordinated by the government and which involves Indigenous organisations, state and territory governments and financial institutions. Whilst we support recommendation 24, which calls for financial literacy to be included in core school curricula, we consider this to be only one of a number of strategies that are required. We also believe the involvement of Indigenous organisations, particularly those with demonstrated success in the area of financial literacy education, to be critical. </para><para>Further, we consider that recommendation 26 fails to go far enough. It is insufficient to call on the ABA to simply examine the successful practices utilised in Canada in relation to Indigenous financial literacy. In our view, the ABA should develop, in partnership with relevant Indigenous organisations, a comprehensive strategy for improving the financial literacy of Indigenous users of banking services, drawing on the Canadian experience. Labor members are encouraged by some of the initiatives taken by some banks and also by the ABA's indicated willingness to work with Reconciliation Australia on this issue. However, it is our view that, in the event these voluntary initiatives prove to be insufficient, these issues would properly be considered in the context of compulsory community service obligations.</para><para>Recommendation 29 related to the issue of the Banking and Financial Services Ombudsman. In particular, Labor members believe that the jurisdiction of the BFSO should be widened further to encompass consumer complaints about the cost of banking services. This is part of that wider discussion. I think the Banking and Financial Services Ombudsman does a pretty good job in many respects; however, the fact of the matter is that he is dramatically limited by the extent of his charter. There are a range of issues which get raised with the BFSO on a regular basis that are not able to be investigated. Those are genuine complaints about the operation of the banking sector but they are complaints which the BFSO is unable to deal with. That is a fault in the system. It means that a range of issues that ought to be investigated are not able to be investigated by an appropriate body such as the BFSO. That is something that I think is incredibly unfortunate. In this particular case, the committee may not have realised the extent of the need but certainly the Labor members do realise that those issues need to be looked at.</para><para>Going on from that, there is recommendation 30, which from Labor's point of view related to the issue of supporting the introduction of community service obligations on ADIs. It is a point that we have made repeatedly in the past. We have said that once again we are prepared to look at reregulating the banks if they do not agree to meet appropriate voluntary community service obligations. Our view is that, until we get the banks to the table in a situation where they understand that the regulators and the government of the day are serious, we will not be able to get real movement on a range of issues. The experience with the sector in the past has been that, when they think things are about to happen, you tend to find that they are then prepared to look at what they might do. We believe more can be done in that area. We stress that as something that should be done in the future.</para><para>I will go on now to the issue of ATM foreign fee structures, which was the subject of a follow-up report that effectively came out of the main report that I have just spoken about. ATMs are a very important part of what is now the banking sector in this country. Many of us here—and no doubt Deputy Speaker Causley would be amongst us—certainly found that initial period of moving across to using an ATM to be of some difficulty. I know that I did. I do not think that is something to be worried about. In my early years it was a matter of going into a bank branch rather than dealing with the infamous hole in the wall. However, most of us have conquered this to a large degree in the last 20 years or so and now it is something that we have taken for granted as being a bread-and-butter part of the banking sector. </para><para>However, there are many things that a hole in the wall cannot do. The experience right across Australia, particularly in rural and regional areas, is that bank branches are the sorts of services that go. We lose the bricks and mortar and the services which relate to that. We are seeing in a range of ways more innovative solutions now being used to deal with some of these issues. That is a good thing, but the bottom line—and this is something that the committee found in its inspections—is that there is still a general and genuine view pervading the community in many rural and regional areas that, although in many respects the new services were good and occasionally in some respects they were better, overall service delivery had dropped and that that was detrimental to the operation of the local community. When you take away those banking services, you end up in a situation where they are simply the first things to go. Then the stores start to leave. The next thing you know—and we saw them—some towns effectively almost turn into ghost towns, not quite overnight but certainly in the passing of merely several years.</para><para>With ATMs the question is: what is happening with respect to the fee structures in those areas? A review is going on at the moment, looking at the question of ATM fees, and there is a working party of the industry, which has come forth with some recommendations about how to deal with those fees. In a nutshell, it involves the abolition of certain fees and a recommendation for more transparency in charges so that when you look at an ATM you would be able to see what you would be charged for undertaking a particular transaction. In the scope of that, there would effectively be a deregulation of what we call foreign ATM fees—that is, when you use an ATM of another institution. In my case, as a Commonwealth Bank customer, if I were using a Westpac, an ANZ Bank or a National Australia Bank ATM, it would be a question of what fee would be charged in those circumstances. By deregulating this area, the concern is that we would potentially find absolutely exorbitant fees being charged, particularly in rural and regional areas but also in some metropolitan areas, depending on the particular circumstances.</para><para>The situation with respect to rural and regional Australia is that it is potentially very damaging. Certainly some of the evidence that was taken at the hearing into this matter highlighted that. The representative from the Country Women's Association, Chris Connolly from the University of New South Wales and representatives from the Australian Consumers Association stressed the fact that many things could happen in this area and that the international experience suggested very clearly that rural and regional communities should be very concerned about what might happen.</para><para>We are talking about a situation where, over the last decade or so, some 750 branches have closed, and those communities have been put into a situation where they need to use electronic banking. Forty per cent of Australian transactions were at foreign ATMs, and this proportion is likely to be higher in the bush where there is often only one bank in a town and therefore not the same level of choice that you would have in metropolitan areas. In my case now, because of these sorts of fees, I look for Commonwealth Bank ATMs rather than using another institution's ATM, because I know that I will be dealing with some additional cost. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>HH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Jenkins</name></talker><para>—For once you are an informed consumer!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>VU5</name.id><name role="metadata">Griffin, Alan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GRIFFIN</name></talker><para>—As the member for Scullin said, for once I am an informed consumer.

It just goes to show that you can teach an old dog new tricks in some cases—but not always. The transaction rate even now, with respect to these fees, can range between $1.35 and $2. When you look at the movement in these foreign ATM fees as they currently stand, before we go to deregulation, you see that they have increased by something like 250 per cent since 1995.</para></talk.start></continue><para>What we are saying is that there are several bottom lines which ought to be the basis of the implementation of these reforms and which we worry about, given the report as it currently stands and where the working party is up to with respect to recommendations. Firstly, we believe that any change should reduce the overall cost of banking to customers. This should be a logical conclusion of these changes, because the fact is that, when you do an examination of the actual cost to the institution for undertaking this service compared to the fees that are charged for electronic transactions, those fees are almost invariably at a significantly higher level of profit than is reasonable for the provision of the service. There should be—and, in our view, there must be—a reduction in the overall cost of banking to customers in this area. We also need to ensure that customers in regional areas are not slugged with higher fees than those charged in the major cities. I will come back to that in a minute. We need to prevent institutions with large ATM networks from using their market power to impose higher charges on customers of smaller institutions.</para><para>One of the recommendations in the report which Labor has strong concerns about is recommendation 1. I will read out that recommendation. It mentions the creation of `safeguards that would ensure that people living in country towns and remote communities do not incur significantly higher fees or charges for using a foreign ATM and that an unreasonable or unwarranted differential in fees and charges between those in rural and remote areas and those in metropolitan areas does not develop'. The key point there is `an unreasonable or unwarranted differential in fees and charges'. Although the majority of the committee said that we should not be in a situation where there is an increase in charges for certain areas, that is actually conceding that there is scope for—and, in fact, it is effectively endorsing—differential fee charging. While it is saying that it should not be unreasonable or unwarranted, it is still saying there is not a problem with it actually occurring.</para><para>The member for Wannon is present today and I am sure he would be concerned about what the results might be there. Going by this recommendation, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services has basically said that it is okay to have a differential rate for foreign ATM transactions between the city and the country. That is what it has basically said. It has said that the differential should not be unreasonable or unwarranted, but it is still saying it can be there. The fact of the matter—and the member for Wannon has some expertise in these matters, given that he is the chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration—is that, over time, we have seen a lot of evidence on the way that banking institutions have operated with respect to the provision of services. I think that, if we asked many members of the public and certainly many members of parliament who deal with regional and rural areas in particular whether the actions of the banks with respect to branch closures over the years have been reasonable or warranted, we would find that, in many cases, there would be significant concerns. </para><para>The fact is that being reasonable and not introducing unwarranted changes is not something that we have come to expect from banking in this country. We can be sure that, with this sort of change, when you open the door they will use every capacity to try to make sure they keep that door open and use it to great effect. That has been the experience in this area where you have had changes and scope for fee increases. Look at the increase we have seen in fees just in this case under the current system—some 250 per cent since 1995, just with this type of fee. When you look at the situation with fees overall, right across the board with banking, you know that they have a very different view of what is unreasonable or unwarranted.</para><para>I am not convinced by the guarantees from the banks. I am not convinced from the wording of that particular recommendation from the committee that what we are going to see is a situation where rural and regional communities get a fair go. I think we are in real danger now of seeing a divide developing—a divide that will mean that it is more expensive than it should be for people in those sorts of communities. I want to make it very clear: the Labor Party will not stand by and let this occur. Other parties have to look at their positions on this, but they can be very clear that we will not stand by and let this happen. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>25645</page.no><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JENKINS</name><name.id>HH4</name.id><electorate>Scullin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In rising to speak in this debate on <inline ref="R1975">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2003-2004</inline>, I indicate my support for the second reading amendment moved by our spokesperson which talks about the government and its budget, the waste and mismanagement of the budget and the wrong priorities that have resulted in a Medicare safety net that does not protect families from increasing health costs and declining levels of bulk-billing. I have had the opportunity to talk about this phenomenon in my local area, where we see a decline in the levels of bulk-billing and an increase in the number of people who are attending the accident and emergency centre of the Northern Hospital. Something in excess of 60 per cent of attendances there are categories 4 and 5, which could be dealt with by general practitioners if they were available. Part of the reason that people attend the hospital is the lack of after-hours services by GPs, the low level of GPs in the outer suburban area that I represent and the fact that there is a decline in the levels of bulk-billing.</para></talk.start><para>The second point in the second reading amendment was on inadequate funding and higher fees for students seeking access to higher education. This debate occurs at a time when one of the local universities servicing the northern suburbs of Melbourne, La Trobe University, has indicated that it will increase its HECS fees by 25 per cent. This is making it harder for people, at a crucial time in their lives, to make the decision to go forward and take the opportunity that tertiary education gives them. It is no use saying that because of the way the HECS system works they are able to defer the payment. These people know that at the end of their course they are going to have an increased level of indebtedness that they are going to have to work off during their lifetime, which is an impediment to their decision to go forward to tertiary education.</para><para>The third item is the growing number of families who are financially squeezed in trying to balance work and family. In the outer suburbs of Melbourne this is clearly identified by the way in which people are feeling the squeeze of trying to establish their family home, juggle their responsibilities with family and, at the same time, stay in employment—often where they have to travel long distances, because a lack of local infrastructure to support them is getting to a crucial stage. </para><para>The last item in the second reading amendment is the 500,000 Australians waiting up to five years to get their teeth fixed. I have had the opportunity to talk about the need for the Commonwealth's involvement in a dental health scheme on a number of occasions. As each day goes by it is clear that there could be great advantage brought about if the Commonwealth were to decide to enter into a partnership with the state and territory governments and community organisations that are working in this field to ensure that we can get back to a negligible waiting list, as we saw when the Commonwealth Dental Health Scheme was in existence.</para><para>Today, I want to use the opportunity provided by this wide-ranging debate on these appropriation bills to talk about the way we discuss public issues in the Australian parliament. I want to illustrate this by using four examples of current issues being discussed to indicate not only the ways in which the parliament could display its strengths but also the weaknesses in the way we deal with things. I want to try to suggest ways we can improve parliamentary discussion of important issues. The first item I want to mention is the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD: <inline font-style="italic">Intelligence on Iraq'</inline><inline font-style="italic">s weapons of mass de</inline><inline font-style="italic">struction.</inline> As an aside, I am pleased that the committee's secretary is in the chamber at the moment and I congratulate her on her involvement in this report. This is an important example of the way in which this parliament can work at its finest.</para><para>Subsequent to the report being released, I am yet to be convinced that it is being handled in a proper way. I was a little disappointed that only half an hour was available for discussion of this during Monday's private members' business. That is no reflection on those who allocate the time, but it illustrates my point. Especially in this case, when there are four members of the House of Representatives who are members of the committee, they should have been given a longer time than five or ten minutes to talk about it in the chamber. I hope that we get an opportunity as a parliament to discuss the contents of the report, because the items that this report covers are very important. They are not only important for the historical basis of the government's decision to involve Australian troops in Iraq but also, as I have had the opportunity to say before, as an example of public policy decision making and the way in which a government portrays the information it has and uses as the basis for a decision, which then leads—if it is not done carefully—to a distrust of the way in which those decisions are made.</para><para>It is really about the political scenario that the government used to, in a way, pick the items which were available to it that it wished to latch onto. The other elements go to more rigorous investigation and examination of the information available. But most importantly it goes to the way in which that information was used in justifying to the community decisions that the government made. If on this occasion, as I believe, this information was used to the extent that decisions were brought forward long before they really had to be made, there is a large part of the public that then, on that basis, asks, `Why would we in future believe any of the decisions that a government makes to commit troops overseas?' I hope that as a parliament we get an opportunity to more fully discuss this report.</para><para>The second item I wish to reflect upon is the US free trade agreement. It will not surprise members that I approach this with a great deal of caution, right down to the fact that I would be much happier if we were actually talking about a fair trade agreement with the United States. That perhaps gives a hint about the angle that I come from. That is perhaps not the majority view of the Australian parliament. I am not sure that it is the majority view of the Australian Labor Party. But I will simply keep up the fight. I think it is an angle from which we have to approach these problems and from which we can improve our best interest in dealing with our trading partners and opponents. </para><para>My beef about the United States free trade agreement is that, in the two to three weeks since the late Australian time that this was settled upon, (a) we have not seen the detail of the document and (b) there has not been a proper discussion by the parliament about the free trade agreement. Critics will say that I am being unfair because when this appears magically after being legally scrubbed—or whatever the technical terms are for the state that it is in at the moment—it will be going to the committee systems of the parliament, and that should suffice. But I believe this is a situation in which there should have been a ministerial statement and in which there should have been a debate.</para><para>Since this agreement has been cobbled together into its final state there have been 17 questions without notice, including three today from the opposition. But before today there were 14, four of which came from the opposition and 10 from government members. At the end of the day, those 10 are dorothy dixers. Within the limitations of the standing orders—and again I do not wish to reflect upon decisions made by people about the legitimacy of questions under the standing orders—they are used to elicit an angle, to allow the Minister for Trade to get up and give the government's spin and angle.</para><para>Instead of that government spin and angle about this free trade agreement there should have been an announcement by way of a ministerial statement in the parliament about the government's view on the agreement. That would have led to a response by the opposition and perhaps somewhere down the track a fuller discussion by members of both houses about the intent of the agreement. I am surprised that this has not occurred if we are to believe the government when they say that this is an important agreement. If it is so important, it should have been subject to a discussion and a debate.</para><para>As I have said, the fact that these matters are not sufficiently discussed is a flaw in the way in which we deal with them. This is something that perhaps should have had fuller discussion during the negotiations. There were a lot of views about. I do not think it is an unhealthy prospect that in a parliamentary democracy like ours there should be a divergence of views. I note that the government seems to want to fit the opposition in its view about the free trade agreement by indicating that it is motivated by pure anti-Americanism and things like that.</para><para>It has been clear from the outset that the Leader of the Opposition has said that he wants to look at this agreement with Australia's best interests in view. It is pretty hard to do that when you do not have the detail of the agreement. Having said that, I think we have been fairly consistent in the view that we have about this agreement—that it should be viewed in that way. One of the shortcomings—because of the things that have been in and out, the things that are at the edges and the timetables that are used in some sectors—is whether it is a comprehensive trade agreement, which is a necessity if we are going to have a bilateral agreement.</para><para>The third issue that I wish to raise—and I wish to express a great disappointment about the way in which the parliament has been treated in this case—is the Treasurer's statement of last week about Australia's demographic challenges. I honestly do not know where he delivered his address—that is only because I have not done the proper research—but what I know is that it was not done in the parliament. And if this is such an important issue, as perhaps quite rightly the Treasurer has flagged, then this place is the venue where this should have been discussed. </para><para>Whilst I note that a couple of the papers that were released at the address allow for public discussion, this address clearly could have been a ministerial statement. Again, there has been a missed opportunity to use the venue that the parliament provides for the proper discussion. If it was good enough for the Treasurer to release his <inline font-style="italic">Intergenerational Report</inline> at the time of the 2002-03 budget and if this is a work in progress that arises from that, it should have come in to the parliament. As I understand it, none of these documents that were released last week have become parliamentary papers. They actually have no status within the parliamentary procedures, and this is a great disappointment. I would love to have the opportunity directly, not through asides during this debate, to give my comments about the lack of direction that I think these documents show about Australia's demographic challenges and to properly debate the meagre propositions that the Treasurer has put forward as solutions: the notion that we should work till we drop and things like that. This is an issue that should be debated. It should have been presented as a ministerial statement; the papers should be parliamentary papers that are open to discussion.</para><para>Finally, the fourth thing I want to raise to illustrate my disappointment about the way in which the parliament is not being used properly is to touch upon Indigenous health. The week before last, the Australians for Native Title and Reconciliation held a conference about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health. The Indigenous health rights campaign launch I think was on 18 February. Directly, my interest in this arises from my membership of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs when it produced its report, <inline font-style="italic">Health is life</inline><inline font-style="italic">:</inline><inline font-style="italic">a report on the inquiry into Indigenous health</inline>. At the time, we wanted to make sure that this was the last time that there was a need for such a report and that we set out the basis for the way in which Australia could go forward with its Indigenous people to improve the health of those Indigenous people. </para><para>When this committee inquiry was launched there was some suspicion that it was an attempt in some way to be negative about what was going on with a clear inference that perhaps there had been excessive expenditure which had drawn little results in the improvement of Indigenous people's health. Clearly, our inquiry showed that the additional amount of money that is spent on the health of Indigenous Australians is actually meagre when compared to non-Indigenous Australians. At the ANTaR launch two weeks ago, the AMA's 2003 report card says that the level of health spending for Indigenous people is 22 per cent higher than for non-Indigenous people, but the need is 200 per cent greater. Really it is not surprising given the state of Indigenous Australian's health that there would be an additional amount being placed at the disposal of those charged with improving the health of Indigenous people. But it is minor; that amount is minor compared to the need. We really have to face up to that.</para><para>After the committee's report <inline font-style="italic">Health is life</inline> in May 2000, it disappointed me to read the speeches and papers delivered at the Indigenous health launch on 18 February. There was a speech, for instance, by the AMA President Dr Bill Glasson that says things like, `We should ask ourselves why Indigenous Australians are admitted to hospital at twice the rate of non-Indigenous people?' He said in his speech:</para><quote><para>I believe all Australians should ask the question why one group of people in our community faces a health reality worse than people in many third world countries. </para></quote><para>In their report card, there is a graph, and it shows the relationship between the percentage of the Australian population as a whole expected to live to age 65 and the percentage of Aboriginal Australian males and Aboriginal Australian females expected to live to age 65. The figures for Aboriginal people are below the figures for people in countries such as Nigeria, Nepal, Bangladesh, India, Thailand and Vietnam. I seek leave to incorporate the graph in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The graph read as follows—</inline></para><para><graphic href="p73640000001.jpg"></graphic></para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>HH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JENKINS</name></talker><para>—I thank the honourable member for Wannon. In these brief remarks about Indigenous health today—I owe it to a lot of people that helped the committee's inquiry three or four years ago to return to these items—I make the point that my disappointment is that we do not discuss this issue enough in these venues, whether it be the Main Committee, the main chamber or the Senate. This is something which should always be in the eyes of the Australian parliament. The report of the committee in 2000 suggested that there be annual reporting to the parliament. The reason for this was deliberate: it was so that these facts would be in our faces as legislators so that we could not ignore them.</para></talk.start></continue><para>When you look at the facts on the AMA report card, you see that diabetes is eight times higher, respiratory conditions are four times higher and circulatory conditions are three times higher for Aboriginal Australians than they are for the rest of the population. The life expectancy of Indigenous Australians is still 20 years less than it is for non-Indigenous Australians. When we compare that figure to the figure for comparable countries, such as the United States and New Zealand, we see that the gap is only five to seven years. And they believe that they have a problem. They understand that that is not good enough. But why is there such a disparity? Why is there a disparity of something like 15 years in the outcomes?  </para><para>We need to make sure we have discussions about how we can best improve the way in which Indigenous communities can best deal with these problems. This has to be a partnership. We cannot let the events of a couple of weeks back in Redfern cloud our judgment about the ability of Indigenous communities to deal with these issues. When they put forward their view about what is required, we need to listen to them and we need to act upon those suggestions. When people come forward, like at the launch of ANTaR, we should listen to them and work with people who are working in the area to make sure that we improve the things that deal directly not only with health but also proper housing, access to employment and, most importantly, their sense of belonging and their sense of grievance for past acts. That is one of the conditions that needs to be addressed. In other countries it has been addressed and there are indications that it has led to improved health outcomes. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>25650</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Byrne, Michelle, MP</name><name role="display">Ms O'BYRNE</name><name.id>84S</name.id><electorate>Bass</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is with a heavy heart that I rise today to speak on <inline ref="R1975">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2003-2004</inline> and <inline ref="R1976">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2003-2004</inline> and <inline ref="R1977">Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2003-2004</inline> and associated legislation and to outline the past eight years of this government's charter, which has included much wastage which has been covered up by even more fibbing. </para></talk.start><para>There are significant opportunities now to build a community that provides greater prospects for all its members. But the reality is that this government continues to augment the growing divide between the priorities on this side of the House and those on the other. In my electorate of Bass the constituents that I have are concerned about the issues that affect their daily lives—the issues that this government continues to sweep under the mat through its refusal to treat them as significant. These issues are appropriate access to health care, access to education, access to appropriate employment, access to a high standard of aged care, as well as looking after the environment, safety in the home and community and being able to properly care and provide for their own families. </para><para>At the beginning of this year a Roy Morgan research poll of Australians showed that the divide between Australia's richest and poorest was continuing to grow—a trend the Australian Council of Social Services believes is related to rising levels of crime and disparities in literacy and other basic life skills. When these results were published, ACOSS President Andrew McCallum said: </para><quote><para>The rich-poor divide should not be made worse by the major political parties using the budget surplus and a federal election to offer some voters a tax cut. This would mean the poorest people in this country—those who don't have a job—will get no benefit from a cut. At the same time the capacity of our national government to address urgent problems in health, education and welfare would be reduced.</para></quote><para>He suggested that it would be of much greater benefit to turn around this divide in more practical ways, such as using the budget surplus to help low- and middle-income families by improving the family tax benefit system, to get help to those people who need it most; use it to improve the value of rent assistance for jobless people and reduce the impact of housing related poverty; to increase the opportunities for job training, whether through increased TAFE and university places or through greater real work opportunities; to enhance universal health care services such as bulk-billing for a doctor; or for equal access to education. </para><para>These types of solutions are sensible solutions to problems that are significant to the people of Bass and the people of Australia. These are, in fact, the types of solutions that the government itself had identified previously in its work and family policy documents, which have recently been discovered in leaked cabinet documents—documents that the government is now seeking to cover up. They are solutions that were discarded by a government more interested in spending much-needed money for social services on increased defence capability and security measures—a decision that has only served to destroy the government's credibility and highlight its disregard for the Australian people.</para><para>However, these solutions included things like more flexible working arrangements for women returning to the work force from parental leave, and addressing the hardship created by inconsistencies in the family benefits system. But instead the government chose to allow families to continue to fend for themselves, while the Prime Minister played cowboys and Indians in the United States. While the Prime Minister has been off playing deputy sheriff, he has left his ministers home alone—and oh, dear, what a mess they have made while they have been left alone.</para><para>The government's ministers have succeeded in utter mismanagement and waste of funds in all essential services. They have succeeded in reprioritising what should be the government's agenda—that is, the insurance of the wellbeing of all Australians. The Minister for Health and Ageing, when he speaks about health, has gone one step further towards completely destroying access to health care services, while the Minister for Education, Science and Training has managed to further alienate Australian students who have worked hard for a place in a university—not to mention the Minister for Ageing, who it appears has great difficulty finding anybody who will play nice with her.</para><para>The latest bulk-billing figures were released recently and again show a drop in the percentage of people who are able to access a bulk-billing doctor. The national average has now dropped a further 3.1 per cent to 66.5 per cent, and in Bass it is sitting now at 43.6 per cent—the lowest in Tasmania. If the government really believes that its MedicarePlus policy will have any benefit for providing appropriate health care services then it is even more out of touch than anyone could have previously thought. The MedicarePlus policy will do nothing to solve falling bulk-billing rates. Bulk-billing rates have been failing consistently under this government, and everything it does completely undermines getting access to a doctor. This policy further takes away the universality of the Medicare system and discriminates against those not in the lowest socioeconomic group. It will advance a two-tiered arrangement, where people will fall through the cracks, unable to access any type of health service.</para><para>It is not good enough that the government continues on its path to create two-tiered systems in all our basic services—systems that only lead to further increases in the divisions between the richest and the poorest in our communities. Another developing two-tiered system is the education system, a system where wealthier families are able to buy places in universities while the number of HECS places for the not so wealthy families, whose children have worked hard through their secondary school years to earn a place on merit but miss out because of decreases in funded places, has declined. </para><para>However, the government has assured us all that there was a definite increase in the number of places, and in fact says it increased the number of places at the University of Tasmania by 1,003. It appears that it is a little confused here. If the government funded an extra 1,003 places at the University of Tasmania, how does that explain the fact that the number of students who missed out on a place this year was 1,606, compared to the 1,416 students who missed out on a place last year? By most calculations, this is actually an increase of 190 students—or 13.4 per cent—who missed out. It seems that the government has been tricking us and has not really created an extra 1,003 new places but has reallocated existing places that were previously funded on the cheap. The government has a dismal record in education policy. It has no commitment to ensuring talented students have access to affordable education. Its only education commitment is towards a user pays system—a system that destroys the opportunity unless you can pay for it.</para><para>Of course access to a university education, while important, is not a priority for everyone, and in Bass there are many more people who are concerned because they cannot get access to TAFE courses and appropriate job training courses. Even in an environment where there are significant identified skill shortages, many younger people cannot get into skills based training because the government simply refuses to fund the appropriate training facilities.</para><para>The government also continues to prop up the Job Network system despite it being a significantly flawed financial model that the minister and the government continue to throw even more money at in an attempt to bail it out. The Job Network continues to fail the long-term unemployed, and data collected through the Department of Family and Community Services shows that the number of people who have been unemployed for more than a year is up by almost 6,000 since November last year. In Bass the unemployment figures are currently sitting at nine per cent. How does the government expect to help people back into the work force when it continues to slash labour market programs by $1 billion a year? How can we be expected to trust the government to assist unemployed people if it continues to do a slash and burn program on all the programs that are in place to help them?</para><para>The other area causing major concern in my electorate is that of aged care. We look forward to the elusive Hogan report into aged care services—the report commissioned by the government, the report that has so far cost $7.2 million, but the report that the minister refuses to release. Interestingly, today, Professor Hogan, the author of the report has started to talk about it himself, probably getting fed up with the government not doing it. In Bass, aged care services are in trouble. There are currently 11 aged care services in the north-east and the providers hold grave fears that if the government funding is not increased then many of these services will simply not be able to remain operational.</para><para>These services are telling me that there is a real danger that many Tasmanian services will have to close their doors because they are not able to remain financial under the current subsidies. It is not just closing businesses; it is closing people's homes. In Tasmania, service providers have identified issues like funding equalisation as significant because it essentially means that the funding for Tasmanian aged care services will continue to decrease in order to bring the national funding level into line. It is not a bad idea to have a national funding adjustment but it should be done so that states are not disadvantaged. It is not a viable option when the subsidy rates in one state are decreased leading to a significant difficulty in maintaining the current standards. </para><para>These reductions are really hurting aged care services in Tasmania. They are impacting on the ability of services to not only maintain the level of care they are renowned for but also to simply survive. This is a point that has been further compounded by the decisions by the Salvation Army to sell off 15 of its 19 aged care services across Australia and the Seventh Day Adventist Church to sell its two services in Tasmania. These are decisions that have caused great distress to organisations that have done excellent jobs in the provision of a high standard of aged care over the years but which now say that they can no longer viably and with good conscience provide such services. The Seventh Day Adventist Church has already sold its services to the Presbyterian Church, which continues to provide services to its residents. The Salvation Army is now in negotiations with prospective buyers for Tyler Village, which provides a home for 75 residents and employment for 85 staff in Launceston.</para><para>With such organisations saying that the system is unmanageable, what hope is there for a robust future for the aged care industry under this government? The government also has to stop treating older people like second-class citizens. The services that the government is refusing to fund appropriately are people's homes; they are part of their lives. The government must stop its dehumanisation of older people and release the report into aged care services so that it can start engaging in the debate about the best way to appropriately fund and manage aged care services, not about the best way to get out of it.</para><para>Let us be frank: why stop at older the people? This government really has to stop its complete disinterest in anyone who cannot directly contribute to its election coffers. Take the treatment of essential services in regional Australia as a point in case. The government recently saw it as necessary to close the Launceston Bureau of Meteorology because it was apparently not cost-effective. However, an unexpected community outcry saw it making policy on the run again and it decided at the same time to suddenly open a shopfront experiment in order to pacify the locals and stop the community backlash about the loss of more regional services and more regional jobs. What is really interesting is that in estimates, only three days before, the bureau made no mention of any future plan to set up a shopfront. Yet, after severely underestimating the reaction that such a closure would have in Launceston, they have suddenly announced plans that were apparently on the agenda for a very long time.</para><para>This decision has been made in order to satisfy the reported 15 per cent funding cut across the board, at least in Tasmania, that the government has enforced—cuts that are part of an ongoing budgetary squeeze by the government, which includes refusals to fund staff pay rises or even supplement pay rises cuts that have seen the bureau's budget dwindling ever lower since they were forced to take action, in this case, to downsize services or, as Dr Love called it in estimates, `de-man.' Based on this, the government must be asked how it can justify or clarify its $27 million fit-out for the bureau's Melbourne head office as a cost-effective measure, while the salaries for three positions in a regional weather office are not.</para><para>I am told that the bureau had no consultation with the Launceston office about its decision to centralise services in Hobart. It was a decision made at a management level for an economic reason and a decision that in turn significantly increases the workload in the Hobart office. Staff down there have not been consulted, so they do not know how they will provide the service either.</para><para>How will the government ensure that the local weather information accessed by the Launceston community, such as farmers or the local winemaker who calls the office each year to discuss the forward forecast at length, remains? The winemaker plans his grape picking schedule by this forecast. What about the marine industry, the professional fishers, the builders and the myriad outdoor occupations that rely on the quality daily contact they have with the Launceston office? How will these professionals have access to the same standard of service from an overworked, overloaded and unconsulted team based in Hobart with very limited local knowledge? Professional meteorologists are telling me that replacing people with automatic instruments is not the answer. Instruments cannot report visibility or the extent of mist or fog and they cannot identify cloud types or distinguish between sea state and swell height. </para><para>This decision should not be based purely on economics; it should also be assessed as a significant safety issue, as well as an industrial issue. And while the government has said it will create two new positions at the shopfront service, it has said that the current staff who hold their jobs and have held them for some time will have to reapply for those jobs, because it refuses to transfer them over. It is unfortunate that, as an economic issue, the government is assessing the future of the Bureau of Meteorology, particularly because of the impact on regional areas. The Launceston office was first, but I understand that there are in fact plans to possibly shed up to another 140 jobs across all the regional weather bureaus. This type of action would be a terrible blight on regional areas not only in terms of the loss of employment in regions but also because of the loss of essential regional services—services that should not be centralised to the nearest capital city.</para><para>Another example of how this government carries out its consultative processes is the National Airspace System. This is a system that has been one calamity after another, and I am sure members are aware that I have followed this quite closely. It is a completely inappropriate system for Australia's airspace. It was introduced with no consideration of industry concerns. It is missing vital safety information and there has been no appropriate training or assessment for pilots. The National Airspace System has essentially turned Australia's airspace into what has been described as an unprecedented unsafe operating environment culminating in what was a serious near miss in the airspace above Launceston on Christmas Eve last year.</para><para>This incident lead to a review of the system by the government's own Transport Safety Bureau, which found that the National Airspace System posed a safety risk and recommended a review. It has also led to the announcement yesterday that AirServices Australia is planning on moving a transportable radar unit to Launceston to assist Melbourne based air traffic controllers and to increase aircraft surveillance over Tasmania. This system is normally stored in Melbourne, but is to be kept operational in Launceston because under the current airspace system with the type and volume of commercial and general aviation traffic, the airspace in Tasmania has become unsafe. However, if someone else's machine breaks down, the Launceston machine will be moved to go and fix up someone else's airspace, which means we return the Launceston air space to being very dangerous once again.</para><para>It is frightening that the minister and the government are prepared to put public safety ahead of their stubborn determination to implement such a system. It is a determination which saw the minister convene industry advisory groups consisting only of those people prepared to share his point of view. The Howard government's cost-cutting agenda is dangerous and raises the question of how we can more effectively leverage regional development through the deployment of more government agencies to regional Australia. It also raises the issue of how the government can use its capital assets spend of some $60 billion a year to benefit regional Australia. </para><para>As a major purchaser of goods and services, the government currently promotes national competitive advantage and Australian and New Zealand industry development. I believe it is time for government procurement policies to be broadened to encompass regional Australia. The government notes that there is a `critical strategic role that government procurement plays within the Australian community.' The rhetoric is not supported by specific procurement policies to assist regional communities. As we know, regional centres are well known for offering cost-effective accommodation options, innovative small business, stability in the work force—and I must say that $27 million will get you an awful lot of office accommodation in Launceston. </para><para>The government publishes contracts and standing offers with a value of $2,000 or more—and I note that the Department of Finance and Administration publish some extremely high-level statistics which are drawn from this data. I would like to suggest that the Department of Finance and Administration publish statistics on the amount of government purchasing which is actually sourced from suppliers based in regional Australia.</para><para>Procurement is being seen as a strategic business tool within the private sector, but not by the Howard government. A more strategic focus on government procurement can result in significant benefits to the Australian community. In fact, every one per cent saving that can be made results in a $600 million benefit. Let us not forget the inefficiencies that exist and the benefits that can accrue from improved procurement practices. While industry is struggling with the cost of tendering in large procurement projects, we are still focused on simplistic initiatives such as putting tenders on the Internet. It seems the Howard government is still struggling with that.</para><para>After multiple false starts, the National Office of the Information Economy is struggling to get agency support with the latest AusTender initiative. How can we deal with the big-ticket issues when the basics are so hard for this government? Surely we have to move towards establishing an office of strategic procurement to streamline processes and to look for opportunities to maximise the benefit being derived from government procurement.</para><para>There is a general failing when it comes to the government spending taxpayers' money. How many examples do we need? Here is another one. How about the Customs Integrated Cargo System, a $100 million blow-out? Even with grant funds, the Howard government just cannot get it right. The government plundered a significant amount of funds through its Networking the Nation program. Many projects are not sustainable and not delivering long-term benefits, through sheer poor management by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. Let us be absolutely clear on the poor management of these programs. ANAO audit report No. 12 2003-04 stated that the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts failed to `translate the government's program objectives into operational objectives that would have helped to establish an appropriate performance management framework to monitor the efficiency and effectiveness of program delivery'. ANAO found that the extent of the increase in telecommunications infrastructure development in regional areas would be difficult to demonstrate because no baseline data was collected at the start of the program and so no targets were set.</para><para>Let us highlight the failed Intelligent Island Program that the Howard government trotted out to ensure the passage of the Telstra first tranche. The Tasmanian ICT industry has been conned, jilted and spat out by this government. I have had a constant stream of constituents presenting case after case where the Intelligent Island management has led them up the proverbial garden path, wasting their time and money and with no intention of ever assisting them—just stringing them along. The $40 million allocated to this program would have been better augmented by Commonwealth investment in the Tasmanian Electronic Commerce Centre. We may then have had a sustainable program, a program which could have expanded nationally to provide assistance to other regions right around Australia. But of course the Howard government did not have the foresight, despite the efforts of many to convince them that the Intelligent Island Program was, frankly, not that intelligent. So we are now faced with an Intelligent Island basket case, which people are running around trying to salvage. At least the meagre amounts of funds provided to the Intellinc initiative appear to have been placed in competent hands. </para><para>This government has had eight years of fibbing and eight years of wasting. Where there is waste, there is a nice little web of intrigue wrapped around it to cover it up. But it is the Australian people who have been the victims of this charade being masked as governance. The Australian people have been the victims of this government's malady of a reverse Robin Hood syndrome, a syndrome that sees it uncontrollably take from the poor and give to the rich. It is time this government sought assistance for its condition and started to address the myriad problems it has created and the projects it has impaired rather than continue with its agenda of more wastage and more fibs.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>25656</page.no><name role="metadata">Gillard, Julia, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GILLARD</name><name.id>83L</name.id><electorate>Lalor</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I take this opportunity in the wide-ranging debate on the <inline ref="R1975">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2003-2004</inline>, the <inline ref="R1976">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2003-2004</inline> and the <inline ref="R1977">Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2003-2004</inline> to firstly raise an issue of great concern to my electorate of Lalor. It is an issue that members of the House would have heard me raise on a number of occasions—some might suggest on so many that they are perhaps a bit bored with it. But it is an important issue. That issue is of course the future of the Point Cook RAAF base, which is within my electorate. A very important announcement was made on Sunday about the Point Cook RAAF base by the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence, the member for McEwen, Ms Fran Bailey. After years of community campaigning, the Howard government has agreed that Point Cook will remain in Commonwealth ownership and that its day-to-day management will be put in the hands of a trust composed of aviation and heritage groups—including the Point Cook Action Group, Point Cook Operations Ltd, a not-for-profit company which was formed specifically with the intention of becoming a manager of the site, and the National Trust—so that this very special place can be managed in the long term, in keeping with its heritage values and its very great history.</para></talk.start><para>The announcement on Sunday has delighted the local community and those who have fought long and hard to see this sort of outcome for Point Cook. I think it is important to remind ourselves that Point Cook is a truly historic site, a site of national significance. As you may be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, Point Cook is the oldest airstrip in the world that is still functioning as an airstrip. It has many of its original features, including hangars and heritage listed buildings. It was established in 1913 as the Central Flying School, and the airstrip has been in continuous use ever since. It is therefore the birthplace of the RAAF and a place of international significance, as the oldest airstrip in the world still being used as an airstrip. When we talk about the Central Flying School being started at Point Cook in 1913, it is important that we get some perspective about that, because we need to remember that in terms of aviation history the first ever flight with a person on board took place on 17 December 1903. So a mere 10 years after man's first venture with flight, Point Cook was operating a flying school, and planes have been flying from there ever since. </para><para>Apart from having history around the length of aviation service, it is the birthplace, as I have said, of the Australian Flying Corps and the Royal Australian Air Force. It was the departure point for the first north-south and east-west crossings of the continent by air and for the first aerial circumnavigation of the continent. Recognising its historic nature, Point Cook is home to both the RAAF museum and the RAAF chapel. With a site of this significance, which has continuously been in Commonwealth ownership, one would have thought that its future, that preserving its history, would always have been at the forefront of the Commonwealth's mind, but unfortunately that has not been the case. It was determined in 1997, as part of the Defence Efficiency Review and the Defence Force Reform Program that Point Cook was to be sold, that it was to move from Commonwealth ownership.</para><para>When I was elected to this parliament in 1998, being aware of the importance of the Point Cook site to the local community, I immediately sought a briefing from representatives of the then Defence Estates Organisation on what was proposed for the future of Point Cook. As we hunched over maps of the site, I was told that, from the point of view of the Defence Estates Organisation, whilst the RAAF museum would continue to operate from the site and whilst they would carve out a heritage precinct that had to be respected, as far as they were concerned, a freehold purchaser of the site would be able to do whatever they wanted to do with the remainder of the site. When I specifically asked them whether that would include closing the site so that it could no longer be used for aviation, they said that that would be all right. When I specifically asked them whether it would be possible for the site to be used for housing development, they said that that would be all right. When I specifically asked them whether it would be possible for the site to be used for industrial development, they said that that would be all right. So, from the point of view of the Howard government at that stage, they were contemplating a future where the oldest operational airstrip in the world would no longer be an airstrip, where the RAAF museum could end up marooned in a sea of housing or incompatible industrial development, and where thereafter the RAAF museum would have been limited to static displays of planes because it would not have been able to engage in heritage aviation and it would no longer have been situated at an operating airfield.</para><para>Having received that brief, I was rightly appalled. I found that in my local community, in the heritage community across Australia and in the aviation community across Australia, people were as appalled as me and I found that there was already in train a community campaign to try to ensure that Point Cook stayed in the ownership of the Commonwealth, that it was managed in a way which was always compatible with its heritage values and that it operated as an airstrip.</para><para>The depth of that community campaign can be shown by the fact that quite quickly more than 10,000 signatures were assembled on a petition which I was able to table in the House. In my capacity as local member I brought together the groups that were interested in the future of Point Cook and they were quite quickly able to agree on a vision whereby Point Cook was managed by a not-for-profit company formed by aviation enthusiasts and former members of the RAAF. The vision of that not-for-profit company—Point Cook Operations Ltd—was to have Point Cook managed in the long term as an aviation heritage, tourist and educational precinct. This would build on its strengths, its heritage value, its aviation value, the fact that the RAAF Museum is located there and the fact that flight training was occurring from Point Cook then, and continues to occur there now through RMIT. That was the vision that people were prepared to very actively campaign for.  </para><para>I should note the following individuals as people who have put in huge service to this community campaign: Mark Pilkington, who has led the Point Cook Action Group, the preservation society that has always had at the forefront of its activities ensuring that Australia did not lose this historic asset for all time; Peter Scully; Gary Westley; and Brad Owens. Each of them contributed to Point Cook Operations Ltd and to bringing its vision of the site together. Each of them, particularly Peter Scully, contributed to very active lobbying of members of parliament to ensure that people understood the true significance of Point Cook.</para><para>If members are ever passing through or are in the vicinity of my electorate of Lalor—they are welcome, as long as I know they are there and what they are doing!—one of the things they should do is visit the RAAF Museum. They should meet there my friend Dave Gardner, who is the director of the museum, and they should take the opportunity to experience the history that lives and breathes all around you when you are at Point Cook. I say congratulations to each of the people who has been in a leadership role in this community campaign. Their work saw fruit on Sunday when the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence agreed that this community campaign had had the right idea all along and that Point Cook should be kept in Commonwealth ownership and should be leased for the longer term to a trust. Active in that trust will be the stalwarts of this campaign: people from the Point Cook Action Group and people from Point Cook Operations Ltd, who will be able to manage the site over the longer term in a way that is compatible with its heritage and aviation values and builds on its strength as a tourist and educational precinct. That is a very important issue from the point of view of my electorate.</para><para>I now turn from a local good news story to something that is in no way a good news story, but I think it would be remiss of me in my capacity as shadow minister for health not to take this opportunity to make some comments on the Medicare issue. I want to talk particularly on the sham safety net, which is at the forefront of the health policy debate, particularly in these two sitting weeks. I think we are all aware that our colleagues in another place are presented with making decisions about the sham safety net in the coming sitting days. </para><para>I want to take members through what I think it is important to acknowledge in the debate about the sham safety net. From Labor's point of view, we think our challenge in the coming few weeks is to save Medicare from opposition. Of course Labor will save Medicare from government. We are used to getting into government and saving universal health systems that have been destroyed by conservative governments, but in the next few weeks we have set ourselves the task of saving Medicare from opposition. If we are to save Medicare, it is vital that the Senate rejects the health minister's political fix—the so-called safety net that is up for debate at the moment. The failure of the Howard government to attend to bulk-billing rates and ensure that specialist fees are fair and reasonable has meant that out-of-pocket costs are rising. </para><para>For the Howard government the sham safety net is the solution of choice. Why is that? Despite the fact that `safety net' are pleasant sounding words, this is yet another policy from the Howard government which is infected with its values and is another policy stepping stone on the path to the dismantling of Medicare. I want to take people through the absurd policy that this sham safety net is if you look at it in detail. First, we need to debunk the Howard government's spin about the benefits of the sham safety net. The truth is that, on the Howard government's own figures, only 220,000 families or individuals will benefit from the sham safety net in a year. I note that the Minister for Health and Ageing is actually even revising those figures downwards. Professor John Deeble, one of the architects of Medicare, has said, `A generous estimate of the percentage of Australians who will benefit is three per cent and it could well be closer to two per cent.' Professor Deeble also says that of those who could benefit half would be better off under current arrangements than under the sham safety net. Specifically, Professor Deeble has calculated that the safety net benefits under the Howard Government's proposal would exceed those under the current system only for services billed at more than 25 per cent over the scheduled fee. On the basis of current GP, specialist and diagnostic fees, this means that well over half of the 220,000 people who reach the threshold would be better off under the current arrangements rather than under the proposed new sham safety net. Professor Deeble says that the proposal to cover 80 per cent of actual fees without limit is effectively uncapped gap insurance, and he is right. This is an admission that the Howard government is both unwilling to increase benefits and unwilling to do anything to ensure specialist fees are fair and reasonable. </para><para>Who wins and who loses in this situation? We have 97 per cent of Australians getting nowhere near the sham safety net. Of the three per cent who notionally benefit, Professor Deeble says that 1.5 per cent are actually better off under current arrangements. An important point to note is that for the 97 per cent of Australians who do not get on the sham safety net, the situation does not remain neutral because it is those very Australians who will bear the impact of increased fees that occur because of the inflationary cycle started by the expectations of the sham safety net. All of the data from all around the world says that with these sham safety net arrangements there is a price inflation effect on doctors' fees and specialists' fees. The 97 per cent of Australians who do not get anywhere near the sham safety net are actually worse off because they end up being slugged for higher doctors' fees and higher specialists' fees. We have a sham safety net where 97 per cent of Australians lose and of the three per cent who are notionally better off, half are actually better off under current arrangements according to Professor Deeble, and it costs $266 million: A $266 million plan to make 97 per cent of Australians worse off and, at best, 1.5 per cent of Australians will benefit. Even talking about 1.5 per cent of Australians benefiting is misleading. You have to be $500 or $1,000 out of pocket before you can begin to benefit and who benefits is subject to all sorts of perverse and unfair outcomes.</para><para>Use of medical services is skewed. While most people have five or fewer consultations a year, a small number of people account for the vast majority of services. Of 220 million Medicare services in 2001-02, 81 per cent were for people who had 10 or more services in that year. A quarter was for people with 40 or more services. These people are much more likely to be poorer than those who saw the doctor only five times a year. The two categories chosen to receive the lower threshold—concession card status or receipt of family tax benefit A—are a poor measure of health need. After all, the family tax benefit system was set up to address another set of problems and issues entirely and there is considerable evidence that even health care cards are not an accurate measure of need. </para><para>The selection of these two categories particularly discriminates against those without dependent children and low-income individuals, while providing significant benefits to many higher income families. For example, a self-funded retiree couple of pension age earning up to $80,000 per annum is eligible for a health care card and hence for the $500 safety net, but a working couple without children earning the same amount will only be eligible for the $1,000 threshold. An individual working full-time earning $35,000 per annum who has a chronic medical condition will enter the safety net only after spending $1,000 out of their pocket, but a self-funded retiree of pension age earning up to $50,000 will qualify for the lower threshold.</para><para>The Howard government have managed to cook up a $266 million plan to at best benefit 1.5 per cent of Australians, and the tests that they have set up will not even pick the most disadvantaged 1.5 per cent. Then of course $72 million of the $266 million is wasted in administration costs. It is such a poor use of precious health dollars: $72 million gone in administration costs; 97 per cent of Australians lose out; 1.5 per cent who notionally gain would be better off under current arrangements; and 1.5 per cent notionally benefit—and they have picked the wrong 1.5 per cent.</para><para>All of these practical objections should be enough to stop this latest political patch-up job going through the Senate. But there is also a bedrock principle objection to this sham safety net. This sham safety net is all about distorting from a universal health system to a welfare system. It is all about enabling the Howard government to justify henceforth its failure to invest in Medicare, its unwinding of the Medicare system and its allowing of Medicare to wither and die. And it will do all of that under the cover of saying, `Don't worry. We have a sham safety net arrangement.' Ultimately, as the universal health system dies, we will end up with a health system like America's with private provision at the centre and sham safety net arrangements for people who are thought to be poor. And we know how badly those arrangements work in America. Anyone, including any senator, who professes a belief in Medicare cannot endorse this sham safety net arrangement. All it will do is assist the Howard government in destroying Medicare. In and of itself it benefits very few, has unfair outcomes and is a bureaucratic monster.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>25660</page.no><name role="metadata">Hatton, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HATTON</name><name.id>LN6</name.id><electorate>Blaxland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is good to see that the shadow minister for health is here.

I can only guess that this $14.3 million may or may not do anything to affect their situation—it may or may not improve it. We are given virtually no indication whatsoever. It is mentioned in passing in one line by the parliamentary secretary. If you go to the bill itself and its papers, there is no more information to elucidate what this is about. Since the government in particular brought in accrual accounting you can look at the bills and the background papers and weep at the prospect of finding any real or substantial information that you would be able to hand on to any constituent not only in my electorate but Australia wide. It is extremely difficult to get the information. </para><para>The government is asking for additional appropriations. There is the normal budget process. These extra appropriations are adjustments to those original expectations of the budget. We in this House are expected to blindly accept the few scraps of information that the government has given us and say, `They are budget measures; therefore they should simply be passed.' The government has not taken the time or made the effort—it has not demonstrated enough concern to inform me or the community at large about the nuts and bolts of what it is doing, which has a deliberate effect and impact on constituents in my electorate.</para><para>I will go in particular into the question of health services in Bankstown with regard to Australian Hearing and the experience of two of my constituents. I may then go to some other matters. There is an item of $21.4 million in assistance for the victims of the Bali terrorist attacks and their families and for meeting the costs of the investigations. We know what a wicked and cruel act it was for people to have their lives stripped away from them and for people who survived but had horrific injuries. All of us had the opportunity to be with their families at the anniversary commemorations in the Great Hall. This simple line says enough about why this sum of money is being set aside and provided. But in relation to most of the other measures there is very small and partial indication.</para><para>Let us go to the $14.3 million for hearing services and to the practical problems that are being faced in Bankstown by not just two of my constituents but also many more. Australian Hearing took the time to write politely to Mr Charles Garwood, the constituent concerned. He and his wife had this experience recently. Australian Hearing wrote on 5 December informing him:</para><quote><para>... Australian Hearing's Centre in Chapel Road Bankstown suffered severe damage when a hot water service burst. As the damage was extensive we had to relocate to new premises.</para></quote><para>They said specifically:</para><quote><para>You may have received other correspondence suggesting that Australian Hearing was no longer able to offer services to you at Bankstown. That is not the case. Australian Hearing is able to provide hearing services to you in your local area at any of our three new locations listed below including Bankstown.</para></quote><para>They indicated that these were at Chester Hill, Revesby and a new site, the Town Square Medical Centre in Bankstown Square, opposite Medicare. They apologised for the inconvenience and confusion.</para><para>What they did not tell my constituent in December 2003 but he found out, to his cost, in January 2004 is that the permanent facility that was damaged was replaced with a temporary facility. In 2003 the Bankstown centre was a permanent site for Australian Hearing, as was the Liverpool centre. When Mr Garwood had problems with his hearing aid he sought help from the Bankstown service. He had been told that those services would still be available but now he was told: `Things have changed. Now this is not a permanent centre; it is only here three days a week and we cannot fix the hearing aid on site. We can take the hearing aid from you and in eight to 10 days time, after it has been sent to Liverpool and back'—only seven kilometres or so away—`we will be able to give you the hearing aid back; or you can choose to go to Liverpool yourself to get it fixed.'</para><para>Mr Garwood, who I know extremely well, is a war veteran. That is the reason why he is eligible for this help. I will read to the House the experiences he and his wife had in trying to get the hearing aid fixed at Liverpool that day. His wife, Hilda, wrote: </para><quote><para>My husband aged 83 a War Veteran with a Hearing disability due to being blown up in a War Zone has their services—</para></quote><para>that is, those of Australian Hearing in Bankstown— </para><quote><para>He received a letter dated 5th Dec.03 which I enclose herewith. However the statement of hearing service in the local area is a MISNOMER. My Husband's hearing aid stopped functioning so we went on Friday the 23rd Jan.04 to Bankstown where we were told there is no such service here we are only a Medical Centre, however if you write your name and address and medical card Number and what is wrong with the hearing aid we will forward it to Liverpool and it will take 8-10 days, but if we were to go to Liverpool they would repair it straight away. </para></quote><para>That is completely different from the experience that they had. She further states: </para><quote><para>We decided to do that. It was a very hot day we went by train to Liverpool it was a long up hill walk to the Centre. They repaired his hearing aid in one and a half hours walk back to the station arriving in Bankstown it took from 10am to 4pm before we reached home totally exhausted am sure there are many more people in our age group needing this service in Bankstown. Surely it could be possible to have a repair service at least one day a week. </para></quote><para>I repeat that last sentence: `Surely it could be possible to have a repair service at least one day a week.' That is a reasonable thing to expect for Mr Charles Garwood, an 83-year-old veteran, and a reasonable thing to expect for his wife, Mrs Hilda Garwood, who went with him in order to get this fixed. Hilda Garwood has visited Liverpool before. She has been to Liverpool hospital. Charlie Garwood, her husband, went to Liverpool hospital time and time again when Hilda was there with a significant heart problem. I visited her there some time last year when she was there for a long period. She had a very significant condition which took her a long time to recover from. To have people in their 80s put out in that way is just not good enough. </para><para>When the permanent facility had been there for years, it is right and proper that not only the Garwoods but my other constituents could say, `If the old centre was destroyed, there should be a permanent centre for Bankstown.' It is not Woop Woop; it is the centre of Sydney. There are 180,000 people in the City of Bankstown—my electorate has 82,000, Daryl Melham's electorate has another 82,000, and there are more people as well. Bankstown is a central place in Sydney. It is easier for a lot of people to get to Bankstown than it is to get to Liverpool. They have had a situation where the permanent facility has been replaced with an inferior, temporary one. We have a high aged population in the electorate of Blaxland. Those people who have not had the experience of the Garwoods will no doubt find the same situation applies. </para><para>I made representations to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs with regard to this matter, attaching the letter from Mrs Garwood. I said, in part:</para><quote><para>To replace the Chapel Road Centre, the Australian Hearing Service three days a week occupies a small, claustrophobic room within the Bankstown Square Medical Centre. They provide a limited service, but have to send hearing aids elsewhere for repairs, taking up to ten days. </para></quote><para>If the $14.3 million here for changes to the hearing service model do not encompass changing from temporary to permanent the Bankstown centre, I suggest to the parliamentary secretary and the minister that that should be undertaken. The significant numbers of people who are disadvantaged by the current situation need to have that addressed. It is a big problem for older people. Both the Prime Minister and, more particularly, the Treasurer, recently seem to have discovered the question of an ageing Australia and the difficulties that that will incur for the government in a fiscal sense. But the real difficulties are faced by people day after day—not in 10 or 20 years time, but right now, day after day.  </para><para>If you do not have adequate and proper services it is very difficult for those people who are already, in this case, paying more than $30 a year for the maintenance of this equipment and who have the extra cost, not just monetary but also on their bodies—on their systems and their nerves—of having to go to that kind of trouble. It simply is not right.</para><para>It is not right that those Australians in my electorate of Blaxland who cannot afford adequate dental care are forced by this government to wait for up to five years to get that care. You will not find any provision of moneys in either the <inline ref="R1975">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2003-2004</inline> or the <inline ref="R1976">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2003-2004</inline> for that dental care. The reason for that is that this is a coalition set of appropriations. They wiped out any future moneys for dental care for the aged and people on pensions and beneficiaries when they concluded the four years of the Keating government program which put an extra $300 million or so into dental care for the aged. As an opposition we have pledged that we will put $300 million of new money towards addressing the very real health problems of Australians living in Blaxland and other electorates where they need the intervention of the Commonwealth government because they cannot get access to proper dental services.</para><para>Hearing and dental problems are two key difficulties for the aged. Anyone here in this room and anyone listening throughout Australia who has aged relatives or friends would understand the trauma that is caused to them through the loss of appropriate and adequate hearing and the difficulty it entails in terms of dealing with their everyday problems. People would also realise how significant it is for people to have dramatic dental problems that simply are not addressed because they do not have the money. The health impact upon those people who suffer is enormous. The final cost to the community, of course, is extremely significant.</para><para>If you let these problems build and do not either take preventative measures or have early intervention, dental problems can lead to dramatic problems which can, through abscesses that become extremely severe, occasion hospitalisation and the direct intervention of surgeons in order to fix those problems. I know that—I have seen it happen. I have been the victim of dental abscesses. The same problem has happened to my wife. If they get bad enough, you can be one or two days off dying if there is no intervention. I was lucky. In my personal experience, we were able to go and get direct intervention and ensure that we got the treatment that we needed. But there are many people who do not have that recourse.</para><para>That is why these appropriations should encompass moneys for more than 500,000 Australians who are on the waiting list and who can wait up to five years or more for appropriate intervention to fix their acute dental problems. These moneys are not here, because this government has not only contempt for us in terms of providing information but also utter contempt for all of those people on that waiting list, because it simply says to them, `It's a state matter—you can sit there and wait.' You can hope that you might get your problems fixed, but the federal government will take no direct approach to this.</para><para>The member for Werriwa, when addressing Labor's national conference in Darling Harbour, quite rightly took a copy of the Australian Constitution out of his pocket and referred to the section which directly says that both health and dental services are a direct responsibility of the federal government. That was why the Keating government was able to take direct action by supporting a four-year program to fix the problem the states did not have the capacity to fix. That is why it is right, proper and just that Labor has pledged to do so. The only hope, because of the heartlessness of this government, is the election of a Labor government to directly intervene to fix those problems. </para><para>Representing people in Bankstown, I know that we have had one service after another taken away from us. It does not really surprise me that the full and permanent service of Australian Hearing was converted to a temporary visiting service and that Liverpool has taken over. This government has a set against Bankstown, and it has a set against it primarily because the former Prime Minister was a boy from Bankstown, just like me. Our experience relates to not only the Australian Hearing Service but also the department of immigration, which was completely ripped out of Bankstown—one of the most multicultural areas in Australia. I know that we have a former shadow minister for immigration and also a former Minister for Veterans Affairs—someone who has visited the electorate of Blaxland, who knows how diverse that community is, and knows how crucial it is to have services where they are needed. You will not find those services in Bankstown now, because this government has ripped them out, just like they have taken away the permanent centre for Australian Hearing. You will not find the Australian Taxation Office in Bankstown now—that building is now inhabited by the state police because this government would not provide a full regional tax office, employing more than 650 people, in the City of Bankstown.</para><para>So I look forward to Labor coming back to government and I look forward to having services put back into Bankstown, into my electorate, and having appropriations—either budgetary or these extra appropriations—to directly service the people of Bankstown, who have been so badly dealt with by this government, which has treated them with utter contempt. It has done so for no reason other than the fact that the former member for Blaxland happened to be their representative and maybe, as a secondary issue, because I worked for him. What I can promise you is this: I trust that the representations that I have made on behalf of Mr and Mrs Garwood—which is just one example of the problems that people have faced with the rolling back of the permanent service of Australian Hearing in Bankstown to a temporary service—will be addressed by the appropriate minister and that it is put back into place, as it should be, so that all of those people in Bankstown who need that service can access it.</para><para>I hold out no hope whatsoever that this government, which has been appealed to time and time again, will restore full dental service to those 500,000 Australians who need it. I trust that the next Labor government will stick to its pledge with regard to that. If you look at the rest of these appropriations, which have been so poorly dealt with in terms of information, a Labor government will not only give the services back but it will explain why it is being done. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>25664</page.no><name role="metadata">Sciacca, Con, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SCIACCA</name><name.id>6J4</name.id><electorate>Bowman</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—<inline ref="R1975">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2003-2004</inline>, <inline ref="R1976">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2003-2004</inline> and <inline ref="R1977">Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2003-2004</inline> give members a forum to canvass the issues that are important to our constituents—issues which in many cases are being sadly neglected by this Howard government. I would particularly like to use this opportunity to place on the public record my continuing concern about the impact that this government's spending priorities—priorities that are dramatically out of kilter with those of the general community—is having on individuals and families living in my electorate of Bowman and, indeed, people around Australia. </para></talk.start><para>Almost two years ago, in his 2002 budget address, the Treasurer released the <inline font-style="italic">Intergenerational Report</inline>. He heralded the document as a landmark enabling the government to draft the budget, not simply with a view to achieving short- to medium-term policy goals but also in the context of the `challenges that lie ahead for our children, our society and our government'. It seems that when the government asked `What do we need to do now to prepare for generations ahead?' unlike the rest of the community, this government did not look at the report's prediction that aged care costs would rise from 0.7 per cent to 1.8 per cent of the GDP over the next 40 years, and that by 2031 the number of Australians aged 65 and over would increase from 12.7 per cent to 22.3 per cent of the population. They did not look at those staggering figures and think that health and aged care services are areas in need of immediate attention. As we saw with the Treasurer's speech last week, they finally realised that it is high time to re-examine pensions and superannuation in the context of our ageing society, but aged care seems to have been left way down the list of priorities.</para><para>The anecdotal evidence presented by my constituents, who continue to experience terrible difficulties trying to find a place for their elderly relatives in an appropriate aged care facility, is overwhelming. Their frustration is echoed by the service providers themselves. I recently met with Mr David Angell and Ms Anne Livingston of Aged Care Queensland, the peak industry body for aged and community care providers in Queensland. With members drawn from the residential, retirement living and community sectors, Aged Care Queensland has a comprehensive understanding of the issues confronting the aged care industry in Australia.</para><para>Mr Angell and Ms Livingston identified three crucial areas that need urgent government attention if the quality Australians demand of their aged care sector is to be preserved and the pressing issue of accessibility is to be addressed. Firstly, the industry believes that the Commonwealth Own Purpose Outlays formula, as it currently stands, does not reflect the real staffing and associated costs of operating aged care services. For example, wage compensation is only increased by the amount of the safety net adjustment, bearing no real relationship to wage fluctuations in the aged care sector. Under the current formula, aged care providers are being forced to find a balance between cutting costs and providing quality care—a situation which is unsustainable. Aged Care Queensland stress that, as most aged and community care providers are run on a not-for-profit basis, they are simply unable to afford to subsidise the gap between income and costs on an ongoing basis. The standard of care will almost certainly begin to slip if this situation is not addressed, and we will see more providers follow the example of the Salvation Army and bow out of the sector, as they can no longer operate on a viable basis—at least in some of the states.</para><para>What the aged care industry is asking for is not without precedent. The Howard government introduced a new indexation formula to rectify a similar disparity between costs and income for services provided by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. The opposition, on the other hand, realise that it is untenable for aged care facilities to continue to shed staff in an effort to cut costs, thereby blowing out the staff-to-resident ratio. A Latham Labor government would oversee the introduction of minimum staffing requirements in the aged care sector to put an end to the current situation, in which the Health Services Union reports that one or two staff members can have responsibility for up to 70 residents at a time. We recognise that our seniors and our aged care workers deserve much better than that. </para><para>We heard the minister recently claim that the Howard government has increased funding to aged care by 100 per cent, but such a claim is vastly different to the picture painted by the people on the ground in the aged care industry. In an interview on ABC's <inline font-style="italic">AM</inline> program of Wednesday 11 February, Richard Gray of Catholic Health Australia said:</para><quote><para>There's been inadequate increases in funding for number of years now, and the current funding regime is not adequate enough to meet quality care needs ...</para></quote><para>Aged Care Queensland estimates that residential care providers are currently around $406 million behind the level of funding needed to meet the real cost increases that the sector has faced since 1997. At the recent summit of the National Aged Care Alliance, industry insiders suggested that an immediate rise in funding of $10 per bed per day is required to bring residential services back to a level at which they can comfortably meet service standards, maintain and upgrade facilities and equipment and retain an adequate-sized and appropriately skilled staff.</para><para>Of course, residential care is just part of the aged care industry. Many of the older members of the community would prefer to be able to remain in their own homes, living as independently as possible for as long as possible. This is where the third area at the centre of Aged Care Queensland's concerns comes in—that is, the underfunding of community care. Having absorbed a $120 million gap between funding and costs, the community care sector urgently needs a 10 per cent funding increase to cover the real costs in providing care to the estimated 400,000 aged and disabled members of our community who rely on community care programs.</para><para>Aged and Community Services Australia, on behalf of respected industry bodies including Alzheimer's Australia, the Australian Council of Community Nursing Services, the Australian Medical Association, Carers Australia and COTA—the Council on the Ageing—published <inline font-style="italic">A vision</inline><inline font-style="italic"> for </inline><inline font-style="italic">community care: a discussion paper </inline>in August 2002. The paper observed:</para><quote><para>There is increasing recognition that community care programs can no longer be considered separately from the myriad of intersecting service sectors, including residential aged care, disability services and primary and acute health services. Changes in any one of these systems inevitably affect the others, as has been the case with the reduction of length of stay in hospitals increasing the care needs of some community care clients after discharge home.</para></quote><para>If the level of service provided by the community care sector decreases as a result of funding shortfalls, the pressure on residential care and hospital systems will increase. In other words, failure to invest in one part of the system is going to make the whole system less effective.</para><para>According to the independent report commissioned by the Myer Foundation—<inline font-style="italic">2020 Vision for Aged Care in Australia</inline>—it is community care in particular that requires a substantial funding boost. The report called for the expansion of community based care with a view to shifting the mix of health care options for older Australians towards a greater availability of community care, including a greater investment in preventative health care and housing features to allow seniors to live in their own homes as long as possible as they age.</para><para>The report also advocated improved integration between aged and community care and other related services. Similarly, the aged care industry has called for prevention and health promotion to be acknowledged as an integral component of community care services. They would like to see the funding system modified so that care is available not only to those with high care needs but also to seniors with less intensive or perhaps less immediate needs to prevent further functional decline. </para><para>Greater investment in these areas would make a significant contribution to delaying and reducing the need for ongoing services in high-intensity community hospitals or residential care. My friend and colleague the member for Franklin and you, Mr Deputy Speaker Mossfield, are, like me, at the age where we may be needing those services some time in the not-too-distant future! Investing in aged care is an investment in the future for all of us. Sadly, with this government we have heard a lot of lip-service but have seen a noticeable lack of action.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AV5</name.id><name role="metadata">Quick, Harry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Quick</name></talker><para>—Where's the Hogan report?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>6J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sciacca, Con, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SCIACCA</name></talker><para>—The Hogan report into aged care pricing, mentioned by my colleague, is an inquiry costing some $7.2 million. It was due in December last year. It is now March and we are still waiting for the report to be made public. While the government sits on its hands the aged care industry is left in limbo, with no certainty as to how their funding system will be altered and how that will impact on their capacity to ensure that, when they need it, all Australians can easily access high-quality care. This is a state of uncertainty that will continue once the Hogan report is finally released, while the government takes its time to respond. If the delays we have experienced waiting for the Minister for Veterans' Affairs to issue a final response to the Clarke report are anything to go by—and, of course, the Prime Minister had to bail her out of that one and made certain announcements today—it looks like we are still at the beginning of a long, drawn out process. It is time for the government to take responsibility—to respond to the calls for action emanating from the industry and the growing numbers of seniors in our community and ensure that the imminent crisis in aged and community care is nipped in the bud.</para></talk.start></continue><para>On behalf of Aged Care Queensland, the many dedicated workers in the aged care industry, and the seniors living in the Bayside and Redlands districts—and, indeed, in all of Queensland and Australia—I call on the government to look at these serious funding issues which are facing the aged care industry and act decisively to invest in this important sector and reverse the damage done before the situation deteriorates even further. Frankly, we are seeing the results of massive budget cuts after the 1996 election, when the public voted the Labor government out of power.</para><para>Another important area in which the government is guilty of sitting on its hands is, of course, that of families and Centrelink benefits. Disappointingly, although fully aware of the problems in this area—as evidenced by the Prime Minister's address to the National Press Club prior to the last election, which identified balancing work and family as a key priority for his third term, and the leaked cabinet documents that emerged recently setting out the deficiencies of the government's family policies—the government has nonetheless chosen to do nothing.</para><para>In the face of a damning report from the interdepartmental work and family task force, made up of representatives from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of Family and Community Services, the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations, Finance and Treasury, which was before cabinet way back in December 2002, the government has done nothing. Even though it is aware that second earners in single-income families in the $30,000 to $40,000 income range are paying, for each dollar earned, 60 per cent plus tax and net child-care costs, that to solve the problem of the flawed family benefit system significant changes are needed, that many families have found the precise forward income estimation difficult and that the issue of debts has detracted from community recognition and that features such as this can be perceived by families as having impacts—these are all words used in that report—it has done nothing. My colleague the shadow minister for family and community services hit the nail on the head when he reflected: </para><quote><para>... frustrated at the cover up, government bureaucrats have taken matters into their own hands by leaking key cabinet-in-confidence documents.</para></quote><para>Rod Whyte, formerly a senior manager with Centrelink, has written a book on the longstanding and appalling error rate within Centrelink and the agency's failure to fully investigate the causes of errors which lead to incorrect payment. Imagine that: enough errors, debts unfairly raised against clients who have done nothing wrong and adventures in mismanagement and inefficiencies to fill a book. In an interview with the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> this week, Mr Whyte said:</para><quote><para>Many customers over the course of the next 12 to 18 months will pay dearly for Centrelink's mistakes, mainly through having to pay back sizeable debts that weren't their fault.</para></quote><para>Mr Whyte's criticisms have been backed by the Australian National Audit Office and by literally hundreds of constituents in my own electorate of Bowman who have suffered significant financial penalties due to Centrelink's inadequate performance. They are people like Mrs Gail Lee of Alexandra Hills, whose dealings with Centrelink have been quite an ordeal. I have written to Minister Anthony about the situation and hope that I will receive his response in the not too distant future. I might mention that I have given up writing to the Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Patterson, who, although reputedly the senior minister, has forwarded all my past correspondence regarding Centrelink to her junior minister for response. It seems that the government, embarrassed by her efforts in the health portfolio, thought it best to give her a title and pop her in a corner where she can do no harm.</para><para>As I set out in my letter to Minister Anthony, my constituent's problems began because of another area in which the government has failed to act to assist ordinary Australians—that is, the rising cost of housing and the difficulties first-time home buyers experience getting into the market. Mrs Lee's daughter was having trouble getting a housing loan, and so in June 2003 they decided that the mother would transfer the title of her unit into her daughter's name. This would allow the daughter to present herself at the bank with equity in property so that she could secure the loan she needed to purchase her own house. As a result of this transaction, Centrelink decided that Mrs Lee had gifted away $140,000 worth of assets. Accordingly, the agency deemed her to be earning an income of $90 a week, and on 6 June 2003 Centrelink cancelled Mrs Lee's entitlement to widow allowance. This decision was taken even though, under the income test, my constituent should still have qualified for a partial widow allowance and, under the assets test, as a non home owner, she also continued to qualify for this allowance. The decision meant that she was left without any income. She was left destitute. She was forced to sell her furniture and rely on the generosity of family and friends in order to survive.</para><para>Fortunately, Mrs Lee was able to secure temporary employment, but that position no longer exists and she is left again without any income. My constituent has advised me that, although she contacted Centrelink by telephone and in person, on three separate occasions she was refused any recourse or right of appeal against the decision taken in her case. By giving out misinformation like this, Centrelink not only undermined my constituent's basic right to seek a review but caused her undue stress and financial hardship. Unfortunately, it was not the only incorrect information given to Mrs Lee. She was also told that, in her circumstances, she would not qualify for a low income earners' health care card, yet when eventually she decided, given that she had nothing to lose, to put in an application she received the health care card she had been entitled to all along.  </para><para>When my office contacted Centrelink about my constituent's situation, they had another look at her case and discovered that, instead of treating Mrs Lee as a non home owner, her entitlement to widow's allowance had mistakenly been calculated and declined on the basis of the home owners asset threshold. But, because my constituent was incorrectly advised of her review rights and tried to make her own way as best she could before, in desperation, she sought the assistance of my office, she is outside the three-month limitation period to obtain any compensation for the loss she has suffered as a result of Centrelink's negligence.</para><para>It is nothing short of disgusting that my constituent, through no fault of her own, has suffered months of stress, has been forced to sell off most of her assets simply in order to survive and is left with no course of redress, no back pay and no apology. Centrelink will not even reinstate her widow allowance because, having re-entered the work force, her circumstances have shifted and she would only be eligible for Newstart payments even though her position existed only briefly. As I mentioned earlier, I am hoping to receive a response to my representations soon and I hope that, in his response, the minister acknowledges the glaring inequity of the situation and acts to ensure a fair solution is found to Mrs Lee's problems which have occurred as a result of Centrelink's repeated errors in dealing with her situation.</para><para>This is the story of just one of many of my constituents who contact my office every week who are suffering as a result of this government's cutbacks, and it is just one of the many reasons why I support the second reading amendment moved by the member for Fraser which condemns this government for its budget waste, mismanagement and wrong priorities. As a former parliamentary secretary in the area of social security for something like four years, I know the dedication and work that is done by people that work at Centrelink, which used to be known as the Department of Social Security. In the vast majority of cases, they are good people. They do a good job and they help out as much as they can under very adverse circumstances. I must say that it must be absolutely trying for them with all these cutbacks and the amount of money that is taken away by the government from these sorts of services.</para><para>We heard my friend the member for Blaxland talk about how many services had been taken away from his electorate. I think just about every Labor electorate in Australia can say that that is the case. Medicare offices have closed all over the place and people have been forced to use expensive transport just to go and get a few dollars back. The reality is that it is not the fault of the public servants. I want to make that very clear here today. It is not the fault of the public servants; it is the fault of the government that does not give them enough money and tries to cut back. Now we have Mr Howard repeating the scenes of 2001, starting again to see if he cannot flip-flop on issues and start to buy the next election. You can see it happening now the way it did in 2001. But I say to him: `Don't just do it at election time. Pay the money out. Give it back to where it belongs. Don't forget that governments are here to service the electorates and the people in this country.' It is about time that we started getting back to reality. It is about time we started spending money on the services that the Australian public needs. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>25670</page.no><name role="metadata">Mossfield, Frank, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MOSSFIELD</name><name.id>MK6</name.id><electorate>Greenway</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to support the amendment moved to the <inline ref="R1975">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2003-2004</inline> by the member for Fraser, which amendment covers the following vital family areas: </para></talk.start><para>(1)  a costly Medicare `safety net' which does not protect families from increasing health costs and the declining level of bulk billing; </para><para>(2)   inadequate funding and higher fees for students seeking access to higher education; </para><para>(3)  a growing number of families who are financially squeezed and trying to balance work and family; and </para><para>(4)   500,000 Australians waiting for up to five years to get their teeth fixed. </para><para>The most important area of policy in Australia is the need to protect families. This is the direction that the Australian Labor Party is taking under the new Leader of the Opposition, Mark Latham. Before I cover those points as I go through my speech, I point out that today, 2 March, marks the eighth anniversary of my election to parliament. My intention is to take stock of the issues in my electorate. I have revisited what I said in my first speech and in other earlier speeches to see what I considered important then, comparing them to the major issues of today and how these have been addressed over that eight-year period.</para><para>One matter I mentioned in that very first speech was the massive residential development that was expected to take place in the northern part of the Greenway electorate around Parklea and Rouse Hill. I said on that occasion:</para><quote><para>The first stage of the Rouse Hill development centred on the Parklea release area is currently in the early stages of development and is eventually expected to house 50,000 people.</para></quote><para>This development has taken place as I predicted, and it is still taking place. Nearly 60,000 new residents have come to call Blacktown city home over the past 10 years. The local council has approved over 10,700 new dwellings in the past five years alone, the majority of which have been in the Greenway electorate. At 285,000 people—and growing by over 5,000 people each year—Blacktown city is the largest local government area in New South Wales and the third largest in Australia. Between the 1996 and 2001 census, Blacktown had the second largest growth of any LGA, and one in every 70 Australians now call Blacktown home.</para><para>I have seen my electorate grow in its population but shrink in its geography. This massive residential growth, as you can appreciate, Mr Deputy Speaker, has placed a considerable strain on the infrastructure needs of the region and, while much has been achieved, there is still very much more to be done. Mr Deputy Speaker, you can appreciate again that that area of infrastructure covers the whole spectrum of health, education, transport and roadworks. Much of the infrastructure work that has been completed so far has been carried out by the state Labor government. Windsor Road, which anyone from Western Sydney would be aware of, has been upgraded, but this was a long-time source of irritation and frustration to local motorists. Marayong railway station, the centre of an expanding area, has also been upgraded, with a modern lift complex to cater for wheelchair access, and the rail track has been duplicated to Quakers Hill, improving the rail service to that station. I called for this in my first speech in this place. Local residents now look forward to the completion of the duplication of the rail line right through to Riverstone, which is the last station in my electorate. Another project that urgently needs attention is the upgrading of the Quakers Hill railway station. As I said, much more needs to be done. Blacktown Hospital has been completely rebuilt by the state government and is now considered state of the art. </para><para>One other issue of infrastructure that I need to comment on is the Western Sydney orbital or, as it will become known when it is completed, Westlink M7. I have been a long-time strong advocate of this highway, even before I entered parliament. It is pleasing to see the speed at which it is now finally being constructed. I was also a member of the Greater Western Sydney Economic Development Board—a board of local businesspeople—which campaigned strongly for what we knew then as the Western Sydney orbital. I have supported the various arguments advanced by that organisation and various employer groups that the M7 would improve industrial road transport, which is vital, with many industries operating on a just-in-time principle, and its construction will lead to employment growth in the region. That will definitely be a good outcome once this road network is completed.</para><para>Unfortunately, the Howard government has ignored its responsibility to the people of my electorate with regard to this highway. The previous government had made plans to finance a certain section of it and had commenced work on it. The M7 will form the last link in the national highway system that stretches over 18,500 kilometres around Australia. Yet the Howard government ducked its responsibility to build it and basically demanded that the New South Wales government build it with a toll. The Howard government has, in effect, privatised the national highway.</para><para>In some of my earlier speeches I praised the work of the Quakers Hill family service, a joint program between Wesley Dalmar Child and Family Care and the Quakers Hill Uniting Church. This service was working with high-risk disadvantaged families and families in crisis. The 1998 annual report of this organisation indicated there had been increasing demand for counselling for families and children. Part of the stress on these families can be described by paragraph (3) of the amendment which simply says:</para><quote><para>(3) a growing number of families who are financially squeezed and trying to balance work and family ...</para></quote><para>This basically comes about because of the high mortgages families now have to contend with. There has also been an increase in the number of families with multiple problems in the area of direct family support. Reflecting on the slash and burn policies of the Howard government at the time, I said in one of my earlier speeches in this parliament:</para><quote><para>The reduction in department of community services funding as of July 1998 and less child care assistance to subsidise low income families being provided by the department of health and family services have brought changes to the service in the area of vocational care. As a result, fees have needed to be adjusted to accommodate the new system, which is confusing many families.</para></quote><para>That was clearly a problem that existed in the early period of my time in this parliament. I have here the report of the annual general meeting of 2002-03 for the Quakers Hill family service. The report shows the services the centre has continued to provide for needy families over the past 10 years. In particular, the report lists its future challenges, and I believe they really highlight what is required by low-income people in the area I represent. The future challenges for this organisation include the closing of Sundowner Village, which is a caravan park for low-income people, and the need to maintain a high level of support and advocacy with increased demands for affordable housing. Once again, I compliment the state Labor government. I have noticed in the press recently that they have introduced legislation that will make people who occupy these caravan parks a little more secure in their accommodation arrangements, and this is good news.  </para><para>Other future challenges for this organisation include ensuring the sustainability of programs, developing opportunities for growth to reflect the increased population and their service provision needs and increased human services for the Rouse Hill strategic planning area. A challenge for Parklea Prison is a growth in beds from 600 to 1,200 in the women's wing. Another challenge is the potential explosion in mortgage stresses with interest rate increases. Once again, that reflects the increase in residential development of the area. On a sad note, the report also refers to the passing of Glenys Judd, a previous centre coordinator who, unfortunately, lost her fight against a major illness in January 2003. Glenys and I developed a fairly good working relationship, and I was happy to work through her to assist this organisation. Glenys made a major contribution to the work of the centre and will be sorely missed.</para><para>I return to the issue of child care, which is a major issue in my electorate. In 1996-97 there was an $820 million cut to child care which has led to increased fees and reduced child-care assistance, low-quality care and the closure of several services. At the time, child-care closures occurred in my electorate in Seven Hills, Marayong, Riverstone and Blacktown. If we move forward to the present day, we can see the results of this short-sighted policy of funding cuts. At a Senate estimates committee hearing in June last year, we learnt that there was a shortage of after school care in the Blacktown local government area of over 1,000 places. This was well in excess of any other area in New South Wales or Australia. The next highest shortfall was in the neighbouring area of Holroyd, which had almost half that number with a 590-place shortage.</para><para>As I have said, there has been a huge residential development, with a lot of young families moving into the area, yet there has been a reduction in the availability of child-care places. This has come about because of the slash and burn policies of the Howard government in the 1997 and 1998 budgets. Of particular concern is the dramatic shortage of child care for the zero to two age group in Blacktown. The electorate of Greenway has the third highest number of children in this age group, behind the neighbouring Western Sydney electorates of Werriwa and Chifley. This highlights the needs of the child-care sector in our area of Western Sydney. For this reason it is encouraging to see the response of the new Leader of the Opposition, Mark Latham, to this crisis. The member for Werriwa has called the rates of pay for child-care workers a national disgrace. He said:</para><quote><para>At $13 an hour it is impossible to attract the qualified teachers to run the education programs so it's more than child minding and becomes child development.</para></quote><para>I think that is a very important statement. It is not simply a question of childminding; it is a question of educating the children and educating their development in these early age groups. The Leader of the Opposition has committed an incoming Labor government to increasing the salaries of child-care workers, increasing the number of child-care places, reducing waiting lists and improving the affordability of child care for parents.</para><para>If I could just once again refer to the residential development which seems to be a major theme in what I am saying tonight, a key to sustainable living in the Western Sydney, of course, is more local employment opportunities. I have indicated that I believe the M7 will contribute greatly to this. Job growth in the region really has not kept pace with residential growth. In my first speech I said: </para><quote><para>It is important that we match the training that is available to young people in Greenway and surrounding areas with employment opportunities in local industries and the growth jobs of the future.</para></quote><para>In an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> on 6 June 2003, Bob Myer, of architects Cox and Richardson, who worked for 20 years on the implementation of the Sydney region outline plan—and he lists Parramatta and Campbelltown, but, quite clearly, this would go beyond those two suburbs—said:</para><quote><para>Job growth ... has been disappointing. Instead tertiary jobs have dispersed in an arc from West Ryde through the CBD to the airport to Botany Bay and people have resorted to private transport to reach their workplace.</para></quote><para>One of the important points on employment is, of course, the availability of local employment. Once again, the major problem in our area is that people have to travel outside the district to earn a living. One pleasing aspect is that, on information provided by the Blacktown Council, I find that, in 1996, 40.3 per cent of all jobs in the city were held by local residents. By 2001 this proportion had increased to 55.4 per cent. This highlights the increased ability of the city to provide jobs for its residents. Like any location, Blacktown city residential growth will create a demand and requirement for jobs, particularly in service industries such as retail, health, community service and business services.</para><para>With that in mind, I am very pleased to be able to report that the residential shopping centre at Blacktown is now being redeveloped. I would probably say that this has certainly been long overdue. But it is now being redeveloped under the leadership of Alan Pendleton, the new mayor. Once it is fully developed, this will create additional employment in the area. The commercial development will bring about a total rejuvenation of Blacktown city's heart and it will be one of Western Sydney's most significant commercial retail centres. As I said, that will help to increase local employment and provide jobs for local people.</para><para>With this need in Western Sydney for more employment opportunities, it was with somewhat mixed feelings that we received correspondence from ING Real Estate advising that, with the decision having being made to close Australia's Wonderland amusement park, the site would now be purchased to create a business park. The problem here of course is that Wonderland will be a loss to the area. It was a major tourist attraction—and out in Western Sydney we do need tourist developments that will attract people into the area and provide employment and amusement for local residents. It was a great employer of local people. There were some 130 permanent and 270 casual workers employed there. The closing of the amusement park will create more pressure on the labour market, particularly in the area of part-time work and young people wanting to get into the work force. </para><para>So it is a double-edged sword: that is happening and there is going to be pressure there, but on the other hand is the fact that the site will be developed by one of Australia's largest organisations in this field, with a prediction that there will be some 9,000 jobs created close to where people live. That is definitely good news. I am advised that, under the proposed plan, the industrial business park will be developed using best practice and environmentally sustainable development practices so that trees will be maintained and the natural environment protected. The potential for employment growth is well supported by the education facilities in the electorate of Greenway, which I have spoken about on many occasions previously. </para><para>They are the developments that have taken place over the eight years that I have been the member for the electorate of Greenway. I have seen massive changes. I have seen the state government making a gallant effort to provide the infrastructure that the new residents of Western Sydney need. However, I have seen the federal government cutting back funds, which has reduced medical services in the area. We have seen inadequate funding and the residents in the area that I live in having to pay higher fees for higher education. As I have been speaking about, a growing number of families are financially squeezed. On the one hand we have got the state Labor government providing infrastructure that is needed for the area, and on the other hand we have got the federal government cutting back on the funds that are so vital for the services that we need in Western Sydney. For that reason I am very happy to support the amendment moved by the member for Fraser. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>25674</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MARTIN FERGUSON</name><name.id>LS4</name.id><electorate>Batman</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In my remarks tonight on the <inline ref="R1975">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2003-2004</inline> I want to specifically draw on the second reading amendment standing in the name of the member for Fraser, Bob McMullan. In doing so I want to touch on my shadow ministerial responsibilities for transport and regional services and issues raised in the second reading amendment going to the opposition's condemnation of the government for its budget waste and mismanagement.</para></talk.start><para>I draw the House's attention this evening to the fact that 12 months ago the Secretary of the Department of Transport and Regional Services told his department that they were in a very difficult financial position. I contend that that arose from financial mismanagement and waste by the Department of Transport and Regional Services. The secretary informed the staff of the department that they would run out of money without major changes in the way they operated. The department posted an operating loss of $4.5 million in 2002-03, yet the figure did not tell the whole and honest story. Losses in 2002-03 were in fact more than $4.5 million. With the rollover funds from 2001-02 and forward into 2003-04 taken into account, the operating loss is more like $8.1 million. And this figure does not include the $13 million drawn down from the reserves since 1999. </para><para>Since then we have discovered that the response of the department and the government to the financial crisis has been to slash staff numbers and freeze expenditure on IT infrastructure, something fundamental to the operation of the department. Across the department the five administrative groups were forced to cut their operating expenses by 10.7 per cent to enable the department to turn around their financial crisis. Two weeks ago during the Senate estimates process we learnt that this whopping productivity increase has fallen squarely onto the staff of the department.</para><para>The department's definition of operating expenses appears to be limited to staff costs. We have learnt that staffing levels within the department have fallen by 13.8 per cent in just nine months. In addition, the tools that enable the department to perform its functions—its information technology systems—have had an expenditure freeze imposed on them. This is in spite of the fact that the secretary of the department clearly indicated on 14 May 2003:</para><quote><para>... to make ends meet over recent years we—</para></quote><para>the department—</para><quote><para>have under-invested in infrastructure such as IT desktops.</para></quote><para>So not only have staff numbers been slashed by almost 130 but the remaining staff are required to put up with failing IT infrastructure. I think this is fairly important, because the Department of Transport and Regional Services is a very significant department. The staff within the department have been made the scapegoat for maladministration by the Howard government. It did not have to be and should not have been the case. A department properly resourced by government could have continued to provide sound administrative functions. The treatment of staff in the Department of Transport and Regional Services is yet another example of the wrong priorities of this government, its waste and its mismanagement—something that is seen generally across the Howard government. </para><para>For that reason I very much support the amendment moved by the shadow minister for finance, the member for Fraser that condemns the government for its budget waste and mismanagement and wrong priorities. These have clearly resulted in difficulties with respect to our costly Medicare safety net system; inadequate funding and higher fees for students in higher education; a growing number of financially squeezed families trying to balance work and family; and 500,000 Australians waiting for up to five years to get their teeth fixed, something which is a major problem in my electorate of Batman in the northern suburbs of Melbourne.</para><para>As a result of penny pinching and the 1980s style corporate management adopted by the government, officers of the Department of Transport and Regional Services are required to perform miracles to achieve government objectives. It is little wonder that the department is falling apart and there are serious problems with respect to the performance of the department, going to such fundamental issues as aviation safety in Australia at the moment. It is little wonder that the department—and, in essence, the Howard government—has not been able to respond to the regional business development analysis report delivered to the government in July of last year.</para><para>It is little wonder that the introduction of a new IT program management system for the Regional Partnerships program is beset with problems that are leading to increased frustration for program applicants all around Australia. It is little wonder that the Regional Partnerships program has been unable to generate the activity or applications envisaged when it was started in July 2003. As at the end of December this program has only been able to spend less than one quarter of the funds allocated, even though it brought forward more than $30 million expenditure from the previous financial year.</para><para>The litany goes on across a whole range of activities in the Department of Transport and Regional Services. It is little wonder, for example, that the much publicised AusLink white paper has yet to see the light of day. And it is little wonder that it has taken so long to get even close to the ARTC agreement with the New South Wales state government being nailed down by the federal government going to the upgrade of the national track on the east coast from Brisbane through to Melbourne. And, most importantly, the government's 20th-century response to departmental administration appears to be designed to silence criticism of the new National Airspace System.</para><para>The Australian Transport Safety Bureau is the organisation that conducts professional investigations into aviation accidents and incidents. It was the ATSB that first recommended a review of the flawed National Airspace System as a result of an investigation of a near miss incident over Launceston. The recent Senate estimates process confirmed the extent of the damage being perpetrated on the ATSB budget and the effect it is having on the preparedness to improve aviation safety for the travelling public. It was confirmed at Senate estimates that the ATSB is investigating only 60 out of 60,000 aviation incidents each year—and this is the organisation that is supposed to assist in maintaining air safety in Australia. This is a very serious issue when you think about the importance of the aviation industry to Australia at large.  </para><para>In 2000-01, the ATSB was funded to conduct 118 new accident investigations, but this has now dropped to just 60. This is at a time when the government is introducing a whole new approach to aviation in Australia. The flawed National Airspace System is slated for fundamental review—and we are cutting back on investigations of aviation safety and near misses in Australia. This is the same airspace system that the ATSB acknowledges is responsible for 27 National Airspace System related incidents since its implementation in November 2003—a very short period. It is the same airspace system that is based on the American model that is clearly unsuitable for Australian conditions, as the near miss over Launceston proved beyond any doubt.</para><para>I note that, in a recent review of midair collisions in the US, it was found that the most common causal factor identified by the US National Transportation Safety Board was failure to—guess what?—see and avoid. It is interesting to note, as the member for Franklin is well aware because of the near miss in Tasmania just before Christmas, that the National Airspace System being pursued by the Minister for Transport and Regional Services is based on see and avoid and that is the system that we are expected to adopt in Australia. It concluded that see and avoid has inherent limitations as a tactical strategy for avoiding midair collisions. It also found that most midair collisions occur near airports, especially non-towered airports, which is pretty important when you think about regional Australia and the importance of aviation. The use of see and avoid, especially around non-towered airports, is one of the most fundamental changes to our new National Airspace System in stage 2B of the implementation of the NAS system.</para><para>It is also interesting that during the Senate estimate hearings a fortnight ago the Chief Executive Officer of Airservices Australia dropped his bombshell about the botched implementation of the NAS system—the system that the Minister for Transport and Regional Services continued to tell us in the House only a matter of a week and half ago is safer than the previous operating system. In his statement to the Senate committee on 17 February, the Chief Executive Officer of Airservices Australia said:</para><quote><para>Airservices recently formed the view that its process for considering the changes on 27 November 2003 may not have properly discharged all its responsibilities under the act. The nature of the gap in our processes relates, firstly, to the extent to which Airservices may have relied on the work of other parties—the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, the Aviation Reform Group, the National Air Space Implementation Group as examples—rather than its own comprehensive research and analysis. And secondly, to the way in which we chose to manage an identified risk related to the implementation of class E airspace.</para></quote><para>I simply say to the House this evening that that was a bombshell and it fell not only on me as the shadow minister but also on the Minister for Transport and Regional Services and his department. The Chief Executive Officer of Airservices effectively stated that the fundamental process for implementing NAS was flawed and hence there were serious questions about air safety in Australia. He stated that, despite the Minister for Transport and Regional Services responding in the House on the same day to a question from me by stating that the system was, in essence, the safest in the world. </para><para>Let us talk about how flawed it is—and that is not my view alone; it is now the view of Airservices and many other professionals in the industry who have long said to the minister, including prior to 27 November, that this system is a risk. I have come to the conclusion that, so flawed is this system as a result of these procedural oversights, Airservices has now undertaken a design safety case for the system's full implementation last year and it will also undertake a more extensive risk analysis of the changes that were implemented last year. The ATSB has identified that the National Airspace System contributed to a serious incident near Launceston airport in December last year. It appropriately recommended that the National Airspace System procedures and communication requirements be reviewed and, where necessary, there be revision and updating of education, training and sharp frequency material. Then Airservices Australia acknowledged that it had not properly discharged its responsibilities under the act—in effect, it had acted illegally—and it will therefore initiate a design safety case of the full program for reform and also undertake a more extensive risk analysis of the changes. </para><para>But what have we heard from the person who should be shouldering responsibility for the introduction of the NAS system; what have we heard from the Minister for Transport and Regional Services? I am sorry to report this evening that he has been silent. He has continued to give the House an undertaking that this is the safest system we as a nation could have. The same day that he last answered a question without notice in the House, Airservices Australia—an independent regulatory authority that had belled the cat—owned up to the fact that it had not done the job it was required to do under the act and that the air safety system in Australia, which we depend on, was flawed and had to be completely overhauled. I would have thought that the minister would have made a statement to the travelling public about where this review is up to and why Airservices have had to take it on. I think the minister stands condemned for not accepting those responsibilities and, in essence, not coming clean.</para><para>But, as far as I am concerned, it is worse than that. The minister has failed to reassure the Australian public that serious incidents like the one in Launceston will not happen again. I think we are entitled to know that that is the view of the minister: that serious incidents such as the one that occurred at Launceston will not happen again—because do you know what that is about? That is about duty of care, from a government point of view. It is time for the minister to fulfil his responsibility by acknowledging the concerns that have been raised time and time again by highly informed members of the aviation industry and by the opposition in parliament and outside.</para><para>This evening I call upon the minister to accept his responsibility and release a full statement of what really happened with the introduction of the National Airspace System. He must explain why he let Dick Smith, an enthusiastic amateur—his good mate and an even better mate of the Prime Minister—and a known advocate of the US air space model, lead the charge in the design of Australia's new airspace regime. The minister must come clean on the exact role of the Airspace Reform Group and whether it will start to have another go at trying to fix its botched NAS system. I contend that we need to get rid of the enthusiastic amateurs and hand the review of the National Airspace System over entirely to the experts—the professionals—and let them do the job, just as they should have been allowed to do it in the first place. </para><para>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services must also fess up, swallow his pride and let the travelling public know his plans for the future management of Australia's airspace system. The minister has deliberately hidden from public scrutiny in relation to the changes that he is responsible for and has left the taxpayers to take the blame. This must end. He can no longer hide from his responsibilities. The Chief Executive Officer of Airservices should not have been the fall guy because the minister will not accept his responsibilities. The ATSB should not be forced to accept massive resource reductions in an attempt by the minister to silence the investigator—and this is a very serious accusation.</para><para>Therefore, on behalf of the opposition this evening, I call on the Minister for Transport and Regional Services to come into the House—if anything I demand that he do so—and explain how and why the National Airspace System has been implemented in the botched way that it has been. The parliament deserves that explanation from the minister and, more importantly, so does the travelling public—and I will tell you why. This is not just about budget waste and mismanagement; it is about the fundamental responsibilities of the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. The Commonwealth Minister for Transport and Regional Services has a variety of responsibilities, but a number of them go to the safety of the travelling public, be it a responsibility in the investigation of road and rail accidents or, alternatively, the development and implementation of a safe air system in Australia.</para><para>This is about duty of care as a minister of the Crown. NAS has put the travelling public at risk. Our air system is not safe, as has been acknowledged by Airservices Australia during Senate estimates just over a week and a half ago. Minister, accept your responsibilities, come clean and help clean up your mess because, if you do not and a serious accident occurs, you will be at fault not only morally but also legally because of a failure to accept your duty of care to protect the travelling public with respect to the implementation and operation of the National Airspace System. I have given the minister sufficient warning and a chance to do what is right by the travelling public. Front up to your responsibilities, Minister: accept your duty of care and do the right thing by the travelling public.</para><para>Debate interrupted. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Main Committee adjourned at 8.33 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate></maincomm.xscript><answers.to.questions><debate><debateinfo><type>Answers to Questions in Writing</type><title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title><page.no>25679</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following answers to questions were circulated:</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Immigration: Protection Visas</title><page.no>25679</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1711)</subtitle><id.no>1711</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>25679</page.no><name role="metadata">Andren, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Andren</name><name.id>KL6</name.id><electorate>Calare</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 20 March 2003:</para></talk.start><quote><para>How many applications for temporary protection visas has his Department received from followers of Falun Gong or Falun Dafa and how many of these applications have been approved to date.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>25679</page.no><name role="metadata">Hardgrave, Gary, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Hardgrave</name><name.id>CK6</name.id><electorate>Moreton</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Under Australian migration legislation persons apply for a protection visa and the decision as to whether a permanent or temporary protection visa is granted is made on the facts of each individual case and depends on whether particular regulatory criteria are met.</para><para>From July 1999 until 30 June 2003 the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) received 4,385 applications for a protection visa from PRC nationals.

The difference reflects an additional stowaway that had previously been incorrectly coded in the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA's) systems. (i) Of the 29 stowaways who arrived in 2001-2002, 10 applied for Protection Visas (PVs) in Australia. Of the 15 stowaways who arrived in 2002-2003, 3 applied for PVs in Australia. (ii) Of the 10 PV applicants in 2001-2002, 5 are from Iraq, 2 are from the Democratic Republic of Congo, 2 are from Burundi and 1 is from Somalia. Of the 3 PV applicants in 2002-2003, 1 is from Burundi, 1 is from Iraq and 1 is from the Democratic Republic of Congo. (iii) Of the 10 PV applications in 2001-2002, 8 have been successful and 2 have been refused. Of the 3 PV applications in 2002-2003, 1 has been refused and 2 have not yet been finally determined. </para><para>(2)	(a) The Department does not keep separate costs associated with the processing of stowaways in detention, including the cost of processing PV applications. Costs vary considerably depending on the time taken to process an application. The average cost of keeping an unlawful non-citizen in a detention centre in 2001-2002 and in 2002-2003 was $160 and $273 per day respectively. Based on volume, the average cost of processing a PV applicant in onshore detention in 2001-2002 was around $3,500. The average cost of processing a PV applicant in onshore detention in 2002-2003 was around $6,000. (b) While the Department infringes shipping companies for bringing stowaways without reporting them on arrival, it does not recover the cost of detention and processing of stowaways who seek protection and make PV applications on arrival. This policy is applied to ensure that there is an incentive to notify the presence of the stowaway. Shipping companies are, however, liable for the costs of removing stowaways whose PV applications have been unsuccessful.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Immigration: Special Purpose Visas</title><page.no>25689</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2726)</subtitle><id.no>2726</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>25689</page.no><name role="metadata">McFarlane, Jann, MP</name><name role="display">Ms Jann McFarlane</name><name.id>83C</name.id><electorate>Stirling</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 5 November 2003:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	How many Special Purpose Visas (SPV) have been granted to date in 2003.</para><para>(2)	How many people breached the conditions of their SPVs in (a) 1996, (b) 1997, (c) 1998, (d) 1999, (e) 2000, (f) 2001, (g) 2002, and (h) 2003 to date.</para><para>(3)	What action is taken to apprehend a crewmember not holding a SPV who jumps ship.</para><para>(4)	What steps are taken to confine a crewmember not holding a SPV to the ship the crewmember arrived on.</para><para>(5)	Who is responsible for notifying Australian authorities if a crewmember denied a SPV jumps ship.</para><para>(6)	What penalties apply for failing to notify Australian Authorities if a crewmember denied a SPV jumps ship.</para><para>(7)	Does legislation require ships to provide information on their crews prior to their departure from Australia; if not, does the Government seek to obtain this information voluntarily and, if it does, how.</para><para>(8)	Further to the answer to question No. 274, (Hansard, 14 May 2002, page 2139) what action is the Minister taking to secure the passage of the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1) 2002.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>25689</page.no><name role="metadata">Hardgrave, Gary, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Hardgrave</name><name.id>CK6</name.id><electorate>Moreton</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Special Purpose Visas (SPV) come into effect through operation of law by virtue of persons holding a prescribed status.

As such, if an SPV holder overstays this will be included in other statistical data, as a number may apply for other visa classes.

This package provides that:</para><para>	the number of approved spouse, prospective spouse or interdependency sponsorships are limited to two per person, a minimum of five years apart (approved sponsorships are those which resulted in the grant of any spouse, prospective spouse or interdependency visa, irrespective of when the visa was applied for);</para><para>	people who have been sponsored as a spouse, prospective spouse or interdependent partner will be restricted from sponsoring a partner under one of these visa classes for five years, counted from the date their application was lodged;</para><para>	a woman granted a Woman at Risk (Subclass 204) visa will not be able to sponsor a former spouse from whom she declared she was divorced or permanently separated prior to the grant of the visa, or who was not declared in her visa application, for a period of five years; and</para><para>	the total number of people that may ever be sponsored by one person in any of these subclasses is two.</para><quote><para>In support of this package, my Department has also introduced a range of measures to minimise possible misuse of the partner visa process, including:</para></quote><para>	The introduction of a Best Practice Model for processing partner visa applications.

However the government's many counselling services for veterans are in fact of great benefit. For example the Vietnam Veteran Counselling Service (VVCS) is a specialised, free, confidential service for all veterans and serving Australian Defence Force personnel. The VVCS has recently expanded and its success is evidenced by the year on year increasing numbers of veterans participating in the counselling, and recent surveys indicating high satisfaction levels amongst veterans.</para><para>(3)	I am advised that the Queensland Government purchased the land in 1995. I further understand that the Queensland Government has offered alternative sites to the veterans, all of which have been turned down.
