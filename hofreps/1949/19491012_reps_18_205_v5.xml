                    <para>Complaints have been made to me by many men that on the death of their parents they hare arranged for an elderly sister to look after their home, and that they have not been able to claim a concessional rebate for income tax purposes in respect of the services of the sister, but that taxpayers are able to claim such concessions in respect of <inline font-style="italic">de facto</inline> wives. "Will the Treasurer state whether consideration has been given to this matter, and if so, whether it is possible for further consideration to be given to the desirability of allowing concessional rebates to taxpayers in such circumstances?</para>

                    <para>- The subject raised by the honorable member has been considered by a number of Treasurers and governments. I do not think that the position of a <inline font-style="italic">de facto</inline> wife is analogous to that of a sister who is looking after a single man. A <inline font-style="italic">de facto</inline> wife occupies a somewhat different position in the home from that of a sister. The conditions governing the allowance of concessional rates in respect of <inline font-style="italic">de facto</inline> wives are fairly strict, and have regard to the character of the union and to children that might result from it. This subject has been considered on a number of occasions because of the continual requests that have been made that the concessional rebate should be extended to cover taxpayers such as those mentioned by the honorable member. Up to the present the Government has not been able to see its way clear to allow a rebate in respect of sisters who occupy such a position in the home because such a practice would be open to very great 'abuses. </para>

                        <para>- Some time ago 1 asked the Attorney-General a question in relation to the impounding of some gramophone records which had been brought to Australia by Mr. Dixon, the well-known Communist. I asked the right honorable gentleman whether he would have the records examined in order to ascertain whether or not they contained certain forms of propaganda. Has he yet had an opportunity to institute an inquiry to ascertain the nature pf the records, and, if so, can he give the House any information on the subject? </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member mentioned this matter on the 30th September last. It relates to the administration by the Department of Trade and Customs of the Customs Act. I referred the honorable member's question to the Minister for Trade and Customs but I have not yet received a reply. A reply will be furnished to the honorable member by the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Customs in this House. Power is contained in the Customs Act for the department to detain certain types of records. As I have already informed the honorable member, I do not know what is contained on the records to which he has drawn attention. However, I am obliged to the honorable member for reminding me of the matter. </para>

                            <para>- My attention was directed last night to a statement made by the honorable member for Warringah, and, I think, repeated at the week-end by another Opposition member, the Leader of the Australian Country party. I take this opportunity to say that the statement is completely inaccurate. It is a complete untruth from beginning to end. The matter has never been considered by the Government, and such a thought has never occurred to members of the Government. There has been only one vacancy on the High Court bench during the regime of the Curtin and Chifley Administrations. The Government's appointee to that vacancy was the then Chief Justice of Queensland, Sir William Webb, and not the slightest objection to his appointment was raised by any member of this House, or any political party, or any representative of the legal profession of Australia. The same may be said without exception of other judicial appointments made by this Government. There has not been one breath of criticism of such appointments. Therefore, I say that it is wrong and wicked that statements such as that referred to by the honorable member for Martin should be made, without authority, in an attempt to mislead the people. Clearly, there is no justification for the statement. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Richmond now talks about a referendum. I pointed out yesterday in answer to another honorable member that, during the whole period of the war, a vast percentage of the High Court's decisions favoured the Government. The question of additions to the High Court Bench is not being considered, and, to use the words of the honorable member for Martin, the statement to which he has referred is inaccurate, misleading and utterly false, but I prefer to call it a simple, downright untruth. </para>

The Russian delegate stated that no steps have been taken by the Australian Government to place natives in charge of any aspect of the administration of its trusteeship territories. Is the Minister in a position to inform me whether that statement i9 true? If natives have not yet been appointed to any significant posts in the administration, are any steps being taken to so appoint them? Are any natives being trained for such purposes? If they are, what is the nature of the posts to which they may be appointed and where is the training taking place? </para>

                        <para>- I have already explained very fully the whole of the circumstances of the acquisition of the property in Victoria that is known as Somers Camp. The business was carried out under the provisions of the Lands Acquisition Act. "When properties are to be acquired by the Commonwealth, sworn valuators are engaged by the Australian Government to value the property that is to be acquired. Those valuations are then checked by the Commissioner of Taxation or by some of his officers. When there is a divergence in valuations, a conference of the valuators is held before any recommendation is made to me by my officers. I shall make the file available to the honorable member for Flinders because the valuations were sound and there is nothing to hide. After a question was asked in the House recently concerning this matter T examined the papers with an officer of the Department of the Interior, and I am convinced that the purchase of the land at the figure quoted by the honorable member for Flinders was quite justified. </para>

As head of the Government charged with the duty of allocating portfolios, I have given consideration to the matter, but at the moment I cannot approve of the establishment of such a portfolio. In any event, honorable members would probably refer to the holder of the suggested portfolio by such a term as " Mother Hubbard " or by some similar colloquialism. Whilst I understand that in one or two countries, notably Denmark, action has been taken along the lines indicatedby the honorable member, I shall ascertain exactly what has been done in this aspect of social life, and when I have obtained that information I shall give further consideration to the honorable member's request. </para>

                        <para>- Local authorities submit particulars of projects that they desire to have included in the national works programme to State governments in the first instance. The projects are then referred to the co-ordinator of works in each State. I think that Mr. Kemp is the co-ordinator of works in Queensland and that Mr. Swift is the co-ordinator of works in New South Wales. In the other States various officers have been appointed by the State governments to co-ordinate the works programmes of the States. Consultation then takes place between the State co-ordinator of works and the Commonwealth Co-ordinator-General of Works, and those officials are guided in their deliberations very largely by the availability of materials and labour. They then set out what, in their view, are the most urgent works, and the CoordinatorGeneral of Works makes reports and recommendations to the National Works Council of the order of urgency that should be given to the various projects, always, of course, on the understanding that money is available to carry out the works. Perhaps I should make it clear to the honorable member that the Premiers themselves do not desire the general publication of all the lists of works that have been approved, because from time to time they may wish to alter the order of priority that has been allotted to projects in the respective States. The Commonwealth Co-ordinator-General of Works is guided by the State coordinators of works.If a State body desires to have certain proposals considered, its representations should be made to the State Government and be dealt with by the State co-ordinator before the matter is raised with the Commonwealth CoordinatorGeneral of Works. </para>

                        <para>- I made a comment earlier about the matter, and I have no desire to add to it now. The position is that an Australian company submitted a request to the Commonwealth for a licence to import petrol from Poland. Speaking from memory, I believe that the petrol was to be loaded at Stettin. We were not quite sure about the currency position, and, naturally, we consulted the Bank of England and the United King&lt;d©ia Treasury, which are the British authorities responsible for exchange control in regard to dollars, in order to satisfy ourselves about the situation. We intimated to the applicant company that if it could buy petrol for sterling, and pay the freight and insurance charges in sterling, the import licence would be granted. Later, I received from the Acting High Commissioner for Australia in the United Kingdom a cable in which he said that the representatives of the applicant company had approached him on the subject. They had found that a difficulty had arisen in obtaining an export licence from the Polish Government, and they asked whether the Australian Government would make representations to the Polish Government about the matter. I sent to Mr. Mighell a cable  in which I asked him to inquire of the Polish representative the reasons, if there were any reasons, for his Government's decision not to grant the export licence for the petrol which, the company had said, could be bought in Poland. The Polish Government has briefly informed us that it was not able to grant the export licence. We already knew that it had to bring crudes from the Persian Gulf to Stettin, and then take them inland for refining. The petrol would be extremely expensive in such circumstances. I understand that Poland has not sufficient petrol to meet its own requirements. The Polish Government has made it clear that the only reason for its refusal to grant the export licence is the unavailability of petrol. </para>

                            <para>- I ask the Prime Minister whether it is true that the petrol consumption of Commonwealth departments and instrumentalities amounted to 800,000 gallons in June and 942,000 gallons in July, compared with an average monthly consumption of 680,000 gallons. As the coal strike did not affect consumption in June, what was the reason for the big increase in that month? Will th» Government instruct departments that they must keep their consumption within the quota of 800,000 gallons a month which the Prime Minister told the premiers was the Commonwealth's petrol allocation, just as all other fuel users are compelled to limit their consumption of petrol to quotas? Is it a fact that numerous new inspectorial activities, which were not previously considered to be necessary, are being undertaken by departmental officers with the use of motor cars, thereby increasing the Commonwealth's use of fuel? </para>

                            <para>- It is true that the consumption in June was higher than in previous months. I have taken the trouble to make a personal examination of returns which show the use of petrol by Commonwealth departments and by Ministers which have been supplied to me by the Minister for the Interior. I have also asked the Public Service Board to direct its inspectorial staffs in the various States to ensure that petrol is not used for other than what can be reasonably regarded as essential or reasonably essential purposes. I made an inquiry into the reason for the increased petrol consumption in June and learned that practically all of the fuel was used for absolutely essential services, mainly in connexion with the carriage of materials. The honorable gentleman mentioned the coal strike. Before the strike actually commenced coal was being rationed, and the New South Wales Railways Department had reduced the number of goods trains engaged in the carrying of building materials, &amp;c. I examined details of the use of petrol for the month mentioned, and found that at least 90 per cent, was used in the maintenance of essential services, and in the carrying of necessary materials. That being so, there was no justification for taking alr action against departments or departmental officers. I told the Premiers what quantity of petrol was being used by Commonwealth departments, but I cannot remember telling them that that quantity would not be exceeded. It is obvious that if there were a complete cessation of railway traffic to Canberra, where much building is in progress, it would be necessary to use motor lorries to bring cement here from the factories. Indeed, it is even now very difficult to get cement carried by the railways because of the shortage of trucks. I assure the honorable member that I have examined particulars of mileages covered by Commonwealth vehicles, and the quantity of petrol consumed. Upon occasions, I have had to take up cases with the Ministers in charge of departments, when I thought that there had been excessive travelling by administrative officers, and I have asked Ministers to make persona] inquiries. There will be no unavoidable use of petrol by Commonwealth departments. </para>

                        <para>- Has the Minister for Civil Aviation seen reports to the effect that Melbourne is likely to be bypassed in the international air race, which has been organized by New Zealand to take place in 1953, because there is no international airport in that city? As Essendon is the busiest airport in Australia, and as there is accumulating evidence of disability caused by the lack of international aircraft landing facilities i» Melbourne, will the Minister review thedecision not to make Melbourne an international airport? </para>

                        <para>- I have not read; the reports to which the honorable member has referred, but I can quite understand the reasons for the decision not to' make Melbourne a point on the route of the international air race to New Zealand. So far as I am aware, that city would not be on the direct track to that dominion, and competing aircraft would need to make a diversion in order to pass over Melbourne. The honorable member has also suggested that Melbourne should also be made an international airport. The explanation why that has not been done already has been made before, but I repeat it now for the honorable gentleman's information. The agreement between the United States of America and Australia provides for an international airport at each terminal. Airports have been established in accordance with that agreement, and any proposal for a variation of the agreement would have to be made by either the Government of the United States or the Australian Government. Personally, I see no necessity for such a variation. The net result of making Melbourne an international airport, and of permitting any international service to terminate at Melbourne, would be that the designated airline of the United States of America, Pan-American Airways, which might be more heavily subsidized than Australian airlines, would be able to send their aircraft to Melbourne, and compete with Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, Ansett Airways Proprietary Limited and Trans-Australia Airlines causing a total loss in revenue to the Australian airlines of £400 to £500 a week. No doubt it would cause the honorable member for Balaclava and his associates in the Opposition a great deal of satisfaction if Australian airlines were to incur such losses. </para>

                        <para>- Until recently, the distribution of supplies of wire for the manufacture of nails was under .the jurisdiction of the Division of Industrial Development of the Department of Postwar Reconstruction. However, because the Government was advised that it no longer had any constitutional authority to decide what allocations should be made to the respective States, it informed the State governments that, as from the 1st July, it could no longer undertake the task of allocating materials to the States. Although the Commonwealth has no power in this matter, the Department of Post-war Reconstruction has referred to the manufacturers various representations that have been made to it from time to time, and the manufacturers have been able to accede to many of those requests. I shall be happy to make representations to the company with a view to securing greater supplies of wire for Tasmania. </para>

Tunica y Casas was formerly secretary of the Communist party in New Caledonia, and a contact man for the Communist party in South blast Asia. The Minister stated that they had been given until the end of May to leave Australia. He added that if they had not left by then they would be deported. Have they yet left Australia ? If not, has any order been served on them? Were representations made on their behalf and if so, by whom ? Has the Minister stayed Iris hand in this case because Tunica y Casas and his wife are an embarrassment to their landlords, or is he trying to help their landlords? Have reports been received about visits paid to these people by native crews of ships that come from New Caledonia and Indo-China? Did the Australian Security Intelligence Organization recommend the deportation? </para>

                            <para>- That is the best of evidence that the statements are entirely incorrect. The report to which the honorable member has referred is the sort of stupid report upon which the honorable gentleman would base a question. I heard from somebody a few days ago that there had been some complaint of the sort that the honorable member has voiced. The truth of the matter is that Australians experience no difficulty in entering any country provided they make arrangements to obtain vises. However, Great Britain and a number of European countries have entered into an agreement whereby they mutually agree to discard the use of vises. Australia was asked to become a party to that agreement. Switzerland was one country that asked us to do so. Certainly, Italy was not a party to any agreement, because at that particular time the peace treaty in respect of Italy had not been concluded. Thus, I do not know what Italy's position would be. I explained this matter when it was raised by the honorable member for Parramatta after he returned from a trip abroad. I then pointed out that for security reasons, it is not desirable that Australia, which is situated 13,000 miles from Europe, should permit persons to enter this country without a proper vise. As we are not prepared to allow other nationals to enter this country without vises, we cannot expectother countries to allow entry to our nationals without vises. However, persons who wish to travel would not have the slightest difficulty in obtaining vises if they make proper application to the authorities of the countries they desire to enter before they leave Australia or at the diplomatic and consular office of such nations in British countries. </para>

                            <para>- That is so; but under the new nationality law we describe ourselves as " Australian citizens ", and Great Britain has altered its passports similarly so that residents of Great Britain are not described now as " British subjects " but are primarily described as " United Kingdom citizens ". The whole of the alterations are consequent upon the passage of new legislation. The whole of the issues raised were answered when they were first mentioned by the honorable member for Parramatta and they were more fully discussed when the Nationality and Citizenship Bill was under discussion. I shall have particular inquiries made, but I remind the honorable gentleman that a lot of great artists are like members of the Australian Country party: They are rather temperamental. </para>

Has he also seen the statement of the spokesman for that Government that it does not regard religion as a wholly private affair for each individual ? Is this action in accordance with the declarations and decisions of the United Nations? If not, will Australia protest against this infringement of human freedom? If no action is taken by the United Nations, for how long are we expected to perpetuate the farce of Russia using the United Nations for its own ends and yet refusing to accept any decision that makes for the betterment of conditions affecting humanity? </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable member for Maranoa wishes to criticize the United Nations, he should not found his criticism upon one incident of this kind, to which there is, I think, a complete answer from the point of view of the United Nations. The facts are that in eastern Europe, first in Hungary, then in Bulgaria and now extending to Czechoslovakia and Roumania, the Communist Governments have systematically prevented the exercise of religious freedom. It is equally true that Australia took the initiative in bringing these matters to the attention of the General Assembly of the United Nations. The result was a resolution, in accordance with the treaties of peace made at Paris with those satellites of Germany, that action should be taken under those treaties. The matter is now actually being discussed by the General Assembly. In addition to the matters that I have mentioned, the very matter that the honorable member has referred to is also being discussed. The fact is that the United Nations is the only forum in the world where conduct of that kind may be brought to the attention of the world and criticized. I am certain that this is of great value in carrying through the objectives of the United Nations. I do not know whether the honorable gentleman was personally responsible for the sentence of his question in which he talked about the " farce " of the United Nations. I venture to say if that is his opinion-- </para>

                            <para>- There is no doubt that every member nation uses the United Nations as a forum, including Russia. It is a part of the procedure of open discussion, just as, in this House, every honorable member may bring before other honorable members matters in which they are interested. That is not in fact; inconsistent with the idea of a world forum : it is the very nature of it. If Russia misuses the United Nations, it gets an answer in kind. The public opinion of the rest of the world turns against conduct which prejudices the practice of all religions in the countries in eastern Europe to which I have referred. </para>

                        <para>- I have seen the press statement to which the honorable member has referred. It is totally inaccurate. The figures were probably computed by someone who was trying to write down the Citizen Military Forces training scheme, which has been in operation for only twelve months. The strength of 50,000 troops is envisaged over a period of five years. I consider that the achievement of a strength of almost 16,000 troops within a period of little more than twelve months is a very fine effort. </para>

                        <para>- Yesterday, the honorable member for Wimmera directed a question to me in relation to a breakdown in the broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings from all stations at approximately 12.40 p.m. on Friday, the 7th October. The broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings from all stations on that day was interrupted from. 12.42 to 12.441/2 p.m. and from 12.49 to 12.511/4 p.m. The breakdown was due to a fault that developed in a rectifier at Goulburn. The broadcast is transmitted from Canberra, through Goulburn, to the test room, Postmaster-General's Department, Sydney, from which it is fed to the Australian Broadcasting Commission studio switchroom, Sydney, for distribution to 2BL, New South Wales, and to other States. Accordingly, any fault that develops between Canberra and Sydney affects the broadcast from all stations. </para>

It is proposed to erect a new three storey wing to the east, west and north of the existing structure, one additional floor over, the rear two story portion of the existing building and an additional floor and stairs to the animal house. This project was reported on by the Public Works Committee on the 1st August, 1945, following a recommendation made by the Minister representing the Minister for Health that it should be examined by the committee. The approval of the Parliament was not requested following the tabling of the committee's report, but as it is now desired to proceed with the first section of the work it is considered that in view of the increase in the estimated cost, the project should again be examined by the committee, especially having regard to the fact that in order to conserve housing material a steel frame construction has been substituted for construction in brick, as shown in the proposal examined by the committee. The total estimated cost approved by the committee in 1945 waa £77,881. The present estimate is £145,310, of which the first section is estimated to cost approximately £S1,000. I lay on the table plans of the proposed work. </para>

                <para class="block">As honorable members are aware, during the war it was necessary to supplement defence legislation with a large body of National Security Regulations. The greater part of these have already been allowed to lapse, or are now no longer required. A few, however, relate to matters of a continuing nature, and have an important bearing on the present and future administration of the services. The main purpose of this bill is to give legislative effect to the substance of such of the remaining National Security Regulations which are administered by the defence and service departments, as it is considered essential to continue in permanent form in the Defence Act. The bill thus forms an important part of the action necessary to be taken to bring to an end war-time legislation continued in the form of the Defence (Transitional Provisions) Act. Certain "other proposed amendments of an urgent nature, outside the scope of the National Security Regulations, have also been included in the bill. </para>
                <para>Some provisions of the measure concern the three services; others concern the administration of the Department of the Army only. A bill to amend the Naval Defence Act to give permanent legislative effect to the substance of certain National Security Regulations which relate only to the administration of the Department of the Navy, will be brought flown during these sittings by the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riordan)</inline> . The following National Security Regulations are now administered by the defence ana service departments: - National Security (Internment Camp) Regulations, National Security (Military Forces) Regulations, National Security (Naval Charter Rates) Regulations, National Security (Naval Forces) Regulations, National Security (Prisoners of War) Regulations, National Security (Women's Services) Regulations, certain regulations of the National Security (General) Regulations and National Security (Supplementary) Regulations. </para>
                <para>This bill and the measure to amend the Naval Defence Act which is to be brought down by the Minister for the Navy, incorporate the substance of such of these regulations as are still required, or provide for the making of similar regulations under the Defence Act or Naval Defence Act. From the 1st January, 1950, therefore, the regulations which I have mentioned will cease to operate under the Defence (Transitional Provisions) Act, except a few provisions of the general and supplementary regulations which are administered by the defence and service departments and which it is considered necessary to continue. The latter will be repealed as soon as possible after that date, and will be replaced by appropriate regulations to be made under the Defence Act as it is now proposed to be amended. This bill and the Naval Defence Bill deal with such National Security Regulations as are the sole concern of the defence and service departments. There are other regulations, however, such as the provisions of the National Security (General) Regulations which relate to the handling and conveyance of explosives, and the provisions of the National Security (Supplementary) Regulations which relate to the administration of the affairs of persons missing as a result of war operations, in which those departments are interested, but which are administered by other departments. Consideration is being given by the responsible departments to the taking of appropriate action in regard to these. </para>
                <para>Among matters now covered by National Security Regulations and for which this bill makes permanent provision  are the adjustment of ranks of members of the military forces after war service, which is covered by clause 4, and the unauthorized use, possession, or supply of uniforms and emblems. Clause 15 will strengthen the existing provisions of section S3 of the Defence Act in relation to the latter. In addition, it is proposed to amend section 124 of the Defence Act to enable regulations to- be made under that act to deal with the following matters which are now covered by National Security Regulations : - The suspension, variation, or cancellation of allotments of pay of members of the military forces; the extension of existing powers in the Defence Act to regulate and control buildings, &amp;c, in defence areas; certification of death and the post-mortem examination and disposal of the bodies of members of the defence f forces who die while on service ; prisoners <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> war ; command and discipline of bodies of the Naval, Military or Air Force or any two of those forces acting together; and provisions relating to the administration of oaths and the execution of powers of attorney by members of the defence forces. </para>
                <para>Apart from the provisions of the bill which arise out of National Security Regulations, the most important amendment proposed _ is that which relates to the composition of the Permanent Military Forces. In my statement to the Parliament on the 4th June. J 947, on the Government's post-war defence policy, I said that the army programme provided for the raising of permanent forces, including a field force, certain fixed establishments, and cadres for instructional, administrative and other duties. These forces, which are known as the Australian Regular Army, have been raised under war-time powers in the Defence Act which will cease as soon as a proclamation is issued terminating the " Time of War ". Section 31 of the act provides that, except in time of war, no permanent military forces shall be raised or organized except for administrative and instructional staffs, including certain specified corps. It is therefore proposed to repeal the existing section an-' to replace it with a section which will give the necessary statutory authority for the Australian Regular Army. </para>
                <para>Other provisions to which I invite the attention of honorable members are to be found in clause 14, which gives statutory recognition to the Australian Cadet Corps, and in clause 19 which regulates the appointment of officers to the Australian Regular Army. With the establishment for the first time of an Australian Regular Army, it is considered that the restrictions imposed by the existing section 148 of the act are too rigid, and the bill therefore provides such relaxation thereof as is considered necessary. It is intended that the amending act should commence on the 1st January, 1950, that being the date up to which the continuance of National Security Regulations is authorized by the Defence (Transitional Provisions) Act 1948. Provision is made in clause 20 of the bill for the continuance in force, under the Defence Act, of the National Security Regulations specified in that clause. These will be amended or repealed as soon as it is practicable to prepare and gazette new regulations under the Defence Act as now proposed to be amended. I commend the bill to honorable members. </para>

It is desired to have the necessary provision to enable the services of certain senior commissioned officers and commissioned officers who received their appointments by virtue of the National Security (Naval Forces) Regulations to be continued. Normally, those officers would not be eligible for employment, being over the prescribed age, or lacking some other qualification. However, owing to the acute shortage of officers in the Royal Australian Navy, it is essential that the services of the temporary officers be retained whilst new appointees are entered and trained. The efficiency of the Navy would be seriously affected should it become necessary to dispense with the services of temporary officers before it became possible to replace them. I point out that they are all volunteers for further service, and that none is being retained against his will. </para>
                    <para>Under the approved naval programme, many more permanent officers will be required than was the case in pre-war days. Every effort to obtain those officers is being explored, but it is not expected that the existing shortage will be overtaken for a number of years. The bill also gives power to the Governor-General to make regulations for the fixing ofcharter rates and establishment charges in respect of ships requisitioned for naval purposes. This will allow the making of regulations under the Naval Defence Act to replace the National Security (Naval Charter Rates) Regulations. Whilst most vessels requisitioned during the war have since been returned to their owners or have been otherwise disposed of, there are a few still under charter, and it is necessary to continue a charter rates board. The board is the authority for fixing charter rates and establishment charges in respect of requisitioned vessels. Owing to changing conditions, charter rates are altered from time to time, and it is therefore necessary for the Charter Rates Board to be in a position to function while vessels are still under requisition. It is unlikely that the last of the vessels will be derequisitioned before the end of 1950 at the earliest. I commend the bill to the House. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish to say a few words about a matter that concerns us very closely. I commend the Minister for Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> for his immigration policy. As usual, of course, he has not hidden his light under a bushel. From time to time, he has told us exactly what progress he has been making; but let us consider the figures. The Minister would have us believe that he is responsible for a flow of immigrants to this country at a rate which is without parallel in our history. For everything that he has done, and is doing to bring to this country immigrants who can be absorbed into the body politic, he is deserving of commendation, but I point out to him and to the country, that the results achieved so far are not satisfactory. Immigration to Australia throughout our history has ebbed and flowed. At times the stream of migrants has swelled to a rushing torrent, and at other times it has shrunk to a mere trickle. On occasions, the stream has dried up. During the period 1910-14, long before Australia had the advantage of the efforts of the present Minister, immigration attained proportions that have not been equalled since. During that quinquennial period no fewer than 048,512 migrants came to this country. The average rate of entry was 129,702 migrants a year. During the period 1946-48, when the honorable gentleman's scheme was in operation, 218,381 migrants entered this country. The average was 72,000 migrants a year. When we consider that the population of Australia during the years 1910 to 1914 averaged 4,940,000 and that to-day it is, according to the latest figures that are available, 7,794,000, we see very clearly that the results of the honorable gentleman's scheme, notwithstanding  the advantages that it has derived from his association with it, have proved to be distinctly disappointing. Between 1910 and 1914 Australia gained 648,512 persons, or slightly over one-eighth of the population at that time. One-eighth of the present population is 974,360 persons, but the actual gain that has been made under the Minister's scheme is approximately 218,000 persons. After the first World War, between 1919 and 1921 there was a net gain of 211,333 persons. Between 1946 and 1948 the net gain was 65,000 persons. If the excess of departures over arrivals in 1946 is deducted, the figure is 50,570. That is an average of 16,000 a year as against an average of <inline font-style="italic">70,000</inline> a year between 1919 and 1921. As I have said, I commend the Minister for his efforts to bring the right kind of people to this country, but I say to him that he ought not to grow weary with well doing. </para>

                            <para>have read with great interest a brochure entitled <inline font-style="italic">Policy and Progress</inline> that the Minister has made available to me. It is chiefly remarkable for the admirable photograph of himself that appears on the first page. I admit that he has enormous advantages over me in that respect. Candidly, I hand him the bun in that connexion. When I read thu brochure, which I did as part of my duty as a member of the Parliament, I found that the photograph was much the best part of it. But although migration is a most important factor, it has always played a subsidiary part the growth of population of this country. Tor over a century of our history it has borne the same relation to the growth of our population by natural increase as one bears to three. I am sure that the Minister has noticed, because few things escape his notice, that in days gone by the birth-rate in Australia which was, with the possible exception of New Zealand, the highest of any country in the English-speaking world had fallen to a dangerously low level. Lately it has taken an upward trend. For that, many thanks. I am not endeavouring now to deal with the birth-rate in detail. I am merely pointing out to the Minister that migration cannot, of itself, solve the problem. I am thoroughly alive to the point that although the birth-rate may swell our numbers, for a generation it will be unable to provide us with more people who are capable of co-operating in the development of our resources and, if need be, in the defence of this country. I remind the Minister that included in the 218,000 people who were brought to this country between 1946 and 1948, were a great many children. That remark applies, of course, to the migrants who were brought to this country before World War II. It is inevitable that the kind of people that we want will be people who bring children with them. The point I am endeavouring to make is that the situation in which Australia finds itself to-day is one that ought to cause every one of us great concern. Aft-r the first World War, the world had no experience of the effects of great conflicts. The victory had been won although at a great price. The fighting forces, of course, suffered enormously more casualties than they did during the war of 1939-45, although civilian casualties wen: much less. I was a delegate to the International Peace Conference, and the members of that conference believed that the world had before it then an unbroken vista of peace, and that it might confidently look to the League of Nations to iron out the differences and settle disputes between the nations that had formerly led to war. Our subsequent bitter experence taught us, however, that although the League of Nations was theoretically capable of preventing war, practically it proved a broken reed. Now we are confronted with a situation that is incomparably more menacing than that presented to us after World War I. Because no one can predict the future, I speak with some hesitation in this matter, but it cannot be denied that our present position must give us great concern. I point out to the Minister that "UNO", the United Nations organization, is simply another name for the " League of Nations ", and that where the League of Nations failed the United Nations cann -. hope to succeed. We have all been impressed by the contributions made by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> to entertain mankind with his injunctions to " Leave everything to United Nations organization. It can and will prevent another world war ". What has the United Nations done? What is it doing now? It is at once the most garrulous and futile of human institutions. Its members make speeches, but action is outside their ambit. This morning we have been fc"l » more of what it is doing. The fact remains that Russia takes no notice whatever of the United Nations. Russia knows perfectly well that the United Nations is impotent. I am not, of course., accusing the Minister for Immigration of worshipping at that shrine. I am merely pointing out that Australia is at once the most inviting and the most vulnerable country in the world. War may be averted because Russia is not yet ready to assault the world by armed force. One thing, however, cannot be averted, and to that I direct the attention of the Parliament and of the country: the world's population is increasing unevenly, and at c great pace. Australians are the heirs to and trustees of this vast island continent, which, although it contains a great area of barren waste, can absorb tens of millions of people, as the Minister has himself very properly pointed out. With others, I believe that the potentialities of this country have not yet been even envisaged. In the fullness of time, Australia must hold tens of millions of people. Time works great changes. Japan, which was our ally during World War I., was our enemy during the recent war, and came within an ace of overwhelming us. Indeed, but for the United States of America, the Japanese would have overwhelmed us. Previously we were shrouded in remote distance, and lay securely sheltered under the broad wing of the Royal Navy until the outbreak of World War II. The British Navy is no longer mistress of the seas, and sea-power itself has declined to a secondary place in defence. During the recent war Japan although defeated, suffered little material damage. The bombs that fell on Hiroshima and Nagasaki inflicted comparatively few casualties. The present population of Japan is the greatest on record and is increasing at the rate of over 1,000,000 people a year. I remind honorable members that Japan occupies an area only one-twenty-fifth of Australia whose population of 8,000,000 is increasing all too slowly - and here I come lo the point from which I set out. Whilst war may be averted, the danger that arises from the uneven distribution of population, and particularly from the tremendous increase of population in the densely congested nations of the east, must inevitably create a situation full of menace to this country. The present population of Japan is 80,000,000, and is, as I have said, increasing at the rate of over 1,000,000 annually. It has now reached saturation point. Japan can hold no more because she can feed no more, but still the increase of population continues. Where are those surplus millions to go? Where can they find a country at once so inviting and so vulnerable as Australia? What armed forces have we that can stop them? It may 'be that the Japanese will not come with arms in their hands, but will knock at the door of the United Nations, demanding a place in the sun and an opportunity to build homes in our country. Since the Japanese are human beings, what can the United Nations say? They have the right to live. That body will deal out even-handed justice. It can afford to regard this matter from a detached point of view. Fifty-four nations are represented in that body, but only four or five of them are able to strike an effective blow for anything, including their own defence. But they may decide our fate. However, if the Japanese come with arms in their hands, we cannot stop them. The days of isolation are gone. We have to play our part in the full spotlight of the world, which is looking on. The world will say : " Here is a people who will neither populate their country nor allow others to do so ". 1 have not the time nor the opportunity now to discuss our White Australia policy; it is enough for me to say, " I am for a White Australia policy ". </para>

                            <para>- I know what the Minister said against the Communists. I thought that his criticisms were very good. Indeed, I could have said those things myself. But a day or so later, when he is tackled in this chamber, he says that he will not prevent Australian Communists from going to Moscow. He claims that they have the right to be given a passport, and that he will grant them passports. The Communists are emissaries of Satan, and the Minister sends them out to do Satan's work. </para>

                            <para>- I should miss the honorable gentleman if he were not here. The point that I desire to make is that we are in no position to defend this country. Indeed, we have never been in a position to defend this country from aggression by a major power. Had it not been for the efforts of the United States of America in World War II., we should have been undone; and had Japan been permitted to settle its nationals in New Guinea, we should have been undone anyhow. War may be averted, but there is danger in the congested populations of the eastern countries in particular. For those surplus millions, there is no escape from death by starvation save by migration. They must find a way out, and I ask again where can they go but to Australia? What do we intend to do to prevent them? Without powerful friends we cannot hope to defend the country against them. We must populate and develop this country, and so order ourselves that the world will say, " The Australians are a people worthy of their freedom and of the right to the unfettered control of this great country, because they are carrying on as civilized people ". Every nation has the right to say who shall come in and who shall not come in, but a wellbred, civilized people do not slam the door in the face of migrants, and let it be seen that they think that they are superior to the nationals of other countries. We are now to play our part under the spotlight on the world stage before the nations of the world. Therefore, we must ensure that we shall be able, first to defend this country to the best of our ability, and, secondly, to develop its resources and absorb assimilable people. The Minister is trying to do that, and I commend him for it. </para>

                    <para>I now desire to make another point. If we are to hold this country we must populate and defend it. We must look to our defence forces. I' believe in the principle of a free people governing themselves. We in this country have attained the widest measure of freedom of any people in the world. We enjoy our democratic parliamentary, institutions, although mark you, they are threatened by the Labour party. </para>

                        <para>.- The right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> is worth listening to on the subject of migration. In fact, I listened to him with bated breath, because I suppose that he is the most spectacular British migrant that we have ever had in this country; but his incursions into the field of migration during this debate were extremely limited. He yielded to his well-known political cunning to traverse such subjects as the birth-rate, the defence of Australia, the United Nations, the White Australia policy and population trends, the development of the inland, the future of New Guinea, the possibility of another invasion, and communism. </para>

                            <para>- They all are associated subjects. I pay a tribute to the right honorable gentleman for havingmade the hest use of his time, and, if as he said, the sea is dotted with craft which are bringing British migrants to Australia, who knows but that there may beon the bounding ocean other right honorable members for North Sydney who will give us the benefit of their services in time to come. That appears to be the best answer, the unpolitical answer, to any criticism of the immigration scheme. Torefer back to the period from 1910 to 1914 and attempt to prove, by a group of" figures unrelated to any other period, that that was the era of the high tide in the golden age of immigration and that, comparatively speaking, there is only a trickle of immigrants to-day, is of no avail. If we accept the period from 1910 to 1914 for the purposes of comparison with the present, we must also take into consideration factors that were not mentioned by the right honorable member for North Sydney. Immigrants in those days were put on ships at the expense of either the Australian Government or the United Kingdom Government and were tumbled out on the wharfs of Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Fremantle and other ports and left to fend for themselves. The result of that policy was that, as the swelling tide had poured on to the wharfs and landing stages, so eventually many of the immigrants flooded the social welfare camps during the depression. </para>

                    <para>Any man who did any social work during the depression will realize that the poor little immigrant, who had been badly selected in the first place without any aptitude tests or anything of that sort, was the first one to go into our " Happy Valleys " and other such centres, where he was given the dole, some clothing and the lowest level of comfort. There can be no proper comparison between the two schemes in terms of numbers alone. Humanitarian treatment must be taken into account as well. Otherwise, the comparison is too remote even to be considered. In 1914, immigration was looked upon by the idealists as a means of increasing our population and developing the country for its eventual preservation and progress. It was also looked upon by others calmly and coldly, with the business-like eye of the man looking for cheap labour in order to break down workers' standards and destroy unionism. That made an ugly story. To-day we accept immigration as a subject above politics. I have always considered that repatriation, immigration, and two or three other subjects should be lifted above the level of politics, though not, of course, exempted from political discussion. Unfortunately, the tributes that are paid to the Minister for Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> by honorable members opposite are of a "yes but - " character. Every body admits that the honorable gentlen.an has done a splendid job in the face of competition from other countries, notably South Africa, New Zealand, and various 'South American States. Yet honorable members opposite say, " Yes, he has done a good job, but he has failed to do this or that ". </para>
                    <para>They link the arrival of immigrants with the White Australia policy and declare that the Minister has not handled that policy effectively. I consider that his outlook upon both immigration and the White Australia policy has been exceptionally broad and statesmanlike. Despite criticism from various sources, he has proved himself to be a great Australian in these matters. When, our present immigration scheme was commenced in 1945, our chances of obtaining new citizens from a bruised and broken Europe and from an England engrossed in the problems of reconstruction appeared to be almost hopeless. There is no royal road to success with immigration. We cannot wait until we have empty houses and everything else in readiness for immigrants. Nevertheless, the only thing that has been lacking has been adequate accommodation. Courage and statesmanship have enabled us to go ahead and to use the services of new arrivals in providing the things that we lack. Prospective immigrants are frankly told the truth about conditions in Australia. The story of this immigration scheme is one of the post-war epics. The project has been carried out efficiently and magnificently in spite of failures that have occurred elsewhere and in spite of the reluctance of people in Europe to undertake the long trek to Australia. We have overcome indecisions and the doubts of trade unions in Great Britain about mass immigration. Immigrant ships are leaving for Australia in increasing numbers, and the estimated net immigration figure for this year is 148,000. In view of the shortages that were caused by six years of war, that figure represents a magnificent achievement. </para>
                    <para>The difficulties involved in the immigration scheme are not confined to those of transporting people to Australia, but most of them have been satisfactorily overcome. As the right honorable member for North Sydney has said, we must anticipate certain new .(problems. For instance, the migration of people under the auspices of the International Relief Organization will eventually cease. From what other source will we be able to obtain migrants? Some people suggest Germany, Scandinavia, and Norway. There are many reasons why it will be difficult to persuade people to come to Australia from those countries. Therefore, we shall be obliged to turn to the surplus population of Great Britain. One of the really difficult decisions that must be made relates to the number of British migrants that will come to Australia. I predict that the numbers will grow and that the proportion of British immigrants to other European immigrants will become considerably higher during the next ten years than it is now. That will be all to our advantage. </para>
                    <para>The Australian attitude towards the nomination of British immigrants poses an administrative problem of which the Minister is well aware. The nomination of an immigrant, imposes a sacred duty. The nominator takes upon himself and his family the responsibility of providing for the accommodation of an immigrant or a number of immigrants without affecting the housing of native-born Australians. .Should the nomination system break down, as the result of insincerity on the part of nominators or nominees, bad feeling would be created and the scheme would be seriously prejudiced. At present, the nomination system is at the top of the news and is being treated idealistically. Exservicemen's organizations are sponsoring shiploads of British immigrants. The first sponsored ship to reach our shores was <inline font-style="italic">Somersetshire,</inline> which I met in Sydney on behalf of the Minister for Immigration. I was particularly impressed by the good type of ex-serviceman that the Returned Sailors Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia is bringing to Australia. At the back of my mind is the fear that Australians will not stand up rigidly to their responsibilities as nominators. It will not be sufficient for a nominator merely to bring an English immigrant into his home, bed him down for a few weeks until he becomes accustomed to his new surroundings and then tell him to try to find accommodation for himself. If we want to make Australia a greater, economically stronger and more progressive part of the Empire than it is now, Great Britain will supply the people that we need. It will be up to us to provide those people with an assurance of security of tenure, and we can do that only if we adhere strictly to the nomination system. It is only fair to insist that the native Australian shall have preference in obtaining housing accommodation, and the Government has done so. If new arrivals seek to break away from the nomination system and obtain houses which should be occupied by Australians, the system will break down. Then the Minister will face further problems. If the nomination system fails, he will have to decide what kind of immigrants he will bring to Australia from Europe and what proportion of new arrivals will be admitted from Great Britain. Those are the only potential flaws in the present scheme. </para>
                    <para>The right honorable member for North Sydney related the subject of immigration to the population tension in the East, to the United Nations policy in relation to the open door for coloured peoples, and to other subjects that have been discussed in Australia for more than 50 years. Neither the Minister for Immigration nor the Government as a whole has suggested that the immigration scheme provides the answer to our low birth-rate. Immigration is only a supplementary measure. However, it will bring many useful citizens to our shores. Up to date, the department has touched only the fringe of the potential field of recruitment. When the difficulties of transport are lessened, when Europe has settled down, and when we can find out exactly how many men and women are willing to come to Australia, great things can be done. Without being mealymouthed, we can pay a glowing tribute to the Minister for having done great work for our country. At the same time, he has done a great deal to ease the tensions of population and reconstruction difficulties that have caused a great deal of disturbance in Great Britain. Comparisons with the past or speculations about the future are futile. The Government's migration scheme is based, not on numbers, but on humanity. Immigrants, upon their arrival in Australia, are not left to fend for themselves, so that the weaker will go to the wall and the stronger succeed. That policy might have been accepted in the 'nineties, but the people of Australia to-day would not stand for it. Our immigration policy is geared to humanitarianism, and it is being applied efficiently. </para>
                    <para>There is a matter touching the administration of the Department of Immigration to which I, in justice to certain persons outside the Parliament, should refer. Recently, the Minister appointed, with my congratulations and those of many other Australians both inside and outside the , Parliament, a planning committee te. arrange accommodation and employment for immigrants. It was decided to utilize for this purpose some of the best business brains in Australia, and I pay a tribute to those who have co-operated so willingly. However, some newspapers took it for granted that the Immigration Advisory Council, of which I am  chairman,  had been disbanded. The honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lang)</inline> writing in the <inline font-style="italic">Century,</inline> that little journal which he produces for his own amusement - -because it has no circulation and no prestige - announced that the  chairman  of the Immigration Advisory Council had been sacked. Perhaps he felt that, as the leading figure in one of the greatest sacking incidents in the history of Australia, when he was sacked from his job as Premier of New South Wales one bright, summer morning by the Governor of that State, he was qualified to offer an opinion on the subject of sacking.  His  comments are immaterial to me except insofar as they affect other members of the council, which includes business men in Melbourne, Canberra, and Sydney, and representatives of organizations of ex-servicemen. The council consists of a group of persons with an instinct for planning and organization, who were gathered together to assist our immigration policy when it was first put into operation. It would be callous on my part not to make it clear that they have done a magnificent job. Although ' many of them hold political beliefs the opposite of my own, they have been completely loyal and tireless in their efforts to make the immigration policy work. I have in mind particularly <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oberg,</inline> who, being  president  of an organization of employers is not of my political kidney. No one could have received more loyal support or co-operation than I did from him when we were investigating migration problems in the United Kingdom and continental Europe. I also wish to pay a tribute to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. P.</inline> R. Wilkins, former secretary of the Associated Chambers of Commerce of Australia, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. L.</inline> Withal], secretary of the Associated Chambers of Manufactures of Australia. There are also on the committee members of the armed services who had grave problems to consider in connexion with . the admission of exenemies. Although their feelings had been bruised by their war-time contacts with ex-enemy nationals, they did a magnificent job as members of the Immigration Advisory Council. It ill becomes a member of this Parliament, who happens to conduct a newspaper, to assail any of the members of the council. If only for the reason that the council has no political affiliations, I am glad that the Minister for Immigration has stated publicly that the work of the council will go on. Members of the council have a fine feeling for the future welfare of their country, and an intense willingness to cooperate in furthering the country's immigration policy. Those qualities are too valuable to be lost, and I take this opportunity to place on record my tribute to the work done by members of the council. </para>
                    <para>A' tremendous amount of work remains to be done in the field of immigration. Neither the Opposition in this Parliament, nor any other section of the Australian people, is justified in attacking the Minister for Immigration for his rigid administration of the Immigration Act. It is all very well to make exclusions into spirituality and liberalism - spelt with a small " 1 " - but the Minister's job is to administer the law. If too much publicity has been given to the way in which the law has been administered, it is the fault not of the Minister but of those who have seized on the situation in order to obtain cheap, emotional effects. Clergymen have decorated their sermons with appeals about humanity, when next door are seething slums, the inhabitants of which are much closer to them than are the evacuees who are being sent back to their own countries in accordance with an arrangement into which they themselves entered. It is beside the point for people, who adopt a hypocritical, supersensitive attitude to the White Australia policy to charge the Minister with committing an administrative <inline font-style="italic">faux pas.</inline> Such attacks may do very well for a press story or to adorn a sermon but deep in the hearts of all Australians is a feeling that we should make no concession on the White Australia policy. </para>
                    <para>The right honorable member for North Sydney reminded us of his 50 years' experience in this Parliament, and he repeated what had been said at various times during that period. I claim that we have much to show for our immigration policy, and we have a plan for the future. That policy is our answer to the call of the empty spaces of this continent. The Government, in its application of the White Australia policy, is applying the law, and adhering to tradition. Prom the first days of federation, the settled policy of Australia has been to keep Australia free and white. </para>

                        <para>. - Immigration ought to be a non-party matter in this Parliament, and it has been treated substantially in that way. In general, the policy of the Minister for Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell),</inline> in taking advantage of the unique opportunity to obtain a large flow of immigrants from Europe, has met with the approval of honorable members of all parties. I am sure that if the forthcoming general election should result in a change of government, the same policy will be continued, because we all recognize the need to populate and develop the country. Having regard to the changed attitude towards population among the white races, it is necessary for us to increase our numbers by bringing here surplus population from Europe. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>It is a great pity, however, that the Minister should have thought it necessary, in administering his department, to behave as he has towards the very few Asiatics, or persons of Asiatic extraction, who were resident in Australia. This handful of persons has been the cause of much dissension and international ill feeling. The Minister's treatment of them has appeared to put us in the wrong, and has earned for us a reputation for being harsh and intransigent on the subject of colour, and has done nothing to strengthen the White Australia policy or obtain acceptance for it. It has  highlighted  the objection to colour that is inherent in the White Australia policy, and publicized that objection to our disadvantage throughout the world, particularly in Asiatic countries. On more than one occasion the Minister himself has said that the term " White Australia " should not be used, yet he has made use of it more than any one else. I regret that his fine record in developing migration from Europe should be marred by these incidents which, in themselves,, are of a minor nature. In one instance a few persons may be involved, or in another instance 27 Chinese, or individual persons as in the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Aug</inline> and that of <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. O'Keefe.</inline> Those incidents do not really amount to anythingin our immigration policy, and the Government should exercise a little discretion in matters of that kind. </para>
                    <para>Dealing with the proposed vote for the Department of External Territories I wish to discuss what I consider to be the very harsh and unsympathetic treatment that the Government has meted out to widows of civilians who lost  their lives  when the Japanese captured Rabaul. It is well-known that the lives of practically all civilians who were at Rabaul at the time the Japanese attacked were wilfully thrown away by the Australian Government. I say "wilfully" becausethose civilians had no hope pf defendingRabaul. I am not now talking about the armed forces. At that time there was sufficient shipping in the harbour toevacuate the civilian population, but the Curtin Government ordered that those civilians should remain at Rabaul. TheActing Administrator of New Guinea radioed to Australia to obtain permission to evacuate those civilians, but that request was refused. Consequently, when the Japanese struck, many of the civilians were killed whilst the remainder werecaptured. In the fullness of time their fate was revealed. Ultimately, after a considerable period, it was discovered that a great many of those who survived the Japanese attack lost their lives when <inline font-style="italic">Montevideo Maru</inline> was sunk. During the period that their fate remained unknown, the Government made liberal payments to widows of male civilians on the basis of the salary that the latter had been receiving. However, when hostilities ended an accounting was made to those widows and in each instance where it was possible, to get back money paid to them in excess of the ordinary pension rate of from £2 10s. a week the Government took action to recover such moneys. In some instances it did so by making deductions from payments that the widows were entitled to draw as superannuation benefits for which their late husbands had contributed. I am in possession of several statements issued by the Department of External Territories that show that some of these widows, instead of receiving a very substantial amount, in some cases hundreds of pounds, in the form of superannuation benefit, received practically nothing at all after these deductions had been made by the Government. I trust that the Government will see that justice is done to these widows, and I propose to show how it can do so. </para>
                    <para>First, however, I draw attention particularly to the case of Captain H. Edwards, M.C., D.O.M., M.M., whose widow now lives in Sydney. Captain Edwards had a distinguished military record in World War I. I read the following quotation from a letter that he received from General Birdwood : - </para>

                    <para class="block">I should like to tell honorable members how the Government treated the widow of that gallant officer. He was at Rabaul at the time that the Japanese struck. </para>
                    <para class="block">He had been residing there for many years previously and was second in command of the New Guinea Volunteer Regiment a few months before the Japanese invasion. He was  president  of the Rabaul branch of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia. However, because at the time of invasion he was not in military uniform as the result of some dispute that had occurred between himself and others in the military forces at Rabaul, he was not considered to have been a soldier at the time of his death. Consequently, despite the fact that the estate of anybody who died as a soldier was exempt from estate duty, <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Edwards</inline> was charged duty amounting to £67 on her husband's estate which was valued at £700. She had to pay that duty because her husband was not considered to have been a soldier at the time of his death. I am in possession of the documents in the case and I shall be pleased to pass them on to the Minister. I suggest that the following provision, which is set out in a letter which <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Edwards</inline> has received from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Olive</inline> Evatt, a Minister in the New South Wales Government, should apply in this instance - </para>

                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">Captain Edwards was at Rabaul when the Japanese struck. He was the most highly decorated soldier at Rabaul and he lost his life because the Government refused permission for civilians to be evacuated. Because he was not considered to have been a soldier at the time of his death, his widow has had to pay the penalty. She has also been denied the rate of pension payable to the widow of an officer, which is considerably more than that payable to widows of civilians. The Government can do justice in this case. Evidence given in the New Guinea timber leases case revealed that the Minister can apply the provisions of an ordinance retrospectively. The particular ordinance cited in that case was Ordinance No. 5 of 1947, being " an ordinance to amend the Workers' Compensation </para>
                    <para class="block">Ordinances 1941 of the Territory of New Guinea That ordinance increased the amount of maximum compensation from £750 to £1,000. It was dated the 14th May, 1947, under the signature of the Governor-General and issued by " E. J. Ward, Minister of State for External Territories ". In evidence given during the New Guinea timber leases case it was stated that one person who was favorably affected by the back-dating of that ordinance was a friend, or relative, of the Minister for External Territories. A notable feature of the amendment effected by that ordinance was that its commencement was made retrospective to the 1st January, 1947; that is, it was backdated five months in order, so it was alleged in evidence given in the New Guinea timber leases case, to cover the circumstances of a friend, or relative, of the Minister for External Territories. I have no evidence to offer in support of that statement except the evidence that was given in the course of the trial that I have mentioned. However, in view of the facts I have given I shall not believe that it is not possible for the Government to do justice to the widows of civilians who lost their lives when the Japanese captured Rabaul. Those civilians were at Rabaul as the representatives of Australia. I shall not agree that the Government cannot recognize <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Edwards's,</inline> claim and refund the death duty that has been charged to her on account of the estate of her husband, or that she cannot be given the rate of pension payable to the widow of an officer, because her case has been settled. I shall not accept these excuses when I find that remedial action can be taken to benefit somebody who happens to enjoy a favoured position with the Minister. Those are facts. </para>

                        <para>.- As 1 have insufficient time to deal with the Department of Immigration and the Department of External Territories, I content myself with saying that I strongly support the remarks of the honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony)</inline> about the treatment of the widows of civilians killed in New Guinea during the war. The Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Barnard),</inline> who was interjecting during the speech of the honorable member for Richmond, knows that a few weeks ago I asked why the widows and dependants of men who had lost their lives in the civil service of New Guinea had not received full repatriation benefits. I asked that he confer with the Minister for External Territories on the subject. I do not know on which Minister the blame lies, but 1 do know that it lies on the Government as a whole. The Minister knows that the widows of those men do not receive medical benefits; although war widows do. They do not have the opportunity to obtain a war service home, although war widows do. Those are just two instances of the disparity between the treatment of those widows and war widows. I hope that there will be no further equivocation. </para>

                        <para>. - Before attempting to approve of the proposed vote for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, which includes the provision of £33,000 for investigation of nuclear energy, the committee should pay close attention to circumstances connected with this organization. Although the Government has placed the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization under administrative control of the Public Service Board, quite obviously it is still clouded with a certain amount of suspicion. At the recent conference in Canada in relation to atomic energy research, although representatives of the United States of America, Canada and the United Kingdom were present, it is significant that Australia was not represented. That highlights certain matters that were revealed in this chamber not long ago when it was shown that there still exists in the minds of people associated with atomic energy research a grave suspicion that if secret developments in the field of nuclear energy were made available to Australia, that information might leak out to Soviet Russia. That was the basis of a lengthy debate during which certain documents were produced that caused an immense amount of public interest. It seems to me that that suspicion still exists in the minds of people overseas. Australia is still excluded from the inner councils of the world powers in relation to atomic research for purposes of defence. That is not to be wondered at. Although, under pressure, the Government removed the aeronautical section of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research from its matrix and placed it under the administration of the Public Service Board, suspicion has not been allayed in the minds of our allies overseas who are closely associated with us in preserving the peace of the world. The reason is not hard to discover. From time to time honorable members have learned of the appointment of Communists to what was the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. Although the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> did not select the appointees, he approved of their appointment. He approved of a studentship being granted to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kaiser,</inline> who was sent overseas to further his studies in the field of nuclear physics. After he had attended at Oxford University for about eighteen months, it was revealed that he was a Communist. He distinguished himself by taking part in a demonstration of Communists at Australia House in London while still a student and under the control of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization. That was a demonstration by Communists against the action that had been taken by this Government in connexion with the coal strike. By taking part in that demonstration he revealed himself as a militant Communist. </para>

                    <para>From time to time honorable members on the Government side of the chamber have declared that every care is taken to screen persons before they are appointed to positions in connexion with defence work investigation, about which secrecy must be maintained. It is apparent that either this man was not screened before appointment, or that he was appointed by the Government in the full knowledge that he was a Communist, and was then deliberately sent overseas to take part in nuclear investigation. He was reported to have been a research officer with the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research for six years in Sydney. Indeed the Minister for Postwar Reconstruction told honorable mem' bers on another occasion that during the war period <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kaiser</inline> had been engaged on very close investigations of these matters, and that there was no reason to believe that he had divulged any secrets about them. </para>

                    <para class="block">This young Communist forsook his loyalty to this country when he made a protest in London about the manner in which Australia was conducting its affairs. If he had been told that the coal strike was a sinister attempt on the part of agents of a hostile power to undermine our industrial, potential, would Kaiser still have refused to undertake secret research into atomic energy? I believe that if this young man had been given an oppor tunity to pursue his investigations of the most secret matters he would not have refrained from doing so because he has no loyalty to this country. He also said - </para>

                    <para class="block">I believe that this statement by Kaiser should be placed on record in support of the Minister's statement that this young man had been engaged in secret work during the war period, when many secrets were jointly held by Soviet Russia, the United States of America, and the United Kingdom. When Russia determined to wage a cold war against the democracies, the position became quite different. Notwithstanding that the Government knew of this young man's convictions, it sent him overseas to undertake most secret research in the field of nuclear energy. By taking part ill the demonstration he proved that he has no love for his country and that he is prepared to take any action to discredit it in the eyes of the world so as to further the objectives of communism. It is regrettable that the taxpayers' money should be wasted on studentship benefits to a young man, who, while enjoying their advantages, sought to bring his country into disrepute. It is true that after he had publicly revealed himself as a Communist and a man opposed to the interests of his country, his studentship was determined. If he had not taken part in the demonstration, this avowed Communist, whose convictions were well known to the Government, would still be employed in an overseas laboratory conducting investigations regarding nuclear energy, and would be in a position to obtain secret information which would be of value to a potential enemy. That information might well have been sent to Soviet Russia. Is it any wonder that Australia is denied admittance to discussions held by the great democratic countries of the world, including a country which cannot boast as we do, that its peoples are of 90 per cent. British stock ? Australia is  excluded  from participation in such discussions because the Australian Government is still suspect. Notwithstanding what may be said to the contrary by the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction, those whom the Government appoints to positions in which they are given access to secret and vital information are not effectively screened. I have no doubt that the Minister will claim that all those who are associated with secret defence work now have to take the oath of allegiance. That may be true ; but does the honorable gentleman claim that the mere taking of an oath of allegiance will make a man trustworthy? He knows very well that Communists do not regard themselves as being bound by an oath of allegiance. Only recently honorable members opposite have questioned the value of administering an oath of allegiance to a Communist. I draw attention to this matter in order to emphasize the need for the closest scrutiny of the credentials of all those who are employed on work of a secret character. There is something wrong with the administration of a government which permits the taxpayers' money to be expended on the provision of studentships for known Communists. Kaiser was appointed as a research student in the field of nuclear energy at a time when, as far as we know, Russia did not possess the secret of the atomic bomb. Russia now claims to have probed the secret of the bomb. I wonder how much of the knowledge which the Soviet now claims to possess came from representatives of the democratic countries who were working as a part of Soviet Russia's fifth column. Honorable members will recall the disclosures that were made at the investigation held recently in the United States of America in regard to Communist activities. They will also remember that quantities of uranium of certain grades were flown from America to Russia. Leakages of vital strategic materials from the democratic countries have taken place with too much frequency. The Government cannot be too exacting in its screening of the persons selected to go overseas to carry out secret research work. We have been told about the  Pomeroys,  the  Rudkins,  and other Communists that were employed in the organization formerly known as the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. We all recall the revelations that were made by the Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> concerning statements that . were made at a meeting of Empire Prime Ministers at Downing-street, and we remember also the statements that were made in relation to this subject by the Minister for Defence at a meeting of the executive of the former Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. These revelations lend colour to the remarks that I have just made. Until such time as Australia is again brought into the discussions of the democratic nations in relation to matters of the highest defence significance, the Australian Government will remain suspect. The Minister for Postwar Reconstruction and the Government have done nothing whatever to dispel the distrust of Australia which is manifest in high defence circles overseas. </para>

                        <para>. - The honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> baa repeated a number of allegations that have been made on several occasions in this chamber notwithstanding that they were refuted whenever they were made.  His  allegations against the Government are completely without foundation. He has referred to the activities of an individual named Kaiser and to the attitude which, he suggests, has been taken by the United States of America in relation to certain meetings between representatives of the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. The latter subject was raised by way of question in this chamber some time ago and the position was then fully explained. In spite of that, however, the honorable member persists in repeating assertions which are quite untrue. For the benefit of honorable members, I shall again explain the position in relation to the association of the United States of America with the United Kingdom and Canada in atomic energy research. During the war period, there was an agreement between the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States of America to share information on the development of the atomic -bomb, and to co-operate in that work. No other country in the world was invited to take part in the joint deliberations, or to assist in the project. The undertaking was completely secret, and all information about it was withheld from every other country. The work was confined to the three countries that I have named because it was so important that no risk of the secrets of the atomic bomb being revealed to the outside world could be taken. The United Kingdom was able to contribute something to the development of the atomic bomb. Canada too was able to make a contribution. Australia could not contribute anything, and therefore was not invited to participate in the work in any way. At the end of the war, the United States of America made it clear that the agreement under which work on the atomic bomb had been carried out co-operatively during the war had ended, and ceased to make available any information on atomic energy to the United Kingdom and Canada. From that time onwards, the United States of America worked on the atomic bomb in isolation. Since then, however, certain developments have occurred both in the United Kingdom and Canada, and the knowledge of how to manufacture the atomic bomb has become more widespread. There is no longer any secret about it. As I have said in this chamber on many occasions, any nation that is prepared to devote the necessary scientific and industrial resources to the manufacture of the atomic bomb could achieve some measure of success in a reasonable period of time. Australia itself, with the knowledge that can be read in pamphlets and books could, if it had the necessary scientific and industrial resources - at present it has not - manufacture the atomic bomb without the assistance of the United States of America or any other country. That is the plain truth as physicists and others who have studied atomic energy know. As I have said, for some time after the war, the United States of America worked on the bomb in isolation, but now that so much is known in other countries about the atomic bomb and atomic energy for industrial purposes, the United States of America has apparently decided that once again it will endeavour to work in cooperation with the United Kingdom and Canada on certain projects. That is why, I imagine, those two countries have been invited to attend a conference. Australia is not interested in the development of the atomic bomb, because, a3 I have said, we have neither the scientific nor the industrial resources to set aside for that purpose, consequently we have no wish to be represented at the conference, even if we were invited to do so. The absence of an invitation does not mean that Australia is mistrusted. The meeting simply represents the reintroduction of the arrangement which operated between the three countries during the war. Australia has not been invited, not because of any distrust, but simply because we cannot make any contribution to the development of the atomic bomb and do not wish to do so. </para>

What is the good of worrying about developing a weapon of that kind when we have not the resources to produce it even if we had the necessary knowledge  1  Surely it is clear that, in the circumstances, the Government of this country would not wish to have any information about the production of the atomic bomb. We are, however, interested in the development of atomic energy for industrial purposes, and we are undertaking certain work in that connexion. We hope with the arrival of Professor Oliphant in Australia to be able to make a valuable contribution to the development of industrial atomic energy, but again, in that sphere we do not require any information from the United Kingdom, Canada or the United States of America. Certain technical problems - I shall not attempt to explain them - in relation to the use of atomic energy for industrial purposes, have to be overcome. Those problems Iia ve not yet been solved in other countries which have a substantial lead over Australia but, with that eminent scientist, Professor Oliphant, in charge of work here, we shall have, perhaps, a better chance than most other countries &lt;of solving those difficulties, because of certain local climatic conditions and the fact that we have isolated areas for experimental purposes. We intend to work on those lines. </para>

                            <para>- Approximately two years ago. In order that honorable gentlemen opposite should not have an opportunity to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Don</inline> Mountjoy had any responsibility in this matter, I made it clear in this chamber that at the time when the selection was made there were only four members of the executive of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research and that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Don</inline> Mountjoy was not one of them. Although I went into all that detail about the matter then, the honorable member for Wentworth has stated the position in a completely false manner in this chamber this afternoon. He has done that knowingly and wilfully. The honorable gentleman does not care what he says as long as he is able, by the publicity that the press in this country and overseas gives to his statements, to bring discredit upon an organization that has done a great deal for Australia. I also made it clear in this chamber that during the war <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kaiser</inline> was engaged upon very secret work. I made that statement in order to show that the executive of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research had some justification for selecting him for the scholarship. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kaiser</inline> was a very brilliant student at the University of Melbourne. I think that he graduated in 1943, and was one of the most brilliant students of his year. He then undertook work in the radiophysics division of the Council for Scientific and Industrial </para>

Those contributions were of great assistance to Australia and the Allies in the conduct of the war. During the whole of the time that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kaiser</inline> was engaged upon that valuable work there was never any question of his integrity. That is demonstrated by the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Tizard and certain security officers from the United Kingdom made it quite clear to the Prime Minister of this country, and, indeed, made public statements to the same effect, that there was no question of any details of the work that had been undertaken by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research being divulged to anybody. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kaiser</inline> was a brilliant student who had done very valuable work. The executive of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research decided that he was the best individual to send overseas for this purpose. It was hoped that when he returned to Australia he would be able to make even greater contributions to scientific research work in this country. </para>

That statement is completely untrue. I have received a letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Sir David</inline> Rivett to the effect that he and the other members of the executive were quite unaware of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kaiser's</inline> political affiliations when they selected him for the scholarship. Two persons have made statements upon this matter. Apparently <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kaiser</inline> had done so, although the honorable gentleman has only read from a newspaper report, and I have received a letter on the subject from <inline font-weight="bold">Sir David</inline> Rivett. I know which of those two individuals I believe, and I know which of them the public will believe. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir David</inline> Rivett, the executive of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research was not aware of any affiliation that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kaiser</inline> may have had with the Communist party before he left Australia. According to information that I have received from London, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kaiser</inline> does not admit even now that he is a member of the Communist party, and the honorable member for Wentworth has not produced any evidence to show that he was a Communist when he left Australia. The honorable* gentleman has suggested, in effect, that the executive of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization or of any other body that selects people in this country for scholarships or for scientific research work should be gifted with foresight and should be able to foresee whether a young man will, at some time or other, change his political philosophy and become a member of the Communist party. </para>

                        <para>. - The Government has allotted only 2£ hours for the consideration of the Estimates for the Department of Labour and National Service, the Department of Transport, the Department of Information, the Department of Post-war Reconstruction and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization. Some honorable members, and particularly Ministers have monopolized the time that has been available for the dissection of the Estimates of various departments. This afternoon, the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> used the same arguments as he employed on another occasion in an endeavour to extricate himself from a shocking situation. A young man, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kaiser,</inline> who was a member of the staff of the Commonwealth 'Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, participated in a Communist demonstration in London, to the shame of all loyal Australians. Although the Minister made a long statement about the matter, he did not clarify the position, and he obviously became annoyed because the honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> ventured to' raise it. Instead of monopolizing the brief period that has <inline font-style="italic">\wv.</inline> allotted for consideration of  the  Estimates for these five departments, he should have chosen a more appropriate time to endeavour to clear himself. </para>

                            <para>- I sincerely regret the unfortunate circumstances that are responsible for the Minister's absence, but I repeat my view that if the circumstances were normal, he would probably be hobnobbing with some Liberal Premier discussing the standardization of railway gauges. The Minister is determined to pursue that policy. With the devaluation of the Australian pound, the original estimate of the cost of that project has been increased from £200,000,000 to £325,000,000, and higher costs of labour may further increase the ultimate figure to £400,000,000. The advantages of the standardization of railway gauges are questionable, and I consider that the money would be expended more wisely in providing so many of the facilities that are urgently required for the development of many parts of Australia. The project that is envisaged by the Minister will replace State railway assets that have already cost £600,000,000. He plans to replace many of the existing railway lines, locomotives and rolling stock, and he is eager t.o begin the wo'rk at a time when we cannot get sufficient iron and steel for wire netting to prevent vermin and stock from  destroying  our crops. At present, the States are importing scores of new  locomotives,  and quantities of spare parts and rolling stock. They are unable to manufacture those requirements in their own workshops because constant strikes in the basic industries have reduced the production of iron and steel. Last week, the Minister was negotiating to make available to the State Premiers of South Australia and Western Australia tens of millions of pounds in connexion with the project for the standardization of railway gauges. I hope that the Government will not proceed with that work but will expend at least some of the money on more advantageous projects. </para>

                    <para>The limited time does not permit me to deal at greater length with the subject of the standardization of railway gauges, and I now direct my remarks to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization. I have a high opinion of that body. Having been well-founded, it is one of the most valuable institutions in the Commonwealth. The staff includes many prominent scientists, and probably a few Communists have worked themselves into its organization. I urge the Government to increase the proposed vote for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization so that it may investigate methods for destroying the pests and vermin that are doing almost incalculable damage in the agricultural and stock-raising industries. The primary producers of Europe, and, in particular, of Canada., receive wonderful assistance from the application of scientific methods to combating pests, diseases and vermin. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization should be encouraged to devote more attention to those matters of practical value instead of to the theoretical side, which compiles reports for universities and students about what happens behind the moon, and in the moon. We should keep our feet on the earth in these matters. Whilst the Commonwealth .Scientific and Industrial Research Organization may be justified in investigating the effects of gases around Mars, or some other planet, il would render inestimable service to our primary industries if it were to solve the problems of the man on the land. If science could destroy the pests and vermin, many of the troubles that beset primary producers would dinappear, and young men would have a greater incentive to remain in the agricultural and pastoral industries. Even in Soviet Russia, agricultural research  is well advanced, and successful experimentation has enabled special varieties of fruits, wheat and potatoes, to be produced even in the snow-bound regions. Primary producers in Australia do not derive all possible practical advantages from the researches of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization. When I raised this matter on a previous occasion, I pointed out that the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, as it was then known, had complained that lack of money was restricting such investigations. I hope that the grounds for that complaint have been removed. I could speak at much greater length on these matters, but as I realize that other honorable members desire to express their views  on  the Estimates for these departments, I shall not prevent them from doing so. </para>

                        <para>.- 1 emphasize the importance of developing irrigation projects in Australia. The Commonwealth is now providing a substantial sum of money for university and general education, and I stress the importance of establishing an agricultural college to instruct students in irrigation processes. In the past, Australians have wasted their limited resources of water because they did not understand soil conditions. However, we are now waterininded. Next week  His Excellency  the Governor-General will turn the first sod to mark the beginning of *the work on the greatest hydro-electric scheme that has been undertaken in the history  of  Australia, and, therefore, the time is opportune for the Government to consider the advantages of training young men in irrigation processes. The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> has already done a magnificent job with the Commonwealth re-establishment and employment scheme, and it is largely to his credit that ex-service men and women have made such progress in their training to fit themselves for various occupations. In the interests of Australia, some of our young men should be instructed in irrigation work. Water conservation projects in Australia include the Snowy  Mountains  scheme, and Burdekin Valley scheme in Queensland, and a huge undertaking in Western Australia. </para>

                    <para class="block">In the irrigation areas on the Murrumbidgee I have seen young orchards, just when they were about to come into production, pulled out because the ground had become waterlogged. That sort of thing will happen again unless our young people are taught the proper use of water. lt does not matter what it costs to teach them ; the expenditure will be well worthwhile. We have been told that the population of Australia, may be 15,000,000 or even 20,000,000 within a comparatively few years, and it has been suggested that it may become necessary to import food. We are now on the verge of a period of great development in water conservation projects, so that it becomes more important than ever that our young men should be taught how <inline font-style="italic">to use</inline> the water properly. I suggest that a training school should be established at Yanco, in New South Wales, and at suitable places in other States. I agree with everything the honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bernard Corser)</inline> said about the need to apply the discoveries of scientific men to the. primary producing industries. The scientists have done magnificent work. They have developed varieties of wheat that are drought and frost resistant. There are still many problems confronting the primary producers, and they can be solved only with the help of scientists. </para>

                        <para>.- I direct attention to the giant propaganda machine that has been established by the Government. It uses large quantities of paper that is badly needed by newspapers and for the publication of books. Many authors find it impossible to have their works published because of the shortage of paper, yet government departments are churning out great quantities of propaganda, or " blah " books, as they are called. I have one here entitled <inline font-style="italic">Ten Years of War and Peace.</inline> issued under the authority of the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway).</inline> The cover carries a picture of the Minister himself, looking very coy. One might be pardoned for thinking that the publication discusses Australia's development; but it is, in fact, pure propaganda for the Minister. Some time ago, I asked what was the cost of the publication, and who had printed it. In all the States, there is a law which provides that  publications shall bear the name of the printer; but this Government is, apparently, above all law. The contents of the booklet are being broadcast over the radio stations by Labour aspirants for political honours. The Minister has used public money to print Labour party propaganda, which should have been paid for by the Labour party. I turned the booklet over to a research organization in order to get an opinion on the facts presented in it. </para>

                    <para>It is claimed in the booklet that there is a feeling of security and general prosperity in Australia. The research organization comments on this claim as follows : -  . . Just how secure the worker is in his employment was graphically illustrated during the recent general coal strike when the number of unemployed in New South Wales and Queensland exceeded that at the height of the depression. Even before the strike commenced, unemployment in New South Wales exceeded 250.000 because of the rains which occurred in the mining areas and the necessity to introduce some form of rationing of coal supplies so that essential services could be maintained for a short period. There were no reserves of coal. </para>
                    <para>There are still no reserves of coal, and the Government refuses to do anything to establish a reserve by importing coal lest it might interfere with the miners' federation. The Government does not admit that as a reason, of course. The comment continues as follows: - </para>

                        <para>Prosperity, from the viewpoint of the Minister, is apparently synonymous  with  inflation, as the only prosperity which Australia possesses is a high national income unaccompanied by production of those things which income can purchase. National income in  monetary  terms has increased from £814,000,000 in 1938-39 to £1,915,000,000 in 1948-49, an increase of 135 per cent. In the same period production has increased overall only from 5 per cent, to 10 per cent. </para>

                    <para class="block">But taxation has increased by 550 per cent. In his booklet, the Minister discusses the Postmaster-General's Department. He points out that the department made a profit of £3,500,000 in 193S, and of £5,103,000 in 1947, but he does not say that in 1949, for the first time since federation, it will operate at a loss. This Government does not believe in the profit motive. Apparently, it believes in the loss motive. Certainly it is achieving losses in the running of Government airlines, as the honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> has pointed out. The Minister for Civil Aviation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Drakeford)</inline> has also issued a booklet. It is called <inline font-style="italic">Post-war Aviation,</inline> and it carries a picture of the Minister on the cover. One would think that the Labour party had just discovered aviation. The honorable member for Flinders showed how the balance-sheet of the Government's air service had been falsified. </para>

Bearing the title he does, he should have a high regard for facts ; but, as .a matter of fact, he should be more properly called the " Minister for Mis-information ". Trans-Australia Airlines, which had the benefit of £3,500,000 of capital free of interest, showed a loss of over £500,000 on the first year's operations. I have here another booklet which bears the title <inline font-style="italic">Homes- for Australia.</inline> It looks as if it had been issued by a prosperous publishing house. But it is sheer propaganda by the Government that should be paid for out of the Labour party's funds and not by the people of Australia. Another booklet was referred to by the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes).</inline> It deals with immigration. I do not detract from what the Minister for Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> has done. He has done a good job in some respects. He is following the lead set by the previous government. We have a refugee scheme and a nomination scheme. The Minister is doing well in regard to displaced persons, but a new phase has arisen regarding British immigration. Nominators of British migrants are running out. Many who would like to come to Australia from Great Britain cannot come because they cannot get any one to nominate them. I should like to see a chapter in the Minister's next booklet about what the Government intends to do about the immigration of British subjects. </para>

                            <para>- Next year? The honorable gentleman will not be responsible for immigration matters then. The succeeding government will have that responsibility. The Minister has lost great opportunities to bring British migrants to Australia. Another government publication is issued by the Department of Commerce and Agriculture. It tells merchants where they can sell their goods. I am confident that merchants are more aware of markets for their goods than any officials in Canberra could be. Another publication comes from the Department of Post-war Reconstruction, which is administered by the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman).</inline> In that publication he does not tell about the thousands of ex-servicemen who did not receive the vocational training that they were promised, because a Communist union boss named Bulmer decided that the industry in which they were to have been trained had reached saturation point and that no more ex-servicemen were needed for training in it. So those ex-servicemen remained unskilled. Honorable gentlemen opposite know how true that is, because the honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis)</inline> has given the facts and the figures. Members of the Government are claiming that they have clone well by Australia, whereas they know that Australia's prosperity to-day results from the fortuitous circumstances of high prices for our exports. Should those prices collapse, as they well may, the succeeding government will have fo adjust the difficulties. I object to the unethical way in which the Government is pouring out propaganda at the expense of the taxpayers. The Minister for Immigration blandly smiles. He thinks it is all in the game. Looking after the people's money is not a game, but a trusteeship that should be taken seriously. Another instance of the unethical attitude of the Government was provided in the admission of the Minister for Informa tion that the cost of the Government's propaganda in connexion with a recent referendum were met from the vote for Post-war Education. The Government is soft-pedalling on socialism these days. It is concentrating on issuing booklets designed to tell the people what splendid men the Commonwealth Ministers are. If those gentlemen get by in the general election, they will be petty despots again. The Commonwealth Electoral Act provides that no honorable members shall make certain payments within three months of the general election with a purpose of ensuring their re-election. Yet every Cabinet Minister is shooting out sheaves of booklets that have that very purpose. I refer also to the booklet dealing with social services. Last week, I asked how many copies of the booklet had been ordered, what they had cost, and why they were finding their way into the offices of trade unions. I also asked whether any more copies were to be ordered. I was told that 500,000 had been ordered and that their cost was £8,000 and that another 500,000, which would also cost £8,000, had been ordered. The gist of the reply to a question about the booklets having found their way into the hands of Labour organizations was : " We did not deliberately send them to Labour organizations. If they stamp ' Vote Labour ' all over them, that is their business ". It is more than their business ; it is the business of the Parliament to ensure that this sort of thing should be stopped. Government propaganda has poured from the printing presses for the eight years in which Labour has been in office. Now, we are experiencing a spate of similar propaganda before the general election. It should be stopped and it certainly should not be paid for by the people. </para>

                            <para>- I am going to discuss that. The honorable gentleman made a specific reference to a recent publication issued under the authority of the Minister for Works and Housing <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lemmon)</inline> entitled <inline font-style="italic">Homes for Australia.</inline> That publication makes it perfectly clear that  housing <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> is the joint responsibility of the Aus.tralian Government and the State governments. The reference in it to housing in Western Australia makes it clear that housing in that State is under the direct administration of the State Government. No claim is made about the part played by the Australian Government in that State, other than that it makes a financial contribution, which is a perfectly  truthful  statement. Actually, that material could be regarded as propaganda for the State Government. It is factual information and has no regard for political complexions. The honorable member said that the booklet on social services was Labour party propaganda. Let us look at this alleged propaganda. On page 7 of the booklet it states - </para>

There are certain sections in the booklet that show that widows' pensions and certain other social services came into being under the Labour Government. That is fact. As honorable members opposite know, a great many social services have been introduced in the eight years of the existence of the Labour Government. To say that is simply to speak the truth. The booklet cannot be regarded as propaganda in favour of any political party. It gives the historical background of social services. It explains the means tost. No one could regard an explanation of the means test as good propaganda for the Labour party. </para>
                    <para>The honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> was again happy in his role of cloak-and-dagger expert for the </para>
                    <para class="block">Opposition when he found out that a gentleman named Kaiser had been systematically betraying secrets. He implied that the secrets' of the Australian Government had been betrayed hy Kaiser to a foreign country. I have to agree with the honorable gentleman that one must infer from Kaiser's demonstration in front of Australia House over the coal strike that he is a Communist. There is no sense in quibbling about that. Whether or not it can be proved that he is a Communist, I do not know. All I know is that no section of the community other than the Communists disapproved of the Government's actions in connexion with the coal strike. My point, however, is that while in the United Kingdom, Kaiser worked in British institutions. No evidence has been produced by the honorable member for Wentworth that those institutions were dealing with anything secret. But, if they were, and he was betraying the secret details, he should have come under the surveillance of the British Intelligence Service. We know certain people who, in Australia during the war, were not prosecuted but who, immediately they reached the United Kingdom, were arrested. One of them was a gentleman on whose behalf honorable members opposite were vocal recently. He would be well advised to keep away from the United Kingdom. The fact is that if there were any real evidence concerning subversive activities by Kaiser he would be arrested in Britain and charged in that country with the offences alleged, because such activities would have taken place in British scientific institutions. It is fantastic to suggest that while Kaiser is resident in Britain he is under the jurisdiction of the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman).</inline> I do not wish to deal with that subject at any great length. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member criticized the allocation of the expenditure. He complained that not enough was to be expended on scientific research connected with primary industries. The present Minister for Defence has so far eclipsed the record of governments that the honorable member for Wide Bay supported, and supported apparently uncritically, that the honorable member made no reference to his achievements. Under the present Minister, expenditure on scientific research has risen from £339,000 a year to more than £2,000,000 a year. The honorable member for Wide Bay made absurd claims about expenditure on astronomy and made fantastic statements about other research work which is not actually carried out. He will find that the heaviest items of expenditure under this division concern plant industry, soils and irrigation, forest products and other activities connected with agriculture. Plant industry, animal health and production account for proposed expenditures of more than £200,000 each. Proposed expenditure under item 6 of Division 113, relating to forest products, is given as £142,600. </para>

                    <para>In presenting these Estimates the Minister has not explained at any great length the expenditure proposed under item 16, section C, of Division 113, " Biochemistry and general nutrition ". That item apparently refers to an activity distinct from animal nutrition. I ask the Minister if his department is taking over research into human nutrition and biochemistry. There have been references in scientific journals for some time to a new line of research in connexion with the growth of food crops in their relation to human nutrition. In the past, emphasis has been placed on wheat and plant breeding and upon  prolificity  and milling qualities of grain. In the United States of America, which leads the world in such research, the emphasis is now upon vitamins and the nutritional content of plants. Some rather remarkable results have been announced by various universities in the United States. I should like to know to what degree, if any, these lines of research are being pursued by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization. </para>
                    <para>Item 8 of section C of Division 113 concerns radio research. I should like the Minister to explain whether the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization is engaging in any research in relation to television, or whether the radio research mentioned refers only to research in connexion with Australian present radio facilities. </para>
                    <para>The Estimates indicate some analysis of research into food preservation and transport. Can the Minister say whether any research is taking place into the claims made on behalf of patent medicines, also into the claims that are advanced by the sellers of certain foodstuffs and certain tonics ? We very badly need an objective analysis to be made of many such claims. Many of the industries upon the products of which the public spends many hundreds of thousands of pounds annually are regarded by doctors as being engaged in lines of manufacture that amount to absolute quackery. It seems to me that some research should he made regarding such claims, and also that consideration should be given to the advisability of requesting the States, under whose jurisdiction this matter comes, to enact legislation to prohibit advertisements based on falsehoods, in cases where it has been established by research that the claims made in such advertisements are bogus. </para>
                    <para>Item 24 concerns fuel research. No doubt, during the recent coal strike, many honorable members received a brochure from a gentleman who claimed to have a process whereby coal could be burned with much greater efficiency and with much greater utilization of its heating qualities than is the case at present. He called it the "Anderson Process for Smokeless Fuel ". I should like to know whether that claim was investigated. The gentleman concerned asked for an analysis of his claims. There are many countries of the world where such a claim would, I am sure, receive some kind of public attention. I should like to know whether the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, which carries out tests for the manufacturers of tractors and other machinery, would also carry out tests into this man's claims which are either outrageous, or, if true, mean that he has discovered a process the value of which is important enough to be investigated. </para>
                    <para>Items 1 and 2 of section D of Division 113 refer to the provision of a total of £31,120 for research associations and research studentships. I should like to know how much of this amount is to be directed towards the tenure of scholarships in Britain. "We have a British fixation regarding many of our overseas scholarships, regardless of the fact that the initiative in many lines of scientific research has gone from Britain, which undoubtedly led in that respect during the nineteenth century, to the United States. I should like the Minister to give the committee some information on how much is to be made available notwithstanding dollar differences for the tenure of scholarships in the United States. An extremely open attitude is displayed by the United States in respect of all lines of scientific research, despite the fact that we are always hearing from honorable members opposite about how that country is keeping scientific developments secret as far as Australia is concerned. </para>
                    <para>Item 20, section C, shows that it is proposed to spend £33,000 on research into nuclear energy, the very field in which, according to the Opposition, the United States is most concerned with secrecy. The Commonwealth could well send students to the United States. It is suggested by honorable members opposite that such students would be denied access to information concerning American research on nuclear energy. I draw the attention of honorable members opposite to the activities of General Eisenhower, the former Commander-in-Chief of the United States Army during the last war, who is now  president  of Columbia University in the United States of America. The United States Government offered that university a grant of millions of dollars for research in atomic energy. Because of the urging of its  president,  Columbia University refused to accept any money from the United States Government for that purpose. General Eisenhower urged that the offer be rejected on the ground that if the university accepted money from the United States Government for atomic energy research it would be obliged to impose secrecy upon the men engaged at that university in such research. Columbia University has the use of many millions of dollars from private funds and also has an unrivalled laboratory which, in fact, carried out much of the research that resulted in the production of the atomic bomb. SoI stress that atomic research at the Columbia University, the  president  of which was Commander-in-Chief of the United States Army during the last war, is carried out under conditions of a complete absence of secrecy. </para>

I am merely stating that General Eisenhower refused to accept money from the Government of the United States of America if the acceptance of such money involved a promise that secrecy would be preserved in relation to any research work undertaken as the result of its provision.

                    <para>The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization is conducting research work into the building industry in Sydney. In the course of that  research work a number of tests have been made. I should like the Minister to inform me what has been the result of this work and how far the results of it have been applied to the building industry. When I first visited the research establishment in 1945 I observed that the officers there were engaged on problems relating to insulation, including the building of houses with flimsy materials which would keep them cool under very hot climatic conditions. Have any conclusions been reached as the result of this research work, and if so, how have they been applied to the building industry ? </para>

                            <para>- The Commonwealth would need to be assured that the State governments would be prepared to take some action before it authorized any such investigations. There is quite a history behind this subject. At one period during the war a regulation was promulgated which compelled the manufacturers of patent medicines to submit to the Commonwealth authorities an analysis of the contents of all such medicines. Some very interesting facts emerged as the result of the promulgation of that regulation. I agree that it would be of benefit to the community if some authority undertook such investigational work. The regulation to which I have referred was disallowed by the Parliament after it had operated for only a short period, and the Commonwealth did nothing further about the matter. If representations were made by the State governments that they were interested in this subject and that they believed that in the public interests investigations should be made into the contents of patent medicines, with a view to ascertaining whether they were really efficacious for the purposes for which they are advertised, the Commonwealth would gladly co-operate through the instrumentality of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization. However, until such time as the governments that have constitutional power over this matter show some interest in it, I do not think that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization should be asked to undertake such investigations. </para>

                    <para>The honorable member for Fremantle has also asked whether any allocations of money have been made for scholarships in the United States of America, and, if so, what amounts had been made available for that purpose. No specific funds have been allocated for that purpose. From time to time the executive of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization makes recommendations to me that particular individuals should be sent to the United States of America to investigate certain problems. The executive also makes recommendations that individuals in the United States of America who have particular knowledge of specified subjects should be asked to visit Australia to assist us in the solution of our problems. Each of these recommendations is investigated on its merits. If it is thought that a scholarship in a particular subject would benefit this country only if the student went to the United States, the recommendation is approved subject to a very thorough examination being made to ascertain whether the student concerned could not obtain the desired knowledge and training in some soft currency country. The same principle applies to recommendations made to me by the executive of the organization in relation to proposals to invite American specialists to this country. Not long ago a recommendation was  made  to me that  an  American expert in the science of genetics, Professor Lush, should be invited to visit this country. I asked whether it would not be possible to obtain the services of an expert from the United Kingdom who would be equally as reliable as Professor Lush. I was informed that the only individual  in  the United Kingdom who had the specialized knowledge which the organization wanted to impart to our own people who are interested in this matter was not available to pay a visit to Australia. In those circumstances, I approved of the recommendation that Professor Lush should be brought from America. Professor Lush subsequently visited Australia and I understand that the information which he imparted to our people who were engaged in the study of both animal and plant genetics has been of very great value to the organization. I believe that I have dealt with all the matters that were raised by the honorable member for Fremantle. If I have overlooked any matter I shall be glad to furnish what information I have about it at a later stage. </para>

Notwithstanding that fact, the honorable member for Fremantle endeavoured to persuade himself mid those who may have been listening to his speech that this booklet is a straightforward document and that thousands of copies of it should be printed at the expense, not of the Australian Labour party, but of the public. I understand that 1,000,000 copies of the booklet are on order with the printers. Apart from that, I want to show how the Australian Labour party has debased this booklet. A copy of the booklet which has been handed to me by the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hamilton)</inline> who, like the honorable member for Fremantle, comes from. Western Australia, has plastered all over it the words, " Vote Labour. Webb for Swan ". We have been told that this booklet is not a propaganda document, that its printing involves a reasonable expenditure of government money, and that its contents would be endorsed by every right-thinking and fair individual in the community. Apparently the honorable member for Fremantle has slipped very greatly in the three short years of his membership of this Parliament. </para>

                    <para>The honorable gentleman spoke of young Kaiser. The Minister for Postwar Reconstruction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> has frequently assured the Parliament and the country that there is no need for us to worry about Communists in Australia having access to information about secret projects, and in his speech to-day he has given the committee assurance after assurance to that effect. He has said that we need not worry, because the screening authorities in Australia are so perfect and efficient that a Communist could not possibly get through the net. It required <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kaiser</inline> himself, at a demonstration in London, to indicate that he had Communist sympathies. The assurances that the Minister gave us months ago, long before that demonstration occurred, have proved to be of no more value than other assurances that he has given us from time to time. The Minister's reputation in the Parliament is such that we on this side of the chamber cannot accept any assurance that he gives unless it is accompanied by documents that place the matter beyond any doubt. Although we have been told from time to time that there are no Communists in the employment of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, or the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research as it was known at one time, they have come to light. I shall name one Communist, of whom the Minister has some knowledge, who was employed by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. I refer to the notorious <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rudkin,</inline> who was convicted during the war of treason. He endeavoured to impart military information to a foreign power. He served a term of six months imprisonment in a West Australian prison during the war, and after his release he was appointed, under the authority of the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction, to an important position in the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. The Minister defended that appointment on every occasion when the matter was raised in the Parliament. He argued that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rudkin</inline> was employed in the forestry division of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research and that he could not in such employment possibly obtain ' information . about secret work. The Minister may not be aware that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rudkin</inline> has been endeavouring to secure employment in the physics laboratory of the University of Melbourne. In his application for employment he has doubtless referred to the fact that he was approved by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. I shall say no more upon that subject. Although the Minister told us that he has not approved of the appointment of Communists, we have found Communists popping up in the departments for which he is responsible. The honorable gentleman told us that the noted <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Atcherley</inline> was not a Communist, but the honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lang)</inline> produced evidence which showed that he was the secretary of the Canberra branch of the Communist party. </para>

The criticism that I now propose to offer relates to the failure of the Government to provide sufficient money for the extension and development of the organization. </para>

That sum is probably the equivalent of approximately £20,000,000 Australian. Although the Canadian Government has expended £20,000,000 in a year upon scientific and industrial research, the Australian Government is prepared to make only £2,000,000 available this year for that purpose.

The honorable member for Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. George Lawson)</inline> apparently belongs to the school of thought that expects to finish where it should begin. There would be no development if theories of that kind were adopted throughout the world. The Government of which I. was a member established the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research and laid the foundations of most of the work for which this Government is now claiming the credit. On the north coast of New South Wales there are many noxious weeds that the landholders themselves cannot possibly control or eradicate, and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization could do some experimental work in that connexion, but, po far as I know, it has not done so. Nothing has been done in connexion with hemp, which is fast invading some of our best land there. Very little has been done by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization in relation to the deficiencies of the soil along the coastal areas of New South Wales. The organization has one man at the experimental  farm at  Wallambah,  but he has not yet submitted a report. </para>

                            <para>- That is so, but the salaries that are paid by Commonwealth and State departments have a certain relationship. If the Commonwealth were to increase the salaries of its scientific workers, the State governments would be forced to follow suit. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Lewcock,  one of the most noted scientists in Queensland, is now employed in South Africa to advise upon agricultural problems there. Many of our scientists have been badly treated. Recently, I spoke to a man who has spent eighteen years of his life in a Government department. He is a Bachelor of Agricultural Science and a Master of Agricultural Science. After eighteen years of service his salary is less than £500 a year. That man is employed by a State authority, but the salaries that are paid by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization are similar to those that are paid by State authorities, although they may be a little higher. I suggest to the Government and to those who are responsible for the administration of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization that the time has come to review the salaries of our scientists, especially those of the top-grade men who are now being attracted elsewhere. We must expend more money upon research and the development of scientific techniques. At the present time almost every branch of trade and industry in Australia is confronted with problems that can only hesolved with the assistance of scientific investigations. What can we hope to achieve on a budget of £2.000,000 ? The reports that are issued by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization reveal that the work of the organization covers many fields, but there is still much to be done. </para>

                    <para>I am a practical farmer. I study the reports that are issued by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization and other scientific bodies and try to make sense of them. I consider that the Commonwealth Scientific; and Industrial Research Organization should publish its findings in such a manner as will enable them to be understood by the ordinary man on the land, who has to give effect to them. As far as I am able to judge, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research adopted the view that once it completed an investigation, its responsibility in the matter ended, and that State Departments of Agriculture should distribute the information among interested sections of primary producers. I did not 'agree with that view. I have always believed that, from beginning to end, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, now the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, should conduct investigations and give the widest possible publicity to its findings and recommendations. The problem of hemp which is most serious in the coastal areas of New South Wales and Queensland, must be solved. This plant pest is rapidly enveloping thousands of acres, and farmers, with their present knowledge and facilities, are unable to control it. They urgently require financial and scientific assistance from the Commonwealth to enable them to maintain production in those areas. If the Government adopts a passive attitude towards that problem, our production of food, especially in the dairying districts, will further decline. </para>

                            <para>- I desire to make a personal explanation. In the early part of his speech, the honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony)</inline> referred to some remarks that I had made and endeavoured to refute my suggestion that the booklet on social services was not partisan. He said that I knew that that booklet contained the words, " Vote for Labour, Webb for Swan". I have examined the 32 pages of the booklet, and I find that that statement does not occur on any of the pages. The honorable member held up a copy of the booklet, and it was obvious that those words had been inserted with a rubber stamp. Having made that statement, the honorable member proceeded to wave the booklet about his head, and claim that it contained statements that were Labour propaganda. It was obvious that those words had not been printed by the Commonwealth, or the Government Printer, and that it would be competent for any person, using a rubber stamp, to imprint any statement in the booklet. The honorable gentleman, in suggesting that I had misled the committee, was himself misleading it. </para>

                        <para>. - I shall endeavour to be brief, because I realize that other honorable members desire to speak on the Estimates for the five departments which are now under discussion. I am obliged to make an observation on the remarks of the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White),</inline> who waved various publications in the air and made disparaging comments upon them. He claimed that all of them were sheer Labour party propaganda, and that the Government waa misusing public funds in publishing them. The honorable member said that the paper could have been used to better purpose in publishing the novels or poems of deserving Australian writers. I inform the honorable gentleman that the quantity of newsprint, and even the superfine and calendar paper used in all Commonwealth  and State government departments in one year, would not equal the quantity of paper that is used in a newspaper office in one day. The honorable member was very wide of the mark if he thought that savings of newsprint by governments would provide a great reservoir of materia] for the publication of the works of deserving novelists and poets. The honorable member for Balaclava also referred to an excellent publication by the Minister for Works and Housing <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lemmon),</inline> in which the operation of the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement is described. As the honorable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beazley)</inline> has pointed out, that scheme is functioning under an agreement between the Commonwealth and every State government, irrespective of the political views of the several parties to it. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. South Australia is the only exception. I regard all those publications as conveying excellent lessons in civics, and I think that they deal with matters of great public interest. The Labour Government has always experienced great difficulty in securing the publication of facts about our communitylife and economy, and in order to ensure that that story shall reach people of all political views, it lias to secure publication of documents that are well and objectively written. For such there is a great public demand. I think that the honorable member for Balaclava indulged in rather small-minded criticism of the Government when he said that those publications were not good. He adopted the wrong attitude in saying that governments should not publicize their achievements. All previous Commonwealth governments have publicized their actions, and all State governments do so. </para>

                    <para>The honorable member for  Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony)</inline> has made a series of bitter attacks upon the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman),</inline> who is a very honest man who tells his story to the chamber in a forthright fashion. For a honorable member to say that the Opposition does not accept any assurance that he gives is contemptible. I have never known any Minister of any government at any time who has deliberately attempted to mislead the Parliament, and certainly the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction has never" attempted to do so. The criticism that the Minister is not fulfilling his responsibilities as the Minister in charge of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization is just too laughable. As a matter of fact, the honorable gentleman is expending six times as much money as was expended when the honora.ble member for Richmond ceased to be a Minister, and he would expend more if he could see a profitable way of doing so, such as obtaining the services of more scientists, securing more equipment and generally doing the things which he believes are in the interests of the Australian people and particularly the primary producers. In that respect, as in all other respects, the Minister has done his work very well and painstakingly, and at great sacrifice of time and energy. </para>
                    <para>The honorable member for Balaclava referred to certain provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act.

I do not think that the provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act have been violated by what has been done to inform the public mind factually and objectively. The whole story of social services benefits, the period of the Premiers plan, the introduction of child endowment by the Menzies Government and other similar matters are dealt with, and, therefore, the publication cannot be described as Labour party propaganda. The Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> is, unfortunately, not here because his father died yesterday, and the Minister is attending the funeral to-day. It ill behoved the honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bernard Corser)</inline> to make his sneering, nasty remark about the Minister even when he was told the facts. To use the vernacular, it was a rotten remark to make. </para>

                    <para class="block">The tariff proposal which I have just introduced covers spectacle lenses, spectacles, spectacle frames, magnifying and reading glasses. The proposal follows a Tariff Board report on these goods and the duties now proposed are in accordance with the board's recommendations and Australia's international trade treaty commitments. The board's report was tabled in the Parliament by me earlier to-day. Before the recent war the only items of ophthalmic goods in regular commercial production in Australia were those on which protective duties had been in operation for many years, namely, fused bifocal blanks and spectacle cases. The war created local shortages which prompted considerable expansion of manufacture to other items. Single vision lenses, which had been imported before the war, commenced to be ground in quantities from glass blanks imported or made locally. An acute shortage of spectacle frames was met by local production by an injection moulding process. The manufacture of gold-filled mountings was started and various types of  sunglasses and goggles were made. The board has carefully examined this industry and the rates it has recommended are those which it considers necessary to protect the industry. A summary of alterations showing the variations of the existing duties has been circulated for the information of honorable members. In view of the change of status and designation of certain countries shown in the Customs Tariff as British non-self-governing colonies, the opportunity has been taken, on legal advice, to vary the Customs Tariff so that it shall conform to the present position of these countries. This amendment is contained in paragraphI of the preliminary matter to this proposal. I move - </para>

The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard)</inline> asked me this morning whether it would be possible for him to table a tariff schedule at 4.30 p.m. to-day. Knowing that that is the normal time at which to table tariff schedules, I said that I was agreeable. I am afraid that I failed to convey that agreement to some of my colleagues. Therefore, I am responsible for any difficulty that has arisen in this matter. </para>

                        <para>- Order ! The point of order raised by the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> relates to urgency. It is that no other business may intrude after the Estimates have been declared urgent and time has been allotted for their consideration. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> said that what the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard)</inline> did had been done by arrangement. I understand that there is a precedent for urgent and important matters, such as tariff schedules, to bo introduced in Committee of Ways and Means in circumstances like those existing to-day. The House is master of its own destiny. I think the proceedings have been quite in order. </para>

This matter is really very disturbing, because,, although <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker</inline> may not pay any attention officially to happenings in committee, the fact is that it has been ruled that no question of privilege may be raised in committee. If no question of privilege may be raised in committee,, although Standing Order 280 expressly, provides that no member shall interrupt another member whilst speaking, unless to call attention to a point of order or privilege suddenly arising, then it must be that a point of order or privilegecannot be raised at all, or it can be raised in the House. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker,</inline> have just ruled- </para>

                        <para>- I have not prevented the honorable member from raising a point of privilege. He is entitled to raise a point of privilege; but the interpretation that I have put upon his remarks is that the matter that he is endeavouring to discuss amounts to the canvassing of a ruling of the Temporary  Chairman.  Therefore he is not raising a legitimate matter of privilege. As I have said, the matter of the actual ruling of the Temporary  Chairman  should have been dealt with in the committee. It is not one for the House. </para>

                        <para>.- I desire to make several observations on the Estimates as they affect the Department of the Army. I do not propose to offer any general criticism of the Government's defence policy, particularly as it affects the Army, because, on a number of previous occasions I have said exactly what I think of the whole basis of defence as it is advanced by this Government. Briefly, I have always considered the Government's defence policy inadequate and an evasion of its responsibility to defend the country adequately. Its policy is lacking in courage, and is indeed a  cowardly  policy. That has been said time and time again and on this occasion I do not intend to attack the basis of this country's military defence which relies on a minute and understaffed permanent army. "We have a very much smaller volunteer army than we had before the last war. I wish to comment, however, on several aspects of the militia scheme in which the Government has put its faith. The great body of the troops who are supposed to defend this country in time of emergency is what we loosely call the militia. We were told that we were to have a part-time army of 50,000 men, but at the end of nearly two years after the scheme was first introduced, only 13,000 men have been enlisted. In effect we have to-day an army that is somewhat smaller than the country's police forces, and is of a contemptible strength. </para>

                    <para>The honorable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) earlier to-day raised the question of how even that very small force is being managed, and she expressed the opinion that even although its strength is so small, numbers of men have recently resigned. I think that she cited the figure of 4,000 men who have ceased to engage in part-time training. But the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chambers),</inline> as he always does when such criticisms are levelled, said that there was no truth in her statement and that it was no doubt some sort of newspaper gossip. He dismissed it as nonsense. As a matter of fact, there is a great deal of truth in the statements that the honorable member for Darwin advanced. The Minister knows very well that recruiting for the militia forces came to a standstill some months ago, and that a large number of men have resigned or have simply ceased to attend parades; and thus have ceased to be effective. In some cases their commanding officers have had to ask such men to resign because it is of no benefit to the country to have men on the books when they are performing absolutely no service. </para>
                    <para>In order, to discover how poor recruiting now is we do not require to look any further than the battalion raised in the Australian Capital Territory, which has an establishment of about 800 men, but the strength of which is actually, I suggest, below 200 men. That is a position which exists- right throughout the Commonwealth. Unit after unit goes into camp with only a handful of men to be trained. Yet the Minister expresses great satisfaction over that state of affairs. He says, in effect, that it is wonderful that after two years we have 13,000 men ready to do part-time training. The militia scheme is so badly administered at the present time that the military authorities are unable to employ properly the men they have. They cannot attract more men and they cannot even hold those that they already have. One of the reasons for that is that the small amount that those soldiers receive in payment as a result of their willingness to undertake voluntary military training, is subject to taxation. A man who volunteers for service in the militia finds at the end of the financial year that he has earned perhaps £50 for his military service. That amount must be shown with his other income for the purposes of tax assessment, which frequently means that his voluntary service in the militia actually costs him money, because the amount that he earns thereby brings him into a higher taxation field. I raised this matter about two years ago when the scheme was first introduced and the Minister said that he would give some consideration to an adjustment of it. I daresay that he did so, but the decision was unfavorable. I cannot see the least reason for taxing the amounts paid to soldiers who have undertaken part-time training, and I ask the Minister once more if he will reconsider this matter, which constitutes a gross injustice. A great many men who undertake part-time military duties find themselves out of pocket as a result of so doing. Many of them have to travel great distances by car to engage in training and, as the Minister knows, the travelling expenses allowed to them are quite inadequate. In addition, as the Minister knows, or ought to know, any officer or non-commissioned officer who takes his duty seriously has to spend far more time on the training of men than he is actually credited with. I again ask the Government to give favorable consideration to the exemption of military pay from income tax. The need for inducing more young men to join our armed forces is great enough to justify such a course. Let the Minister take this step to show that the Government has some appreciation of what it is asking these men to do. </para>
                    <para>I wish to refer now to the manner in which the figures relating to the strength of the armed forces have been presented in this chamber. The Minister has said that we have a permanent army of 19,000 men. I point out that at least 5,000 members of the so-called permanent army are really members of the interim army. It is most misleading for the Minister to say that we have a permanent army of record numbers when, in fact, a great number of the men could resign at any moment they desired to do so, and another very large number of them perform duties of a purely administrative character. In order to ascertain the strength of the regular army we have only to consider the strength of the permanent brigade. This much vaunted permanent brigade has not even the strength of a battalion. Under present conditions it is very unlikely that it will attain the strength of a battalion for a considerable time. If that statement is not correct, let the Minister state specifically how far below strength our permanent army units really are. At about this time last year I had occasion to cite the figures relating to one of the battalions of our permanent army. At that time, it was less than one quarter of the target strength. My statement was not then contradicted, and no facts or figures have since been forthcoming from the Minister to prove that it was inaccurate. I know that the figures which I have cited are correct. This Government is indulging in great deception in painting such a false picture of the defence forces of this country. As the honorable member for Bendigo <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rankin)</inline> said in his speech during the general debate on the budget, never before in such troublous times have we had less with which to defend ourselves. I do not intend to deal at length with the subject of compulsory military training. I merely point out that even New Zealand, which has a socialist Government, has determined that all the citizens of that dominion shall- be in a position to defend their country. </para>
                    <para>I propose now to say a few words about the decision of the Government to use army personnel on the northern coal-fields during the recent coal strike. That was the most cowardly action which this Government has taken. It destroyed whatever confidence in the Army the great Labour movement may have held, and gave rise to a great deal of resentment. It was well known that the requisite labour could have been obtained from among the members of the Australian Workers Union. Indeed, the members of that union volunteered to work the mines. The Government did not use their services because it feared to split its party political affiliations. Its decision to use members of the armed forces on this work destroyed the confidence of the unions in the armed forces of this country. That was one of the worst actions that has ever been taken by any government in this country, and the honorable gentleman who calls himself the Minister for the Army, having permitted that to be done, is unworthy to occupy his present position. </para>

                            <para>- In 1938-39 Germany had developed a great war potential. The 1914-18 war left Germany's war potential practically -untouched. Within a short, space of time after the conclusion of World War I. Germany was able to train another huge fighting force, and to equip it with all the implements of war. The world knew that Germany was preparing for another war. Italy still had the capacity to place a large fighting force in the field, and Japan had emerged from World War I. virtually untouched. Although it was common knowledge throughout the world that Germany, Italy and Japan were preparing for war, the strength of the permanent military forces of Australia in 1938-39 was less than 5,000 men. </para>

                        can authenticate every statement that I have made. When the strength of the Commonwealth military forces was supposed to be 50,000, it was actually only about 25,000. The present strength of the Citizen Military Forces, which were established only a little more than twelve months ago, is 15,000. Thus the total strength of the Citizen Military Forces and the Permanent Military Forces is approximately 30,500. The 1914-18 war left virtually untouched the countries which subsequently attacked the British Empire and its Allies in 1939. Their capacity to engage in another great war was unimpaired.

                            <para>- Let us compare the position that, existed then with the present position in relation to the supply of equipment. Adequate stocks of war-like stores, including guns and ammunition, are now held both for the protection of the troops and to enable our troops to engage an enemy until such time as Australia's manufacturing capacity can be brought into full operation. At the outbreak of the war in 1939 the equipment position was scandalous. All that was available was the residue of the 1914-1S war. Equipment not only was inadequate but also had been  out-moded  .by more modern equipment in the hands of our potential enemies, who, unlike ourselves, had long before commenced to re-arm and had concentrated the national effort on extensive war preparations. </para>

                    <para>The honorable member for Henty condemned the Government because it made use of the armed forces during the recent coal' strike. The honorable gentleman said, in his knowing way, that the Australian Workers Union volunteered to dothe work that was done by the Army and that it would have done it had it beenasked to do so. The Australian Workers Union could not do that work, because its constitution does not make the necessary provision. It is wrong to say that the people of Australia, have condemned the Government and the Australian fighting forces for their actions during the strike. Noone is in a better position than I am. to know that the action that was taken, by the Government then was highly commended by the people. I remind honorable gentlemen opposite that never beforein the history of Australia has an Australian army been able to undertake in: peace-time an operation such as that which it undertook during the coal strike. </para>

No one regretted more than I did that it was necessary to use the Army for that purpose on that occasion ; but the events of the coal strike have proved at least that we now have an Army that is capable of meeting a national emergency. The Australian people do not despise the Government or the fighting forces for their actions during that emergency. No members of the forces objected to doing the work that was done. </para>

Italy and Germany have been totally destroyed as fighting forces, and those countries no longer have the capacity to manufacture the equipment that is necessary to fight a war. Those are facts that cannot be denied. The Government has every reason to be pleased with the progress that has been made during the last twelve months in the implementation of its defence policy. "We have made no attempt to deceive members of the Opposition or the Australian people. The figures that I have given are accurate. The number of members of the Citizen Military Forces is gradually increasing, although the rate of increase is a little less than I should like it to be. The number of enlistments into the Citizen Military Forces during the last four weeks has been greater than the number of enlistments during any of the last six months. </para>

                        <para>. - I had not intended to make a speech upon this matter, but the remarkable utterances of the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chambers)</inline> have brought me to my feet. One thing that I can say in favour of the honorable gentleman is that most of the matters that he has discussed are matters of which he has no first-hand knowledge. Hs may, therefore, be pardoned for having fallen into error about them. I shall not repeat what was said very effectively by the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett)</inline> about the present state of affairs; but I shall say something about the Minister's estimate of our present danger and his remarkable travesty of the events that occurred before the last war. The Australian Labour party has been lying its way along on this matter for much too long, and something ought to be said about it. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>First, I shall say something about the present danger. The Minister has said that Italy, Germany and Japan are disarmed. If one accepted the statements of the Minister at face value, one would be led to believe that the danger in the world to-day is very small. Let me say frankly and at once that as a military force Italy has been non-existent for many years. This country can afford to look back with some satisfaction on the fact that one Australian division, the 6th Division, cleaned up a quarter of a million Italians in Cyrenaica. "Whatever may be said  about the Italians, who are in many respects most civilized people, they cannot be regarded very seriously as a fighting force. Is Russia quite so innocent as the Minister would have us believe ? </para>

                            <para>- On the contrary, the Minister was at great pains to tell us. on the authority of Field Marshal Montgomery, that 7,000,000 Russians were destroyed during the last war and that, presumably, Russia is no longer quite the menace that honorable members on this side of the chamber may think it is. The fact is that during the last three years the world has been almost standing to arms. Why? Is it because of Italy, Japan or Germany? Or is it because of Russia? The whole world has been in a stats of grievous uncertainty and danger during the last three years because of the power and aggressive capacity of the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, we have lived long enough to hear a Minister for the Army tell us in this Parliament that the dangers are not to be overestimated and that in reality they were much greater in 1938 and 1939 than they are now. That is the honorable gentleman's case. I always like to meet a man on his own ground. Let us assume that the dangers were much greater in 1938 and 1939 than they are now. Under those circumstances, will the Minister undertake to explain to the people of this country why his respected colleague, who is now the Minister for Labour and National Service, said in this chamber, on the 3rd November, 1938, ten months before war broke out - </para>

                            <para>- If the Minister for the Army will wash his hands of all that the members of his party have said and will acquit honorable gentlemen on this side of the chamber of everything that any body has ever said, from <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Angliss downwards, we shall once more meet on common ground. The Minister has taken the responsibility of saying that before the last war honorable gentlemen who are now in Opposition were unaware of the danger and per formed inadequately. He has said that they did not do anything like as well as this Government is now doing. I say to him that his colleague, who is now his colleague in the present Cabinet, said exactly what I have just quoted. A little of modern history will do the Minister no harm. If he will look back upon the speeches that were made in 1938 in this chamber, he will discover that a greatly respected leader of the Labour party at that time, the late John Curtin - a man about whom I always speak with respect - said after Munich that the events of Munich did not justify the increase of defence preparations that the Lyons Government was putting in hand, but a reduced preparation, because the danger had been lessened. </para>

                            <para>- Apparently the Minister for Works and Housing accepts responsibility for what was then done by members of his party. He cannot have it both ways. He either shuffles out of the responsibility for it or stands up to what his own leaders said at that time. If members of the Labour party are to stand up to what their leaders said at that time, I say that those leaders were anti the possibility of war and anti the preparations for war. To be told, in this year of grace, by these people that we failed to understand what the obligations were then is the most ironical -.thing that I have ever heard. Indeed, <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> shall pursue that line for a few minutes, because it is time that the people of Australia were reminded of a few of these :matters. When war broke out in 1939, did the Labour party support the formation of the second Australian Imperial Force ? </para>

In the twelve months preceding the outbreak of war, there had <inline font-style="italic">been</inline> a great "testing of national recruitment in this country - a testing upon which the then Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons,</inline> had decided. He had a feeling, and one can fully appreciate it, that we should test out the -voluntary system to the full, and so he said, " We shall raise a large force of volunteer troops in this country". A ;great recruiting campaign was put in hand. My distinguished colleague, the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> will remember it vividly. Did that campaign have the approval of our present masters? Not at all! Did it succeed? It did. The largest volunteer force that this country has had in time of peace was formed. </para>

                            <para>- I am delighted to have the Minister's view on that, because I should like him to know that most of the members of the Labour party at that time did not consider that war was imminent. On the contrary, they thought that the whole danger had been disposed of. Then war broke out. What you may do if war is imminent is one thing. But what are you to do when war occurs ? Af ter all, that is something which speaks eloquently to the dullest intelligence. War broke out, and all sorts of problems emerged. The first was, " Shall we reintroduce compulsory military training ? " Where did the Labour party stand on that? Honorable members opposite were opposed to the reintroduction of compulsory military training. It is quite true that, when the system was re-introduced, members of the Labour party discovered that the people of Australia thought well of it, and thereafter they went very quietly on that point. But I say that they were opposed to the re-introduction of compulsory military training. Had they been in office at the time, it would not have been reintroduced. The next development was the formation of the second Australian Imperial Force. Honorable members will permit me a few reflections of my own on this matter. I recall that there was a time in 1942 when the Labour Government assumed great credit for bringing back to Australia the magnificent divisions of the second Australian Imperial Force. What the people perhaps have forgotten is that, if members of the Australian Labour party had had their way, not one unit or troop of the Australian Imperial Force would have been in existence. The second Australian Imperial Force was formed in the teeth of their opposition. </para>

                            <para>- One fine day, I, as Prime Minister, announced that the first formations of the second Australian Imperial Force would go abroad. What did the Labour party do then? It submitted a motion in this Parliament protesting against the despatch of the second Australian Imperial Force overseas, and pushed it to a division on party lines. In other words, had the matter been left to the Labour party, there would have been no compulsory military training, no second Australian Imperial Force, and no despatch of the second Australian Imperial Force abroad. "We have become familiar in these days with the allegation that we dispersed the strength of this country in foreign fields. </para>

                    <para>The next reference that I make is to the introduction of the Empire air training scheme. I have lived long enough to hear Ministers claim great credit for that achievement. It was initiated in Great Britain in 1939, and the first representative of Australia to discuss, on the spot, the details of that great scheme was the late J. V. Fairbairn. The Empire air training scheme was adopted, and Australia set about doing its share. It was the greatest single co-operative movement between the units of the British Empire in the course of a war. Although the scheme began in October, 1939, it, was not until July, 1940, that a conference of the Australian Labour party decided that it would permit members of the Labour party in this Parliament to support the scheme. The Minister for the Army has told us that the Government's defence programme is much better than the defence programme before the outbreak of war. </para>

                            <para>- I do not blame the Minister for expressing that view, because he has had this story pedalled up to him year after year for a long time. The whole of the socialist story in Australia may be expressed, thus, " Of course the Opposition parties did nothing to prepare Australia for war, and the Labour party had to save the country ". I do not need to be told by Johnnies-Come-Lately who did this job in Australia. I say categorically that the greatest munitions organization that this country has ever had, was given into the hands of the Labour party at the end of 1941. The incoming Government kept all the plans and all the men. It did not sack them. Labour Ministers had enough wit to say, " We shall keep the plans, the men and the organization, and allow them to work". They were given the second Australian. Imperial Force, to which they did not add one ounce. They were given the system of com-  pulsory  military training, which they developed later. They were given the Empire air training scheme and the whole nucleus - a very big nucleus, too - of the most marvellous co-operative effort that involved the most desperate struggles to secure training aircraft and all sorts of  plant  from other parts of the world. I I have lived long enough now to assess at its true value all this chatter - this boasting chatter - of the last four or five years by people who did not create anything but who took what had been created for them. They now have the gall to say, " We are doing a marvellous job. During the war you members of the present Opposition parties failed. You were not ready for war. You had no army, navy or air force. It is quite true that if we had had' our way, Australia would have had nothing-minus, but that does not prevent us from saying that the Opposition parties have been tried and have failed ". That is the greatest piece of imposture that has ever been p\it over the people of Australia. </para>

He is still living in the dark ages when wars were fought with man-power alone. Wars are now fought with manpower, plus  industrial capacity. Every well-informed person knows to-day that the United States of America is so powerful industrially that no other nation, nor any combination of nations, could successfully wage war against it. The United States of America would inevitably win any war that might be begun within the next 5, 10 or even 25 years. Russia is so far behind, in industrial potential that it with take at least ten years for that country to reach the position which the United States of America occupies  to-day.  By that time, the United States of America will be still as far ahead' as it is now. </para>

                    <para>The Leader of the Opposition said that his government re-introduced compulsory military service, and organized divisions of the Australian Imperial Force to go overseas. It is true that the Labour party opposed) the sending of so many troops overseas, because it was believed that they were needed at home, a fact which was admitted by some of the members of the present Opposition at that time, or very soon afterwards. For example; the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender)-,</inline> when he was Minister for the Army, said in this House that if one Japanese armoured division bad landed in Australia it could have overrun- the whole country. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps, but I am not disclosing information given at a secret meeting. It is public property that the honorable member for Warringah said that if one Japanese armoured division had landed in Australia it could have overrun the country. I do not think that anything is to be gained by raking over old controversies. The Leader of the Opposition spoke in a derogatory fashion of my colleague, the Minister for Works and Housing <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lemmon).</inline> He accused the Minister of shuffling on a particular issue. The Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> deserted their posts during the most critical period in Australia's history. Their parties had a- majority in the House of Representatives and in the Senate, but they both deserted their posts when the country was in danger. The Minister for Works and Housing cannot justly be accused of shuffling on any issue. He was not a member of the Parliament when the events to which reference has been made took place. It does not lie with the Leader of the Opposition or the Leader of the Australian Country party to make accusations against one of my colleagues when they themselves have been convicted at the bar of public opinion of the crime of desertion. That is a crime which, ordinarily, a mam never gets <inline font-style="italic">w</inline> second chance to commit. If the Leader of the Opposition and the- Leader of the Australian' Country party had been members of the armed! forces - which they neves were - and had deserted, they would have been immediately shot. Therefore, it is incomprehensible that they should accuse any one on this side of the committee of shuffling over defence issues. </para>

                    <para>The Leader of the Opposition also said that the Labour Government had inherited' an organization for the manufacture of munitions. That is- true, but it can also be said that the government, which was led by the present Leader of the Opposition, had as its slogan "Business as usual". The right honorable gentleman's government organized the manufacture of munitions, and was responsible for Australia's adherence to the Empire air training scheme; but side by side with that somewhat puny achievement, it evolved the slogan " Business as usual " during a critical period in the history of the country. At that time 250,000 persons, who could have been doing something for the defence of Australia, were unemployed. That is the record of the Opposition parties as a government when the danger to Australia was much greater than it is to-day. </para>
                    <para>The present Government is expending more money on defence, and expending it to better advantage, than did any previous government in peace-time. The money is not being expended merely upon  enlisting persons in the armed forces. It is being expended c a the development of new weapons, and on research, whilst the strength of the armed services is being maintained at a level higher than that of 1938. This Government has a very good record in regard to defence preparations, and I repeat that the threat of war is much less imminent now than it was at the time during which a previous government did less to prepare for the defence of the country. </para>

                        <para>. - After the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett)</inline> had trenchantly criticized Australia's defence training policy this afternoon, the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chambers)</inline> accused him of having indulged in party political propaganda and of having made a personal attack upon himself. Neither charge can rightly be levelled against the honorable member, because, for the last couple of years, ever since the Government enunciated its defence policy, we have criticized it, not for the sake of indulging in party political propaganda, but because we have a deep concern about what we consider to be the inadequacy of the training programme, livery honorable gentleman on this side who, by virtue of his own military service, is, in some way, qualified to speak, has completely condemned the policy. Surely the Minister will realize that the criticism is directed as something far transcending political propaganda, and therefore that it be heeded. But the Minister and his Cabinet colleagues refuse to listen to the criticism. The Minister buries his head ostrich-like in the sands of complacency, and refuses to face facts that ought to be obvious to any one with knowledge of the subject of defence. In reply to criticism of Australia's defence policy, we hear, from time to time, from honorable members opposite, the statement that Australia, has never been better prepared to defend itself than it is at present. Ministers are particularly adept at making that claim. The Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> is very fond of booming it forth, but it will take more than, that to convince the people of Australia, especially those with knowledge of the situation, that the Government's defence policy provides for the adequate defence of Australia. Another justification for its attitude that is advanced by the Government is that Australia, in conjunction with Great Britain, is doing a big job in developing the guided weapons testing range. That is essential and the development cannot be decried, but it cannot take the place of a complete defence policy. It is only a part of the whole picture, many aspects of which are missing. The Government's attitude is based on the belief that the development of the atomic bomb and guided weapons has, in some way, changed the basic character of warfare and  Tendered  unnecessary trained soldiers, sailors and airmen. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>We often hear remarks about "push "button warfare" and other similar fatuities. Throughout history, every time a revolutionary weapon has been introduced, the same opinion has been voiced. It was voiced when the blunderbus replaced bows and arrows, when cannons were developed and when aircraft and tanks were developed. Now that science has developed the atomic bomb and guided weapons, we hear the same contention. Time has proved such an attitude to be fallacious, and it will continue to be fallacious. Every one with a knowledge of warfare knows that once ground has been taken highly-trained men are needed to hold it. No nation has been defeated without being overrun by enemy troops. Therefore, regardless of the development of new weapons, we must have men trained to throw out an invader should one attempt to conquer us. The present system is entirely inadequate, not only to defend Australia properly, but also to enable it to meet its obligations as a major nation in the efforts to preserve world peace. I propose to refer only to the Army and to leave references to the Navy and the Air Force, which I believe are similarly placed, to other honorable members, with experience in those arms, who  are  more competent than I am to talk about them. It is not my intention to offer much criticism of the broad defence plan as distinct from the defence policy. It is the policy that I regard as erroneous. The broad plan is that there shall be established in Australia a regular army consisting of a small highly trained force, which, in peace-time will carry out all the functions necessarily carried out by a regular army in peace-time, but which, in war-time, will be the nucleus of an army capable of adequately defending Australia. In addition, a citizen force is to be established. It will consist of men who will remain citizens, but will be sufficiently trained to enable them efficiently to take their place in the army at short notice to defend Australia. It must be remembered that, in an emergency, the fate of ' Australia would depend, not on the small regular army, but on the citizen army, of which theregular army would be the nucleus. In order to determine the success of our defence policy, we must assess the success that we have had in recruiting and training the citizen army. First, I point out that we are still operating on the voluntary system. I have condemned the system before, and I condemn it again. Under it, the cream of our youth, those who love Australia and have a sense of responsibility, are the ones who answer the call. That means that we are training them to take the first blow. </para>

                        DAVIDSON.- Yes, the Government hopes to develop a militia force of 50.000 men in five years. On that basis, the Minister for the Army contended that the enlistment of 15,000 in the first year or so was a good effort. I challenge that. We cannot afford to sit back complacently for five years hoping that we shall then have reached the stage at which we might be able to defend ourselves. Every one realizes that a force of 50,000 men is too small for the defence of the country. We must have a reasonable force trained as quickly as possible. We cannot sit back and wait for four or five years. The Minister for Defence said that he was satisfied that there would be no war within five years. I hope that he is right, but we must face the fact that the Russian bear may attack at any time. Moreover, the Government cannot expect the enlistment rate of 15,000 a year to continue. It is obvious that no progress is being made with enlistments and that the force has reached its maximum under present conditions. My inquiries have revealed that infantry battalions, which have an establishment of 700 or 800 men, have a maximum strength of about 200. In other words, the battalions are at about 25 per cent. strength. Amazingly, the support units, such as the artillery, are not attracting the enlistment that infantry battalions are attracting. Incoming troops barely balance the outgoing. Troops cannot be trained on imagination. It is practically impossible to train a skeleton force. We must have reasonable numbers of men to enable training to be carried on, particularly in the higher branches. In an under-manned unit, elementary training, such as rifle drill, can proceed, but there is a definite line, not much higher than that, beyond which instructors cannot go. As a result of a question that was asked this morning the fact was elicited that about 5,000 men had left the Militia Forces. I have found that that decrease is going on steadily all the time, and that the first flush of enthusiasm that existed when the recruiting programme started has gone. Men are beginning to drop out and unit commanders can do nothing about it. Apparently the only source left from which to make up the gap between 15,000 men and 50,000 men will be the young men who are now reaching military age. But I fear very much that the majority of those young men are not likely to offer themselves for voluntary military service because of the fact that, as the present system is staggering to  a  stop, the comment made to any one proposing to join up will be, "Don't be  a fool! Why offer? It is not necessary". Another reason that will operate against further enlistments is, as the honorable member for Henty
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett)</inline>
                        rightly said earlier to-day, the fact that the Government used troops as strike breakers in the recent coal strike. I join with the honorable member for Henty in saying that no other action could have been taken that would have had such calamitous effects on our defence policy as the use of those troops had. That action should never have been taken except as a last resort to prevent the country from being thrown into chaos, and I cannot accept any assertion that that was the position. The serious effects of that action on the recruiting programme are obvious to probably all honorable members. When a young man informs his mother that he intends to join the Militia she will say, "What for? To be used as a strike breaker?" The Government's action in using soldiers as strike breakers must, I repeat, have a serious effect on an already unsuccessful scheme.
                    </para>
                    <para>In his reply to the honorable member for Henty the Minister, in an attempt to justify as far as possible the present defence policy claimed that there was plenty of equipment available. He had started out to say how splendidly the present position compared with the position before the last war, but I noticed that he stopped at the subject of equipment. I am quite prepared to concede that the equipment now available for the training of both the Regular Army and the Militia Forces has never been better. But it is not the slightest use having a lot of splendid equipment if it is only to lie in drill halls and ordnance stores. If we have not the men to train in the use of that equipment we might as well not have it. I consider therefore that although it is a matter of congratulation that we at last have some decent equipment, it cannot be claimed that it is something for which the Government should receive credit. </para>

                            <para>- Some of it is. I have seen a great deal of valuable equipment, and if men were trained in its use a great step forward would have been taken. In addition to equipment, we have plenty of fine instructors available at the present time to train the Militia. They are men who served in the last war and whose outlook is such that they are prepared to offer themselves as instructors for the Citizen Forces, and many of them are indeed at present acting as instructors. They command the great respect of the young men whom they are training. The experience of these men should be used to the utmost while it is available, but their enthusiasm is waning. There is a spirit of frustration growing among them because they are becoming' weary of the round of night parades and week-end bivouacs without sufficient men to train. We shall find that unless we do something about getting men for those instructors to train we shall lose their services. If the Government's present policy continues I consider that we shall be lucky if we have even the present 15,000 militiamen at the end of the five-year period. </para>

                    <para>I cannot accept the Minister's complacent assurance that because of the fact that in the first year we got 15,000 recruits we shall obtain the required 50,000 by the end of another four years. All the evidence points to the fact that the momentum that was developed at the start of the scheme has now been lost, and recruiting is actually now working in reverse because so many men are leaving the Citizen Forces. I said at the beginning of my remarks that my criticism does not arise from any desire to make political propaganda. This is far too serious a matter to be used as a basis for political propaganda, because I believe that Australia is facing a steadily increasing menace. We were told by the Minister for the Army this afternoon that there was no particular menace facing us. He told us that Italy was " out " as a nation and that Japan was completely destroyed as a fighting force. He made various other statements of a like nature which suggested that there was no particular threat facing Australia. I need not deal with that matter at great length because the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> has dealt with it very successfully and conclusively, but I draw the attention of the committee to the fact that a red tide is steadily surging down through China at this very moment and there is no knowing when it will stop moving. Already Great Britain has been forced to reinforce the defences of Hong Kong because of that threat. The position in the Netherlands East Indies is, at the moment, indeterminate, and we do not know what will develop there. The statement that Japan has been completely destroyed as a military power is a most dangerous one to be made by a man who holds the position of Minister for the Army. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know how any one who knows how Japan emerged 50 years ago from the dark ages and was able to develop itself to a position where it could do what it did in the last war can say that that nation has been completely destroyed as a fighting force. From what I have seen, Japan, if given a free leg, could become in ten years a serious menace to Australia. It is obvious that it will not be long before a peace treaty with Japan will be signed. The feelers are out already and it is obviously the desire of the United States to finalize such a peace treaty so that it may develop Japan into something in the nature of an ally. There have already been suggestions that Japan may be permitted a certain degree of rearmament. That is the thin end of the wedge. Let us remember that greedy eyes in Japan are turned towards New Guinea. Those honorable members who have been to Japan will bear me out in that statement. There are Americans in Japan who consider that one of the outlets for surplus Japanese population lies in the direction of Australia. In view of these facts - and they are facts - the statement that Japan has been completely destroyed as a possible threat to Australia cannot be sustained. </para>

                    <para>In addition to the menace facing Australia which I have briefly outlined it must also be remembered that Australia has certain obligations under the North Atlantic Pact, and lately there have been suggestions that a Pacific pact should be brought into being. According to recent statements that have been published it appears as if the United .States, which previously was not very favorable to the suggestion for a Pacific pact, is now turning its thoughts to the development of such a pact somewhat along the lines of the North Atlantic Pact. Australia would have to play a major part in such  a  pact. Having regard to Australia's present capacity for defence I  ask  whether we could expect America to place any great reliance upon this country as a partner in the Pacific. We should certainly not be in a position to do anything of a major nature  in  respect of taking any great share of the obligations which we might incur under such a pact. Yet the development of such a pact is vastly important. If we could show that we were moving towards  a  realization of our obligations, as New Zealand has done, the likelihood of such a pact coming into existence would be increased. </para>
                    <para>I conclude by placing a plea before the Minister for the Army to pay some attention to the opinions expressed by honorable members on this side of the committee. I assure him that those opinions are not voiced for purely political purposes. They are based on sound knowledge. If the Minister would care to appoint a select committee of the House of Representatives to investigate charges that the training of the militia forces  is  not proceeding as it should be doing,  and  call in service chiefs who would not otherwise be in a position to speak their minds, he would discover that there  is  a substantial basis for our charges. Improvements in the scheme which would result from such an inquiry would lead to a development of Australia's defence policy so that this country could claim eventually that it was in a position to defend itself. That is not the position at present. </para>

                        <para>.- It is necessary to take a thorough overall view of the whole defence position and not only one small aspect of it because after all we speak here as the representatives of a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations. Honorable members opposite have displayed recently a really anti-British attitude on every occasion on which we, on this side of the chamber, have mentioned the British Empire. We must study this matter in a large sense. The  British  Empire is founded on a strong fighting navy and a strong merchant navy. It would be futile to say that defence of such  a scattered Empire as ours could be maintained without the existence of a strong British Navy. The Government has been criticized because of its attitude towards defence. An examination of the relevant figures will show that there is no basis for such criticism. The Royal Australian Navy now has a strength of 10,000 effective personnel compared with a strength of 5,000 effective personnel in 1939. </para>

                            <para>- I am not adopting a party political attitude. I am merely stating facts. The point is that as soon as we on this side advance concrete facts honorable members opposite start to squeal or laugh like hyenas. Let us consider what has been done by the present Government in respect of naval defence. The Menzies Government spent £9,000,000 or £10,000,000 on naval construction, but since 1947 the present Government has expended £60,000,000 on naval defence. Honorable members opposite would have the people believe that this Government has not played its part in taking measures for the defence of this country. In the Anzac Pact we have agreed with our sister dominion, New Zealand, to take joint measures for our protection and security. I understand that the fleets of the two dominions are now engaged on joint manoeuvres, off the Australian coast, in which they will gain experience in joint operations which would be of inestimable value should our countries again be plunged into war. That is merely another step that has been taken by the Labour Government in discharging its responsibilities for the defence of Australia. We have also reached an understanding with our great ally, the United States of America, with regard to the defence of the Pacific area. </para>

                    <para>Honorable members opposite have indulged in a good deal of criticism regarding the aircraft carrier H.M.A.S. <inline font-style="italic">Sydney,</inline> which is the latest addition to the Royal Australian Navy. They have said that the vessel is already obsolete. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is well known to most honorable members that after the laying of the keel of a vessel alterations are frequently made in design and construction before the vessel is completed. I had an opportunity to inspect a number of large aircraft carriers in Great Britain the construction of which had been deferred because of alterations in the original design. That is occurring continually in the Mother Country, which is the home of the British Navy and which has taught the peoples of other nations how- to man and use ships to the best advantage. It ill becomes honorable members opposite to criticize the efforts that have been made by this Government to honour its obligations to safeguard the defence of the Commonwealth. During World War II., when our fighting forces returned from the Middle East, they had to be re-trained in order that they would be able to acquit themselves adequately in jungle warfare, for which they had not previously been trained. Similarly, in the building of warships, frequent changes of design are made, either to meet the requirements of service in certain waters or to provide for variations in the design of armaments. Honorable members opposite would have the people believe that because a Labour government is in office in this country it can not be trusted with the secrets of scientific warfare. I have never before listened to such claptrap as that. The simple fact is that Australia is to play an important part in the construction and development of secret war weapons. I had the privilege of listening to the British Defence Minister outline his views on the future of secret weapons in the defence of the British Commonwealth. No suggestion was made by him that Australia was mistrusted in this matter. On the contrary, he said that we must all work with those with whom we knew we can work amicably. The truth of that statement is borne out by the fact that Australia was subsequently selected as the proving ground for long-range weapons which are on the secret list. Honorable members opposite cloud and misconstrue the facts to suit their own purposes. They would have the Government reveal all its defence plans. If that were done our potential enemies would be jubilant. If the British Commonwealth is to survive every member of it must develop a virile naval force. The British Navy has always played an important part, not only in the winning of wars, but also in the maintenance of peace. No one can say that the British Navy did not play a very important part in maintaining peace in the world in the period between the two world wars. It is useless for honorable members opposite to indulge in destructive criticism of the kind that has marked their contribution to the debate on these Estimates. For the preservation of our scattered Empire, it is essential that all its component parts shall play their part in developing naval strength to the utmost of their ability. At least the Australian Labour Government can claim that it has played its part in that direction. </para>

                        <para>.- I propose to reply briefly to some of the remarks that were made by the honorable member for Boothby <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Sheehy).</inline> Nobody can be satisfied that any branch of our armed services is satisfactory to-day. Everybody realizes that the future is fraught with great difficulties and that the possession of one aircraft carrier and a limited number of naval craft does not give us any cause for satisfaction. If the honorable member for Boothby is satisfied with that state of affairs he has po cognizance of the problems that beset us. The Government is much too complacent in this matter. In the very limited time at my disposal I propose to deal briefly with the failure of the Government to adopt an adequate and sound defence policy. The mere fact that a guided weapons range has been established at Woomera, in South Australia, does not satisfy me that the Government is doing everything possible to take advantage of the latest developments in scientific warfare. The Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chambers)</inline> has said that the permanent forces now number 15,500 personnel. In answer to a question which I asked on the subject the honorable gentleman admitted that more than one-third of that number are non-combatants. That means that we have only approximately 10,500 combatant personnel. The honorable gentleman also admitted that 5,000 men had recently left the forces. That is a very sad story which does not justify the complacency that has been exhibited by the Government in relation to defence matters. On every occasion on which the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> has answered questions relating to defence or has dealt with matters relating to defence, he has boasted that Australia now has a larger defence force than it has ever had in its history during a time of peace. Such statements can be characterized as irresponsible and dangerous nonsense. In 1938, just prior to the outbreak of World War II., the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> was requested by the Lyons Government to increase our militia forces from a total strength of 30,000 to 75,000. At the right honorable gentleman's request I was given the task of assisting him in Queensland. As the result of his efforts the militia forces of this country were increased beyond the target strength to a total of 85,000. After three months' training those 85,000 young men became the nucleus of the 2nd Australian Imperial Force which played such a prominent part in World War II. 1 invite honorable members to compare the strength of the militia forces in those days with the pitifully small permanent army that we have to-day. Surely the Minister for Defence cannot be satisfied with his efforts. How oan he claim that he is perfectly satisfied with the manner in which the Government's five-year defence programme is being implemented? During the eighteen months in which that programme has been in operation he has succeeded in enlisting a permanent army of a total strength of only 15,000 of whom one-third are non-combatants. Honorable members on this side of the chamber and the people of Australia generally are dissatisfied with the Government's defence policy. </para>

                        great deal of time has been wasted by honorable members opposite in trying to convince the people that they should derive a great deal- of satisfaction from the fact that, in conjunction with the British Government, the Commonwealth has established a guided weapons range in South Australia. That project will make little or no contribution to the defence of Australia for some time to come. It is merely experimental, and if it is successful a long time will elapse before practical advantage can be taken of it. What this country wants more than anything else at the moment is an army of skilled specialists to use the mechanized equipment with which modern wars are fought. Large numbers of trained personnel who served in World War II. are willing and anxious to help to train young men in the use of modern equipment. The Minister should do everything possible to secure their services by making the conditions of service in the armed forces attractive. I have a great regard for Lieutenant-General Savige, who is well known to every member of this Parliament. Lieutenant-General Savige has been most forthright in his condemnation of the state of our military forces, He does not bandy words. According to the press, this great soldier, who served with distinction in the two world wars, is unequivocally dissatisfied with our militia forces as they exist to-day. He is reported to have said recently -

                    <para>According to the Minister for the Army, we have a regular army of 19,000 men. I regard that force as a nucleus upon which to build. We must increase the size of the militia forces, which will, in my opinion, be required to shoulder the greatest burden if war occurs. If we approach this problem properly, we shall be able to establish a militia force that will be worthy of Australia. In 1938 we increased the size of the militia to 85,000 men, and I believe that we could do so again if the necessary effort were made. Nobody who has the interests of this country at heart can be satisfied with the present position. I appeal to the Minister to accept the advice of senior military officers, especially LieutenantGeneral Savige, who has stated that the lack of men in Australia who have been trained in the use of modern weapons is a menace to the safety of this country. </para>

Neither the right honorable gentleman nor his predecessor as Prime Minister was game enough then to do what he thought should be done. The Australian people will surely be puzzled by the attempt of the right honorable gentleman to blame a party that was in a minority  in both houses of the Parliament for the failure of the Government prior to the outbreak of war to establish adequate and efficient defence forces in this country. The right honorable gentleman referred to the late John Curtin and his opposition to certain proposed defence measures. In 1936 I served with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin</inline> on a committee that drew up the defence policy of the Labour party for presentation to the people at the 1937 general election. What <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin</inline> desired was an efficient air force. I ask honorable gentlemen opposite how efficient our air force was in 1939. </para>

In the debate on these Esti mates honorable gentlemen opposite have been indulging in the tactics in which they have indulged for the last three years. On every occasion when a member of the Opposition makes a speech in this chamber he endeavours to sow in the minds of the people the seeds of distrust and suspicion of the Government. He suggests that the Government will not protect the country by doing what is necessary for our defence and that it will ruin us. Honorable gentlemen opposite must have a very poor opinion of the intelligence of the people if they think that they will be misled by statements of that kind. </para>

                    <para>Why was there a change of minis <inline font-style="italic">\ry</inline> in 1941? Honorable gentlemen opposite talk of unity, but when the present Leader of the Opposition was Prime Minister, the Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. .</inline> Fedden)  also wanted to occupy the post and the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> said that he was the man for it. The people of Australia were wondering who would be the man who would lead them in the war. Eventually two of the supporters of that Government said, in effect, " If you are going to make such a poor showing by arguing amongst yourselves, and if you are going to jeopardize the defence of Australia, we shall turn you out of office ". They did so, and a minority party, the Labour party, formed the Government. That minority party did such a wonderful job that it was returned to office with a record majority at the 1943 general election. At that time  [ remember talking to men in trains and in the streets. They said to me, "We want John Curtin ". They gave the party that was led by John Curtin a majority in this House that it had never had before. There were no fights in the ranks of the Labour party. Our fight was with the enemy. The members of the Menzies Government did not have the guts to say to the people of Australia, " We are going to make this an all-in war. Every man in the country must play his part ". We did that in spite of the opposition of some members of our own party. We were prepared to do what was necessary for the defence of Australia, and to take risks. Honorable gentlemen opposite often talk about taking risks, but when the parties to which  they belong were in power they were not prepared to take the risk of saying to everybody in Australia, whether they were serving in the forces or engaged in industry or business, that they would have to play their part in the war. On the contrary they adopted the attitude, " Business as usual for the business man and let the volunteers carry on with the fight ". The people of Australia are quite satisfied that the Labour Government has shown, by deeds and not by words, that it is prepared to do the job. </para>

                        <para>.- I do not propose at this juncture to refer to the administration of the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Barnard)</inline> in relation to the War Pensions Entitlement Appeal Tribunal and the War Pensions Assessment Appeal Tribunal. I pointed out on a previous occasion that the Minister decided to dismiss a tribunal for having questioned his administration, and that he refused to accept a report from a tribunal, under threat of dismissal, unless it was prepared to alter the document to conform to his own opinions. I mention those matters only to show that the remarks which I shall make about war pensions generally are completely consistent with the Minister's failure to administer the Department of Repatriation in a proper manner. </para>

                    <para>The Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act, in my opinion and in the opinion of quite a number of those who have some knowledge of this matter, should be completely overhauled. The original act has been amended piece-meal since its introduction in 1920 by the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes).</inline> However, the act and the regulations promulgated thereunder have not been completely overhauled, and as the result of two world wars, a considerable number of anomalies have arisen, the general effect of which has been to penalize ex-service men and women. It appears to me that ex-service men and women constitute one class which should receive sympathetic consideration from the Government. Unfortunately, they receive scant consideration from this Government, and possibly less consideration than other sections of the community receive. That impression is held so widely among ex-servicemen that the joint organization of ex-servicemen's associations has prepared what it describes as a 33-point plan for submission to the Government. </para>

                            <para>- I accept the correction, because it shows that the ex-servicemen's organizations are dissatisfied about three other points in addition to the 33 that are known to me. If the representatives of ex-servicemen can indicate 36 points of the act which bear  harshly upon them and worsen their position compared with that of other sections of the community my contention that the act should be completely overhauled must stand unchallenged. The Minister stated that he informed the representatives of the joint organization of ex-servicemen's associations that the Government would not increase the rates of repatriation pensions. According to reports, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> later confirmed the Minister's statement. The Government is more concerned with providing social services benefits than with rendering simple justice to ex-service men and women by increasing the rates of the various categories of war  pensions.  It seems that the Government prefers that war pensions should be  abolished and that repatriation benefits and social services generally should be paid from the National Welfare Fund. That impression seems to be borne out by the fact that the Government is keeping the rate of the war pensions static. While the Government succeeds in doing so, it will be diverting to the National Welfare Fund money that should rightly be allocated to increasing war pensions. </para>

                    <para>I shall cite some examples. The percentage of the national income which was expended in 1939 on pensions for those who had fought in the Boer War and World War I. is almost equal to the percentage of the national income that is now being expended on the payment of pensions to those who served in the Boer War, World War I. and World War II. It is a misnomer to refer to " war pensions ". A war pension should be regarded as compensation to men who lost limbs or were broken in health as the result of serving their country in wars. The payment is an obligation that the Government and the people should assume. Of course, the Government does not  recognize  that fact and, in my opinion, it regards war pensions merely as an obligation to be met by the payment, in many instances, of the minimum rate. Since the end of World War II., the increase of war pensions has lagged far behind the soaring cost of living, and the steady decline of the purchasing power of the war pension is quite evident. However, the basic wage and the age and invalid pension have frequently been adjusted to meet the increasing cost of living. I mention those points, because later I shall compare the increase of age and invalid  pensions  in relation to the basic wage, with the increase of war pensions in relation to the basic wage. </para>
                    <para>One of the anomalies which inflicts the greatest degree of hardship is that war pension rates are not sufficient to enable the recipients to maintain a reasonable standard of living. Obviously, if wages and costs rise, but war pensions remain static, the recipients are penalized. Let us consider how the purchasing power of the 100 per cent, war pension has been allowed to fall, notwithstanding the fact that the national income <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> has increased since 1939 by approximately 86 per cent. </para>
                    <para class="block">Age and invalid .pensions have increased by approximately the same percentage, but the 100 per cent, war pension and the special war pension have been increased by only 30 per cent, in 10 years. The 10.0 per cent, war pension in 1939 was £2 2s. ,a week, and at present it is £2 15s. a week, an increase of 31 per cent. The rate of the special war pension in 1939 was £4 a week and to-day it is £5 6s. a week, an increase of 32.5 per cent. Honorable members will see that my statements about the decline of the purchasing power of war pensions are borne out by those figures. I shall now examine war pensions in relation to the basic wage in 1939 and in August of this year. The 100 per cent, war pension was £2 2s. a week, and the basic wage was £3 19s. a week in 1939. In other words, the 100 per cent war pension was 53 per cent, of the basic wage at that time. In August, 1949, the basic wage was £6 7s. a week and the 100 per cent, war pension was £2 15s., or only 43 per cent, of the basic wage. Those of us who watch economic trends know that the basic wage will continue to be further increased. I have no doubt that, before the general election on the 10th December next, the basic wage will be increased to £6 10s. a week. The 100 per cent, war pension will have to be increased to 70s. a week if it is to bear the same relation to the basic wage now as it bore to the basic wage in 1939. The case for the increase is unanswerable. </para>
                    <para>All civilian pensions and the basic wage have been adjusted in accordance with the increased cost of living, but ex-servicemen, who have lost a limb or who have been broken in health through helping to preserve our democratic way of life and our standard of living, are not being treated so sympathetically as civilian pensioners are. I do not desire to suggest that war pensions should rise or fall according to fluctuations in the cost of living. I do not suggest that the 100 per cent, pension rate should be adjusted automatically in accordance with variations in cost of living figures. Perhaps the Minister, calling upon his imagination, could evolve some other method of dealing with the problem. At any rate, it is clearly our duty to honour our obligations to the ex-servicemen who answered the call to defend their country. They  should- not be placed in a worse position than other sections of the community. In 1939, the full war pension represented 53 per cent, of the basic wage; now it represents only 43 per cent., and if an adjustment is not made soon the disparity will be still greater. If the Treasurer, whose coffers are overflowing, can grant concessions to other sections of the community, he can well afford to do justice to ex-servicemen. </para>
                    <para>Before the war, the Australian Soldiers'' Repatriation Act was amended to provide that wives of ex-servicemen, who married ' after the 30th June, 1938, should be excluded from benefits under the act. The "Minister, no doubt, will remind me that the amendment was made while a government which I supported was in power. That is so, but the amendment has led to some anomalies, and I have here particulars of a case in point. An ex-serviceman has written to me in these terms -  1 will try to point out the injustice by stating my own case. </para>
                    <para>I married in December 1941 and refrained from doing so earlier because I felt, in justice to any woman I should not add further responsibilities, either from a health or financial point of view, until the doctors told me it was safe to marry. </para>
                    <para>The writer was suffering from tuberculosis. The letter continues - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>For taking the commonsense point of view I am now ineligible for any assistance for my wife. </para>
                        <para>My action thus prevented the spreading of infection, and also saved the Government financial liability for a wife for all those years from 1919 to my marriage in 1941. </para>
                        <para>It seems hard that privileges should be granted to those men who, often very unwisely married quite early in their T.B. life, and that penalties be imposed on those who, in the wisdom of their doctors, felt their health prevented them from taking on the responsibilities of a married life earlier than they did. </para>
                        <para>Returned men feel that this section of the Act should be amended by deleting that section, after which date, 30th June, 1938, a man may not receive help for his wife if he marries. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>I shall give this letter to the Minister, but I do not know whether he has power to do anything about it. The writer was suffering from tuberculosis, which was at an infectious stage. He was a man of some standing, and his doctor advised him that if he married he would be doing a disservice to the community. </para>
                    <para class="block">He would be likely to infect his wife, and if there were children they might be infected too.  His  doctor advised him not to marry until he was given a clean bill of health. He could have refused to accept his doctor's advice. He could have married, and possibly spread the infection, thereby imposing, upon the Government additional liabilities. However, he refrained from marrying until he was given a clean bill of health. He is now married, and complains that, because he faced his responsibilities as a citizen, he has been penalized. That is an anomaly which ought to be corrected. The Minister should be given discretionary power to, deal with cases of the kind. There cannot be many of them, and no great demand would be made on the Treasury by giving favorable consideration to applications of ex-servicemen in such a position. I appreciate the fact that the act was amended to cover cases in which women married ex-servicemen for the sole purpose of deriving benefits under the act. I am not quarreling with the general provision. The principle of the amendment was sound, but the anomalies created by it have become apparent only since the provision has been in operation, and something should be done to correct those anomalies. I make no apology for my general remarks on war pensions. I believe that, compared with other persons in the community, the position of ex-servicemen is worse than it- used to be. The Minister should have pressed for increased rates in order to maintain the same relation between war pensions and the basic wage as obtained in 1939. Because he failed to do so, he has fallen down on his job. </para>

                        <para>. - I congratulate the honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> on the temperate way in which he stated his case. Such behaviour is most unusual for him. On this occasion, he tiptoed through the tulips because he knew very well that there would be little justification for his remarks if he were carrying the responsibility that now rests upon me as Minister. He kept very carefully away from one aspect of repatriation that has been Qf special interest to him in recent years. He mentioned it in only a casual way, because he does not wish to have much to say about it. seeing that the election is so close. I refer to the question of the onus of proof in cases that come up for hearing before the War Pensions Entitlement Appeal Tribunal. I remind the honorable member for Wentworth that he was one of those who voted against the proposal to place the onus of proof on the Repatriation Commission, the 'State repatriation boards, and on the entitlement tribunal, tie poses as the champion of ex-servicemen, but when the Labour party, which was then in opposition, wished to place the onus of proof upon the various bodies that deal with applications for war pensions, he voted against the proposal. </para>

The honorable member for Bendigo <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rankin)</inline> was one of those who voted for the proposal, 'but the honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony)</inline> voted with the honorable member for Wentworth against it. I can read the division list to the honorable member if he wants me to. The Labour Government has put the amending provision into operation with great pleasure, so that hundreds of men, who had been denied pensions when the honorable member for Wentworth was Minister for Repatriation, have received them since I have been Minister. However, I do not propose to pursue that point further, nor to place on record once more the relevant division list. That was done as recently as June last. The honorable member for Wentworth put his case very temperately, but some of his statements need to be appropriately replied to. First, he said that the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act should be completely overhauled, and that it had not been overhauled since its introduction by the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes).</inline> The honorable member knows that that is untrue, because an almost completely new act was introduced by my predecessor, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Frost,</inline> who then represented Franklin. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable member reads it, he will find it almost a completely new act. Between- 1920 and 1943, so many anomalies came to light that it was decided to redraft the legislation in order to remove them. All the amendments of the principal act were consolidated as recently as 1943. So the honorable member draws a very long bow when he talks about the need for a complete overhaul of the act. I remind him that the amendments that were made in the 1943 act were based on the report and recommendations of a committee composed of returned soldiers from all sections of the Parliament. The committee was presided over by my honorable friend, the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard).</inline> The new legislation provided for an increase of pensions by 20 per cent. The honorable member went on to talk about a 33-point plan. Actually, the plan presented to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Chifley)</inline> and myself is a 36-point plan. A good deal of time has been spent on examining the document. I presume that the honorable gentleman wanted to reduce it to a 33-point plan, because several of the requests made in it were adopted and passed into law about 12 months ago. I do not propose to take up the time of the committee in enumerating them, but half a dozen sections of the plan have already been given legislative force in compliance with a request made by ex-service organizations at least a year ago. So much for the plan. We are still examining other proposals which it contains. We hope to be able to reach a decision on some of the other requests contained in it as soon as the Cabinet, is able to have a look at it. The honorable gentleman went on to say that returned soldiers' pensions had been kept static. For the benefit of honorable members, I am getting out a document that gives a complete picture of pensions. </para>

                    <para class="block">There may be photographs of some repatriation institutions that we are proud of. Between 1914 and 1916, when soldiers were paid 6s. a day, the rate of pension was £2 a week. It was not until the 6th May, 1943, that the rate was increased to £2 10s. The honorable member criticizes the Government for not having done anything for ex-servicemen. In effect, he has said that since 1939 we have not done this or ought to have done that. But he ignores the fact that, between 1914 and 1943, the pension of returned soldiers was not increased. I could quote the figures to show the increase granted by this Government. A good deal has been said about the 100 per cent, pension, that is the pension paid to an ex-serviceman whose disability is assessed at 100 per cent, incapacity. Whereas he formerly received a pension of £2, he now receives £2 15s. a week, and he can earn whatever pay he is able to earn. In other words, there is no means test. </para>

The honorable member for Wentworth makes the astounding claim that ex-servicemen who work in industry, and have had the benefit of increases of the basic wage, should have their pensions fixed at a higher rate to accord with the increase of the cost of living. The pension has no relation whatever to the basic wage. Ex-service organizations - at least, the Returned Sailors.

                            <para>- The reason is that they do not desire the basic wage and the pension to be related as far as increases or decreases of the cost of living are concerned. They are prepared to rely on the generosity or lack of generosity of the Government in determining the rate of the pension. We have never applied falls or rises of the cost of living to any ex-service pensioner, from the " 100 per cent-er" to the "10 per cent-er". The increase of the pension was decided on by the Government, that is the Labour Government, because no other government gave an increase at all. NonLabour governments applied the means test to war widows. Until 1943, a widow who had a little property and let a couple of rooms to supplement her pension by a small amount, received the handsome pension of £1 3s. 6d. a week. The means test was always applied to widows until Labour came to the treasury bench in 1941. </para>

No means test is applied to the 100 per cent, pensioner who, without suffering a reduction of his pension, may earn whatever his physical or mental condition allows him to earn. In earning that money, he reaps the benefit of increases of the basic wage in accordance with the increase of the cost of living. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Wentworth describes the pension as compensation for services rendered. He talked about pensions being revised periodically. Pension rates were revised in 1943 and they have been revised at least twice since I have been Minister. Increases of pensions during my term of office have meant that an additional amount of £2,000,000 is now circulating among ex-servicemen. </para>

Surely the honorable member would not argue that a man who is in receipt of the basic wage and who receives a 100 per cent, war pension, should have it both ways. As far as special rate pensioners are concerned I agree that there is some validity in the argument that a man who is in receipt of a pension of £5 6s. a week for himself and £1 4s. a week for his wife, and who has to pay rent, must be having a struggle to live. </para>

                            <para>- I agree with that. Some of these special rate pensioners earn some proportion of the basic wage, but what about the man who gets £3 or £4 a week from a superannuation fund? That amount is not taken into account because it is not produced by personal exertion. What about the man who is a director of a firm and who has an income that is not produced by personal exertion? We cannot measure all cases by the same yardstick. If a concession is given to one person it must be given all down the line. </para>

                            <para>- It is described in the relevant act as a pension. Everybody refers to it as a pension and it has been referred to by that name right down through the years. The honorable member has raised an objection to the term used only because he wants to be critical about this whole subject. It is not of much use for the honorable member to shake his head about it, because that will not alter the position. The honorable gentleman referred to the special case of a tuberculous ex-serviceman. I deal with special cases every day. Special cases are always with us. The yardstick used in respect of other cases is not suitable for tubercular cases. Only recently the  president  of the Tubercular Sailors and Soldiers Association came to me and offered me his congratulations upon what the Government had done in the readjustment of pension rates for tuberculous ex-servicemen. The honorable gentleman mentioned a case of a man who married after a certain date, but he anticipated my answer because that was a matter that was decided long before a Labour government came into office. When returned servicemen's organizations made a recommendation to this Government regarding what they considered should be provided in the new act of 1943 they did not recommend the abolition of that particular section. They recommended that the maximum period in respect of soldiers from World War I. should be twenty years and that for soldiers of World War II. it should be fifteen years. That recommendation was made by returned soldiers, some of whom are still members of this Parliament. The Government accepted the recommendation and that provision remains in the act. </para>

                    <para>Let us return for a moment to the question of totally and permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen. It is true that a totally and permanently incapacitated ex-serviceman with no children must be finding it hard to live on his rate of pension. But that is not all we do for him. We have a very excellent system of education for the children of such people. As soon as a child living at home starts to go to school he is enabled to get tram fares, books and so on until he reaches the age of thirteen years. The rate of educational allowance paid in respect of a child was formerly 6s. a week, but it has been increased by this Government to 9s. a week for children between the ages of thirteen and fourteen. We also provide school books and sporting requisites for such children. The educational allowance in respect of children between the ages of fourteen and sixteen is 12s. a week and at sixteen years of age, when the pension ceases to be payable, educational assistance goes up to 33s. a week if the child is living at home, and 50s. a week if living away from home. While children are at school we pay for books and provide sporting requisites. We even make an allowance to them if they go to a university. The allowance for a boy learning a trade is 45s. a week in his first year of appren ticeship, and for a girl it is 40s. a week. If the young people are living, away from home the rates are 60s. and 55s. respectively. The pension rate is not a maximum rate but it is a minimum rate, in effect, because of additional benefits available. The Government regards itself as not being ungenerous .to ex-servicemen. I agree that some sections of ex-servicemen have some difficulty in making ends meet, but I hope that a little later on we shall be able to review the matter and make  some  provision for those who find themselves in great difficulty because of rising prices. As far as the 36-poi.nt plan of the Returned Servicemen's League is concerned I hope that we shall be able to do something more about that matter in the very near future. The Government has a record of achievement of service to ex-servicemen since it has been in office of which it can be justly proud. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable gentleman may say that, but returned servicemen, especially those who have had some responsibility as officials of ex-servicemen's organizations, would tell the honorable member that they approve of what the Government has done for them in removing anomalies in the act and in providing more generous pensions, allowances, educational benefits and medical attention. I think that in many cases ex-servicemen recognize that while they may desire to have more, the Government has not been ungenerous to them. </para>

                    <para>Last week we heard some criticism of repatriation hospitals and of the Heidelberg Military Hospital in particular. Some general reference was made to repatriation hospitals by the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett).</inline> The honorable gentleman is usually fairly generous in his comments on those matters. If he desires to level criticisms at repatriation hospitals I consider that he should cite specific instances. Almost daily I receive letters of commendation, not only from people high up in the social world who visit repatriation hospitals, but also from people lower down in the social scale. They commend the Government for the services rendered by the  staffs of repatriation hospitals. I confess that in a big institution where there are perhaps 1,600 patients and a very big staff, there may be from time to time some matters that require tightening up. If such cases were brought to the notice of the department it would have an opportunity to deal with them. I say in conclusion that as far as repatriation hospitals are concerned the Government has real grounds for pride, and so have the returned soldiers. </para>

                        <para>. - The group of Estimates that we are debating covers the expenditure that is to be incurred by this Government for benefits of ex-servicemen. I wish to examine what this Government is doing, and to compare it with what a previous non-Labour Government did after World War I. I shall also compare the measure of prosperity now being enjoyed by ex-servicemen with their plight four years after World War 1. ended. The total expenditure incurred by the Commonwealth on all forms of benefits to ex-servicemen of World War II., up to the present time, amounts to £88,'000,000. That amount is accounted for under various headings. First of all the Commonwealth reconstruction training scheme provides university-type training covering many thousands of ex-servicemen who take professional courses to become doctors, dentists, scientists, engineers and so on, and has involved an expenditure, up to the 31st July last, of approximately £11,000,000. That amount includes almost £7,000,000 for living allowances and £1,600,000 for tuition fees. <inline font-style="italic">[Quorum formed.]</inline> The amount also includes more than £1,000,000 for additional courses and more than £1,000,000 for accommodation and equipment. An amount has been provided for technical and vocational-type training under the Commonwealth reconstruction training scheme which includes training for all types of trades. A sum total of £24,000,000 has been expended on that activity up to the 31st July last. That sum included £8,000,000 for living allowances, £5,000,000 for tuition fees, and more than £9,000,000 for subsidies to employers. As honorable members know how this scheme is operated, I shall not go into details with regard to it. It is a magnificent scheme for the rehabilitation and reestablishment of ex-servicemen, and it far excels any scheme that was put into operation by anti-Labour governments after World War I. In connexion with rural type training an amount of approximately £1,000,000 has already been expended. There are certain liabilities in relation to pensions but as that matter has been dealt with by the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Barnard),</inline> I shall not deal with it now. On the supplementation of apprentices' wages an amount of £3,500,000 has been expended. Grants have also been made of furniture loans. Small business loans and agricultural loans of less than £250 have accounted for approximately £5,000,000. There are many other items such as medical treatment for war-caused disabilities, free passages to and from the Commonwealth, re-employment allowances and removal expenses, on which heavy expenditure has been incurred. A total of £88,000,000 has been expended on the rehabilitation and re-establishment of ex-servicemen. The Labour Government realized, in drawing up all these plans for re-establishment and rehabilitation of ex-servicemen, that they could be implemented only if the community as a whole was prosperous. Consequently, the whole plan was envisaged in an economy enjoying full employment. It can be truthfully said that there are no ex-servicemen in the community who have not already been re-established or rehabilitated or who are not now in the course of being successfully re-established or rehabilitated. I ask honorable members to contrast that position with the position that existed four years after the termination of World War I. I have taken the trouble to examine the Estimates for 1921-22 in order to make such a comparison. <inline font-style="italic">[Quorum formed,"]</inline></para>

The Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of 4th April, 1922, reports the visit of a deputation of mayors representing 26 municipalities, headed by the Lord Mayor of Melbourne, to the Victorian Premier to urge the Victorian Government to co-operate in providing as much work as possible for unemployed ex-servicemen. The deputation also tried to see the Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> but was unable to do so. The Lord Mayor informed the Premier that between 1,100 and 1,200 returned men with families were on the verge of starvation. </para>

                    <para>A conference of Mayors was convened by the Lord Mayor to consider measures for providing employment for returned soldiers. The Lord Mayor said the League and associations interested in returned soldiers had agreed to form a confederacy. The idea was that there should be only one central organization dealing with unemployed soldiers. </para>

                        <para>The serious aspect of the industrial situation in Newcastle has been increased by the closing down of the works of Rylands Bro6. The works have been devoted mainly to the manufacture of wire netting. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">We have heard a number of complaints from honorable gentlemen opposite that soldier settlers cannot get sufficient wire netting to meet their requirements. The reason is that, because of the prosperity of primary producers generally, there is such a great demand for wire netting now that supplies are insufficient. That is in marked contrast with the situation in  1922  when farmers bad not sufficient money to buy enough wire netting to keep the wire netting works in production. The present situation is entirely different from that which existed in 1922. I have given the committee a description of the plight of returned servicemen in 1922. When the federal  president  of the Returned Servicemen's League visited me in Canberra not very long ago he said that he had not one criticism to make of what the Department of Post-war Reconstruction was doing for returned servicemen. The only matters that he had to raise in relation to the welfare of returned servicemen were matters that were taken up with the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Barnard).</inline> It can be said that this Government has looked after the interests of the returned servicemen of this country on this occasion very much better than they were looked after by anti-Labour governments after World War I. </para>

I repeat for the information of the honorable member for Swan (MrHamilton) that the amount that has been expended upon living allowances for university trainees is £7,000,000. Approximately £8,000,000- has been expended upon living allowances for trainees undergoing technical and vocational training. </para>

                    <para>I propose to make one or two remarks about land settlement. After World War I. land settlement was undertaken by the State governments. It was so badly managed that it cost the Commonwealth approximately £30,000,000 to write off debts that were incurred. The main reason for that situation was that land was bought at prices that were far too high. Returned servicemen who were settled on the land after World War I. were left with a millstone of debt hanging round their necks. <inline font-style="italic">[Quorum formed?]</inline></para>

                            <para>- After World War I., many returned servicemen spent many years of their lives in trying to make a success of the properties that ha*d been allotted to them under the war service land settlement schemes of that time. They incurred huge debts. Eventually they found that it was quite impossible to make a living, and they had to leave their blocks and start life afresh. After a period of years, debts to the value of over £30,000,000 were written off by the Commonwealth. On this occasion we have taken steps to ensure that returned servicemen who go on the land will get a fair deal. We have also taken steps to ensure that the valuations of their properties will be such as to enable them to earn a reasonable personal income, to pay all their expenses and eventually to make a great success of the blocks on which they have been established. </para>

The Commonwealth has arrived at an agreement with Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania in relation to valuations. The same remark applies to Queensland. The New South Wales Government has indicated that it does not wish to fix the valuations for another five years. Victoria is the only State with which I have had any difficulty in relation to land valuations. </para>

                    <para>I shall give to the committee some details of the war service land settlement scheme. Up to the 30th June this year, the proposals submitted by State governments related to an area of 9,235,000 acres. The area approved by the Commonwealth as suitable for war service land settlement was over 7,000,000 acres. The number of properties approved for acquisition was over 1,000, involving an area of almost 7,000,000 acres. The number of properties acquired by State governments for war service land settlement was S37, covering an area of 6,000,000 acres. The number of properties approved for subdivision was 551, covering 3,000,000 acres. The number of single farm units approved by the Commonwealth, the great majority of which are in New South Wales, was 468, covering an area of 3,000,000 acres. </para>

                            <para>- That is not true. The honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Turnbull)</inline> does not know what he is talking about. I have always been prepared to accept single farm propositions provided they are submitted to me within the terms of the War Service Land Settlement Agreements. If the honorable gentleman knew anything about the agreements he would know that I have no power to refuse to consider single farm unit propositions provided they are within the terms of the agreements. I did object to considering propositions that were not put forward within the terms of the agreements. I refused to have anything to do with propositions of that kind. None of them has been accepted by me. That is not because of my objection to them, but because they did not come within the terms of the relevant legislation. Some single farm propositions have been dealt with by the Victorian Government outside the War Service Land Settlement Agreement altogether. The fact that they are being dealt with by the Victorian Government does not mean that if that Government had put them up to me within the terms of its agreement, I should not have accepted them. State governments are bound to comply with the terms of the agreements in the same way as I am bound to comply with them. The total sum of money that has been expended upon war service land settlement to date is approximately £16,000,000. Approximately one-half of that sum of money has been expended upon the acquisition and development of estates generally and upon rural training for the settlers who will occupy the blocks. The remainder of the money has been expended upon re-establishment loans for returned servicemen who are on the land. That is the £1,000 loan proposition. That is entirely a Commonwealth scheme and the State governments are not called upon to bear any of that expenditure. I express my gratitude to the State governments for making available to me facilities such as the Rural Bank of New South Wales and the Soldier Settlement Commission in Victoria for the purpose of organizing in connexion with the scheme, doing the necessary inspections of the properties and generally assisting the Commonwealth in allocating the money. Administrative expenses of that kind are borne by the Commonwealth, but I express my thanks to the State governments for having made those facilities available to us. Soldier settlers and in fact all ex-servicemen of World War II. have been given very generous treatment by this Government and there it not any section of the community which does not recognize that to be so. </para>

                        <para>.-I direct attention to a matter affecting a former naval officer in the hope that  the  Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riordan)</inline> will ensure that justice shall be done  to  him. I did not consider that this matter should be raised when the Estimates for the Department of the Navy were under consideration, even if I had been given an opportunity to speak on that occasion. I propose to relate the experience of a former Lieutenant-Commander in  the  Royal Australian Navy who was courtmartialled on five charges, found not guilty on the two most serious ones and reprimanded on the other three. As  the  result of that reprimand he has forfeited the whole of his deferred pay amounting to some hundreds of pounds. Although the naval regulations provide for forfeiture in such circumstances, the punishment in this instance does not fit  the  crime. That is an unwritten law which is older than all the naval regulations and the regulations that have been promulgated under the defence Act. I shall cite the details of the case. This man is the son of a retired bank manager and is himself a senior bank officer. Every member of his family, including himself, had an excellent war record. He volunteered and served in the Royal Australian Navy on the lower deck, was promoted  to  sub-lieutenant in fourteen months,  to  lieutenant three months later, and to acting lieutenant-commander after a further four years. Whilst serving as an officer he carried out naval secretarial duties ashore and afloat in <inline font-style="italic">Arunta, Shropshire</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Bataan.</inline> He joined <inline font-style="italic">Bataan</inline> in April, 1946, as secretary to the commanding officer, who was in charge in the Tenth Destroyer Flotilla. His duties were of a secretarial nature and were concerned with the flotilla of six destroyers. He was officer in charge of public moneys on <inline font-style="italic">Bataan,</inline> but he had nothing whatever to do with victualling. I shall describe what happened. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>In December, 1946, Bataan, paid an official visit to Shanghai for four days. Upon arrival he drew local currency from the Australian legation. Prior to sailing twelve days later, he returned the balance of unexpended Chinese currency. At this eleventh-hour visit to the legation on the day of sailing, he was confronted with three accounts for victualling stores presumed to have been purchased from Chinese  providors  during the stay of the vessel in Shanghai. He was requested to sign them, because of the short time that would elapse before <inline font-style="italic">Bataan</inline> sailed. The supply petty officer in charge of victualling claimed that it would not be possible for him to return on board in order to obtain the signature of the requisite authority. He hae written to me as follows : - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>These facts are hazy to me now and it is possible I signed the three documents in the ship immediately before being asked to bring the documents ashore to the legation office, such fact of my visit being known to the supply petty officer. The difference in times of signing would be only half or one hour. The supply  petty officer was a recommended and trusted rating and my banking experience would make me believe the word of a senior rating. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">Eventually the legation copies of the victualling accounts were received in the Department of the Navy, and they disagreed with the amount of provisions that were actually taken on charge in the ship's account. Earlier, the ship's account was " missing " and when the supply petty officer was asked to make out a duplicate copy, the account which he handed in was the " missing " original. I understand that the supply petty officer was prosecuted on other charges at a court of inquiry, and it became evident to the former commander whose case I am voicing that a circumstantial case had been woven around him. The senior rating was later discharged from the service and deprived of his good conduct badges. The officer claims that he was the unfortunate victim of circumstances. I do not know the facts of the matter other than as they have been given to me, but I am informed that the cost of the trial of the officer amounted to approximately <inline font-style="italic">£10,000.</inline> I think that this officer, having spent many years of his life in the service, should have received more sympathetic consideration from the Department of the Navy. I am not one of those who believe in breaking down discipline, and I agree that a man who commits a crime must take his punishment. However, the punishment should always fit the crime. The officer has written as follows : - </para>

                        <para>After the Sydney Board of Inquiry in July, my previously approved demobilization was deferred. I was kept inactive in Sydney until the end of August and then allowed to proceed home to Melbourne. In mid September I was flown to Japan to rejoin <inline font-style="italic">Bataan.</inline> One  of  the two officers referred to above was trained to Melbourne from Cairns and accompanied me to Japan. From here <inline font-style="italic">Bataan</inline> sailed to Shanghai where a second Board of Inquiry was held in a British cruiser which had come up from Hong Kong. The Chinese  providors  were witnesses. </para>
                        <para>From Shanghai, <inline font-style="italic">Bataan</inline> spent fourteen days in Hong Kong before returning to Japan. In mid November I was informed I was to be  court-martialled  and so <inline font-style="italic">Bataan</inline> returned to Shanghai and <inline font-style="italic">Australia</inline> arrived from Hong Kong. I was charged on two alternate charges of defrauding the Commonwealth Government and three charges of signing documents when I had no authority to do so. I was found not guilty of the two serious charges and as my signature was on the accounts my solicitor instructed me to admit the other three charges. </para>

                    <para class="block">The other three charges were laid under the all-embracing provision of " conduct to the prejudice of naval discipline ", which is a kind of drag-net section that is employed when charges under other sections fail. I do not question the fairness of the trial, but I know that the officer incurred considerable expense in defending himself. The letter continues - </para>

                        <para>For several months at the end of 1!)47 <inline font-style="italic">Bataan</inline> was almost entirely engaged in this case, going or coming from Shanghai. She was sent thence, ostensibly on a courtesy visit, a request being sent to the Australian Minister in Nanking on both occasions for the visits to be approved by the Chinese Government. The following further expenses were incur.red to bring me to trial: - (1) An officer travelled by train from Cairns to Melbourne and thence was flown to Japan. (2) I was flown to Japan. (3) A shorthand writer and another officer were flown from Sydney to Japan to assist at the court-martial. </para>

The foregoing expenses amount to almost £10,000 yet a request by me to have a retired naval officer flown from Sydney to Japan to assist me was turned down unless I held myself responsible for his fare. Arriving in Shanghai 3fl hours before ray trial I had to go ashore in a city of almost 7,000,000 people and find a solicitor. There were four British solicitors in the city and I eventually obtained an U.N.R.R.A. man. After my trial he charged me £150.

                        should not he necessary for me to place any additional facts before the Minister for the Navy. As I have stated, I do not know this man personally, other than through this case. After five years' service in the Royal Australian Navy he attained the rank of acting Lieutenant Commander. As an accountant he signed certain documents and he realizes that he must accept the responsibility for the sins of another. Bie signed documents that had been placed before him without being able to check them. As the result of the findings of the court martial, he has forfeited between £500 and £600 in deferred pay. That penalty is too harsh. This could not happen in the Army or in the Air Force. The deferred pay of a soldier or an airman would not be touched. It is contended, I know, that deferred naval pay is good conduct pay, but I am sure that no member of this Parliament would agree that a man who suffers a reprimand in any of the armed services should lose payments that have accumulated during many years of service. As I have said, I  have  already taken this matter up with the Minister. I know that he is merely a cipher. He is the servant of the Naval Board. He sends matters such as this to the Naval Board, and the board provides the answers. But this is a special case. The serious charges were not proved. T am diffident about mentioning the matter at all because I rather lean the other way, and believe that a man must take what is coming to him. I have sat on many courts-martial in the Army and in the Air Force, but I believe that human considerations must be taken into account. I repeat that the punishment must fit the crime. That principle is older than any military, air force, or naval law. I remind the Minister that there was a celebrated case in England in which a midshipman, Archer Shee, was accused of a dishonest act while attending a naval college. He was expelled from the Navy.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline>
                        Carson, later Lord Carson, took up his case years afterwards. The incident was dramatized in a recent very fine British film called
                        <inline font-style="italic">The Winslow Boy.</inline>
                        The film showed how that boy was disgraced, but, through the persistency of his father and other relatives and with the. able advocacy of
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline>
                        Carson, he was finally cleared, although he never returned to the Navy. The demand made by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline>
                        Carson in that case was " Let right be done ". It took a hide-bound Admiralty a long time to recognize the claim, but finally right was done. I ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scully)</inline>
                        to take this matter up with the Minister for the Navy, who is absent from the chamber at present. I am not pleading for theman. Probably I do not know him any  better than any other honorable members do, but he has come to me with his case, and I feel that the punishment imposed upon him was harsh. The matter should be reviewed to ensure that right is done.

The ruling was made (after the Crown Law authorities had proceeded against the two men concerned on a charge, to the effect that on or about the 1st May, 1949, they had stolen the vessel), for the reason that the vessel had originally been delivered to the accused by Mr. Rivers under an agreement dated the 4th August, 1948, in which the latter leased his vessel to those men for a period expiring on the 30th April, 1949. The magistrate ruled that there was insufficient evidence before him to establish larceny and adjourned the case <inline font-style="italic">sine die.</inline> The vessel was not returned to the lessor on the date agreed upon and it was later located at Soumalaki in the Tanimbar Islands from whence it was towed to Ambon.

As one of the accused had constantly maintained to the Netherlands authorities that he had bought the vessel from Mr. Rivers in August, 1948, it was considered by the Crown Law authorities that no useful purpose -would be served by making the visit. The Dutch authorities have been informed that the Australian Government no longer desires to send police representatives to Batavia (where it is understood the accused now are). It is regretted that owing to international and legal difficulties the proceedings for the extradition of the accused cannot be advanced any further. </para>

                <para>Full information concerning the reasons why it is necessary to continue to limit imports of petrol was given in the Prime Minister's statement made by leave in the House on the 25th May, 1949, and in the documents furnished to the Premiers for their conference on the 17th June, 1949, which were tabled in the House on the 21st June. In the Prime Minister's statement and these documents it was ex plained that the operations of British-controlled companies are largely carried on in countries outside the sterling area, where some 85 per cent. of their total output is produced. The quantity of petrol sold by oil companies in the United Kingdom for export to other countries is negligible. According to the United Kingdom trade and navigation accounts this amounted to only 5,692,000 gallons during 1948. In fact the United Kingdom is a substantial importer of petrol and other petroleum products and, like Australia, draws her supplies of these products from both British and American controlled companies. The nature and extent of the dollar cost of oil to the sterling area was also explained in the foregoing documents. At present the total net dollar cost is running at an annual rate well over 400,000,000 dollars. As well as purchases from American companies this figure includes the cost of dollar freight and tankerage, and dollar expenses of British controlled companies operating outside the sterling area. The net figure takes into account the dollar income of British controlled companies. Rationing is in force in the United Kingdom, India and New Zealand. According to press reports the South African Government has announced that petrol rationing will be introduced shortly. </para>

                            <para>The press statement to which the honorable member refers is based on a misunderstanding of the conditions under which Maltese settlers were brought to Australia. The standards of skill within the trades associated with building in Australia have always been jealously guarded, not only in the interests of the workers themselves, but also in the interests of the public generally. Since other countriesuse differenttechniques in building and work largely in different materials, it follows that a skilled tradesman from another country does not necessarily immediately measure up to Australian standards of skill. It is realized, therefore, that it is unlikely to be possible to carry out trade teste abroad which will be acceptable to all unions and employers in Australia. Nevertheless, it is still necessaryto guard againstmen with no skill or experience posing as tradesmen in order to be granted passages to this country, and the Maltese Government, in consultation with the Commonwealth Government, instituted a system of trade testing of men who have applied for emigration from Malta as tradesmen. The trade tests are conducted by the Maltese trade training authority and, while they do not permit absolute definition of skill by Australian standards, they doserve as a guide to the skill of applicants. All the Maltese settlers employed at Woomera who were formerly employed us tradesmen in Malta were warned prior to embarkation for Australia, that irrespective of their previous experience, their recognition as tradesmen here would depend upon their ability to establish the requisite degree of skill under Australian conditions. After their arrival at Woomera the men were given several months to settle down and were then trade tested by a board consisting of a senior works supervisor of the Department of Works and Housing, a union representative, and a leading hand carpenter. Only a proportion of the men so tested were successful in satisfying the board that their skill was up to Australian standards. Those who did not pass the test areemployed as unskilled workers on the job, and were not advised to seek employment elsewhere. In view of these circumstances, I do not feel that any further investigation is necessary, for the situation in regard to employment of the Maltese settlers at Woomera is similar to that in Canberra and elsewhere, and is well known not only to me and my officers but also to the Maltese Government.I may say that while the difficulties of this situation have been known for some time, I have not been complacent concerning them, and as a result of a suggestion made by me, through my representative in Malta in May of this year,a technical expert from Malta isat presentonhis way toAustralia to survey standards of Australian trade training in each State with a view to ensuring that future arrivals from Malta do measure up to  out  standards of skill. </para>

                        <para>On the 22nd September, the honorable member for Griffith (Mr. Conelan) asked me questions concerning the position of importers who obtained licences for the importation of goods from dollar areas before devaluation occurred. In reply I desire to inform him that importers would not be required to pay for the goods at the higher rate if the relative dollar funds were purchased in full (spot or forward) prior to the 19th September; otherwise payment at the higher rate would have to be made. Any importer in doubt on this question should consult his 'banker. Where holders of import licences issued before the 19th September had not completed purchase of dollars against their licences and now have to purchase them at the new rate of exchange, an adjustment of the Australian currency values shown on their licences will be necessary. As announced by the Minister for Trade and Customs on the 23rd September, this adjustment will he made. by issuing supplementary licences, where required, to allow the importation of the same quantity of goods as would have been imported prior to devaluation. Importers when applying for supplementary licences should support their applications with certificates from their bankers indicating that no exchange has been purchased against the original licence, or, in the case of licences requiring partial adjustment, the actual amount of exchange which had already been purchased against each licence. </para>
