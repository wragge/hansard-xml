            <para>- In the absence of the Minister for Defence, I ask the Minister for External Affairs a question which relates to reports that have appeared in several daily newspapers recently. On Tuesday, the 4th October, the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> discussed - the need for reaching an atomic peace with the Soviet, or joining in the most expensive and perilous armaments race in history (a race in which Australia, along with other democracies, would be an enforced runner). </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>A few days previous to that report both the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> and the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> drew attention to the making of atom bombs by Great Britain and stated that those bombs would probably be tested in Australia. Will the Minister say whether there is any truth in those reports? Are atom bombs likely to be tested in Australia? I remind the Minister of the assurance given in this House by the Minister for Defence on the 22nd November, 1946 when he said - </para>

            <para>-I shall deal with the  last of the honorable member&#39;s questions first. I confirm the answer  that  was given on an earlier occasion by the Minister for Defence. The guided missiles project is quite distinct from any project involving the use of the atom bomb, and therefore, the previous answer still stands. The most important of the honorable member&#39;s questions relates to the general attitude to be adopted in relation to what the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> report referred to as &#34; atomic peace &#34;. The position of Australia has remained unchanged since 1946, when the Atomic Energy Commission commenced its work. It is an essential condition of atomic energy control, in relation to armaments, that there should be international inspection and control. If there were no international inspection and control, there would be no certainty that one nation would not make preparations to employ atomic weapons of great power and magnitude, without being observed by other nations. That is the view to which the Australian Government has consistently adhered. The honorable member referred to two articles, one of which appeared in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> and the other in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald.</inline> Both articles are in accordance with the policy of Australia in relation to atomic energy in that Australia considers there should be further exploration of the possibility of reaching an agreement between the nations, not merely to avoid the use of atomic weapons in war because of their dreadful consequences to humankind, but also to avoid war altogether, if possible, in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations. Those are the principles which we have followed in common with most of the countries concerned, particularly the United States of America and the United Kingdom, and to those principles we adhere.We shall take our part in any such endeavour. </para>

Representations have been made to me that Australian troops in Japan, which,I understand, is now a dollar area, are at a great disadvantage as the result of loss of purchasing power due to the devaluation of sterling.

          </talk.start>
          <para>Mr.CHIFLEY.- I am not able to give the honorable member any conclusive evidence of the discovery of oil in Australia or in New Guinea. Very extensive exploration has been carried out in the search for oil. The Government has made available an allocation of dollars to companies that are interested in this work which have spent a great deal of money in Papua and New Guinea. Extensive exploratory work has also been undertaken in Queensland and in other areas in north Australia. I am not able to say that there is any clear evidence of the possible existence of gushers in any of those areas. The most I can say is that those interested have strong hopes of such a discovery being made. </para>

            <para>- As the Minister for the Army is aware, the northern rivers districts of New South Wales are periodically swept by devastating floods. For example, in two years out of four, the Richmond River has had a tremendous deluge. I have received a letter from the Mayor of Lismore in which he has asked me to make representations to the honorable gentleman that army ducks be stationed at Lismore as army personnel are at present located in that area, so that they may be used not only in the Lismore area, but also in the areas drained by the adjoining rivers which are subject to similar flooding. Will the Minister consider this request ? </para>

            <para>- Undoubtedly army ducks did a great deal of valuable  work, not only during .the recent floods, but also in earlier floods. I understand that as the result of their use the lives of approximately 6,000 persons were saved. The unfortunate occurrence of the floods also gave the army personnel an opportunity to carry out valuable training exercises. These vehicles must be kept in the rivers adjacent to the training depots and it is necessary to have specially trained personnel to control them. I shall have the proposal examined because it has been proved very definitely that army ducks can play a very important part in the saving of the lives of flood victims. If army ducks can be assigned to areas where dangerous flooding occurs, I shall ascertain whether some of the craft can be sent to the districts to which the honorable member has referred. </para>

            <para>- I desire to make it clear at once that it wa3 not intended that the finance ministers of the British Commonwealth, who met in London, should discuss devaluation. The mere suggestion of a general discussion on devaluation at that time would have been the height of folly, because the slightest leakage of such news could have enabled speculators to make great fortunes. The resolutions which were carried by the finance ministers after the discussions in London related to an endeavour to bridge the dollar gap. There was a general agreement that the delegates at that conference should recommend to their respective governments a 25 per cent, reduction of imports from the dollar area. That is the only effective and practical way of reducing dollar expenditure. Devaluation was not discussed.. No secret meetings were held about devaluation when I was in London, or when the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction subsequently attended the London conference. The subject was not even discussed informally. The conference of finance ministers did not give to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Stafford</inline> Cripps a brief in respect of matters that he might discuss at the Washington conference. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Stafford</inline> Cripps, when he attended that conference, discussed the general position as it affected the sterling area, and particularly the United Kingdom. If he had a brief, he took it from the Government to the United, Kingdom. On the subject of devaluation, every country made its own decision. The Dominions could have appreciated their currency in relation to sterling if they had wished to do so. They acted on their own volition. </para>

            <para>- During the last sessional period, the Minister for External Affairs was good enough to make a statement, in answer to a question, in which he set forth the extensive restrictions placed on the movement of Australian diplomatic representatives in the Soviet Union. Very few districts could be visited, and even then permits were required. Have representations ever been made to the Soviet Government that it should accord to our diplomatic representatives the same freedom of movement as we accord to their  represtntatives  in Australia ? </para>

            <para>- I shall discuss with my colleague, the Minister for the Interior, and the Minister for Education in New South Wales a suitable commemoration by school children of the great occasion. The Government has sent about 1,000 invitations to distinguished people, not only in New South Wales, but throughout Australia, to attend the official ceremony that will take place at Adaminaby on the 17th October. We believe that representatives of all State governments will attend the function. At the same time, the Government extends a general invitation to all people who desire to be present. Every one who attends the ceremony, whether he be an officially invited citizen or an interested hut not officially invited citizen, will receive the same consideration and privileges. Every one who attends the ceremony will meet at Adaminaby on a common level. </para>

Their view of &#39; the matter was forwarded to the Government of New South Wales. The only authorities that can launch a prosecution are the Crown Law authorities of New South Wales, because the alleged offence is one against the law of New South Wales.

We have intimated to the State Crown Law authorities that if a prosecution is launched the services of the counsel who assisted the royal commissioner will be available to them.

            <para>- I saw the statements referred to, which appeared on page 9 of the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> under a threecolumn headline in the earlier editions, and under a single column headline in the later editions. Apparently the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> realized, after the early editions had appeared, that it was giving prominence to a statement that was not based on sound foundations. Whether the statement originated in the office of the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> or in the office of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited is a matter for conjecture; but, wherever it originated, it is entirely misleading and is, in fact, a complete misrepresentation of the facts. The take-off limitations for different types of aircraft in adverse weather conditions are determined by the number of power units applicable to the aircraft and the performance of the aircraft assuming that an engine failure occurred immediately after take-off. Certain specified .minima arn set out for each airport. With most airports, it is a ceiling of 800 feet and a horizontal visibility of 2 miles for both take-off and landing. However, DC4, Constellation, DC6 and Lancastrian aircraft, which can fly on three engines, are permitted to take off under worse conditions than those specified for landing because they can fly safely to another airport. The performance of a Convair with one engine inoperative is infinitely superior to that of a D03, and in fact is almost equal to that of a DC4. The Convair type of aircraft has, therefore, been included with the four-engined aircraft for the purpose of this concession, with the proviso that a suitable alternative airfield is available. The Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald&#39;s</inline> report is merely another instance of misrepresentation in respect of Convair aircraft on its part. </para>

              <para>- I have seen statements in the press which referred to proposed air services to Sale and Bairnsdale in Gippsland, and I also know that a number of applications were made following inquiries by the interdepartmental committee some time ago, and also that many applicants were not prepared to go on with their applications even if they were permitted to start services. As far as intra-state air services are concerned the attitude of Victorian governments has been that they are not prepared to grant, permission for services to operate between air stations that are in close proximity to railway services. That attitude ha9 so far not been modified officially, but recently the Victorian Minister for Transport, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kent</inline> Hughes^ has made some representa tions to the Department of Civil Aviation about air services in the Gippsland district. The matter is being examined and I have offered to meet <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kent</inline> Hughes for the purpose of discussing it if he could come to Canberra or, if it is not possible for him to come to Canberra, I have offered to meet him at the earliest opportunity in Melbourne. T have not heard anything previously in connexion with a proposed airfield in the vicinity of Morwell and Traralgon, and so far as I know no definite approaches have been made to the department. However, I shall investigate the matter and let the honorable member have a reply later. </para>

Did he also say that the Government (lid not at present know its constitutional powers because it had not received the reasons . for the judgment of the Privy Council in relation to the <inline font-style="italic">Banking</inline> case. Is it also a fact that when the judgment of the Privy Council is received and has been considered by the Government, and it is thought that the Constitution makes certain steps possible, the Government intends to continue with its effort to nationalize the trading banks? </para>

            <para>- It is true that I addressed the federal executive of the Australian Labour party yesterday and that I referred to the subject of banking. My recollection is that I expressed the view that it had always been the belief of the Labour party that the business of banking was such a great public utility, and had such a great effect upon the lives of the people, that it ought to be controlled by the people. I added to that, of course, that under the decisions of the High Court of Australia and the Privy Council - although the reasons for the decision of the Privy Council had not been received - that could not be done. I also stated that the Government would not be party to any unconstitutional action. I added that one of the claims of the Opposition and the banking institution was that competition in banking was highly desirable and that there would be no lack of competition if banking could not be nationalized. </para>

            <para>- I direct a question to the Minister for Repatriation relating to the pensions paid under the New Guinea civilian war pensions scheme to widows of civilians who were killed in New Guinea during the war. I point out that we were told by both the Minister for Repatriation and the Minister for External Territories that the same conditions would apply to such widows as apply to other war widows. Is it a fact that the conditions are not equivalent and that medical benefits, furniture grants, post-war training and war service homes are denied to these civil widows? Why has this anomaly been allowed to exist for so long when representations for its rectification have so frequently been made in this House and in the Senate? Does the Minister intend to confer with the Minister for External Territories to have this injustice righted soon, so that these worthy people will not continue to suffer? If not, why not? </para>

            <para>- The subject of broadcasting was not listed for discussion by Cabinet this morning, and accordingly, it was not considered. Last week, and again this week, by way of question, the honorable member for Reid asked me what decision had been made by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board in relation to the matters referred to it by the Postmaster-General. If my reply has not yet reached the honorable member, it should  reach him this afternoon. It embodies a statement which was forwarded to the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department and to me by the board setting out its decision on the matter. Without dealing with the subject at any great length I can say that sections 4, 5 and <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> of the original order have been withdrawn. The only matters now determined by the order are first, that there should be no discrimination in the charges made to any political party; and secondly, that all broadcasting stations shall submit a return to the board indicating what applications have been made to them for time and what treatment has been accorded to such applications so that the board may be in a position to make a full report to the Government and the Parliament on the matter. In reply to the last of the honorable member&#39;s questions which relates to broadcasts made by me and by the honorable member for Eden-Monaro, that matter has nothing to do with the order or with the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. Such broadcasts have been made by me and by the honorable member for Eden-Monaro for twelve months or more. The broadcasts made by me do not relate to political matters. That is equally true, no doubt, of the broadcasts made by the honorable member for Eden-Monaro. The one or two of his broadcasts that I have heard did not seem to me to be extremely political. </para>

I  offered to submit, not only to the local broadcasting station, but also to any authority named by the Macquarie network, including the managing director of that concern, copies of the script of all the broadcasts so that it could be ascertained whether they were or were not of a political character. At no time have I had any complaints that any of my broadcast reports to the nation have been other than factual statements. </para>

MrAllen has gone abroad under arrangement with British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines Limited.  His  visit will not involve us in any dollar expenditure whatsoever. He has taken with him some very excellent films which he will place in the commercial field in America. He is a very efficient officer and he will he able to talk to the Americans in their own language. I am sure that Australia will benefit greatly in dollars from his visit.

            <para>- The failure of the Government to make good its promises to the dairying industry is the reason why I have submitted this motion. The promise of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley )to implement the findings of the Joint Dairy Industry Advisory Committee which recommended the payment of an additional 3d. per lb. of butter from the 1st July last, has not yet been fulfilled. No other industry in Australia has had the same niggardly treatment. During the war years, the price of the dairyman&#39;s product was pegged by this Government. The dairy farmer was denied the equivalent of the world market price, and government instrumentalities kept the Australian price below the cost of production. In consequence of that treatment, production declined so rapidly that the Government was obliged to ration butter, and we could neither fulfil the requirements of our own people, nor meet the needs of Great Britain. During the war years, the output of butter declined by more than 40,000 tons annually compared with the production before the war, and the situation is very little better today. Production last year was 160,000 tons compared with 200,000 tons in 1939. Because of the</inline> dimunition  of supplies, the Government was finally compelled to act. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>A committee was appointed to examine the costs of production in the dairying industry, and to recommend a price which the farmers should receive. The committee diligently set about its task, and I  commend it for its work, even though I do not accept all its conclusions. However, it pioneered much new ground and laid foundations for future determinations. Of course, the committee was handicapped by the knowledge that it would submit its report to a government which would not grant an increase of the price of butter in excess of a few pence a pound. That was a supposition which subsequently proved to be correct. I shall mention the method by which the committee worked in order to show the exactitude upon which its findings were based. Eighteen teams of experts searchingly probed .the costs of production of 1,000 dairy farms throughout the Commonwealth. One member of each team represented the Commonwealth, and the other the producers. To eliminate any possibility of bias as the result of experience of a single season, the investigators selected a five-year period. Side-line crops were excluded and factory returns were examined in order to test the farmers&#39; own figures. Of the 1,000 farms that had originally been selected, 300 were excluded because their costs of production were either too high or too low compared with the average. By treating the remaining 692 farms as a composite farm and averaging the figures, the committee reached the conelusions that the average dairy farm was a 50-cow concern producing 9,7S1 lb. of butter from that number of cows, and that the average production was 196 lb. of butter per cow per annum. As the average production per cow per annum in New South Wales, according to the State Statistician, is only 14S lb. of butter per cow per annum, honorable members will realize that the committee worked on extremely high costs, and, therefore, its conclusions must have resulted in a price that was lower than it should have been. </para>
        <para>However, the committee after its exhaustive investigations, recommended that the price of butter should be 2s. 1-Jd. per lb. In arriving at that figure, the committee assessed the value of a dairyfarmer&#39;s labour at &#163;6 18s. a week. That amount was later advanced to &#163;7 7s. a week. Even so, that figure is less than the wage that is paid to a junior porter employed by the Victorian railways. In recent advertisements, the wage for junior porters in that service is shown as &#163;7 10s. a week. The value of a dairyfarmer&#39;s labour was also calculated on the basis of a 56-hour week at 2s. 7d. an hour. Overtime is calculated at the same rate. The dairy-farmer is not allowed time and a half or double time when he works on his farm. I contrast the dairyfarmer&#39;s rates of payment and working conditions with those of a wharf labourer whose rate of remuneration when he works between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. i9 5s. 2d. an hour for a 40-hour week. If he works after 5 p.m. he is paid at the rate of 7s. 6d. an hour. If he works on Saturdays, Sundays or holidays, the rate is 12s. 6d. an hour. If no work is offering, or the weather is wet, he receives 12s. a day as appearance money, and he stays at home. If the cargo on which he is engaged is smelly or sticky to handle, an extra rate is provided. For handling a cargo of sugar, the wharf labourer receives an extra 3d. an hour. The dairy-farmer has many unpleasant tasks in his occupation, but he receives the flat rate of 2s. 7d. an hour, and is not paid overtime when he works on Saturdays, Sundays or holidays. </para>
        <para>Despite the thoroughness of the committee&#39;s investigations .and the meagre rewards upon which its findings were ultimately based, the Chifley Government refused to accept the recommended price of 2s. lid. per lb., and reduced it to 2s. per lb. I remind honorable members that, at that time, the Australian Government was demanding and receiving from the United Kingdom Government a price of 2s. 3i&#39;d. per lb. for all butter f.o.b. Australia. One of the reasons that was given for refusing the farmer his just reward of 2s.  1 1/2 d.  per lb. was that interest calculated at 4&#163; per cent, on his equity was too great and should not be higher than 3f per cent. Another reason was that the five years, which the committee had selected as an average period, were all bad seasons and that it could be expected that the following five years would be favorable. I suggest that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Inigo</inline> Tones and Mother Shipton have grounds for an action for trespass against the Government for engaging in long-distance forecasting. The reduction of the price that the committee had recommended by l$d. per lb. deprived dairy-farmers as a whole of an amount of &#163;2,200,000. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard),</inline> to quieten his conscience in this matter, gave back &#163;250,000 for expenditure on what he claimed was research to improve the efficiency of the dairying industry. However, most dairymen have a knowledge of the steps that are necessary to improve their industry. All that they require is the financial means to enable them to give practical effect to their knowledge. The farmer&#39;s problem i9 to find the money with which to do the job. It takes money to fertilize, to lime, to subdivide, to fence, to buy barbed-wire, to improve pastures, and to get better cows. Such things cannot be done on the deadline wage of &#163;6 15s. a week, or 3&#163; per cent, on capital. The policy of the Chifley Government is to deny the dairy-farmer a price for his produce that would enable him to help himself. The Government will spend &#163;250,000 a year to employ publicity officers to tell the farmers what to do, and then deny them the means to do it. </para>
        <para>We now come to the most recent history of the industry. Two years ago, in October, 1947, the Prime Minister announced publicly that the producers would be guaranteed a price for their butter for five years, varying up or down in accordance with cost factors, as determined by the Joint Dairy Industry Advisory Committee, and that the price would operate from the 1st July each year. The committee made its recommendation months ago, and awarded an increase of 3d. per lb. The 1st July has long since passed, but the dairyfarmers are still waiting for the higher price. </para>
        <para>Many farmers have very low incomes during the winter months, and often thecream cheque is scarcely enough to pay the rent. Yet the Prime Minister hasnot yet honoured his promise. The committee is the dairy-farmers&#39; arbitration court, and its findings are his basic wage.. One can imagine the outcry there would be if the basic wage itself were denied tothose entitled to it for one-tenth of thetime the dairy-farmers have been denied the increased price awarded to them.. Apparently, there is one rule for thefarmer, and another for those favoured, by the Government. </para>
        <para>The Commonwealth blames the Stateprices authorities, but that is merely an. attempt to draw a red herring across the trail. There is nothing to prevent theCommonwealth from granting a subsidy on butter as it still does on tea. In my opinion, a subsidy rather than a priceincrease is best for both producer and consumer. It enables the &#39;consumer tobuy at a lower price, and to get back something from the taxes he pays, whilethe producer has the advantage of a widermarket because the price is lower. If the Commonwealth and the States do not wish to grant a price that will cover production costs, there is a simple remedy.. The British Government will pay 2s. 9d. per lb. f.o.b. for all butter purchased&#39; under contract. That, however, is besidethe point. The Australian housewife isentitled to butter. It is the Government&#39;s duty to see that she can get it at a pricewhich is fair both to the producers and consumers. At the present time, theAustralian butter producer is amongst the world&#39;s lowest paid workers. He hasbeen denied the advantage of postwarprosperity, in contrast with the treatment received by the farmers of Canada, theUnited States of America, Denmark, and Great Britain itself. The British farmer is paid for his milk at a rateequivalent to approximately 5s. per lb. for butter. Very little butter is made in Britain, practically the whole output of the dairying industry beingconsumed in the form of liquid milk.&#34; The Government of the United Kingdom has wisely safeguarded its agricultural industry. It recognizes that the health and well-being of its people depend upon giving a fair deal to the farmers. The day  is coming when Australian governments will have to act and think in the same way if they are to ensure the provision of adequate supplies of food for our people. </para>
        <para>We are accustomed to regard ourselves as a mighty primary producing country. The fact is, however, that apart from wheat and wool, Australia is a negligible factor in the total production of food, although nature intended it to be a great factor. There are fewer dairy cows in milk in Australia than in the United Kingdom. In 1948, there were in Australia 2,267,000 dairy cows, whereas in the United Kingdom there were 2,278,000. Total milk production for all purposes is less in Australia than in Britain. In 1947, the dairies of the United Kingdom produced 1,452,000,000 gallons of milk, or almost 300,000,000 gallons more than the dairies of Australia. The British Government is stimulating agriculture by incentives of many kinds. For milk, it pays the equivalent of 5s. per lb. for butter, arid it pays subsidies to the farmers for every acre of fodder sown. It pays a bonus of &#163;4 for every dairy heifer calf raised to the age of twelve months. As a consequence, the number of dairy heifer calves under twelve months of age in Great Britain was 1,457,000 in 1948. In Australia, in the same year, the number was 727,000. Thus, the United Kingdom produced in 1948 twice as many yearling dairy heifer calves as the whole of Australia. Stock needed to replace our dairy herds in Australia is being sold daily as veal to sausage makers, because the policy of the Government makes it unprofitable to rear the calves. The Minister speaks of stabilization, but offers stabilization only when the world market offers lucrative returns over a long period. The latest London report on the subject estimates that, for so far ahead as 1951, the world SUpply of fats, including butter, will be almost 1,000,000 tons short of the world&#39;s requirements. </para>
        <para>Almost every country in the world, except Australia, is encouraging dairy production in the same way as Britain is encouraging it. In America and Canada, satisfactory prices are assured. In Denmark, the contract price is equivalent to 3s. per lb. for butter, and production is rapidly approaching the pre war level. In Holland, production has progressed to the stage that butter rationing was abolished on the 1st July. But in Australia, under a Labour Government, butter rationing is still in force. Australia is one of the few countries in the world to retain butter rationing, and we cannot properly supply the needs of our own people, let alone supply as much to Britain as we should do. </para>
        <para>The return to the dairy farmer is insufficient to enable him to pay reasonable wages in order to keep his children on the farm. An investigation into the ages of those who persevere in the industry would show that they are mostly men and women of 45 years of age or more. The young people are taking better-paid jobs in the towns and cities. The price paid for dairy produce does not enable farmers to compete with the wages paid to bread carters, railway porters, &#38;c. Even the increased price now under discussion does not constitute an incentive price, but it would be a step in the right direction if the dairy-farmers could get it. There should be no further delay. The increased price of 3d. per lb., made retrospective from the 1st July, should be included in the next factory cheque paid to Australian dairy-farmers. </para>

The honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony)</inline> has spoken very loudly but he was a member of a government that neglected the opportunity of doing some justice to the dairy-farmer. In those days not one dairy-farmer in one hundred had an income sufficient to require him to pay income tax. The authority for that statement is the honorable member for Richmond himself. Speaking in the House of Representatives on the 26th May, 1938, when an administration that he supported was in office, the honorable member said - </para>

        <para class="block">Instead of abusing this Government for its treatment of the dairy-farmers, the honorable gentleman should be abusing members of his own party for their disgraceful treatment of the dairy-farmers in those years when they had to be content with 8d., 3d. or lOd. per lb. for butter. When all the dairy-farmers in Australia asked the Menzies Government, which was supported by the Australian Country party, for an increase, the Menzies Government shelved the matter and took no action of any kind. Yet, not one member of the Australian Country party in the Parliament dared to say one word about that Government&#39;s disgraceful treatment of the dairy-farmers. No one will deny that to-day the dairy-farmer is being deprived of <inline font-style="italic">2i</inline> per lb. for butter which has been shown to be necessary to bring his return up to the cost of production. No accurate historian will deny the reasons. To realize the reasons one has only to go back to the referendum at which the future of the control of prices in Australia was decided, and read the advertisements published by the Liberal party and the Australian Country party in which they urged the dairy-farmers to vote against the continuance of Commonwealth control of prices. The result of the referendum was that the power to provide reasonable prices for dairy products reverted to State governments. Nothing is more shameful in retrospect than the assurance then given to the dairy-farmers by representatives of the Australian Country party and of the Liberal party that they would be better off with the transfer to the State governments of power to control prices. Had the Australian Government not lost the power to control prices, the dairy-farmers would be receiving 2-&#163;d. per lb. more for their butter than they are receiving. They are not receiving that extra payment because the control of prices is in the hands of six separate State governments, three of which are Liberal party governments. There is no possibility of those six governments, three of which represent vested financial interests, reaching a united decision that would give justice to the dairyfarmers. If the honorable member for Richmond were earnest in his desire to assist dairy-farmers, he would not raise his voice against this Government, which is the only one that has ever tried to provide justice for the dairying industry, but he would raise his voice in anger against the betrayal by his colleagues of every promise that they made to the dairy-farmers to induce them to vote against continuance of Commonwealth control of prices. He, of course&#62;has also had his part in that betrayal. He would use his best endeavours to persuade his colleagues in the State governments to give to the dairy-farmers the price that they are entitled to receive. It is true that an assurance was given to the dairying industry, in good faith, by this Government. When it gave that assurance, it possessed control over prices. The assurance was accepted by the industry, equally in good faith. It is true that that undertaking should be honoured. It is equally true that the primary obligation to honour it now rests upon the six State governments. It is also true that because the dairy-farmers are loyal and patient and hard working, and are not men who indulge readily in direct action, they have not received from the- State governments the justice that they are entitled to. I understand that the State governments have not even communicated finally to this Government their refusal to allow the butter producers the additional price that is necessary to cover their cost of production. If the State governments finally conveyed to this Government their refusal to pay a just price to the butter producers, I believe that the obligation would then rest upon this Government to take every step within its power to ensure the honouring of the undertaking given by it and accepted by the dairying industry in good faith. I do not know what method could be adopted to ensure that end in view of the extraordinarily difficult situation created &#39;by the defeat of the referendum as the result of the false propaganda of the Liberal party and the Australian Country party which was designed to induce the dairyfarmers and other Australian electors to vote to end Commonwealth control of prices and transfer the control to the States. I do not know whether, in the event of the State governments refusing to pay to the dairy-farmers a just price, it would be possible for this Government to withhold from money due from it to the State governments a sufficient amount to enable the price of butter to be subsidized until such time as the State governments came to heel and agreed to give justice to the dairying industry. The only answer to the honorable member&#39;s contention that this Government has been niggardly in its treatment of the dairying industry is that it is utterly false. The coalition Liberal party and Australian Country party Government led by the right honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> refused every plea by the industry for an increased price at a time when, on the evidence of the honorable member for Richmond, not one dairy-farmer in 100 earned &#163;250 a year. Such a state of affairs continued over a long period of years. As soon as Labour took office, it was energetically active in ensuring that the dairy-farmer should be justly rewarded for his arduous toil. The relevant figures are on record and are known by every dairy-farmer. Not one dairy-farmer in Eden-Monaro will ever again accept the word of the Australian Country party. </para>

          <para>.- I support the motion made by the honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony)</inline> for the adjournment of the House to discuss the urgently important subject of the dairying industry of Australia and the Government&#39;s failure to honour the promise of. the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> to the dairy-farmers. To listen to the honorable member for EdenMonaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fraser)</inline> one would think that there was no other primary industry besides the dairying industry that had received the benefit of increased prices during the war period. The price of almost all primary commodities rose rapidly in war-time because of the substantial increases in the elements of production costs, such as transport charges, wages and other items. I remind the honorable member that the price of wheat sold in a free market rose to more than &#163;1 a bushel and that the price of wool rose to more than 10Od. per lb. Meat prices also rose considerably. But it was a Labour government which pegged the price of butter and made it. impossible for butter producers to share in the increased prices that were available in. the markets of the world. The honorable member made no reference to that fact. Butter producers are still barred from obtaining the benefit of high overseas prices, which are now about 2s. 9d. a lb. The honorable member is trying to shelter behind the fact that the people refused the Government permanent power to control prices. The Government has been paying a subsidy of about &#163;3,000,000 on &#39;butter production for a very long time and is still paying it, and it is able, if it chooses to pay the increased price that it undertook to pay. It is nonsense and pure bluff to say that the Government cannot honour its promise to the hard-working dairymen. Such statements amount to an attempt to pass, the buck to the States. The Government should pay the butter producers the price that was fixed by the Joint Dairy Industry Advisory Committee. The honorable member for Eden-Monaro is doing a great disservice to the primary producers of his electorate by not fighting for the primary industries. It is most improper for him not to ask the Government to honour the promises that it made, and to leave the primary producers high and dry while the Government wrangles with the State governments. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The Government&#39;s promises regarding the price of butter were made in 1947 when the Prime Minister himself promised that a price would be guaranteed to the producers for five years. That period has not yet elapsed. The price was to be guaranteed according to the cost factors determined by the committee which was composed of economists, officers of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture, and representatives of the producers. That committee has made several recommendations to the Government, but the Government has not acted on its report although it should have done so many months ago. The butter producers should have received an increase of at least 3d. per lb. from the 1st July last. It is now October and the Government is still wrangling about it, although its promises in 1947 regarding butter prices were unqualified. The dairying industry is languishing to-day because it is unable to obtain the materials that it requires to carry on. The Minister laughed just now when I said that the industry was languishing. It is of no use for him to laugh because I assert  that, if this industry were prosperous its production would not be falling off as it is doing at present. Not only is production falling off but the number of dairy stock in Australia is rapidly decreasing. An examination of country newspapers published in the dairy-farming districts would show that whole dairy herds are being disposed of. That is happening because dairy-farmers are finding it impossible to carry on under present circumstances. Yet the Minister laughs. </para>
        <para>I rose primarily to ask that the Government honour its 1947 promises. The Joint Dairy Industry Advisory Committee, as I have stated, recommended an increase of 3d. per lb. in the price of butter, and nothing has been said by the honorable member for Eden-Monaro nor is there anything that the Minister could say, that could justify the Government&#39;s failure to honour its promise. If the Minister can show that the promise was not made, then I should have to regard the matter from another aspect, but I know that he cannot do so. I am familiar with the difficulties of the dairying industry, and I know that those engaged in it work hard and for long hours for 365 days a year, in winter, summer, autumn, and spring, in hail, rain or snow. They are surely entitled to a just return. There is no industry in Australia to-day that has been so roughly treated and received so little consideration as has the dairying industry. I know that prices for dairy products increased during the war, but that increase was not in proportion to the increases that took place in the prices of goods produced by other industries. If the prices for dairy products had not risen during the war the dairying industry would be in a worse position than it is now. The increase of prices during the war was recommended by a committee that was established to investigate conditions in the industry. A similar committee later recommended, as I have said an increase of 3d. per lb. in the price of butter but the Government has deliberately refused to give effect to that recommendation. It is of no use for the honorable member for Eden-Monaro to say that the States should tackle the problem, and that if they do not tackle it then the </para>
        <para class="block">Australia Government ought to do so. I take the view that the Government has an obligation to pay the increased price to the producers as from the 1st July last. There should be no dilly-dallying till the eve of an election when the Government might make some proposition in the hope of influencing country electors. Such an action is unworthy of any government and I trust that the Minister will not be a party to it but will see that the increased price is paid now without any further procrastination. </para>
        <para>The dairying industry has done more to develop closer settlement than has any other industry, and it will continue to do so if it is sustained by fair treatment. I believe that the present fall in production in the industry must be attributed to unsatisfactory prices and the Government&#39;s shilly-shallying, and I trust that we shall have an announcement from the Minister to-day that he intends to honour the Government&#39;s promises forthwith. </para>

            <para>- In his speech the honorable gentleman said that no industry has ever been treated in such a niggardly fashion as has the dairying industry. On the .contrary, every dairy-farmer in Australia knows that never at any time in the history of Australia has the industry been in a more prosperous condition. That doe9 not deny the justification for the assertion of butter producers that they should be given the found cost of production but nevertheless it is true that the industry has never been more prosperous than it is to-day. If honorable members were to refer to the newspapers that are published in the western district of Victoria, which is a very great centre of the dairying industry, they would find that the balance-sheets of the co-operative companies in that district are at an all-time high. I read last week, in the journal of a primary producers&#39;  organzation  in New South Wales, a report that gave the all-time record profits of the various factories in New South Wales that handle dairy products.. The balance-sheets of those factories reflect very accurately the prosperity of the dairying industry, because almost without exception they are co-operative factories. How then, can the charge made by the honorable member for Richmond, that the dairying industry is the most niggardly treated industry in Australia be valid. In this chamber, in 1941, he stood up and told the most harrowing story I have ever heard about primary industries in any country. I advise him to refer- to the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record and refresh his memory about that vivid story of his about farm fences falling down, gates hanging on one hinge, cowsheds falling to pieces, homes deteriorating and women and  chldren  crying at the gates. He painted that heart-rending picture despite the fact that governments of which he had been a member had had the opportunity to assist the primary industries in the long  periid  between 1932 and 1941. How was he able to paint that harrowing picture if the industry at that time was being treated properly ? </para>

        <para>The honorable member also dealt in more inaccuracies. He told us to-day that butter has had to be rationed because of the decline of butter production. He knows that that is untrue. Any decline in butter production has been primarily associated with the fact that the Menzies Government early in the war allowed recruitment of men from the dairying industry. No action was taken to pre vent the drain of dairy farm labour into the military forces. </para>

            <para>- I did not interrupt the honorable gentleman once when he was making his speech, and he should not interrupt me. Any interruption he makes will not put me off. Recruitment of farm labour continued right up to the time that the Labour Government took office. That Government immediately took steps to see that dairy-farmers, their sons, and their employees were placed in the category of employees in reserved occupations. To that extent the rot was stopped, but it was rather too late. Butter rationing was not caused by a decline in production. The honorable gentleman knows that when the government of which he was a member was in office it talked much of what it would do for Britain, and flaunted its patriotism, but that it was not until a Labour Government took office in 1941 that butter rationing was instituted, not to meet the conditions caused by a decline in production, but to give practical application to our belief that we should help our less fortunate fellow citizens in other parts of the world. Although the war has been over three years, and there is always the possibility of a repetition of the disastrous droughts of 1945-46, this Government has continued to ration butter, not to offset the decline in production but to help our less fortunate kinsfolk in the United Kingdom and the people of other European countries. The honorable member&#39;s hypocritical statement that the decline in butter production is responsible for butter rationing was deliberately intended to mislead the people. What are the facts? Notwithstanding the facts that during the war years the dairying industry suffered greatly through enlistments of farm labourers and dairymen in the armed forces and that the disastrous droughts of 1944-45 and 1945-46 decimated our dairy herds, production is now substantially above normal pre-war levels. It is true that there has been a fall in the volume of butter produced, but as I have said over and over again in this House the increased spending power in  the hands of the people, which enables them to purchase greatly increased quantities of whole milk, means that less cream is available for the manufacture of butter. Let us consider how the consumption of whole milk has increased in Sydney and Newcastle. In comparison with pre-war years the consumption of whole milk in those two cities alone has increased by 26,000,000 gallons, or a quantity sufficient to make 6,000 tons of butter. On that figure we could reasonably estimate the increased quantity of whole milk consumed in the other capital cities at 26,000,000 gallons. Thus, throughout the whole of Australia, it would be safe to assume that increased consumption of whole milk would account for the loss of 20,000 tons of butter. It is pertinent to point out that in 1935, which was one of the worst years in the economic history of the Commonwealth, milk production reached its highest peak in our history. What was the cause of that? At that time the unemployment situation was so desperate that the sons of dairyfarmers were compelled to stay on the farms because they could not find work elsewhere. Their parents were in such straitened circumstances that they could not afford to send their children to the cities to be trained as lawyers, engineers, doctors or artisans. They had to stay on the farms. In these days a dairy-farmer is able to make an adequate living from 40 or 50 cows. In those days, in order tr&#62; ward off the demands of the banker or the financier, a dairy-farmer had to milk ten to twenty cows more than he had to milk during periods when prices were normal. It is undeniable that if the remuneration of the dairy-farmer becomes too great it may have a tendency to depress rather than to increase production. I:fi a dairy-farmer can obtain <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> sufficient income by milking 40 cows, why should he milk 50 cows? If the price of milk is fixed too high there is an inherent danger that production will fall, but that fact does not deter the Government from ensuring that the dairy-farmer receives a fair price for his product. </para>

        <para>The honorable member for Richmond expressed a very provocative opinion, which is characteristic of his whole outlook on this matter, when  he  said that there was no inducement to keep children on the farm. Does the honorable member think that every dairy-farmer in this country should be induced to keep his children on the farm ? Many dairymen want their sons and daughters to be doctors, teachers, nurses, or, maybe, politicians. Does the honorable member think that this Government should do something to keep the children of dairymen on the farms? When he himself was assisting the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture the children of our dairy-farmers had no alternative but to stay on the farms. For them, it was a case of stay on the farms or starve. The honorable member also dragged another old herring across the trail when he told the people that we are not bleeding our kinsfolk in the United Kingdom hard enough by charging them only the cost of production of our butter. He contrasted the price paid for Australian butter with the price charged for butter from Denmark and other countries. He has said that, because the Danes, the Canadian? and the people of Ireland have been able to extort from the United Kingdom a few more pence a pound than we have requested this Government should be condemned. He conveniently ignored the fact that our longterm butter contract with the United Kingdom, which will operate until 1955, is much more satisfactory than were those made by the United Kingdom with other supplying countries. He conveniently forgot that in Denmark the cost of meal, cereal grains and other stock feed is substantially higher than it is in Australia, and consequently the cost of production in that country is greater than it is here. He also forgot to mention that deliveries from Denmark can be made in a few hours. What he also neglected to say was that this Government has been able to bring the price paid for Australian dairy products up to the level of the price obtained on the United Kingdom market by the dairy farmers of New Zealand. </para>
        <para>Another rotten inaccuracy was his statement of the purposes for which thu grant of &#163;250.000 to the dairying industry of Australia is being expended. He said that the whole amount would be spent  by publicity officials. He did not tell the people that the grant has been allocated to the State governments and is being expended by them through their Departments of Agriculture to assist and subsidize herd testing, sire testing, pasture improvement and the like. Not one Commonwealth officer will be employed on that work. No publicity officers are employed on it. Again, the honorable member was merely indulging in untrue and false propaganda. I should not have minded his moving this motion had he dealt with his submission on its merits; but he failed to do so. The Government entered into a specific undertaking to do certain things for the dairying industry of this country. A referendum was subsequently held and the Government was robbed of its power to pass on to the consumers of Australia the dairyman&#39;s additional costs of production. The need for passing on to the consumers <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> increased costs of producing butter was unpalatable to a Labour government, but, we did so in accordance with our obligation to maintain the price structure in Australia. In the first year of operation of the plan for the assistance of the dairying industry the additional cost was passed on to the consumer under the powers then possessed by the Commonwealth, but at the same time we paid a subsidy of 6d. per lb. on every pound of butter consumed in the Commonwealth. At the moment the situation is fluid. We are still negotiating with the State Premiers and we&#39; hope that they will at least do the right thing and maintain throughout the length and breadth of Australia a, uniform price structure on an organized basis. If that is done the dairy-farmers will receive their ascertained cost of production. </para>
        <para>The honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis)</inline> has said that this Government pegged the price of butter. What are the facts in relation to that matter? A government of which the honorable member was himself a member appointed Professor Copland as Commonwealth Prices Commissioner and that distinguished gentleman, acting within the authority conferred upon him by a nonLabour government, pegged the price of butter in Australia. We have merely maintained the pegged price. The honor able member, from a propaganda motive, attempted to convey the impression that the Labour Government is the big bad wolf in this matter. Responsibility for the pegging of the price of butter rests entirely on a non-Labour government of which he was a member. The Labour Government continued to apply that policy. But it also did something more positive. It appointed a special committee to ascertain the costs of production in the dairying industry. The recommendations of that committee were accepted and made effective by the Australian Government when it had authority to act. On every occasion that an increase in the price of butter was reported by the committee to be warranted, we accepted our responsibility to the dairy-farmers and increased the price. We were robbed of our price-fixing powers largely as the result of the false propaganda indulged in by honorable members opposite and their powerful friends. As the result of their false propaganda the effectiveness of overall Commonwealth prices control as administered by the Commonwealth in the interests of the people generally was destroyed. </para>

          <para>That, on and after the eleventh day of October, One thousand nine hundred and fortynine, in lieu of the rate imposed by the Stevedoring Industry Charge Act 1947, the rate of the charge in respect of the employment of waterside workers be Two pence half-penny for every man-hour of employment. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Under the Stevedoring Industry Charge Act 1947, a charge was imposed on employers of waterside workers at the rate of 4&#189;d. for every man-hour of employment. The proceeds of this charge have been credited to the Consolidated Revenue Fund, and, in accordance with the provisions of the Stevedoring Industry Acts of 1947 and 1949, equivalent amounts have been paid to the Stevedoring Industry Commission and to the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board, which replaced the former body as from July, 1949. The funds of the board are used for the payment of attendance money to waterside workers, administrative costs and the provision of amenities to waterside workers. </para>
        <para>The purpose of this resolution is to reduce the charge to 2&#189;d. aman-hour of employment on and from the 11th October, 1949, as it has been found that the rate of 4&#189;d. aman-hour has produced revenue in excess of requirements. The charge imposed in 1947 was based on an estimate of 30,000,000 man-hours of employment of waterside workers a year. However, the number of man-hours has substantially increased, and in the year ended the 30th June, 1949, there were approximately 35,750,000 manhours. As a consequence, at the 30th June, 1949, the commission had accumulated funds of about &#163;250,000, after allowing for liabilities incurred. It is anticipated that the reduction of the charge to 2&#189;d. will result in the board&#39;s funds being progressively reduced over the next few years. The diminishing balance will provide a reasonable reserve of working capital to cover unforeseen circumstances. I commend the resolution to honorable members. </para>

            <para>. - I find a little difficulty in relating the matter that I desire to raise to a specific item in the proposed vote for the Department of the Treasury, and am in a quandary, because I am unable to find an appropriate item elsewhere in the Estimates. Some little time ago, I asked a question about the acquisition of Craig&#39;s Buildings in Elizabeth-street, Melbourne. I endeavoured to ascertain the purchase price, and the cost of alterations to date, and of furnishing and equipping the buildings. I also asked whether office furniture had been manufactured in Sydney for use in the buildings, and had been delivered by furniture vans to Melbourne. I further sought to elicit how many of those deliveries were made. The reply that I received was to the effect that the property known as Craig&#39;s Buildings in Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, had not been purchased by the Commonwealth, but was owned by the Commonwealth Bank, and, therefore, the Minister to whom I addressed the question was not in a position to give the information to me. My reason for raising these matters- </para>

That institution is in a different position from that of a public company, which is responsible to its shareholders, or of a government department, about the expenditure of which honorable members can elicit from the responsible Minister any information that they require, because we are not able to pursue either of those two normal methods of inquiry. </para>

              <para>- Very well. Then let me point out that expenditure by the Department of the Treasury has shown a substantial increase, no less, indeed, than ?254,029. This has occurred at a time when the Government is appealing to the people through posters and pamphlets to save money. The Government should itself set a better example, a fact which ought to he pointed out as the Estimates for each successive department are being considered. If the Government is unable to practise what it preaches, how can it expect the people to pay any heed to its preaching? Expenditure is constantly increasing, and the people are not getting value for the money expended. The Government tells people to save, but having put their money in .the savings bank its value constantly declines as time goes on. Those who disregarded the Government&#39;s advice, and bought motor cars and farm implements, did more good for the country than was done by those who saved. </para>

            <para>. -  I hope that I shall be able to satisfy you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> that the remarks I make in this debate are not contrary to the Standing Orders. The proposed vote for the Attorney-General&#39;s Department shows a considerable increase over the expenditure for 1948-49. In fact it shows an increase of more than &#163;50,000, and there is an increase of about &#163;75,000 in the proposed vote as compared with that of the previous year. Normally, we would not begrudge increased expenditure by the AttorneyGeneral&#39;s Department if it could be shown that the public were receiving service, and that protection which the AttorneyGeneral is normally required to extend to citizens. The portfolio of AttorneyGeneral is one of the most important in the Administration, and the AttorneyGeneral has the high responsibility of seeing that the laws of the Commonwealth are administered fairly and interpreted accurately. It is the duty of his department to protect the free people of the Commonwealth against those who violate Commonwealth laws. It is the duty of the Attorney -General to maintain the Constitution for the benefit of the people, but the present Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt),</inline> who has occupied the position for a number of years, has earned an unenviable reputation in that regard. In the past, we have looked to the AttorneyGeneral to enforce the Constitution against those who would defy it. However, in recent years it has become necessary for citizens of the Commonwealth time, time and time again, to expend their own money in order to defend the Constitution against the AttorneyGeneral. Some of the legislation which the Attorney-General has inspired or applied has been successfully challenged on one ground or another. I do not propose to go into details, because this is, perhaps, not the proper place; but the issues will be sufficiently familiar to honorable members. I shall recite some of them. First of all, there were the two leading cases affecting banking legislation - the action brought by the Melbourne City Council against the Commonwealth, and that brought by the combined banks - in which State governments intervened - on the nationalization of banking. </para>

              <para>- I am not dealing with banking. I am discussing a series of cases in which, instead of the AttorneyGeneral acting to support the Constitution, it has been left to citizens and organizations in various parts of the Commonwealth to maintain the Constitution against the Attorney-General, to uphold the Constitution against the Government which sought to go beyond its limits. There was the litigation about petrol rationing. I also have in mind an important case bearing upon land sales control, in which the Commonwealth was not prepared to go ahead because it feared that the verdict might bring down the whole prices control structure. There fore, it agreed to a settlement. Then there was the litigation about the air companies </para>

              <para>- To the item covering general costs of administration by the Attorney-General of his department. Surely this is an opportunity for us to examine, when such huge expenditures are involved, whether the AttorneyGeneral&#39;s Department is serving the public properly, or whether it has failed the people in recent years because of the policy applied by the Government. I am trying to make the point that one of the functions of the Attorney-General&#39;s Department is to uphold the Commonwealth Constitution. The only other case to which I desire to make reference is the <inline font-style="italic">Blue Peas</inline> case, in which also the Commonwealth was successfully challenged on its power of acquisition. It has been left to the private &#39;citizens to uphold the Constitution. </para>

              <para>- The High Court has served Australia well, and it merits the continuing respect of Australia. The people are entitled to be told by the Attorney-General what is the attitude of his department and the Government to the High Court. Do they regard it as the final court of appeal on matters, constitutional or other, that arise in this country, or does the Government take the view that the High Court is not to be the final court of appeal, but that the system that has prevailed up to the present shall continue? You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Temporary Chairman,</inline> say that that is a matter of policy and that it may not be discussed. I do not know where else in the Estimates there are provisions that would enable honorable members to place before the Attorney-General matters that, although they may be matters of policy, certainly affect the status of instrumentalities that come under the general supervision of the Attorney-General. I hope that the Attorney-General will make clear to the public the attitude of the Government to the High Court as a court of appeal. The Estimates for the Attorney-General&#39;s Department provide for increased expenditure on the High Court. Obviously the subdivision &#34;A. - Salaries and Payments in the nature of Salary&#34;, does not refer to the salaries of the justices of the High Court. </para>

              <para>- Obviously, the reference is not to the salaries of the justices of the High Court, but I notice that the provision for salaries and allowances this year is about 25 per cent, greater than it was last year. Possibly the reference is to justices&#39; associates or officers attached to the justices. I wonder whether the increase indicates the appointment of additional associates or officers and whether that in turn implies the appointment of additional justices. </para>

              <para>- No. The appointment of justices is dealt with in the statute governing their appointment. The increased provision is due to increased cost of living payments and normal incremental advancement. No policy is involved in the increase. It is simply obedience of arbitration awards. </para>

              <para>- There are two other matters that I desire to refer to. The first is Division 46, &#34;Court of Conciliation and Arbitration &#34;. Again, I hope that what may be described as a matter of policy may be referred to under this heading, for I assume that it is the proper place at which to discuss it. Under the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court Act, the Chief Judge of the Arbitration Court and the Chief Conciliation Commissioner are required to present annual reports to the  Parliament.  and, in their last reports, the Chief Judge and the Chief Conciliation Commissioner both made recommendations, the adoption of which they considered would improve and strengthen the system of conciliation and arbitration. To the best of my knowledge, no action has been taken by the Government to carry out those recommendations, although about twelve months has elapsed since they were made. If the system of conciliation and arbitration, to which we all arn pledged, is to continue successfully, why has the Government seen fit not to adopt those recommendations? </para>

              <para>- There was a recommendation that the Arbitration Court be given stronger disciplinary powers. There was a recommendation that there should be better co-ordination of the decisions of conciliation commissioners in order to achieve uniformity. A. recommendation was made that the existing prohibition on the appearance of lawyers at hearings in the Arbitration Court and before conciliation commissioners be removed, because in the opinion  of thu Chief Judge and the Chief Conciliation Commissioner the presence of counsel was, generally speaking, of assistance to all parties. I think that the Attorney-General will also find that them were a number of other recommendations of a like nature. 1 turn now to the Commonwealth Investigation Service. I consider that the Parliament has never had explained to it in clear enough terms just what the functions of that service are, nor has it been told how many persons are employed in it. We appreciate that much of its work must he of a secret nature and that it is not always expedient to give to the Parliament information that has been secured by that service. I consider that all of us in this free country are concerned about the maintenance, inside a government department, of what is in effect a police service but which is not of the same character as are the police services in the States. It is a police service over and above the ordinary police services that are provided for the protection of the community, and I consider that the Parliament should at least be given a clearer understanding than has been given of what is being done by it, and how the problems that come before it are being handled. The present debate would be a convenient opportunity for the AttorneyGeneral to enlighten us on that point. </para>

            <para>.- 1 refer to Division 49, &#34;Patents, Trade Marks and Designs &#34; and direct the attention of the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> to a complaint that I have received concerning that section of his department. Some time ago I received the complaint, from several of my constituents that, having submitted to the Patents Office projects which they desired to have patented, they had received no information about their applications for periods, of as long as two years. The complaint seems to be general that there is an enormous backlog of work in the Patents Office. I am certain that the AttorneyGeneral realizes that the work of those who desire to proceed with the manufacture of articles that they wish to have patented may be held up by their inability to obtain patents. Will the AttorneyGeneral say whether the problem is one of Staffing, or otherwise? I know of an employee of the Attorney-General&#39;s Department itself having submitted the plans of an engineering device and having to wait for nine months for the device to be tested. I attended to some of the correspondence involved in that matter, and I know that the replies by the department to various representations regarding the delay seemed to be rather unsatisfactory and vague. I shall be glad if the Attorney-General will correct me if 1 am wrong, but it appears to me that the Patents Office may not be offering salaries that will induce engineers and other persons with sufficiently high qualifications to pass judgment on the work of other engineers, to join the staff. It is generally believed, particularly among engineers, that the Patents Ofthe is not obtaining the most highly qualified engineers and that&#39; there are not enough employees in it competent to pass judgment on projects submitted for patenting. </para>

          <para>I turn now to the High Court of Australia. Will the Attorney-General explain why there is such a backlog of cases in the High Court? I shall refer to one case, though, of course I shall not deal with its merits, as it is <inline font-style="italic">sub judice.</inline> The delay in dealing with that particular case has held up the hearing of two other cases. It is the prosecution of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. L.</inline> L. Sharkey. Because of the delay in completing that case no steps have been taken in the charges of sedition against a gentleman named Burns and another gentleman named Healy, who hails from Western Australia. The Sharkey case was submitted to the High Court many months ago, but has not yet been completed. I maintain that a charge of sedition is a grave one, and I should like to know why the High Court is not dealing with such charges with more expedition. </para>

            <para>- You were in the chair last night, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Temporary Chairman,</inline> and I naturally thought that you had established a precedent. The item with which I desire to deal relates to the general expenses of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. I notice that this year&#39;s proposed vote is markedly greater than last year&#39;s. The increase on five items amounts, to &#163;14,000 and there i3 also an increase of about &#163;10,000 on another two items. The proposed vote for travelling and subsistence is increased from &#163;12,000 last year to &#163;16,000 this year. The proposed vote for incidental and other expenditure has risen from &#163;7.000 to &#163;13,300. When the sixteen conciliation commissioners were appointed some honorable members on this side of the chamber considered that their appointment was designed by the Government eventually to destroy the Commonwealth Arbitration Court as a full court. The estimated expenditure on the staffs of the sixteen conciliation commissioners appears at page 243 of the Estimates. We on this side of the committee consider that the Attorney-General may at this juncture, when we are dealing with the proposed expenditure on these staffs, tell the committee just how these conciliation commissioners are, in the vernacular, &#34;making out&#34;, because quite obviously the appointment of these men, whose activities were separated into watertight compartments, cut across the main principles of Commonwealth Arbitration Court procedure. Can the AttorneyGeneral tell the committee how many cases have been referred by these commissioners to the full Commonwealth Arbitration Court? Have they referred to the court anything associated with industrial matters, and if not, then why not? I ask that because quite obviously only the Full Court can assess the effect of any decisions given by the conciliation commissioners over the whole field of industry. With its peculiar knowledge the Full Court can relate industrial matters affecting on industry not only to the general economy of the country but specifically to other industries. We consider that conciliation commissioners should refer matters to the Full Court from time to time so that the effect of individual decisions on the general economy of the country may be correlated. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Can the Attorney-General also say how many disputes have been settled by the conciliation commissioners? Can he tell us whether those commissioners are worth their salaries and whether the staffs employed by them are discharging their obligations in a way that would warrant a continuance of this experiment in conciliation? Can he tell us what increases of wages and marginal rates these gentlemen have awarded, and what decisions they have reached regarding any other matters associated with the industries that are the particular concern of individual commissioners? Can he give us some indication of what evidence was produced to show that the workers in any particular industry should receive increased wages, or any other considerations that might have a direct and an adverse reflection upon other sections of industry and, through those other sections, upon the general economy of the country? In short, what I desire the Attorney-General to elucidate is whether the ultimate results achieved by these conciliation commissioners are not aimed at the complete destruction of the full functions of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court and whether the commissioners, each of whom operates in his own small compartment of industry have not, by gradual accretion, brought into being some form of threat to the great principles of arbitration in this country, that must ultimately result in giving effect to the Labour party&#39;s policy of the complete destruction of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. That is important, because we know that such things are possible. </para>

              <para>- I admit that, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Temporary Chairman,</inline> but I intended my remarks as a passing reference only, and shall not proceed any further along those lines. We know that it is possible to achieve results by indirect methods. In this instance we have the creation of the office of conciliation commissioner, each conciliation commissioner having clearcut duties to perform with no need to refer to the parent body, the full court, even on points of law. The commissioners are a law unto themselves. But their decisions may have repercussions that will affect industry generally and also the national economy as a whole. That is why I consider that we should know more about the position than we now do, before we pass these Estimates which are intended to continue these gentlemen in office so that they may carry out a policy of hari kiri that may end in the destruction, not only of their own offices, but also of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court We should know what matters they have referred to the full court, how many disputes they have settled, how many increases of wages and marginal rates they have awarded, and whether these increases have been related to ohe another as far as their effect on other industries and on our general economy is concerned. It has been a principle of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court in the past that no award regarding any industry should be made unless the court took into consideration the effect that it would have on other industries and on the country&#39;s economy. That principle has been disposed of entirely by the appointment of these conciliation commissioners with their present powers. I want to know whether they have given any effect to that principle or whether they have taken it into consideration. If not, they are useless in their positions and are a direct menace to the national economy of this country. </para>

If my remarks are out of order, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Temporary Chairman,</inline> I shall be glad if you will correct me. I have no desire to make an attack upon the High Court. Indeed, I would be the last person to attempt to degrade an institution that plays such, an important part in the life of the community. My difficulty is that I do not know where the action of the Parliament in making a law ends and where politics begins. I am not clear, and nobody has made clear to me, at what stage we offend against the law. There is something radically wrong with such a set-up. I do not blame for that state of affairs the instrument under which the High Court was established. Let us consider the very much discussed, and vexed subject of banking.

            <para>. - I direct the attention of the committee to the great increase that has taken place in the cost of administration in the Attorney-General&#39;s Department. The proposed vote for the department for the current financial year is &#163;665,000, compared with &#163;207,000 in 1937-38. Thus, the cost of administration of the department has increased in the last ten years by &#163;458,000. That increase seems to be out of all proportion to the claim of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> that we are now in the &#34; golden age &#34;. Division 45 covers the administrative costs of the bankruptcy administration. Expenditure on that account last year amounted to &#163;51,141. The proposed vote for this year is &#163;53,000, which represents an increase of &#163;2,000 nearly over the expenditure, and of &#163;4,600 over the vote for 1948-49. In 1937-38 expenditure on bankruptcy administration amounted to &#163;39,000. Government spokesmen are always boasting about the great prosperity which this country is now enjoying. They are fond of citing statistics to show that the number of bankrupts has reached an all-time low level. Notwithstanding that fact the cost of the bankruptcy administration is increasing by leaps and bounds. It cannot be claimed that our bankruptcy officials are conducting examinations of the affairs of persons who became bankrupt prior to the accession to office of the present Government. Honorable members opposite are constantly reminding us that farmers are steadily reducing their mortgages and overdrafts, and that prosperity abounds throughout the land. If that be so, how can tha Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> explain away the great increase in the cost of the bankruptcy administration? In the so-called dark days of the depression the vote for the bankruptcy administration was only &#163;39,000. If the vote now proposed is reasonable, either the number of bankruptcies must be increasing - and I do not think they are because there is a measure of prosperity in the country as the result of the high prices we are receiving for our export commodities - or the costs of administration of this government instrumentality are far too high. One wonders how government departments are administered in these days when the expenditure of millions of pounds means nothing to the Government. I should like the Attorney-General to explain fully the reasons for this increased provision. </para>

            <para>. -  Under Division 48, &#34;Commonwealth Investigation Service &#34;, there is provision for a security service and an investigation service in all the States, with&#39; a deputy director in each State. No similar provision has been made for the Northern Territory.  I  am disturbed by the fact that the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> is so remiss in his duty as not to have appointed a security officer in Darwin, which is our most important outpost.  I  am well aware that officers of  the Attorney-General&#39;s Department and of the Department of the Interior are engaged on certain phases of security work in Darwin, hut I believe that the time has arrived when a special security service should be established there as has been done in the capital cities. </para>

I should fail in my duty if I did not remind the Government of the threat that lies in the fact that of the 90,000,000 people of Indonesia, 93 per cent, are illiterate and subscribe to the ideology of Russia. </para>

            <para>. - I seek the assistance of the AttorneyGeneral <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> in a matter that is of some importance. The right honorable gentleman will concede that I am one of those members of this chamber who have had a good deal of experience of the work of the Crown Solicitor&#39;s Office. As such, I should like to say that I have considerable admiration for the standard of the work that is done in that branch of the AttorneyGeneral&#39;s Department in the various States, and for the skill and integrity of the staffs. To my mind, they represent some of the finest elements in the Public Service. I grant that, while the war was in progress, a great expansion of thu work of the Crown Solicitor&#39;s Office in the several States was inevitable. I have not the relevant figures before me, but I am sure that the Attorney-General will agree that that expansion was almost astronomical. However, it was necessary. A spate of work was thrown upon the staff of the Crown law department as a result of war difficulties, prices regulations, national security regulations, and many other pieces of legislation to which the war gave birth. I also concede that, for a period&#39; after the war, it was necessary to maintain a much larger staff than I should expect in time of peace. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Having made those preliminary remarks, I ask the Attorney-General to indicate how far the processes of expansion are to continue. The proposed vote for the Crown Solicitor&#39;s Office reveals that a steady expansion is taking place. That fact is emphasized by an advertisement that appeared in the press some months ago inviting applications for considerable number of highly paid positions in the Crown Solicitor&#39;s Office. A few week ago, I asked the Attorney-General whether the positions had been filled. I cannot recollect the precise answer that the Attorney-General gave, but I think that he said that they had not been filled and that the matter was still under consideration. Perhaps some of the positions have been filled, but I do not think that they have been. I have before me a copy of the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney</inline><inline font-style="italic">Morning</inline><inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> of the 9th February, 1949, in which some 50 vacant positions for legal officers were advertised. Some of them were very senior appointments indeed. For instance, applications were called- for the position of first assistant  secretary in ihe 1 legal division of the Attorney-General&#39;s Department at a salary range pf from &#163;2,500 to &#163;2,638 a year, and also for the position of assistant, secretary on advisings at a salary range beginning at &#163;1,625 a year. Other positions carried lower salaries. I should like the Attorney-General to supply as much information as he can about those positions. I ask him to state the number of appointments that have been made, whether it is intended to fill any of the positions that are now vacant, and why that increase of staff is justified. I ask those questions, not because I want to be difficult, as I realize that some of those appointments are necessary, but because the advertisement iindicates a striking expansion of staff that one ought not to expect when the processes of contraction should have begun. I remind the committee that there has been no increase of Commonwealth powers since the end of the war, and that the powers which the Commonwealth acquired in war-time should be shrinking. Each of the six States has its own legal department, which undertakes a mass of business in the interests of the public and at public expense. Why is it necessary at this stage for the Commonwealth to be expanding in fields which, in peace-time, should be covered by State departments? The advertisement that invited applications for some 50 positions in the Attorney-General&#39;s Department, some of them at an extremely high salary, makes one wonder what additional powers and duties the Commonwealth law department is obliged to assume in peace-time that cannot be performed by the States. The Attorney-General and I know that there are branches of the Crown Solicitor&#39;s Office, not only in the capital cities, but also in various towns throughout the Commonwealth. I recall that one of those branches is located at Townsville in northern Queensland. I should like the Minister to give me the fullest information about those matters. </para>
          <para>One honorable member, when referring to the powers and functions of the High Court of Australia, mentioned the difficulty that is experienced because of the inability to anticipate the decision of the High Court in a particular case. When the Parliament passes legislation, the act may or may not be within the limits of the Constitution. I suppose that the Attorney-General will give the answer that has occurred to me, namely, that the Australian Constitution does not include a provision that permits the High Court, as the supreme &#39;interpretive body, to anticipate or give advisings about proposed legislation. The Supreme Court of the United States of America has some such power, and I express, as my personal opinion, the thought that a similar power, vested in the High Court might be of advantage in avoiding litigation. Law books might not be filled with constitutional cases, as happens at the present time. The existing position is unavoidable as the law and the Constitution now stand. Some government in future may have sufficient courage to ask the people, at a referendum, for greater power for the Commonwealth Parliament to enable the High Court to give judgments in hypothetical cases. Experience suggests that that government may not get that power, but I offer the view that, theoretically it might be a good thing if the Parliament had it. Although the changed position might be bad for constitutional lawyers, it might ultimately be to the advantage of citizens. </para>

            <para>.- I direct the attention of the AttorneyGeneral <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> to a matter which, though comparatively minor, is causing inconvenience to many people. A few days ago, one of my constituents informed me that, two years previously, he had applied for a trade mark. He had used a certain brand for a long time, and then he discovered that it was being infringed to some degree.  His  application to register the trade mark was lodged at the Patents Office some time ago, and when he communicated with me recently, he asked me, as a constituent normally asks his parliamentary representative to perform a service for him, to endeavour to speed up the handling of the application. I got in touch with the Patents Office, and an officer informed me that the staff was dealing with applications that had been lodged at the end of December, 1947. In other words, the Patents Office is almost two years in arrears. </para>

              <para>- Prom- information that I have been able- to obtain, I conclude that the examiners are not necessarily highly technical officers-. The qualifications for the work require that the examiners- shall have an arts degree, or have successfully completed the first or second year of the arts course. Some of the examiners have legal qualifications. However, the salary that is offered is not attractive-. I may be incorrect but I believe- that- the rate is approximately &#163;500 a year. Only four additional&#39; examiners are required, I understand, to enable the back-log of work to be overtaken. The delays that have occurred in dealing with applications have caused considerable inconvenience. To those who desire to register trade marks or to patent inventions, the delay of years is completely unreasonable. </para>

          <para>I realize the physical difficulties of the department, but the staffing problem should be solved. I suggest that the applications for trade marks and patents could be sorted into various categories. I understand that the practice at present is to allot to each application a serial number, and difficult ones are mixed up with easy ones. Some of the applications may be described as &#34; plain sailing &#34;. Would it not be possible to place thI applications into a few classifications? The easy ones could be dealt with expeditiously, and the more complex ones could be set aside for determination at a later date. The first consideration should be to dispose of the back-log of applications as quickly as possible. The particular application in which I am interested is of minor importance, and should not require a great deal of research. Yet I am informed that it cannot be considered in less than two years.

              <para>- The knowledge of honorable members about the newly instituted Security Service is so meagre that  they  would like some information about its functions, and how they differ from those of the Commonwealth Investigation Service. We have at least three, and perhaps four, separate security services operating at present in the armed services. There is one for each service and perhaps a fourth working under the direction of the Defence Department itself. Honorable members would like to be assured that there will be no overlapping. Now, it is proposed to superimpose on the security services attached to the various defence arms, and on the already established Commonwealth Investigation Service, a new security service for which &#163;150,000 is to be .provided this year. This conjures up visions of a very extensive secret service in Australia. I should like to know how it is to be employed. It will not have to concern itself with security within the armed services, because that is already provided for, nor with offences against Commonwealth law, because they will be dealt with by the Commonwealth Investigation Service. I ask, therefore, why it should be necessary to expend &#163;150,000 of public money for the upkeep of a new secret service department. I should like to be assured that it will not be given a charter to probe into the affairs of private citizens but will devote its activities exclusively to matters associated with the security of the nation, and outside the recognized scope of the Commonwealth Investigation Service. If its activities are to be so restricted as that, I find it difficult to believe that it is necessary to vote &#163;150,000 for its support. I want to be assured that it is not intended to establish a substantial new department to operate on a wide front investigating the private affairs of citizens. I have seen new departments created before this. I have in mind the Department of Information, for which  the  original vote was about &#163;100,000. When the Department of External Affairs was instituted, its expenditure was covered by about &#163;100,000 also, hut after a few years more than &#163;1,000,000 has to be voted for that department. Is that experience to he repeated? Are we now laying the foundations of a secret service which, in a few year&#39;s time, will need &#163;1,000,000 to maintain? Honorable members, whatever their political faith, cannot be happy in agreeing to this proposed vote unless they receive a full explanation. We have had many examples of the keeping of a close tab on the activities of members of the Opposition. Ministers of the Crow have been able to say upon whom members of the Opposition called at 3.30 p.m. on a certain day when they were in New York, and with whom Opposition members did business in Perth at 10 o&#39;clock on a certain morning. The personal affairs of members of the Opposition- </para>

              <para>- Yes, even that. Ministers have shown that they have had knowledge of the private affairs of members of the Opposition. While I have been speaking in this chamber, the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman),</inline> who controls one security service, and the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard),</inline> have made interjections which have revealed that, by some device, they were in possession of most intimate knowledge of my private affairs. I should like to know how they came by that knowledge. I do not believe that they were able, by their own efforts, to keep tab on my private affairs. I do not believe that Ministers can, without assistance, learn of the activities of private members of this Parliament hi Perth, New York, or London. I am compelled to believe that when Ministers of the Crown indicate that they possess intimate informa11011  about members of the Opposition, based upon a comprehensive dossier, public servants and public money have been employed in the gathering of the information. It would seem that some Ministers, at any rate, can maintain so close a scrutiny upon their political opponents that they are able to turn up a record of their affairs, perhaps to their political embarrassment. I should like to receive an unequivocal assurance that the new Security Service will not bc pui ployed in the gathering of information of that kind. There seems to he no doubt that some Ministers do keep dossiers on members of the Opposition showing with whom they do business, how they conduct their affairs, how many persona they employ, and what they pay them. We should be relieved of the fear that, when we vote &#163;150,000 for the Security Service, it will not be employed upon activities of that kind. I hope that my remarks will evoke from the Attorney-General a full explanation of the purposes for which the Security Service has been established. </para>

              <para>- I desire to refer to the proposed vote for the conciliation commissioners and also to certain other aspects of the work of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. The fact that in the course of the year it may be necessary to replace a conciliation commissioner who has resigned, as <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> number of commissioners have already resigned, prompts me to offer some observations on what I conceive to be a desirable character and the background for the appointee that ought to be properly borne in mind by the Government in exercising its rights under this proposed vote. My first point is that the men who exercise judicial or quasi-judicial functions need to be objective .and impartial. Objectivity and impartiality are necessary in any form of court procedure or litigation. Without it in the field of conciliation and arbitration there cannot be satisfactory conciliation or arbitration in the area of employer-employee relationship. It does not matter whether one is dealing with the court itself, conciliation commissioners or the umpire at a football match, the protagonists must have confidence in the impartiality of the judge, the commissioner or the umpire, as the case may be. Without confidence in the impartiality and competence of the person who will pronounce judgment, there cannot be any confidence that fair play will prevail. There cannot be any confidence in the judgment given. So, if there is not confidence in the conciliation commissioners, this departure in the field of conciliation, will not be found, in the final analysis, to have produced the good employeremployee relationship that we were told it is designed to produce. When people are appointed to judicial posts they are normally, and were always, I think, until quite recently, chosen from people with special training and no background of continuing bias in one direction or the other. There has been a complete departure from that ancient&#39; and fundamental principle of British judicial procedure in the choice of the appointees whose salaries we are now to vote upon. </para>

              <para>- And there is confidence in some of the others. But when the Government chose the panel of conciliation commissioners who are, by statute, entitled to pronounce judgments affecting great industries from which there is no appeal it is strange and bad to find that it, with very few exceptions, chose men whose whole training and background has been designed to cultivate a bias in one direction. I do not say that it is a vicious bias ; I wish that to be understood. Nevertheless there is a bias.

          <para class="block">I have said points to the fact that the Government has been completely partisan in appointing gentlemen to  make  awards in all these great Australian industries. The guiding principle in the appointment of the conciliation commissioners seems to have been that those who were chosen for appointment are those deserving of reward for having been faithful servants of the Australian Labour party. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture has just called out, &#34;Hear, hear ! &#34;, which shows that I have been correct in my reading of the Government&#39;s motives. I have got that same comment again and again from that Minister. I shall not be found protesting against a reward being given for faithful service. But I say that it is disgraceful to reward the faithful service of these gentlemen to the Labour party by appointing them to important positions that have such far-reaching consequences, when they are without the requisite training or background, and when their whole history leads them to be biased in favour of one interest. That kind of appointment is designed to destroy confidence in the Australian system of arbitration. Ninety thousand people attended a football match between Carlton and Essendon teams in Melbourne recently. How many people would have attended that match if they had been informed beforehand that the umpire would be chosen from the active supporters of one of the teams on the field? Such a circumstance would destroy confidence in the game of football. The Government&#39;s appointments of certain individuals to conciliation  commissionerships  will similarly destroy confidence in the arbitration system. That is what the Government&#39;s action in appointing these men was designed to do, and the design, in fact, extends beyond the realm of those conciliation commissioners. Jurisdiction over the maritime industry was taken away from the Commonwealth Arbitration Court and the industry was placed under control of the Maritime Industry Commission; and who was appointed to that commission but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> V. Elliott, an avowed Communist? The stevedoring industry was also taken out of the hands of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court and was placed under the control of the Stevedoring industry Commission, now defunct. Another openly avowed Communist, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> Healy, was appointed a member of that commission. </para>
          <para>The  DEPUTY CHAIRMAN.-  Order ! That subject has nothing to do with conciliation and arbitration. The question whether the persons appointed as conciliation commissioners should have special qualifications was discussed at the time that the bill for the act under which they were appointed was being considered in this House. The honorable gentleman is entitled to discuss whether the persons appointed actually have special qualifications such as legal or other training. </para>

              <para>- That is the point that I have been discussing up to the present time. They have no special training, but, with the few exceptions that I have mentioned, they are inevitably biased in one direction in respect of the judicial functions that they have to carry out. Their appointment, therefore, is certainly calculated to destroy confidence in the arbitration system. There is one great organization in Australia which has, as its openly proclaimed purpose, the destruction of the arbitration system. I refer to the Communist party. These appointments are in accordance with the policy of the Communist party. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member for Indi has cast aspersions on men who have been appointed to their positions because of their knowledge of the matters upon which they are called to adjudicate, and because of their understanding of industrial conditions and not so much because of their legal knowledge. A.&#171; the honorable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beazley)</inline> has mentioned, many members of this Parliament have come from very varied avenues of life into the totally different atmosphere of the Parliament and have carried out their parliamentary responsibilities with distinction because they have good intelligent minds and, amongst other things, have an understanding and appreciation of what is required of them, as well as a knowledge of -w to adapt themselves to their new &#60;rcumstances. It is shocking that in a democratic country like Australia we should hear criticisms of a man merely because he once occupied a position as a ministerial car driver or a trade union delegate, or because h* has been able by sheer ability to win the confidence of the Parliament and gain appointment to a high position. It is dreadful that honorable members opposite should attempt to bring into disrepute men who have been appointed to high positions because of their loyalty and experience. Some time ago in this chamber the honorable member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beale)</inline> criticized a gentleman who was also mentioned to-night by the honorable member for Indi. I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> R. Donovan. The honorable member for Parramatta criticized <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Donovan&#39;s</inline> handling of matters concerning the pastoral industry and his attitude in court to conciliation matters. Some months ago he endeavoured to show that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Donovan</inline> was partial and could not give a fair interpretation of the matters that came before him. Following that attack I received from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dougherty,</inline> of the Australian Workers Union, a transcript of a statement that he had made before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Donovan</inline> regarding that conciliation commissioner&#39;s attitude to matters of conciliation. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dougherty</inline> also supplied me with the transcript of a statement made by the employers&#39; representative on the same occasion, in which he had paid a tribute to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Donovan&#39;s</inline> impartiality and to the manner in which he had adjudicated in matters affecting the pastoral industry. </para>

You have been manifestly fair to both sides in the hearing of the cases, both the wool classers&#39; case and this, and I cannot say more than that you have heard us very impartially and very fairly. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>Those are outstanding tributes from both sides and constitute a complete denial of the attitude taken about the commissioner&#39;s impartiality by the honorable member for Indi. I have no doubt that a perusal of the records of the courts would produce similar statements regarding other conciliation commissioners. We on this side of the committee do not criticize the fact that many men who now occupy high posts in this country came from the ranks of the political parties opposed to the present Government. In most instances these men are adjudicating to-day most fairly in connexion with the matters that come before them. An examination of the list of political appointments would show that in various avenues of the life of this country are men who were appointed directly by anti-Labour governments for political purposes. </para>
          <para>The most significant feature of the speech of the honorable member for Indi was that he completely excluded from criticism any of the appointments made by governments which consisted of members of the present Opposition parties. It is for honorable members to decide for themselves why he omitted to mention such appointments. The fact that he omitted to mention such appointments shows that the honorable member for Indi is partial in his criticisms, and was endeavouring to undermine and besmirch not only the impartiality of the conciliation commissioners, but also their characters and their ability to do their jobs. Probably the only appointments that could be validly challenged are those made by honorable members opposite when they were in office. The fact is that this Parliament saw fit to legislate for the appointment of the conciliation commissioners. This Government could not bp expected to appoint as conciliation commissioners solicitors and other legal men without experience in industrial matters, with no industrial background and with no sympathy for the employees in industry, and thus betray the interests of the workers to those who are determined to serve the interests of the employing classes. The conciliation commissioners were appointed after due consideration by the Parliament, the Cabinet, the Attorney-General and by the Labour party generally of the value of such a system of conciliation and in common with all other members on this side of the committee I resent the attacks made on men like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hamilton</inline> Knight, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Donovan</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Findlay,</inline> who have served this country in the industrial and political spheres, and by being appointed to these positions, have been enabled to continue their good work. These gentlemen, in the course  of their duties, have received commendations from the representatives of both the employers and the employees. Honorable members opposite would be much better occupied in discussing fairly and impartially the Estimates before the committee than in trying to undermine the arbitration system and public confidence in its institutions. </para>

            <para>. - Prior to the suspension of the sitting, I spoke about conciliation and arbitration, and I pointed out that the appointment of conciliation commissioners was robbing the Commonwealth Arbitration Court of its full jurisdiction. I do not want to say anything more on that subject except that everything that the honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr, McEwen)</inline> has said regarding these appointments and the qualifications of tie conciliation commissioners highlights Labour&#39;s policy of so ridiculing the arbitration system as to run the risk of completely destroying it. This Government is holding the whole system up to ridicule. It has taken sections of industry away from the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court and it has placed them in watertight compartments without worrying about the effect that the decisions made by individual conciliation commissioners may have on other industries and on the country&#39;s economy generally. The award of increased wages and marginal rates in one particular industry may have an effect on other industries. The Commonwealth Arbitration Court has always taken into consideration the effects of its decisions on industry generally and on the country&#39;s economy. That principle has now been departed from as a consequence of these appointments, and everything that the honorable member for Indi has said regarding the qualifications of the conciliation commissioners bears out my contention. I do not want to say more than that on the point. </para>

              <para>- I wholeheartedly agree with it, because it gives me an opportunity to say something earlier than otherwise would have been possible. Provision has been made in these Estimates for &#163;115,000 for the Security Service. In 1948-49, an amount of &#163;13,000 was provided for a security service as distinct from the Commonwealth Investigation Service. The Estimates of the AttorneyGeneral&#39;s Department for this year include an amount of &#163;74,000 for the Commonwealth Investigation Service compared with an expenditure of &#163;66,506 under that heading in the preceding year. It would appear on the surface that that is all the Government proposes to expend on a security and investigational service. That is not so. A close analysis of the Estimates discloses that that amount covers only one section of the investigational and security work which is carried out by this Government. The citizens of Australia are subject to more prying eyes and more snooping tactics than are the citizens of any other country in the world. Intelligence services have been established in the Navy, the Army and the Air Force. We have a Commonwealth Investigation Service, and we have State police. Because of the dossiers that have been compiled on members of the Opposition, I have no doubt that there is also a security service within the Department of Information. Doubtless, there is also a security service within the framework of the Department of Defence. In almost every foreign embassy in Australia dossiers are to be found on every person of notein this country. I venture to say that in the Soviet Embassy . in Canberra  theer  would be found complete dossiers of every person of importance in Australia. I know, and every other honorable member knows, that if any person of note moves from one country to another his dossierinvariably precedes him. Australians are subjected to more prying and more extensive snooping tactics than possibly are-  the Russians themselves. I do not in any circumstances object to the establishment of a security service for the purpose of preserving the security of this nation ; but there are several undesirable features associated with the security services which this Government has established. </para>

From time to time, when embarrassing questions are asked by members of the Opposition, replies are fired across the chamber in which threats are made to reveal some incident in a private member&#39;s life in an attempt to intimidate him.

I venture to say that the continuous application of good administrative policy is made possible only by our public servants. Yet the leaders of our public departments have protested vigorously that dossiers are being compiled about them for purposes about which they know nothing. For all they know the dossiers may be used at some subsequent time to intimidate them. Things have come to a pretty pass when the Government establishes a security service, not to police the security of this country, but to compile dossiers that may subsequently be used to embarrass people. Where this sort of thing is likely to lead1 us has been amply shown by recent history.. These moves are the forerunners of a political police force - a gest;apo, the </para>
          <para class="block">O.G.P.U. of Soviet Russia and the like. They herald the beginning of a political police force in this country. No country which embraces the tenets of totalitarianism, as this Governments seeks to impose them on the country by its socialist programme, can get by without a political police force. The Security Service was, I understand, originally designed, and I hope it will be used only for the protection of this country and its people. I have pointed out the extent to which the services of this Government have been used to embarrass not only public servants but also public men. We should make the closest examination of these Estimates to ensure that the money voted by us is used for the purpose for which our Security Service was originally designed. I am completely in accord with the view that the activities of our security officers should not be divulged. I agree that if their activities were divulged our security could no longer be guarded. My complaint is that our Security Service&#39; is being used for purposes for which it was not designed, and that Ministers themselves are employing their own security officers to compile dossiers. I am aware that we cannot in any way prevent foreign embassies that are established in Australia from compiling dossiers on our prominent citizens. Our embassies in foreign countries no doubt do likewise. The Attorney-General laughs at that remark. He knows that he is made aware of all the details relating to any person of note who comes to Australia from another country. Dossiers which give an outline of their history, their standing in the community, and their political beliefs, always precede prominent men when they travel abroad. We all are aware that that is so. It is regrettable, however, that people in this country should be spied upon by so many eyes. Our private affairs are subjected to closer&#39; scrutiny than are those of the peoples of any other country. Because of the totalitarian character of this Government, we are rapidly approaching the stage when we shall have a political police force established in Australia. </para>

            <para>. What we want to know from the honorable member is whether or not lie favours the establishment of a security service to protect the internal security of this country.  His  speech showed him to be both for and against it. He has said that Australia is becoming a totalitarian country. The Security Service must be operated with secrecy in order properly to protect the community. The results of the investigations of the Security Service are not published because the purpose of such a service is to protect the nation, especially against subversive activities. If the results of our security investigations were published, the attempt to defeat subversive activities would always be foiled. The honorable member has also spoken about prying eyes. He has said that the Security Service is a constantly prying eye. Of course it is. That is the very purpose for which a security service is established. He tried to pay a tribute to the public servants. I remind him that all the officers of the Security Service are servants of the Commonwealth. All of these Estimates, in one form or another, are designed to provide for the salaries and allowances of trusted officers of the Commonwealth. Honorable members opposite suggest that we should take every possible precaution against the spread of subversive activities, but when the Government does so it is denounced as a totalitarian government. That is the very phraseology of the Communists. If communism exists in a democratic country, and that country desires to protect itself by establishing a properly organized security service, the great cry of the Communists is &#34; Totalitarianism ! Terrorism ! &#34;. The truth of the matter is very simply that the proposed vote which was dealt with by the honorable member for Wentworth relates to the Security Service recently approved by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> after consultation with the British Government to protect this country against subversive activities, and for no other purpose. We so designed it as to put it beyond the scope of political party approach. The Government decided to appoint a Supreme Court judge from South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Reed, to administer the service. Officers came from Great Britain in order to see that, broadly speaking, the same system, would be adopted here as had been adopted in Great Britain. This is a period in which there is a danger of espionage and of subversive activities, and the -plan for the establishment of a security service was drawn up in consultation with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Reed, and to put the matter beyond the sphere of party politics <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Reed was given the charter to which the Prime Minister has referred. He is not subject to ministerial control in the ordinary sense. I support the proposed vote, because&#39; we have a trusted officer in charge of the Security .Service and, as in England, Cabinet Ministers are not interested further, other than to know, as we do know, that we have an efficient service under a completely impartial and fearless head in the person of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Reed. </para>

          <para>Some of the confusion that has arisen about this matter is due partly to the change that has been made in the Commonwealth Investigation Service of the Attorney-General&#39;s Department. That service, which was established many years ago by the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> had what might be described as a police or investigation side, and a security side. On the police and investigation side, the organization fulfilled for the Commonwealth the purposes which, broadly speaking, were fulfilled by the police forces of the respective States. The purpose of the investigation service was to secure obedience to and enforcement of Commonwealth laws. </para>

              <para>- It certainly grew out of a dispute many years ago, and it is an old-established service. The security side gradually developed before the outbreak of World War II., and functions of a security character were assigned to the officers of the Commonwealth Investigation Service, which has been under the control of able men.  Colonel Jones, Colonel Lloyd  and  Colonel Browne  are three names that immediately occur to me. The Government has decided to separate the investigation and police functions from the security function. The investigation and police functions are to be left with the Commonwealth Investigation Service, of which  Colonel Lloyd  is the chief, and the security functions in connexion with subversive activities affecting the internal security of Australia are under the control of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Reed. I am glad that you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Chairman,</inline> and the committee have consented to consider the Commonwealth Investigation Service and the Security Service together, although they are separate organizations. The proposed vote for the Security Service is more than &#163;100,000, but it is comparatively small. If we are to have an efficient Security Service, we&#39; must obviously employ persons who have a knowledge of other languages, who are skilled in inquiry work, and in tracing the movements of persons who may be a danger to security. Broadly speaking, the same kind of security service exists as in Great Britain, and in the United States of America where it is known as the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Although many officers of the Commonwealth Investigation Service could perform security functions, we have separated the two organizations. The investigation service will be analogous to a State police force and its functions will be to ensure that Commonwealth law shall be enforced, and that if a breach of Commonwealth law is committed, it shall be detected and proceedings taken in the appropriate place. The Government considers that, in the interests of efficiency, the Commonwealth Investigation Service and the Security Service should be separated. These Estimates, for the first time, separate the two organizations. I hope that honorable members understand clearly that that has been done. </para>

              <para>- The Commonwealth Investigation Service. The ordinary enforcement of Commonwealth law has always been a function of the AttorneyGeneral&#39;s Department, and that posi tion has not been changed. The Commonwealth Investigation Service enforces not merely the decisions of the AttorneyGeneral&#39;s Department, but also the decisions of other Commonwealth departments. If an offence has been committed against a regulation of the Department of Trade and Customs or the Department of Commerce and Agriculture, the officers of the Commonwealth Investigation Service are at the disposal of those departments, although nominally they are officers of the Attorney-General&#39;s Department. The Security Service, which is more important, especially under present-day conditions, is committed to my administration as far as the Parliament is concerned. I have to&#39; speak for the Security Service in the Parliament, but the charter under which that organization works gives the widest discretion to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Reed. The Government has every confidence in the ability and independence of that gentleman. The Government does not concern itself with the precise methods that he uses. We have adopted, in principle, the practice which United Kingdom governments have adopted successfully. </para>

The honorable member for Wentworth has suggested that dossiers are kept on public servants. What does he mean by that statement?

I do not know of any such case, and I do not know how the honorable member knows about one. If the Security Service has a record of a public servant, the honorable member should not knowabout it. </para>

I want the committee to understand the line of deinarkation that has been made between the enforcement of Commonwealth law, and the Security Service. The last-named organization deals with subversive activities that may threaten the internal security of Australia. The Estimates provided for the establishment as it existed prior to the inauguration of the Security Service recently, and they further provide for a number of posts in the former security section of the Commonwealth Investigation Service. Since the Estimates were prepared, security functions generally have been assumed by the new security intelligence organization under the control of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Reed.

What an honorable member might say about socialism in the heat of an election campaign might very well be contrasted with what he said a few years earlier in favour of socialist enterprise such as wheat pools and the intervention of the State in matters which were then regarded by some honorable members as very desirable in the public interest for such government intervention. </para>

The organization was started for good reasons, some of them internal, and some of them of an external character. We adopted the system that is in operation in Great Britain after we had had consultations with British and Australian officers about security matters. </para>

              <para>- That is so. At one time the lag was even greater than it is now. Substantially the same position exists in British and American patent offices. The law of those two countries in relation to patents and trade marks does not differ greatly from Commonwealth law. The arrears are primarily the result of the difficulty of obtaining the services of adequate technical staff, despite repeated advertisements in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> and the press. The Public Service Board, not the Government, fixes the salaries of examiners. The salaries have been increased in recent years, but the demands of industry in Australia, under conditions of full employment, are insatiable. It is very difficult for the department, despite the efficiency of its officers, to make up the lag. Branches have been established in Sydney and Melbourne in an endeavour to alleviate the situation, and we are prepared to &#39;establish branches in other States and territories should that be desirable. , </para>

              <para>- I cannot answer that&#39; question offhand, but I shall make inquiries. In 1946, an act was passed to remove disabilities  occassioned  to applicants for patents because of delays in examining applications. Honorable members will see the importance of this, because the granting of a patent, prima facie, gives the patentee sixteen years&#39; monopoly of the patent. The lag cannot be overtaken by picking out the applications that look simple. The simpler a device is the less patentable it may be legally. The legal rights of an applicant now commence automatically almost immediately upon ti e lodgment of his application. The present lag is almost two years, but during the war, which was responsible for the accumulation of work, the delay was as much as three and a half years or four years. The department wants to get staff, and is prepared to pay suitable men, but the rewards in industry are so great that we find it very difficult to get suitable staff. However, nothing will be left undone to alleviate the position. </para>

That increase is not due to an increase in the number of bankruptcies. It is due to the fact that employees in the bankruptcy office are obtaining increases of salary, due to cost of living increases, reclassifications, or general salary increases throughout the -whole service. </para>

              <para>- &#34;Well, primary producers now obtain guaranteed prices for  their  products, and Australia is in the excellent financial position set out in the budget. The honorable member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beale)</inline> paid a tribute - and it is always of some value to underline a fact of that kind - to the Crown Solicitor&#39;s Office. He said that it had won his admiration. However, he wished to know why advertisements had appeared in the press inviting applications for 50 new appointments. It is true that the work of the office has increased, but I am told nhat of the 50 new positions, probably about 40 will be filled by officers already in the department. The new positions have been created because of the need -to reclassify existing positions. The honorable member for Parramatta and the honorable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Gaha)</inline> asked whether it would be possible to obtain advisings from the High Court before the Parliament passed legislation which touched upon constitutional law. It would be impossible to do so, because, as I pointed out earlier, Parliament in 1921 passed such an act, and the High Court declared that it went beyond the constitutional power of the Commonwealth. </para>

          <para>The honorable member for Indi and the honorable member for Wentworth mentioned the conciliation and arbitration systems. It is &#34; true that when we were putting the case for the appointment of conciliation commissioners we said that delays in the hearing of cases would be prevented, and I think that that claim has been justified. Broadly speaking, the commissioners do not deal with basic matters, such as hours and the basic wage, but with margins and conditions. Jurisdiction in basic matters is vested in&#39; the judges of the court. Up to the 30th June, last, the commissioners had dealt with 1,541 cases or disputes, and the court had had before it in the same period 242 matters. It is evident, therefore, that both the commissioners and the court have done a greatdeal of work during the eighteen monthssince the commissioners were appointed. The number of new awards, or variations of existing awards in the same period was 917. </para>
          <para>The honorable member for Indi had toargue from a difficult brief. He went through the list of commissioners, but it is quite impossible that he should know them individually as others do. There isthe closest liaison between the commissioners and the present Chief Judge of the Arbitration Court. Chief Judge Drake-Brockman did a great service to this country, particularly during thewar, and we greatly regret his death, which was, indeed, largely due to the work he did during the war. Chief Judge Kelly has been able to tighten up the arbitration system. This has not resulted in appeals from the commissioners to the court, but it has resulted in more frequent meetings between the  chairman  of the conciliation commissioners, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mooney,</inline> and the Chief Judge. There is more teamwork, and I believe that the system is working successfully. </para>
          <para>It was claimed that the appointment of conciliation commissioners would streamline arbitration, and avoid the irritation arising out of delays in hearing claims. I think the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway)</inline> will agree  with me that it has had that resultIt is true that some of the commissioners were previously trade union officials, but the Chief Judge made the original assignment to industries on the general principle that a commissioner would not act in a claim affecting a union of which he had previously been an official. The commissioners were chosen because of their knowledge of various industries. I am obliged to the honorable member for Martin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Daly)</inline> for taking up the case of one commissioner, and reading to the committeetributes paid to him by the representative of the pastoralists, who were theemployers in one of the cases with which lis had dealt. We are entitled to takethe view that a commissioner will discipline himself against any possibility of bias, and will give a fair decision on the evidence and the. facts. Some of them have had considerable court experience and have acquired the habit of considering matters fairly. As a matter of fact, <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> have received complaints from trade unions that conciliation commissioners are so impartial that they lean over backwards in their efforts to be fair to the employers. </para>

              <para>- I am not trying to take a trivial point. The honorable member for Indi criticized the commissioners, and in order to support his criticism he should have shown that they had failed to deal impartially with cases brought before them. He did not do so. Everything points to the fact that they have been fair and impartial. The only complaints against the conciliation commissioners, including former trade union officials, are that in- their awards they have indicated an unwillingness to accept union claims. It is quite correct that many of the conciliation commissioners have been, associated with unions. One or two have been union secretaries. One name omitted by the honorable member for Indi is that of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. V.</inline> G. Hall, who was chief industrial officer in the New South Wales railways and who, before his appointment, acted for twelve years as a board of reference under the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act in matters affecting the New South Wales railways. Generally the commissioners have not been appointed to act in fields in which they acted as union officials. Work ing together as a group, under the chairmanship of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mooney</inline> and under the general supervision of the Chief Judge, they have acted successfully. In fact, until to-night, the only objections to the group of conciliation commissioners have come from the Communist party. One Communist referred in the court to the commissioners as being perfectly useless to the workers and as more or less dilutee judges. The extremist organizations object to the fact that they are impartial. I regard that as nothing but an unconscious tribute to the attempts that they have made to play their part in the struggle for industrial peace in Australia based on conciliation and arbitration. The honorable member had a difficult task in dealing with them seriatim. They ave able men. I could go through the whole list, but the honorable gentleman referred to one who, at one time, drove a ministerial car. That is a very important job, but the man in question was secretary of the Transport Workers Union. As a conciliation commissioner, he has shown a degree of ability that is quite up to standard and has been favorably commented upon in Canberra, where he operates, not only by the employees&#39; representatives, but also by the employers&#39; representatives. We are not dealing with the salaries of the conciliation commissioners. They are provided for by an act of the Parliament. Working with the judges, under the system of liaison and co-ordination that I have tried to describe, they have rendered a useful service to the Commonwealth. The system that we have instituted has been a success. Therefore, there is no justification for the criticism of the conciliation commissioners. </para>

            <para>. -  This afternoon, when I tried to discuss the Commonwealth Security Service under the proposed vote for theCommonwealth Investigation Service, I was&#39; ruled out of order; but, now that it has been decided to consider the items together, I presume that I maydiscuss the Security Service and the Commonwealth Investigation Service in conjunction. I pointed out that, whilst there were security  officesand  deputy  directors of security in all the capital cities of Australia, there was-  neither a security office nor a  deputy  director of security in Darwin. The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> has informed me privately that a security service officer has been appointed at Darwin. I do not know whether he has taken up residence yet, but I congratulate the Government on having, at long last, through <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Reed, the DirectorGeneral of Security, decided to look on Darwin as a focal point in our security service. I shall return to that matter in detail later. </para>

          <para>Provision is. made in the Estimates for the salaries of the Public Service Arbitrator and the Assistant Public Service Arbitrator. The Public Service Arbitrator,, in the old days, did a mighty job in solving the problems of the railway workers from the northern boundary of South Australia through. Finke River to Alice Springs, in the Northern Territory, and from Port Pirie to Kalgoorlie. He was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Westhoven.</inline> He, in conjunction, with the Minister for Air <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Drakeford),</inline> who was then  president  of the. Engine Drivers and Firemen&#39;s Association, and myself, succeeded in greatly improving the lot of the railway workerson the two lines that I have mentioned. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.. Westhoven-</inline> has retired. Before he retired he did a wonderful job for the railway workers. The amount of &#163;3 a fortnight was put on to the wages of pumpers,. Blacksmiths and other workers were given substantial margins. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Westhoven&#39;s  report was very useful, as an, indication of the neglect of the railway workers in central Australia and on the Trans-Australia line. That report was made in 1937 and improvements followed. It was a pleasure to pass along the north-south railway a few months ago and&#39; see the greatly improved conditions that exist as compared with those of the bad old days, before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Westhoven,</inline> with the assistance of the Minister for Air and myself, got to work on improving the conditions of the workers. The men now have messes. Cooks are provided. Quarters are available for married couples. Previously, the conditions under which the people lived, were disgraceful. So we should congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Westhoven</inline> on. the manner in which he reported on. the Commonwealth railways up to that time. Both . the Conservative government to which he reported and the Labour Government are also to be congratulated for what they have done to give effect to his recommendations. Thereby the conditions of the railway workers on the line to Alice Springs and of the Trans-Australia line have been greatly improved. However, the conditions of the workers on the line from Darwin to Birdum were left unchanged. I interviewed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Westhoven</inline> in his office in the Commonwealth Bank Chambers, Sydney, about what should he done on their behalf. He told me he was waiting to be asked to go to Darwin by the union. Then I went to Darwin and pleaded with the executive of the railway workers to invite <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Westhoven</inline> to do for them what he had done for their colleagues on the other Commonwealth lines. That was 1937, an election year. Because it was an election year and probably because acceptance of my intervention on their behalf might help me politically, the leaders of the union, .fearful of the outcome, refused to invite him to Darwin. It hurt me to think that I had put the ball at their feet and they had refused to play. So, for many years, the workers on the Darwin-Birdum line have lived under much worse conditions than have the workers on the Trans-Australia line and on- the north-south line1 to Alice Springs. </para>
          <para>I think the Public Service Arbitrator should do something for&#34; the clerks, temporary and permanent, male and female, at Alice Springs. Their secretary invited me to attend a meeting at which they were considering putting their case to the Public Service Board. I advised them not t&#39;o go over the head of the board1 by approaching me as their federal member before the board had given a ruling. They have a good case for an increase of salary, if only because the Minister f or the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Johnson)</inline> increased&#39; railway fares and freights by 25 per cent, recently. Anyway, I discussed the plight of the clerks with the union secretary, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bowditch,</inline> and also with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Matthews</inline> at&#39; Darwin. I refuse to believe that they have not recently written to me because this is an election year and because they are fearful that if I took up their cudgels on the floor of the House of </para>
          <para class="block">Representatives and assisted them, 1 would gain political kudos. They are educated men and women. There are five panels involved. The Public Service Arbitrator should be deputed to go through the Northern Territory and consider their problems immediately. The workers there should not have to carry on their negotiations in writing with the Public Service Board, which is so far distant. Let the Government take the bit in its teeth and not wait until the clerks ask that the Public Service Arbitrator go &#39;to the Northern Territory, &#39;but let it send him there with instructions to go thoroughly into all matters. I realize that the conciliation commissioner, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Portus,</inline> does a fine job for the pastoral workers and hotel employees, but the public servants could well have &#34;their problems dealt with by the Public Service Arbitrator. Let the .Minister for the Interior, who was in the Northern Territory at about the .same time as I was there recently, not hang back in the collar, but do something for the workers there immediately. </para>
          <para>I -return now to the matter of the establishment of a branch -of the Security Service in Darwin. I am disturbed that we have a Communist cell in the city. It seems to have been taken lightly by the Government. I remind Ministers r.hat Darwin is a focal point. It is the gateway to Australia from the north. Agents of Russia - let us not back and fill about mentioning its ,name - whose .ideology is opposed to o.ur own, could do great damage &#39;to the port of Darwin. They could so damage it as to prevent the .arrival of petrol for naval, military and air establishments. I .have taken part in listing the name9 of known Communists in Darwin. We have 83 listed, many of whom are on the government .payroll. There .are 23 whose names are not listed publicly. The Government would be surprised if I named those whom I suspect to be Communists. I put it to the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> and the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> that it is high time that they took the area of Darwin seriously. There are Communists on the public payroll. Apart from that, we should conaider the position of the <inline font-style="italic">Standard</inline> newspaper, which is definitely communistic. </para>
          <para class="block">It has been Communist-controlled ever since the former editor, Don McKinnon, was kicked out. &#39;Of the union executives 95 per cent, are rank Communists. That remark does not apply to rank and file. Does the Australian Government intend to turn a deaf ear or a Nelson blind eye to that state of affairs? It is high time my representations were heeded. I sympathized &#39;with the young fellow who has been nominated as the Australian Labour party candidate for the Northern Territory -at the forthcoming general election. His candidature is being sponsored by the <inline font-style="italic">Standard</inline> and the Communists. The Minister for the Interior knows that young fellow and he knows that, in his innocence, he is being used by the Communists. I know, too, that the Communists are anathema to the Minister, as .a former &#39;.leading official of the Australian Workers -Union. That young fellow is playing with fire in allowing his candidature to be sponsored in this treasonous newspaper, the <inline font-style="italic">Standard.</inline> I desire to know how the Communists came to obtain the printing .machinery from the Army for a song after the war. Surely the security officer had the right to visit that newspaper&#39;s office. It is up to the Government to .prevent that from printing what it now .prints. That is to say, it would be up .to a real government which was not itself being used as a Trojan horse by the Communists. To indicate to the committee the character of this newspaper I shall read some of the items that appeared on the front page of its issue of Sth July which, because copies of the newspaper are not airmailed to Canberra, is the last issue that I have available. Here is an example of what the Communists who produce this newspaper think of this government - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Federated Ironworkers&#39; Association was to-day fined &#163;1,000 by the Court. Jack McPhillips was sentenced to six months&#39; imprisonment and has been arrested. Ken McKeon, Sydney District Secretary of the Federated Ironworkers&#39; Union, was fined &#163;100. </para>
            <para>Other cases are proceeding against Union officials. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>Then, under the headline &#34; The Betrayers &#34;, the newspaper says - &#34;Labour&#34; Premier Chifley who went on strike in 1917 once said that he would never crucify &#39;the workers. Now he has embarked on the infinitely .more cruel course of attempting to starve them into submission. </para>
          <para>Evatt frequently prates of human rights, now lie is striking at the very foundation of all human rights - the right to eat. </para>
          <para class="block">That is the position in Darwin and I ask the Attorney-General, the Minister for the Interior, and the Government in general, what they are going to do about these Communists who are astride our road to Singapore. The Communists in Darwin are able to flit back and forth by air to Singapore, Timor and Djokjakarta and I ask the Minister to inform the committee of the identities of the men and women who fly so often back and forth between Australia and its neighbouring countries in the east. I ask that the Director-General of the Security Service, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Reed, be instructed to order that people who make these flights shall be very carefully watched. </para>

              <para>- 1 am glad that my representations are being heeded. The Communists in the Northern Territory are treason merchants who are definitely trying to get the multitudes of Indonesia into the Communist camp. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. &#34;</inline> Jock &#34; Garden started it, as I said before the suspension of the sitting. The Communist ideology is moving like wildfire in Indonesia. Now China has joined that amorphous mass under the encouragement of the Moscow pressure group. The influence of the Communists now stretches right across Europe and the Asian land mass into Malaya. There is not much of Malaya left that we can call British and the danger there is very serious, particularly when we recall what has happened in Burma. I shall now quote from a speech made at a Methodist Church gathering by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Usman,</inline> the Indonesian representative in Canberra, on the 20th August, 1947, to an audience of 1,500 people. This extract will give the committee some very interesting information :about what is happening in Indonesia.

            <para>.- The only parts of the Opposition&#39;s contribution to this debate which may be taken seriously were the speeches immediately following the resumption of the sitting that were made by the honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> and the honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen).</inline> The honorable member for Wentworth spoke of lengthy dossiers about public servants. Very good evidence of the keeping of dossiers was given to us this evening by the honorable member for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blain),</inline> who informed us that he had dossiers on 83 people in the Northern Territory, including 20 public servants. The honorable member for Wentworth regards the keeping of dossiers as very deplorable. I hope that the criteria on which the honorable member for Northern Territory has based his dossiers were a bit more scientific than those on which be based his argument in the speech that he has just concluded. The honorable member for Indi, taking his cue from those members of the Opposition who belong to the legal profession, attacked the system of conciliation as a device to undermine the system of arbitration. The legal members of the Opposition, have, on a number of occasions, gone further than that and have suggested that the qualifications for a conciliation commissioner should be those of law, that is to say, that they should be graduates in law. As the honorable member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beale)</inline> once put it, a legal training gave them the forensic ability that was necessary when they were adjudicating in arbitration and conciliation cases. </para>

              <para>- The suggestion that conciliation undermines the arbitration system was made more crudely by the honorable member for Indi, who, apparently, did not appreciate the refinements of the points made by the honorable member for Parramatta. I find the suggestion that conciliation undermines arbitration very interesting. It is quite clear that the founders of the Constitution clearly differentiated in section 51, sub-section (xxxv.), between conciliation and arbitration. They conceived them to be two distinct things. They conceded it to be necessary to have non-legal judgments in court cases. The honorable member for Indi was a Minister in a government that made several amendments to the original Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act, and in view of his performance to-night it is interesting to read section 25 of the original act of 1904, which founded this sacred system that, according to the Opposition, is only now being altered by a Labour government, which is laying hands on what was a purely legal court and putting in these hobbledehoys who are not lawyers. The act of 1904 was amended in 1910, 1911, 1926, 1930 and 1934, and also on other occasions and right up into a period when the honorable member for Indi was a Minister. Section 25 of the original act reads - </para>

              <para>- A decision of a conciliation commissioner does not concern anything fundamental such as the basic wage. The commissioners make decisions on what one might call minor industrial problems that arise in the course of industry and that, in view of the number and type of disputes requiring adjudication, would be quite clearly beyond the ability of courts consisting of highly trained lawyers to handle, because of the time involved in hearing them. </para>

              <para>- After all, the Commonwealth Arbitration Court is involved in many complicated legal technicalities. For instance, the question of the exact limits of the jurisdiction of State arbitration courts and of the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court has at times been a very difficult problem. Honorable gentlemen opposite are quite right, however, in assuming that there is a general objection in the industrial movement and in the Labour party to lawyers appearing in arbitration courts. There was a reversal of form quite recently by the Labour Government in Western Australia, in connexion with the Public Service in that State. It decided that teachers who were appealing against the appointment of other teachers&#39; to higher positions should have the right to legal representation, and that the adjudicating body should be not just a Public Service appeals board, but a much more formal instrumentality. Then the beanfeast for lawyers began ! When some teachers put in their appeals in .October, just after the relevant act had been passed, the standard fee for legal representation was &#163;5. A great many of these appeals began to be heard and the lawyers realized that here was a field from which revenue could be obtained. Within a month the standard fee was &#163;10. Then, over the Christmas holidays, realizing that a large number of appointments would be made in February, which would be the subject of appeals, the lawyers of Perth got together and the standard fee became &#163;25. The result was that a member of the teaching profession who wished to appeal against the appointment of another member to a position had to pay &#163;25 to get legal representation, and if the case lasted very long he had to pay out a bit more. There are some Ministers in this Government who have had a great deal of experience in conducting union cases before the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, when legal representation was almost essential. Unions had to face paying fees of &#163;100 a day plus refreshers of &#163;90 a day- </para>

              <para>- The expense of justice as administered by lawyers and as advanced by lawyers, have been impressed rather forcibly on the minds of a great many people, and I have no doubt that although the teachers union of Western Australia is an extremely respectable union, and has not had anything to do with the Labour party, it will come round very sharply to the viewpoint that there is perhaps a very wide field of arbitration in which it is possible to have- a court that shall act according to equity, good conscience and the substantial merits of the case, without regard to technicalities or legal forms, and shall not be bound by any rules of evidence, but may inform its mind on any matter in such manner as it thinks just. </para>

          <para>The honorable member for Indi quoted the occupations of conciliation commissioners. He approved of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blackburn,</inline> who was a lawyer, as a very good conciliation commissioner. He said that he thought that the others were not so good. Of course, his argument was useless because we did not submit any evidence of incompetent jurisdiction by even one commissioner. We gathered that he regarded the previous positions that some of the appointees had held as rather amusing, and he thought apparently that if a man had been a trade union secretary, a position in which he would necessarily have become well versed in arbitration procedure over a number of years, he would be unfit to be a conciliation commissioner. The honorable member was unable to produce a shred of evidence to substantiate the charges he made against any of the individuals he named. He spoke of them as being former, party politicians. I do not make any complaint about that. If honorable members read through <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> they will find, that when the Labour party was in Opposition, Labour members had a good deal to say about political appointments that had been made by the government of the day, both to the Arbitration Court, to which the former Liberal senator, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Drake-Brockman,</inline> was appointed, and to the High Court to which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Latham, who was Leader of the Opposition during the regime of the Scullin Government, was appointed Chief Justice.

              <para>- The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> may be quite correct. The point I made was that the honorable member for Indi had characterized a certain gentleman, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hamilton</inline> Knight, as having been a member of the Labour party, and had suggested that hi3 membership of that party should have disqualified him from selection for appointment as a conciliation commissioner. The analogy between his position and that of Chief Judge DrakeBrockman and the Chief Justice of the High Court is that they had all been members of political parties. If I have made a misstatement of the actual circumstances of the appointment to the High Court of the Chief Justice I regret it. The point made by the honorable member for Indi in, relation to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hamilton</inline> Knight is the pertinent point in this argumeut.  I have not heard it suggested by any responsible person that the Chief Justice of the High Court is any worse a judge because of the fact that he has had (political experience. I do not think that the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hamilton</inline> Knight had practical experience in the Government of New South Wales should disqualify him for appointment as a conciliation commissioner. The honorable member for Indi made a most unworthy speech. He suggested that there was an intention on the part of the Government to undermine arbitration, and he clearly implied that the appointment of these fifteen conciliation commissioners was an instance of how arbitration was being undermined. If that were so, all these gentlemen would be contemptible instruments. The honorable member said that the Communists are trying to bring arbitration into contempt. There is no question about that. The only persons who publicly suggest that conciliation commissioners are the means by which this Government is trying to undermine arbitration are persons who themselves are attempting to bring the system of arbitration into contempt. In trying to score this point the honorable member was attempting to score very unworthily. I doubt whether the country will take very seriously the objection which he has raised to these appointments, especially when it is not backed up by evidence of poor jurisdiction on their part. </para>

          <para>The speech made by the honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> on the subject of security was extremely interesting. He complained that dossiers had been prepared on certain civil servants, but he did not inform us of the character of those dossiers, nor did he say whether the civil servants concerned were suspect. He spoke of the compilation of the dossiers as a terrible thing. The honorable gentleman is most vocal in this Parliament on the subject of the employment of Communists in the Public Service. He has asked questions on many occasions about their employment in the Postal Department, which he rightly described as a key communication service. How is it to he known whether or not Communists are employed in the Postal Department if nobody is to inquire about these things or exercise any supervision over public servants? When he sees evidence that there is some surveillance of a section of the Public Service, he speaks of it as deplorable. There is no consistency about the honorable member. He opposes simply for the sake of opposition. While he claims that there is need for surveillance, when he sees evidence of it, he deplores it. Hia claims to knowledge of what goes on in foreign embassies and in the most secret sections of our Security Service will not be taken very seriously. The Estimates for the security and investigation services of the Commonwealth seem to be very inadequate. That only &#163;115,000, plus an additional amount for the service under the control of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Reed. has been provided appears to suggest that we are the most modest spenders on security in the world. Most countries expend very large sums on their security services. I do not suggest that we need to provide larger amounts for this purpose, but I do suggest that the votes are not excessive and that they should not be queried on that ground. </para>
          <para>I thank the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> for his explanation of the position in regard to patents. The statement which he made regarding the difficulty in getting technical officers to examine claims for the patenting of processes seems to be unanswerable, and appears to confirm the fear on the part of some engineers who have submitted claims that their qualifications are superior to those of some of the officers who deal with their claims. I suppose that that is inevitable in these days when technicians can obtain better salaries outside the Public Service. I trust that a revision of salaries in the Patent Office will be made so that the important business of dealing with patent applications may be expided. </para>

            <para>. - The honorable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beazley),</inline> who has just resumed his seat, made so many misrepresentations and so distorted the views of honorable members on this side of the chamber that I do not propose to waste my time by replying to him. Everything possible should he done to improve the system of conciliation and arbitration in this country so that the prospects of peace in industry may be enhanced. It has been said by an honorable member opposite that in 1929 I joined other honorable members now on this side of the chamber in voting for the abolition of arbitration. Nothing could be further from the truth. I assure honorable members that what I then did I did in company with honorable members of all the political parties that were represented in this Parliament. Up to that time unsuccessful attempts had been made on four occasions to induce the people to clothe the Commonwealth with full authority in industrial matters, but on each occasion the people rejected the proposal. Only three alternatives were then open to the government of the day. First, it could have held another referendum of the people, at a cost of approximately &#163;100,000; secondly, it could have asked the States to exercise full authority in industrial matters; and thirdly, it could have asked the States to hand over to the Commonwealth full powers over industry. The Bruce-Page Government, which was then in office, decided to adopt the third alternative, but the States rejected the proposal. The Government thereupon introduced a bill into the Parliament which was designed to hand over to the States full authority to deal with all arbitration matters. Had that bill been passed it would have affected no fewer than 29 awards in my own State. </para>

              <para>- I wholeheartedly support the system of conciliation and arbitration. If, in fact, I had opposed the continuance of arbitration in 1929, I should oppose it to-day. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Temporary Chairman,</inline> may get out of that one, if you can. I go further and say that I would support an extension of the arbitration system if by that means we could ensure peace in industry. The most that the Opposition can do is to press for an amendment of the law to provide for the holding of compulsory secret ballots before a strike may be declared. Let the free men in this free democracy express themselves and not be dictated to by the agents of a foreign power. Those saboteurs are determined to cause industrial turmoil and delay the housing programme. </para>

            <para>.- The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt),</inline> in his reply to the debate, either omitted or neglected to make any reference to three of the four matters which I raised this afternoon. If the right honorable gentleman speaks again, perhaps he will find an opportunity to deal with those points, should he consider that they are of sufficient consequence to warrant a reply. However, I return to one of the four matters that I mentioned earlier because I feel that although the Attorney-General may have made a genuine and sincere attempt to give information on it, there are various phases of it that shall require clarification. I make it clear, at the outset, that I am trying to treat this matter as objectively and as factually as I can. The Commonwealth police force is primarily and almost entirely a secret police force. We see only a few officers in uniform in the precincts of the Parliament, at aerodromes and in some public places. A large majority of the members of the police forces of the States are in uniform and in full view of the public. Many of the leading officers are well known to the public generally. However, members of the police forces conducted by the Commonwealth are not known widely to the public or even to members of the Parliament and of the Public Service. I do not make that remark with any sinister intonation. The fact is, and I do not think that it will be denied, that the police forces of the Commonwealth are, in the main, secret bodies in the sense that personalities are not known, and that their activities are not widely &#39;known either to the Parliament or to the public. Therefore, it is all the more important that the administration of those police forces should be above suspicion, and that there should be no feeling, either in. the Parliament or among the people, that they are ever used improperly or for partisan political purposes by th&#38; Attorney-General, the Prime Minister, who apparently is now to administer the Security Service, or any other Minister. One point which I should like to clear up with the Attorney-General is the statement that he made that our police forces were conducted upon somewhat the same lines as the Federal Bureau of Investiga-tion in the United States of America. </para>

              <para>- Apparently the Attorney-General did refer to the Security Service, which is a new organization. The right honorable gentleman mentioned that the Department of Trade and Customs might require the services of an officer of the Commonwealth Investigation Service. As the result of the war-time expansion of departments and of the great increase of Commonwealth activities, many persons were appointed to police the operation of regulations. The Attorney-General may correct me on this matter if I am wrong, but I understand that by no means the greatest number of officers who have been appointed to police those regulations come under the right honorable gentleman&#39;s administration. From, my understanding of the position, I believe that almost every senior Minister in this Government has attached  to his department investigation officers who are not members of the Commonwealth Investigation Service, and who do not come under the general supervision of the Attorney-General. </para>

              <para>- Then I shall mention the departments which, according to my understanding of the position, have their own investigation officers who function under the general administration of their respective Ministers. The Department of Trade and Customs has its investigation officers. We were informed recently that some of those officials, apart from their ordinary duties, check from time to time incoming mail and parcels in collaboration with officers of the PostmasterGeneral&#39;s Department. The last-named department, I understand, has its own investigation officers. The Department of the Treasury has its investigation officers, many of whom are employed in the Taxation Branch. Not long ago the Department of Trade and Customs had special investigators to deal with problems of rents and prices control, and I should be interested to learn whether they have been withdrawn from those duties. I assume that they are carrying on investigation work either in the Department of Trade and Customs or in some other department. The Department of Immigration, I understand, employs investigation officers who inquire into the bona fides of immigrants and deal with other matters which come under the purview of the Minister for Immigration. Each of the three service departments maintains its intelligence service, although what those three intelligence services do in peace-time is somewhat of a mystery to me. </para>

          <para>I am not attempting to make the point that if those services exist they are being used improperly by the respective Ministers for political purposes or for any other purposes; but I say that, if this growth has occurred during the war and as the result of the expansion of departments, all those services should be brought under one central administration, which should be responsible to one Minister, and, through him, to the Parliament. If every senior Minister has his own team of investigation officers, the opportunity does exist, whether it is exercised improperly or not, for a Minister to assign to those officers tasks which should not normally be given to them and which could be designed to embarrass a political opponent or to take an improper advantage of a citizen. </para>

              <para>- We learnt recently of the methods of those investigators in relation to some war widows, who, it was alleged, had not been conducting themselves according to the standards that were approved by the department. I should like to know whether investigations of that kind are carried out by the Commonwealth Investigation Service or by officers who are answerable to the Minister for Repatriation and are employees of that department. Within the Department of Information, there are many men at the present time who were censors during the war. In that role, they naturally came into possession of a great deal of confidential information about people throughout the length and breadth of the Commonwealth. Many of them are still working with the Department of Information, and are carrying out research functions - to give the term a rather euphemistic turn - for the Minister for Information. If we line all of them up, we shall have quite a team of investigators of whom comparatively few are officers of the Comonwealth Investigation Service. Another group of officers, the peace officers, were formerly working for the Department of Munitions. Their functions were to safeguard munitions establishments which came under the general jurisdiction of that department. If nearly every Commonwealth department has its own team of investigators who are not answerable to any central administration or to the AttorneyGeneral, obviously honorable members&#39; do not get a true picture of these activities by merely examining the estimates for the Attorney-General&#39;s Department. What the Parliament and the people should be told, in order that they may have a realistic picture of how many investigators are employed by the Commonwealth, is the total amount that is expended on such services. I invite the Attorney-General to give us a complete and clear picture of the situation. I ask him whether my understanding of the position, that there are scattered throughout various departments a number of investigators, is correct. I should like the right honorable gentleman to tell us his own opinion about my suggestion for bringing all those activities under one administration. I think that he will agree that a system of the kind that I have described, if it exists, is capable of serious abuse. It would be in the interests of better government if there were one organization responsible to one Minister and answerable, through him, to the Parliament. In that way, we should have a check, but under existing conditions, these growths could take place and the Parliament and the people would not know anything about it. The day could come when we should find ourselves with a sinister network of investigation and inquiry that would represent an unwarranted and unreasonable intrusion into the private lives of the citizens. </para>

              <para>- That is so. The statement by the honorable member for Fremantle, as honorable members who are familiar with the facts know, is completely wrong. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons</inline> became Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives in 1930, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Latham became Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia in 1935. One has only .to mention the dates to demonstrate how absurd the allegation is. As a matter of fact, when <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Latham became Chief Justice of the High Court, I was Attorney-General, and I had the privilege of nominating him for appointment by the Lyons Government. Formerly he had himself been Attorney-General in that Government. It is interesting to recall that his appointment as Chief Justice of the High Court took place after I had become Attorney-General in succession  to him. I mentioned those dates because the honorable member for Fremantle should have them in mind before he makes charges like that again. As a matter of fact, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Latham was an  eminent lawyer. If to be a member of Parliament, or a Minister of the Crown, is to be a disqualification for judicial office, then <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Latham was disqualified; but if to be one of the few outstanding leaders of the bar, and a lawyer of great experience, is to be a qualification, then <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Latham had that qualification. All I need to do is to point out that he was appointed on my own nomination five years after <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons</inline> had become leader of the party in succession to him, and he was appointed entirely on his merits. I do not share the view that service in politics is a disqualification for appointment to the Bench. It would be absurd to say that a  lawyer of great knowledge and experience was disqualified for judicial office because he had the public spirit to serve the country in parliament. That would be fantastic. My only complaint, in so far <inline font-style="italic">as</inline> I have a complaint, is that service i.n the Parliament should not be regarded  as  a substitute for legal knowledge and experience. Assuming that a man has legal knowledge and experience, and the judicial mind and character, his experience in public affairs may be of great value to him, particularly in certain jurisdictions. </para>

          <para>Reference has been made to the conciliation commissioners. Apropos of them, I should like to say that I do not regard the fact that a man has been a member of Parliament, and therefore a party politician, as a disqualification for office as a conciliation commissioner. A person&#39;s suitability for such a post should be decided entirely upon an assessment of him as an individual. My own criticism of the system of conciliation  commissioners,  as established, is that it substitutes the conciliation commissioner for the judge. Under existing conditions a conciliation commissioner does not act as a conciliation commissioner, but as an arbitrator. He is himself the judge in the case. When the legislation under which the commissioners were appointed was before the Parliament, we on this side look the opportunity of saying that if it were proposed to wipe out the ordinary arbitral jurisdiction of the judges, and to set up fourteen or fifteen conciliation commissioners who would themselves be judges, it was a great error to leave the decisions of the commissioners without appeal or control. The commissioners might easily apply different principles to cases, and thus produce a series of anomalies of the kind that give rise to industrial dissatisfaction. Experience has supported that criticism. I think that arbitration court judges would say without hesitation that there ought to be some means of getting rid of such anomalies. </para>

              <para>- That is so. It would be undesirable to grant the right of appeal in every case, because that would string proceedings out to the crack of doom, but I do not know why there should not be an appeal by leave of the courts itself, such leave to be granted only when there was a matter of real importance to be decided. On some future suitable occasion, when this matter is under review, I shall seek to have the law amended alone those lines. </para>

          <para>The real point of the criticism of the conciliation commissioners is embodied in what I have just said. The majority of the commissioners were union secretaries. I am not quarrelling with that, as such. I have had, in my time - it was a fair number of years ago. I agree - a good deal of experience in industrial matters, and have had to do with union officials and  organizations  of  employers.  The commissioners are, no doubt, experienced men. They could be used effectively if their function was that of conciliation or getting the parties together: hut when their function becomes arbitration, so that they sit in final judgment between the union on one side and the employer on the other, honorable members should not be surprised if there are many people in Australia who feel that the decision of a union secretary in such a position is not necessarily an unbiased one. I am not making a personal attack on any of the commissioners. I am quite certain that they are all doing their best. I have no desire to criticize them or to attack them as men ; but it is undesirable, where people sit in final judgment - and there is no appeal from the decision of the commissioners - that we should have a3 final  adjudicat  rs men, the whole of whose training, zeal and loyalty, admirable as those qualities are, tend to bring their judgment down on one side rather than on the other. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Dr.. EVATT</inline>(Barton - AttorneyGeneral and Minister for External Affairs &#91;10.25&#93;. - The honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen)</inline> criticized the conconciliation commissioners on the ground that they had been associated with trade unions, and that one of them had actually, as a member of Parliament, supported the Labour party. The remarks of the honorable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beazley)</inline> were made in reply to that criticism. It is impossible to reconcile the criticism by the honorable member for Indi with the observations of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies).</inline> I think that every one on this side of the chamber will agree with what the Leader of the Opposition has just said. Indeed, I have said much the same things myself. I believe it to be true that experience of parliamentary life, or of the semi-public life of a trade union official, is an asset. A person may have loyalties, but when he is in a position where he must discharge judicial or quasi-judicial functions, he will be conscious of those loyalties and guard against them. The honorable member for Fremantle merely pointed out that in many instances persons otherwise qualified were appointed to judicial positions, notwithstanding the fact that they had been members of the Parliament, or even of the Executive. In my judgment, the fact that they have occupied such positions is a qualification, not a disqualification. I am able to accept everything that the Leader of the Opposition said on that point. But the right honorable gentleman then went on to criticize the conciliation system, and to say that there should he an appeal from the decision of the commissioners. He admitted, fairly enough, that if there were an appeal in every instance cases would go on to &#34; the crack of doom &#34;, as he put it. Of course they would. It was because of the delays arising from the hearing of industrial disputes the new system was introduced. It would be possible, of course, to have a system of by judges of the Arbitration Court that appeals limited as the Leader of the Opposition suggested; but the method followed has been to encourage consultation between the commissioners and the judges, and that method is working satisfactorily. It may be that the present system will have to be revised in the light of experience, but the commissioners are working well with the judges. Difficulties experienced at the commencement are being overcome, and everybody hopes that the system will be successful. </para>

              <para>- Possibly, but the honorable member mentioned only three or four departments out of a total of nineteen. Side by side with the system of internal investigation officers in certain departments, we have had a Commonwealth Investigation Service ever since it was established by the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> nearly 30 years ago. In that service there are officers who have become experts, particularly in enforcement proceedings. That does not mean that enforcement proceedings could not be taken without them, and it may be that the activities of such officers could in some instances be unified. The Public Service Board is now considering the desirability of unifying staffs where possible, but that would not be a help in some  departments. Immigration inquiries are not usually concerned with breaches of the law. </para>

          <para class="block">Where a breach of the law has been committed, the matter .is usually taken over by the investigation service of the Attorney-General&#39;s Department. I do not think there is any substance in the honorable member&#39;s point. It is true, of course, that in the Commonwealth of Australia police, officers are not usually in uniform; but that is only another way of saying that the ordinary enforcement of law and order in Australia, outside Commonwealth territories, where there are uniformed police forces, is a matter for the States. Commonwealth peace officers protect Commonwealth property, such as aerodromes, the service departments and the like. But there is no secrecy, in any sinister sense. There is simply, I submit, th normal procedure for detecting and dealing with breaches of the Commonwealth laws which are administered by one or another of the nineteen Commonwealth departments. If the Public Service Board takes up this point further, I have no doubt that the points raised will be considered. But there is no fear of any infringement of the rights of citizens. There must be a body of people to enforce the Commonwealth laws. I know that the honorable gentleman does not object to that. That sums up the position. I am obliged to honorable members who have made helpful suggestions about the administration of the department. </para>

              <para>- I remember what was said on that occasion. I did not advance any case for the exclusive appointment of lawyers as conciliation commissioners. What was said then and was repeated to-night by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> dealt with the importance of the Arbitration Court itself and th.i undesirability of enlarging the jurisdiction of the conciliation commissioners, as it was being enlarged by the Government in that amending legislation. I stressed the value of legal training and, in particular, of practical forensic experience as a way of getting at the truth and enabling people to see both sides of a question. That was all that I attempted to advance. I do not believe that there is any necessity or any case for confining appointment as conciliation commissioners to lawyers. .No argument could be advanced for that to be done. Some of the conciliation commissioners are lawyers. I think the Chief Conciliation Commissioner, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mooney,</inline> is a solicitor of some experience. Some of us have respect for the work that he has done. </para>

              <para>- Yes. The point I wish to make from that is that I am sure that some of his skill and ability is derived from his practical experience in the courts and in dealing with legal matters generally. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Commissioner</inline> Blackburn is, I believe, a trained lawyer, and I believe that his legal training has added to his qualifications and value as a conciliation commissioner. The point is that, after the passage of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, which created the present conciliation commissioner system, about sixteen conciliation commissioners - do not bind me to precise figures, for I may be one or two out - were appointed. I think one retired and one died and that both were replaced. It is a fact that almost all the original appointees were either trade union secretaries or were active participants in the Labour movement. My first comment, which was made at the time and is repeated now, is that the Government cannot tell me that the only  people who should be appointed as conciliation commissioners are  people  drawn from the Labour movement. I can well understand, as the Leader of the Opposition has said, that there is a case for the appointment of men of wide industrial experience, but why draw almost all of them from one side of industry? We submitted that point when the bill was being discussed. We said at the time, and I say again, that the inference to be drawn that the Government was concerned in getting into the job men who would have, by their training and experience, bias in one direction. I think experience in several cases, although not for what was said by Government supporters at that time was in all, has wholly borne that out. </para>

              <para>- I agree. The High Court has restrained him, and he is trying to get round the injunction. We have taken out a second injunction. I mention tha t only in passing. Experience has shown that several of the conciliation commissioners are biased. I do not say that they are wickedly or deliberately biased. But men drawn from a particular field, with a limited background, cannot avoid bias. The Government should have picked people from various fields. The matter need not be considered only in the light of what the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender)</inline> and I, or other lawyers with experience, may say. Information may be obtained from parties who have appeared before many of the conciliation commissioners. If one reads the journals issued by the various federations and associations in the last couple of years one sees complaint after complaint about some of the conciliation commissioners. One may say, well enough, that some of these complaints are biased and express the employers&#39; point of view; but where there is smoke there is fire, and when one has complaint after complaint one must conclude that there is some substance in the complaints. Experience has shown that some of these commissioners are incapable of approaching, in a truly impartial spirit, the problems that they have been asked to solve. That brings us to the point that we made last year and that was well made again to-night by the Leader of the Opposition, that it was wrong to give to the conciliation commissioners the enormous jurisdiction that they have without any right to appeal, because as honorable members know, apart from hours of work, rates of pay and rates of pay for females, everything is now decided by conciliation commissioners. It was because of that that the Chief Judge of the Arbitration Court recently made the criticism that he did make of the present system. Chief Conciliation Commissioner Mooney made a similar criticism. Honorable members will not say that those criticisms were biased. They were made because experience has shown that the system does not work satisfactorily. </para>

On Thursday of last week, at question time, I asked the Prime Minister - whether it is a fact, as reported, that the Australian Government has hypothecated to its own use an amount of petrol per annum equal to approximately GO per cent, of the supply that was available under the recently terminated .rationing scheme to the whole State of Tasmania? </para>

          <quote>
            <para>I infer from the honorable gentleman&#39;s question that he suggests that the Australian Government should become the sole importer of and trader in petrol. In other words, he considers that the Government should completely socialise the petrol industry. If that is so, I should be glad if he would advise the public accordingly. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Any one can see that the inference taken by the Prime Minister was quite incorrect, and I regret to say that I am convinced that he knew, when he gave the answer, that I was not suggesting by my question that the Australian Government should socialise the petrol industry. The Prime Minister did not want to give a straight answer to a straight question and he framed his reply in a way that was gauged to gain some paltry political advantage. Every one in this House knows that I am totally opposed to socialism and to the lack of enterprise and production that are always associated with it. All I ask is that I be given a reasonable answer to a straight question. What are the facts? The High Court of Australia ruled that petrol rationing was invalid. Then the coal strike increased the requirements of petrol beyond the normal amount. Private consumers and businessmen found it difficult to secure adequate petrol, because the Government did not see fit to allow more petrol to be brought into the country to offset the greater demand. Government vehicles, however, appeared to be abundantly supplied. The Prime Minister stated that no provision had been made to assure the supply of petrol available in Australia to the Government, so the logical question was: Is the Government hoarding petrol ? Petrol hoarding is a procedure that the Prime Minister has condemned. Instead of answering this question the right honorable gentleman endeavoured to twist it and suggested that I favoured socialization of the petrol industry. Consequent upon the suggestion in my first question that the Australian Government had reserved for its own use an amount of petrol equal to approximately 60 per cent. of the recent ration allocation to the whole of Tasmania, I have ascertained that the yearly allocation for Tasmania under the recent rationing system was 14,300,000 gallons, and that the amount used by the Australian Government and its departments for the same period was 8,400,000 gallons,&#39; which is approximately 60 per cent. of the total supply available to Tasmania. </para>

Every opportunity has been given to the organization concerned to comply with the law without recourse to prosecutions and in future, if any organization, whether of employees or of employers, continues to fail to comply with the Industrial Registrar&#39;s demand within a reasonable time, the Industrial Registrar will have no alternative but to institute proceedings. </para>

          <para>The number of sitting days of each Conciliation Commissioner during the period from the 1st June, to the 31st August, 1949, inclusive, is set out in the schedule hereto. The number of sitting days is not a true index of the amount of work performed by a conciliation commissioner. A considerable amount of time is expended by conciliation commissioners in inspections and informal consultations and, after hearings, in studying the transcript of evidence and in drawing up awards or orders. In addition, conciliation commissioners are assigned to industries or groups of industries throughout the Commonwealth and are thus compelled to expend much time in travelling. </para>

            <para>- On the 27th September, the honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lang)</inline> asked me questions regarding Marx House and I indicated I would let him have what information I could on the subject. I have now ascertained that the building known as Marx House is being purchased as a long-term investment by the Coal Mines Insurance Proprietary Limited, for the sum of &#163;50,000 from Messrs. C. H. Campbell and R. J. Gottliebsen. Coal Mines Insurance Proprietary Limited is a registered company, shares being held by the Joint Coal Board. Resumption facilities, of course, are not available to the company. The company obtained its own valuation before signing the contract for purchase and is not aware of the amount of any profit made by the vendors. The ValuerGeneral has not yet made a valuation of the City of Sydney and has not visited the property for the purpose of a valuation. The purchase is being effected by the company under its own powers and the prior approval of the Commonwealth or State governments is not necessary. The Joint Coal Board will not occupy the premises, but the contract involves vacant possession and that fact will materially assist the board in securing suitable accommodation in Sydney. </para>

        <para>I now furnish hereunder the following replies to the questions asked :  - </para>
        <list type="decimal-dotted">
          <item label="1.">
            <para>Formation flying is not regarded by the Air Staff as an extremely dangerous exercise because of the risk of collision. Formation &#34; take-offs &#34; with twin or multi-engined aircraft, however, can be dangerous because of the risk of engine failure, which would cause the aircraft in which the failure occurred to swing across the paths of other aircraft. For this reason formation &#34;take-offs&#34; in twin and multi-engined aircraft are forbidden. There is a safety distance laid down for pupil pilots and this distance is two wing spans, whilst, at the same time, the pilot must fly in a position in which he can see all other aircraft in the formation. The distance laid down for qualified pilots is half a span for fighter aircraft. According to Air Staff advices, flying in formation at night is not difficult provided navigation lights are used, or provided the night is clear. Formation flying in cloud is again not unduly hazardous and is, in fact, an operational necessity. The press report that the Mustangs at Canberra collided as the formation was emerging from cloud is quite incorrect, as the formation was never in cloud at any time. In fact, it is authoritatively reported that there was no cloud whatever at the height at which the aircraft were flying. </para>
          </item>
          <item label="2.">
            <para>Formation flying is not obsolete for operational or other purposes. Precision bombing by day, particularly in the face of enemy fighter opposition, demands formation flying, firstly for mutual support against attack by enemy fighters, and secondly to ensure a concentration of bombs on the target. Fighter aircraft always fly in formation, and so far as can be seen at the present time, will, in any future war, continue to fly in formation so that aircraft can mutually support each other, and,  more  important, to ensure that effective control can be exercised at all timet by the Squadron or Wing Leader. In general. Air Staff has  advised  that formation flying was, is, and must, continue to be employed when moving aircraft from point to point to ensure effective control by the Squadron  or  Wing Leader as well as for the efficient and expeditious movement  of  the aircraft. </para>
          </item>
          <item label="3.">
            <para>In  view  of the replies to questions 1 and 2, the question of issuing an order prohibiting formation flying does not arise. With regard to the automatic ejector type seat, that fitment has only become necessary because of the impossibility of the pilot getting out of the latest types of jet propelled aircraft which fly at  speeds  in excess of those attained by orthodox aircraft. Experience has shown that escape can be made from the orthodox type of aircraft under practically all conditions. In all aircraft escape hatches are provided for this purpose and are capable of extremely rapid operation. In the Mustang the canopy can instantly be jettisoned by pulling an escape lever, and in this particular instance, the pilot did, in fact, jettison his canopy, and did leave the aircraft. Unfortunately, the canopy of the parachute became caught on the tail-plane of the aircraft. </para>
          </item>
          <item label="4.">
            <para>In operational aircraft, ammunition is normally carried because, without it, the aircraft would &#34;handle&#34; very differently, and the pilot would be given an entirely wrong impression of the &#34; handling &#34; characteristics and general capabilities of  Mb  aircraft. For example, the weight of ammunition carried in a Mustang is 620 pounds, and bearing in mind that this weight is carried in the wings of the aircraft, it will be appreciated that, if that weight were not carried, the aircraft would. &#34;handle&#34; and perform very differently. The inference in this question is that it may not he possible for the crew of a burning aircraft to be rescued because of exploding ammunition preventing a near approach by rescuers. In this regard, it can bo stated that ammunition will not commence to explode until a fire has been burning for an appreciable time by which the occupants of the crashed aircraft would either have been rescued, or would be beyond aid, In the particular case under reference, Air Staff has advised that the pilot&#39;s body was lying well clear of the aircraft, and assistance to him was in no way retarded or endangered by the exploding ammunition. </para>

        </interjection>
        <quote>
          <para>The Political Broadcasts (Federal Elections) Order was made by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board in pursuance of an obligation imposed on it by section 6k of the Australian Broadcasting Act to ensure equitable facilities for the broadcasting of political matter. </para>
          <para>The board realized that this particular legislation was of a novel character and, in the course of its deliberations on the subject, it was confronted with great difficulties in determining what would constitute equitable facilities in the political field as it exists in Australia to-day. </para>
          <para>Consequently, before deciding to make an order covering the broadcasting of political matter during the forthcoming federal election campaign, the board carefully examined the practices adopted in other English-speaking democracies and those which had been recommended unanimously by all-party committees of the Federal Parliament for adoption in Australia. </para>
          <para>The order which the board made incorporated principles which are substantially comparable with those followed by the English-speaking democracies, notably Great Britain, the United States and Canada and arc in substantial conformity with the recommendations of the Gibson Committee and the first report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Broadcasting. Nevertheless, it would seem from the discussion which took place in the Parliament last week that, notwithstanding the relevant provisions of the act, it is not the desire of the Parliament, which has power to disallow any order of the board, that these conditions should be applied to the broadcasting of political matter prior to the forthcoming federal election. </para>
          <para>The board has therefore decided to repeal paragraphs 4, 5 and 7 of the order. The remaining provisions will require the licensees of commercial broadcasting stations to refrain from discriminating between parties and candidates in respect of charges, and to submit returns to the board. These returns will enable the board to place before the Parliament a complete report on all aspects of election broadcasts so that the whole matter may be reconsidered in the light of the information available. </para>
