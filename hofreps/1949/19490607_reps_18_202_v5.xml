The remark was a gross reflection on the Chair as well as on a vote of the House. If the right honorable member withdraws the statement I shall leave it at that. Will the right honorable gentleman withdraw the statement, if he made it, and apologize ? </para>

                        <para>- Order ! The censure motion has no relation to the particular matter which the right honorable gentleman has mentioned. The Chair rules that his remark is a reflection upon the vote of the House. The Standing Orders provide that an honorable member must not reflect upon any vote of the House, and, therefore, I ask the right honorable gentleman to withdraw the statement, and apologize. </para>

He is also stated to have agreed with the deputation that petrol rationing should now be abandoned, but as New Zealand had agreed to comply with the request of the British Oil Trade Advisory Committee to continue rationing, he would now seek to have New Zealand released from that agreement. </para>

I hope that the House will not place upon the Chair the responsibility of preventing honorable members from referring to quotations or statements that other honorable members have made in their speeches in a previous discussion, because honorable members adopt that practice in the House, and quote from notes that they have taken of other speeches in the chamber. It is not permissible to quote from the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> "flats". It is obvious that the Minister has not a copy of the " flats " with him and that he is quoting from detailed notes that he has made. The Minister is in order, and I ask him to continue his answer. </para>

                        <para>The statement quoted as alleged to have been made by me is incorrect because I have not received a deputation of motoring interests seeking abolition of petrol rationing. Not having received a deputation, I could not have stated to them that dollars were no longer the reason for the continuation of rationing. To the contrary, I have, whenever necessary, emphasized that so long as the full requirements of petrol in the sterling area are not available from the sterling area, then any increased usage in New Zealand would entail the use of dollars. There is no record of any request from the British Oil Trade Advisory Committee to New Zealand. An organization so named is not known here. If there has been no request, we could not seek release from an agreement. Rationing in New Zealand has been maintained at the request of the United Kingdom Government which has affirmed that, under existing conditions, the saving of petrol saves dollars. The Minister of Industries and Commerce (Mr. Nordmeyer) is in charge of rationing and he advises roe that he has made no such statements as referred to. Personally. I am satisfied that the need for conservation of dollars is so urgent and immediate that New Zealand will continue to ensure the minimum resource to purchases or other commitments that will entail their use. </para>

Was the consumption of petrol in Australia prior to the cessation of petrol rationing on the basis of 33,000,000 gallons a month? Is it a fact, as alleged by the Australian Automobile Association, that with the cessation of rationing an increase of usage of between 2,000,000 and 3,000,000 gallons a month may be anticipated? Is that amount approximately from 5 per cent, to 10 per cent, of the gallonage used during rationing? Has the Government formed any estimate of the likely increase in petrol consumption in the event of rationing not being re-imposed by the States? </para>

                            <para>- Estimates have been given by a number of people, with what knowledge or authority I do not know. Certain figures were quoted recently by the Leader of the Australian Country party which were said to have been supplied by a former official of the Liquid Fuel Control Board. I have also seen estimates made by certain officials of motoring organizations. Naturally I do not take much notice of estimates made by people who are not in a position to make any precise judgment of the matter. In fact, I do not know that anybody i3 in a position to make a precise judgment of it. I dealt with this subject at some length recently when the House was good enough to permit me to read a statement about it. I shall supply to him a copy of that statement, which indicates the estimate made of the possible increase in the use of petrol as a result of the abolition of rationing if, at the same time, import licensing were abolished and all the petrol available were allowed to enter Australia. I shall let the honorable member have a copy of that statement, although I do not know whether he will read it or not. </para>

                            <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline> - Last week, the Leader of the Australian Country party, Mr. Fadden, made a powerful, reasoned, statement on petrol rationing which involved, of course, an examination of prospective imports of petroleum products into this country. The Prime Minister (Mr. Chifley) replied. Indeed, the right honorable gentleman has made two or three statements on this matter. He has told the House that the reason for the continuance of rationing is the shortage of dollars and the dollar obligations that might arise from increased petrol purchases. After his last statement, the right honorable gentleman offered to show certain figures to me in confidence. Although I appreciate that offer, I have not availed myself of it, because I do not care to be the recipient of confidential information on a matter that has become of such widespread interest and importance. Since the statements of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Australian Country party were made - they attracted, quite properly, a great deal of interest throughout the community - the High Court has delivered a judgment, in the course of which, I gather from the press, it has by a unanimous decision found that petrol rationing by the Commonwealth under the National Security Regulations is no longer valid. That is not a matter, I pause to remark, which is affected by any referendum, because the referendums of 1946 and 1947 had no relation to the problem. In other words, petrol rationing by the Commonwealth has throughout been a matter which must some day come to an end when the defence power ceased to support it. Now the High Court has unanimously found that the defence power can no longer support petrol rationing, and so it has come to an end. I have observed also in the press that the Prime Minister has communicated with the Premiers of the States and invited them to replace the Commonwealth rationing, now invalid, with State rationing, which, it is suggested, might be valid. I point out to the Prime Minister that it is unreasonable to suppose that any State Premier or Government will undertake the business of establishing a rationing scheme for petrol without being informed by the Prime Minister of the facts which, in his view, sharply to be distinguished from the cogent arguments advanced by the Leader of the Australian Country party, make the continuance of rationing and other controls desirable. I cannot suppose for one moment that a State Premier or Government will enter upon this disputable ground without having possession of facts adequate to support such action. Therefore, I have assumed that the Prime Minister proposes to put before the State Premiers facts which so far have not been put before this House. I point out to him that it is unreasonable that every member of the National Parliament should be denied information on this subject, which, as far as I can judge, must be given to State administrations if they are to take over the problem from the Commonwealth. If this were a matter of security, nobody in the House would discuss it. But there is no hint of any question of security. It is quite true that the economic security of Great Britain and other non-dollar countries is very much involved, and we all appreciate that. The Leader of the Australian Country party and I are completely at one with the Government in our desire to co-operate with Great Britain. No question of challenging that has ever arisen. But surely there can be no good reason why we should not be told in this House what the position is in relation to dollars, what particular transactions in relation to petrol from sterling areas are involved, and what effect those transactions would have upon the overall dollar position or the dollar position of Great Britain or Australia. Until we are put in possession of those facts, I greatly fear that this problem will be discussed by many people in the light of prejudice. It ought not to be discussed in the light of anything less than real knowledge. As the Prime Minister knows, the cancellation of Commonwealth petrol rationing at once produces a reaction in the public mind. People begin to form certain views about it. The Prime Minister's reaction has been to say to the States, " Now, you go ahead and take over this job I emphasize that the right honorable gentleman cannot reasonably ask a State to do that unless he gives it the case in support of rationing and that means all the figures. We have not had all the figures. We have had statements but the closest examination of figures that we have had in this House was the one submitted by the Leader of the Australian Country party. We have had from the Prime Minister a sort of blanket answer, "Well, it cannot be done because of dollars". If that is not a mere phrase, but means exactly what it says, the reason must be that there are the factors in the international balance of payments which render that conclusion necessary. We in this House will not be satisfied on this matter until we are informed of those facts. No State Government could reasonably be supposed to be willing to undertake this task unless it has the facts. Neither can the Australian public be expected to accept, either from a State or the Commonwealth, a continuation of shortages unless, it is put in possession of the facts. So far there has been no real reason advanced in this House why the facts, if and as they exist, should not be made known. This problem is not merely a problem of movement across this table but it is one which concerns millions of people in Australia. It ought to be settled on a sensible basis. The only facts that the people have been given so far are those that were put forward by the Leader  of  the Australian Country party to the limit of the resources available to him. There is no reason why the facts available to the Prime Minister should be secret facts. They should be made known. </para>

                            I had prepared a statement on the subject of petrol rationing which has been raised by the Leader of the Opposition
                            (Mr. Menzies).
                            A unanimous decision of the High  Court  delivered yesterday has ruled the National Security (Liquid Fuel) Regulations to be invalid. The High  Court  was not, of course, called upon to express any view on the relationship of petrol rationing to the sterling area dollar problem or on the necessity for limiting consumption of petrol in order to save dollars. The issue before the court was to determine whether the control of internal distribution of liquid fuel under the National Security (Liquid Fuel) Regulations represented a legitimate exercise of the Commonwealth's defence power. In setting out the reasons for the judgment invalidating the National Security  (Liquid Fuel) Regulations, the High Court made the following comment: -
                        </para>
                        <quote>
                            <para>The invalidation of these regulations will not reduce the power of the Commonwealth Government to co-operate with the Government of the United Kingdom in relation to problems arising from the dollar shortage. The Commonwealth Parliament by suitable legislation and the Commonwealth by administrative action can completely control imports into Australia. The power of the Commonwealth enables it to determine bow many dollars can be spent from Australia in buying either liquid fuel or other imported commodities. Federal control of dollar expenditure is not in question . . . The distribution and use and price of petrol within Australia can be controlled under State legislation. </para>
                        </quote>
                        <para>The High Court judgment does not affect in any way the general financial situation which has made it necessary to limit the consumption of petrol and other petroleum products in Australia. I dealt with this situation in considerable detail in the statement that I made in the House on the 25th May and do not propose to repeat the details now. In the course of his personal message to which I referred in the House on the 25th of last month, the United Kingdom Chancellor of the Exchequer said quite categorically - and I quote his own words - </para>
                        <quote>
                            <para>Immediate increases in the consumption of oil generally in the sterling area are bound to lead to an increased dollar drain on  the  sterling area reserves . . . While a large expansion programme for sterling oil is proceeding, this will not bear fruit for a considerable time. In the meantime, I should be grateful for your co-operation in ensuring that petrol is not increasingly used for less essential purposes. </para>
                        </quote>
                        <para>I am satisfied that at the present, and for some considerable time to come, it will continue to be necessary to exercise economy in the consumption of petrol and other petroleum products in order to avoid a further drain on the central gold and dollar reserves of the sterling area. It is the firm policy of the Government to co-operate to the fullest possible extent with the United Kingdom Government in the measures which are necessary to meet the sterling area dollar shortage. There is no question of any challenge to the Commonwealth's power to control imports of petrol and other petroleum products. It i9 clear, however, that chaotic conditions could develop rapidly if no effective system of rationing is provided by the State governments to take the place of the Commonwealth rationing scheme which has now been declared invalid by the High Court. Accordingly I sent a telegram last night to each of the six State Premiers in the following terms: - </para>
                        <quote>
                            <para>As a result of High Court decision announced to-day petrol rationing by the Commonwealth Government is no longer effective. To meet the extra demand for oil products generally, which is likely to result from this decision, would undoubtedly require a considerable increase in imports. However, despite recent  reports to  the contrary, any additional oil consumption by Australia would add to the net dollar cost of oil supplied to countries of the sterling area. The present acute dollar shortage, and. our obligation to the United Kingdom to playour part, as a member of the sterling area, inkeeping dollar expenditure to a minimum,, necessitates the continued limitation of oil imports to about the present level. In myview, therefore, it is most important that the States should immediately consider  instituting  an effective system of petrol rationing as soon? as possible, otherwise chaotic conditions emnid! develop rapidly. The constitutional position is such that this matter can now be dealt with only by the States. I should be glad if you would give this question immediate, consideration and advise me of your views. </para>
                            <para>A meeting of representatives of the Commonwealth Government and the oil companies has been called in Melbournt for to-morrow afternoon to consider the situation. </para>
                        </quote>
                        <para>I hope that another meeting will he held to-morrow morning. I am quite sure there are many people in this country, particularly those with vested interests and the spokesmen of vested interests, who do not realize how critical is the position with relation to dollars, and the necessity for the continued limitation of oil imports to about the present level. I point out that when a dollar deficit has to be met, it is not our own dollars we use, but it is the dollar reserve of the United Kingdom Government. </para>
                        <para>I shall make a further statement to the House as soon as the position has been clarified with the State Premiers and the oil companies. In the meantime I make a strong appeal to all users of petrol and other petroleum products not to buy greater quantities than those to which they would have been entitled had the Commonwealth rationing scheme remained in operation. Companies and retailers engaged in the distribution of petrol and other petroleum products will be acting in their own interests as well as in the interests of the community at large if they confine sales to normal quantities and continue to ration available supplies as equitably as possible. As I intimated to the Leader of the Opposition the other day, the information supplied to me confidentially by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer was based on figures prepared by the Bank of England, which controls foreign exchange. Therefore, it would not be reasonable to doubt such information. If it were desired to disprove those figures it would be necessary to analyse the trading of every country dealing in petrol and also the sterling and dollar cross-payments, and to study the private affairs of various companies. Banks always endeavour to avoid disclosing the affairs of their clients, and I follow a similar policy in respect of private companies. The Leader of the Australian Country party stated last week that I had received an  offer  of petrol from a new oil company at 10.30 p.m. one day, and was able to make an involved prepared statement to the House at 4 o'clock on the following day on that subject. The right honorable gentleman used those times as the basis for a conclusion that I had not made a sufficiently detailed verification or investigation of that offer. However, the position was that I knew the name and the exact ownership of the company, so that when I received the letter, I knew the firms that the company represented. </para>
                        <para>I did not intend originally to make this statement to the House. I proposed to issue it to the press, because I know that the House does not like long state.ments. I assure the Leader of the Opposition that I realize the difficulties which are associated with the point that he has raised. Last week, I said that it would suit me nicely to be able to disclose all the detailed figures. I should do that with the greatest pleasure, because I agree with the comment by the right honorable gentleman that a few figures are more informative to the public than general statements on a particular subject. Therefore, I should like to be able to release the precise figures computed by the Bank of England and supplied to me by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. However, the public does not want detailed statements about crosspurchase actions, particularly in relation to the European recovery plan, which if also involved in this matter. What 3 have done is to intimate to the Chancellor of the Exchequer that, in view of the decision of the High Court yesterday, this Government is not in a position, by means of local rationing, to keep down the consumption of petrol. However, the High Court has made it perfectly clear that the Commonwealth's power to control imports is not questioned, and, therefore, the quota of petrol that is admitted to this country can be, and will be, controlled by the Government under the provisions of the Constitution. But the Government is anxious to ensure a fair distribution of petrol within Australia. I informed the Chancellor of the Exchequer that I had asked the State governments to consider taking control of petrol rationing. I said almost precisely what the right honorable gentleman has stated. I think that the States would hardly agree to institute rationing unless they were in possession of the relevant figures. I certainly feel that in order to convince the State Premiers, that is, if they can be convinced, I must give them those figures confidentially. Naturally, I do not disclose information that has been given to me confidentially, although very often I should like to be in a position to do so. It would be politically advantageous for me if I could publish information that has been given to me confidentially about certain matters. However, one cannot break a confidence, and continue to enjoy the confidence of other countries. This morning, J spoke to the Premier of New South Wales, Mr. McGirr, and intimated to him that if that State were prepared to carry on petrol rationing, the Commonwealth would meet the cost. A similar intimation will be conveyed to the other State Premiers. Petrol rationing is carried on principally by State officers, and only a small percentage of Commonwealth employees are engaged in it. I require the permission of the Chancellor of the Exchequer to make available the relevant figures to the States if they desire some proof about the need for continuing petrol rationing and are not prepared to take our word on the matter. I should also like to ascertain from the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether those figures may be released to the public of this country. I assume that the Bank of England and the other authorities to whom I have referred, know their business, and I believe that a two-line statement of the position 19 sufficient to knock the bottom out of the argument advanced by the representatives of vested interests. </para>

Some people have adopted the practice of going to the United Kingdom and travelling on vessels leaving British ports for Australia. We are doing our best to help those who try to come here via the United Kingdom.

                        <para>- The term "British Commonwealth of Nations" has no legal significance. Those who speak on behalf of the Dominions are free to use whatever term they choose to use. I have already said in answer to a question addressed to me in this House that I ;propose to continue to use the expression " British Commonwealth of Nations ". Other dominions may or may not continue to use the word " British ". When the House is considering the item on the notice-paper which deals with the declaration that was made at the conclusion of the recent conference of Empire Prime Ministers, the question to which the honorable gentleman has referred will be open for discussion. The Government does not intend to introduce legislation covering the matter and, as far as I know, there is no necessity for such legislation. Three very distinguished lawyers were present when the matter was discussed in London, but apparently they did not regard legislative action as being necessary. It was agreed generally at the conference that each dominion should use the term that it considered to be appropriate. I do not know of anything in the preamble to the Statute of Westminster that affects this question. The term " British Commonwealth of Nations " does not appear in Commonwealth legislation or on bills submitted for the royal assent. On behalf «f Australia, I intimated at the conference of Empire Prime Ministers that we should continue to use the term " British Commonwealth of Nations ". </para>

                            <para>- I understand that Mr. McNamara holds an office in an overseas organization, of which he is either the vice-president or a committee member. He has not, however, any authority to represent Australia. He is an Australian citizen and was originally elected to a position in an overseas organization. As the honorable member will remember, I answered a similar question some time ago regarding Mrs. Jessie Street, and I then intimated to him that such persons did not represent the Australian Government and carried no credentials whatever to represent it. That position obtains regarding Mr. McNamara. He is certainly an Australian, but the views that he will express will be his own. Mr. McNamara was issued with an ordinary passport and we have no control over him. I shall examine the latter part of the honorable member's question regarding any credentials or any brief that might be given to Mr. McNamara. Nobody should be briefed for the Government who is not an official delegate. </para>

                        <para>- In view of the statement in this morning's <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> that four choice pastoral leases on the Barkly Tablelands, in the Northern Territory, had been allocated after applicants had been waiting since the 24th April, 1948, can the Minister for the Interior say whether the Northern Territory Land Board exercised its right to choose the most suitable applicant for each block, or whether it was unable to separate the qualifications of desirable applicants, and resorted to the ballot system? In view of the fact that at the conference of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which was held at Townsville last Tuesday, delegates from Western Australia submitted proposals urging the Queensland Government to allocate at least 50 per cent, of newly opened land in that State to returned servicemen, will the Minister instruct the Northern Territory Land Board to grant a similar concession to ex-servicemen when allocating choice pastoral leases in the Northern Territory? </para>

                        <para>- Shortly after the end of hostilities we sent a technical and scientific mission to London and, at a later stage, a mission was sent to Germany to deal with the reparations there. Such reparations as are available are submitted to a committee of the Western allies, and those countries which are competent to participate in them are then asked to make bids for the items in which they are interested. Australia has made, bids from time to time. In fact, reparations to the value of approximately £750,000 already have been received in Australia. An additional 1,000 tons of machinery items is on the water at present. While Australia was entitled to only approximately 1 per cent, of the total reparations made available, up to the present it has already received about 1 1/4 per cent. These cover a very wide diversity of articles, ranging from small machine tools to very large items, such as a big steel press, of which there are few equals in the world. This has been received and set up at Newcastle. We have also received a modern diesel-engined coastal vessel which will soon be operating in the Australian coastal trade. When the items now on the water have been received they will he distributed to industry in the usual way. </para>

                        <para>- On the 19th May, the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture announced that a survey, which had been carried out by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, showed that the cost of the production of eggs was 2s. 7d. a dozen, which figure included 3.39d. attributed to marketing costs. In assessing the f.o.b. cost to producers of eggs for export, will the Minister take into consideration charges incurred in getting the eggs from the grading floor to the ship, including cartage, oil and cool-storage charges, and the levy and pulping charges imposed by the Australian Egg Board ? No allowance has been made for those charges in the survey. If the Minister will give consideration to the inclusion of  those charges, as I trust he will do, will he also see that full consideration is given to the recent increases in those charges? </para>

                        <para>- The report of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics on the cost of production of eggs has been received. It indicates that the cost of production is 2s. 6id. a dozen. That figure, I understand, assumes that all the eggs marketed are first-grade eggs and it includes the handling charges of the respective State egg boards. It is based on a low production figure of 10.07 dozen eggs per hen per annum. Might I explain to the House that that figure Ls based on deliveries to the State egg boards. It is known that, apart from deliveries to the State egg boards and sales by produce agents, there is a leakage which may or may not amount to a quantity in excess of one dozen eggs per hen. These leakages find their way to retail shopkeepers and others and include sales from roadside stalls and consumption on commercial egg farms. In view of the opinions expressed t.y those engaged in the commercial egg industry it is not unfair to suggest that a reasonable assessment of the production per hen per annum in Australia would be approximately twelve dozen. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable member made a calculation, on the basis of twelve dozen eggs per hen per annum he would be able to ascertain that the commercial cost of production of eggs does not amount to 2s. 6 1/2d. a dozen. My view is that, to help commercial egg producers in this country, and, at the same time, to assist the British Ministry of Food, it is reasonable to assess egg production throughout the Commonwealth at eleven dozen per hen per annum and at the same time to make compensating allowance for leakage and down grading in quality. </para>

I wrote to him in March, and pointed out that the concessions were not fully in operation; and he promised to make an early reply. To-day is the 7th June and I have not yet received a reply.

                            <para>- The widow to whom the honorable member has referred enjoyed a war widow's pension, until very recently, when certain information concerning her was received by the Victorian branch of the Repatriation Department. The local repatriation board, which is the appropriate authority to consider claims -for pensions or to review pensions already granted, reviewed her case, and the pension was cancelled. When the matter became public I called for a report, which I have now obtained. I have also examined the departmental file, and to-day I read twelve pages of a letter which I received from the widow. I propose to give further consideration to her case. I have already pointed out that if the lady concerned is able to satisfy the Victorian branch of the Repatriation Department that she complies with the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act and regulations, which have been operative ever since repatriation pensions have been granted, and that she is a proper person to receive a pension, it will he restored to her immediately. </para>

                        <para>- Will the Minister representing the Acting Attorney-General explain to the House the effect of the recent decision of the High Court which invalidated regulations that prevented the eviction of ex-servicemen and gave them certain other privileges in relation to housing? A statement has  appeared  in the press that the Government of Victoria has proclaimed regulations to replace the defunct Commonwealth regulations? Is the Minister in a position to inform me whether any other States have been able to take immediate action? </para>

I do not know whether any action has yet been taken as the result of the decision of the High Court, but the Minister for Works and Housing administers the few remaining Commonwealth regulations relating to the housing of ex-servicemen, and I assume that he will negotiate with the States for the purpose of endeavouring to strengthen the position, and protect the interests of ex-servicemen. </para>

                            <para>- I am afraid that such an answer would be equally unsatisfactory. I remember the questions asked by the honorable member and similar questions asked by the honorable member for Cook. I said that the defence power of the Constitution, under which the female rates were fixed, was becoming weaker and that sooner or later the High Court would invalidate the relevant regulations. For that reason I continually warned the unions concerned to approach the courts to have the special rates obtained for their female members incorporated in awards. I discussed the matter with some of the judges of the Arbitration Court, and they said that that could be done and that they were quite willing to do it. I should say, at a guess, that approximately 90 per cent. of the unions concerned accepted my advice and approached the court. A small minority of unions did not do so, and now that the regulations have been declared invalid, they have lost the legal backing which maintained the female rates at 75 per cent. of the male award rates, but I doubt whether any employers will take advantage of their right to reduce female wages now that the regulations have been declared invalid. </para>

                    <para class="block">Consider the use of the word "permitting ". Every honorable member knows that no government can either permit or prevent any member of the House, irrespective of whether he happens to be  a  Minister or a private member of its own party or of the Opposition from saying anything that he pleases. Subject to the Standing Orders every honorable member is entitled to say whatever he thinks fit. The inclusion of the word " permitting " implies that the motion of censure is directed not so much against the Government as against the Standing Orders or against the manner in which you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker,</inline> have conducted the proceedings of the House. It is clear, therefore, that the word " permitting" has no proper place in the motion. Next, I invite attention to the use of the word "encouraging" in the same paragraph. For a government, or an individual, to encourage a certain course of action is a very different thing from permitting such a course to be adopted. However, the fact is that no evidence has been  adduced that the Government has encouraged any member of the Ministry or any of its supporters to adopt a particular course of action. The only statement that might be accepted as evidence in support of that charge was the assertion of the Leader of the Opposition that my colleague, the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard),</inline> was " put up " to reply to the honorable member for Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Adermann).</inline> If that is the only evidence in support of the allegation that the Government has encouraged its members and supporters to adopt a particular line of action, it does not substantiate the charge. In any event, I say that the assertion that the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture was " put up " to reply to the honorable member for Maranoa is completely false. I was sitting very close to the Minister when he decided to speak on the matter.  His  action was quite spontaneous. It did not require any encouragement by anybody, and every honorable member who knows the honorable gentleman personally is aware that he does not need any prompting by any one. On most of the occasions when the honorable gentleman has risen to speak in this chamber, he has done so quite spontaneously. So it was on this occasion. My reaction was the same as that of the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture. If he had not risen to make a statement then I should have done so, also spontaneously. </para>

                            <para>- It would have been much to the same effect. I shall give my reasons for saying that. The reaction of the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture and myself was a reaction to the statements of the Leader of the Opposition, who painted a picture of the honorable member for Maranoa as a saint with a halo around his head. I do not accept that description of the honorable gentleman, although I have nothing against him. When he first entered the Parliament, I thought that he presented his arguments very fairly, hut since then he has spent a long time in the company of a number of honorable gentlemen opposite who persistently misrepresent facts in this chamber. The honorable member for Maranoa has learned quite a lot from the honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen),</inline> the honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony),</inline> the honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Abbott)</inline> and other members of the Opposition. I am not prepared to accept the picture of the honorable member for Maranoa that was painted by the Leader of the Opposition. I would describe the honorable gentleman's standards of integrity, honesty and sincerity in this House as " f.a.q." and nothing more. </para>

                    <para>No evidence has been adduced by the Opposition to prove that the Government has encouraged Ministers or other honorable members to take a particular line of action. It is alleged in the motion that the Government has permitted and encouraged personal defamatory and threatening attacks upon Opposition members by Ministers. The rank and file are excluded. They are quite innocent. The motion refers only to " Ministers ". No Ministers are mentioned by name. Is the allegation intended to cover two or more Ministers or all of the Ministers? The only evidence that has been adduced by the Opposition in support of the allegation is that on one occasion certain statements concerning the honorable member for Maranoa were made, and in my opinion justifiably made, by the Minister for Information <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell).</inline> All that my colleague did then was to read a letter containing allegations from which the inference could be drawn that the honorable member for Maranoa had been guilty of certain misdemeanours. Instead of alleging that one Minister has been permitted and encouraged to make personal defamatory and threatening attacks upon honorable gentlemen opposite, the Opposition has made a general charge against all Ministers. At any rate, the motion uses the words " by Ministers ", and we are left to draw our own conclusions on whether the charge is laid against two or three Ministers or all Ministers. An allegation that Ministers are making personal defamatory attacks upon members of the Opposition when the only evidence, for what it is worth, adduced in support of the allegation concerns one Minister only is a persona] defamatory attack upon every Minister with the exception of the one to whom the evidence relates. The Opposition is therefore, guilty of the very offence with which it has charged the Government in this censure motion. </para>
                    <para>Having disposed of some of the propagandist trimmings in this part of the motion, I pass to the words, " personal defamatory and threatening attacks ". I have never heard language used in the House or outside it by any Minister or honorable member on this side of the chamber which has threatened any member of the Opposition. It is apparent that there never has been any utterance of a kind that could be said to constitute a threat against honorable gentlemen opposite. Therefore, the word " threatening " has been included in the motion as padding, and in order to make it read a little better than it otherwise would read. I find it very difficult to differentiate between a personal defamatory attack and what honorable members opposite would probably argue was a legitimate political attack. I make bold to say that no such distinction could be drawn. Honorable gentlemen opposite, including the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden),</inline> have at times been guilty of making upon honorable members on this side of the House political attacks that were in fact personal defamatory attacks. I say, therefore, " He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone". A considerable time ago the Leader of the Opposition coined the slogan, " The eyes of Hitler are on Corio". It might he argued that that was a legitimate political attack, but is it not true to say that it could also be described as a defamatory attack upon the character of the Labour party candidate for Corio at that time, who was myself? The inference to be drawn from that slogan, which was coined deliberately by the Leader of the Opposition, was that the Labour party candidate for Corio was a traitor to Australia. Is that inference worse or better" than the inferences that can be drawn from the statements concerning the honorable member for Maranoa that were  n-ade by the Minister for Information? </para>

                        of chat slogan by the Leader of the Opposition was as much a personal defamatory attack upon me as the statements made by the Minister for Information were a personal defamatory attack upon the honorable member for Maranoa. When the slogan was coined I was nol a member of the Parliament. Therefore, 1 did not have an opportunity to denounce in this House the statement* that were made by the Leader of the Opposition. If I had said that the public could judge whether I was a traitor to this country or the British Commonwealth of Nations by comparing the records of the Leader of the Opposition and myself in relation to military service in two world wars, and had gone into the details of the military record of the right honorable gentleman, that would have been said to be a personal defamatory attack upon him.

                            <para>by the use of its majority in this House is unreasonably and improperly restricting the rights of private members and the electors they represent ;  [t is assumed that this allegation is based on the fact that the Prime Minister moved a motion last week that had the effect that Government business took precedence over private members' business, and that on " Grievance Day " only two private members were able to address the House. We then returned to consideration of the bills on the notice paper. Let me point out that the bills under discussion were Supply and Approbation bills, during debates on which honorable members may discuss anything in the wide world. In fact, anything that they could discuss on " Grievance Day " they could also discuss in debating those particular bills. Honorable members were therefore not curtailed or restricted in their remarks by the fact that " Grievance Day " was allowed to continue for only a short period of time and that the House then reverted to the discussion of the bills that were on the notice-paper. Every government with a majority has always used its majority to ensure that government bills, and particularly urgent government bills, receive prior consideration. On looking back through the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> records I found that the Leader of the Opposition himself, immediately after he became Prime Minister in 1939, did exactly what this Government is doing, and of course, with the same justification, on the first "Private Members' Day" to which Parliament was entitled after he had become Prime Minister. The occasion to which I refer occurred in April, 1939. The House divided when the right honorable gentlemanmoved that government business should take precedence over private members' business. He was supported by the honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison),</inline> the honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline> Francis), the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt),</inline> the honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen)</inline> and the honorable member for Deakin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hutchinson).</inline> At that time there were a number of motions on the notice-paper. There was one by the then honorable member for Lilley who sought to revive the Public Accounts Committee. That was regarded as a very important matter. There was also a motion by the present honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> for the appointment of a select committee to inquire into the administration of the Repatriation Commission. The Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Barnard)</inline> will be interested to know that dissatisfaction with the operations of the Repatriation Commission is evidently not new. There was also a motion by the present Minister for Air <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Drakeford)</inline> for the appointment of a select committee to inquire into the Commonwealth Public Service. Not only did the Leader of the Opposition take the action that I have indicated when he was Prime Minister, on the first " Grievance Day " to which the Parliament was entitled after his assumption to office, but he also took the same action on the second " Grievance Day ". The plain fact, as I have said, is that any government which has a majority naturally uses it to see that urgent measures on the notice-paper are given priority, and nobody can blame this Government for taking that particular line of action. Other incidents to which I shall refer show that Opposition members,  when they have been on the treasury bench, have taken action that has been very restrictive of the rights of private members. I shall cite figures relating to the number of sittings of this House while the present Opposition parties were in office. In nine years of antiLabour government, from 1932 to 1940 inclusive, the Parliament was allowed to sit for only 496 days, or an average of 55 days a year. In the last seven years of Labour government the average number of sittings has been 69| days a year. That is to say, in a period of seven years, Labour governments have given honorable members almost the same opportunity to express their own and their constituents' views on legislation and administration, as anti-Labour governments vouchsafed them in nine years. It is interesting to note also that there was a time when honorable members opposite, while occupying the treasury bench, "guillotined " measures through this House at a much faster rate than this Government has ever done. There was an occasion when the honorable member for Balaclava applied the " gag " about 30 times in one night. Those were the days, also, when a former anti-Labour Prime Minister, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons,</inline> was afraid to call the Parliament together because he was not sure how his own supporters would react to a particular international crisis that had arisen. I remind honorable members that when Czechoslovakia was seized by Germany in 1939 this Parliament was not in session, and as I have said, the then anti-Labour Prime Minister was not game to call it together because he did not know what action his own followers would take about that crisis. So it ill becomes honorable members opposite to criticize this Government, which has given the representatives of the people in the Parliament far greater opportunity to discuss problems, both domestic and international, than anti-Labour governments have ever given them. Another part of the motion states that the Government - </para>

                    </list>
                    <para>The fact is that the Opposition has got into the habit of submitting motions of want of confidence against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> and it does this so frequently that the Government is entitled to treat the motions as frivolous. Let me make a comparison between the practice in Australia in this matter and that in the House of Commons. In Australia, the Opposition seems to think that it is a very small thing to make a motion of censure against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> and it does so even if its charge against him is no more than that he has departed somewhat from customary procedure. In the House of Commons, however, the making of such a motion is regarded as a very grave matter, indeed, and is resorted to only when the circumstances are regarded as almost unprecedented. The last occasion upon which a motion of censure of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> was submitted in the House of Commons was in 1902. The time before that was in 1882, and for a third occasion we have to go as far back as 1777. Thus, during a period of 175 years, the Opposition in the House of Commons has on only three occasions moved that the ruling of the  Speaker  be disagreed with, or that his conduct was worthy of censure. In the Australian Parliament, the Opposition has submitted motions of that kind on four occasions in the last five years. Members of the Opposition in the Australian Parliament have at times been very unruly in their conduct. That is why I took notice of the remarks of the Leader of the Australian Country party. He apologized for them to-day, and therefore, I suppose, I should make no further reference to them. It is because members of the .Opposition are at times so unruly, and their conduct so disorderly, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker</inline> have had to take action. Had they not done so, they would have been recreant to their duty. Thus, it has been the misconduct of members of the Opposition themselves that has made action by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. -Speaker</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker</inline> necessary, and such action, when taken, has become the subject of motions of censure from the Opposition. Therefore, it is in order for the Government to treat as frivolous the motion, .of censure now on the notice paper. Indeed, the Minister for Repatriation interjected to that effect when the Leader of the Opposition was speaking, and the Leader of the Opposition replied to this effect, " Well, if the Government thinks that the motion is frivolous, why not discharge it from the notice-paper? Why allow it to remain there for so many months ? " In order to get the motion discharged from the notice-paper, the Government would have to move to that effect. If it did so, obviously the Opposition would contest the motion, and the ensuing debate would cover the very same ground as if the original motion were being debated, and time would be wasted. Therefore, the Government is entitled, since it came to the conclusion that the motion was frivolous, to ignore it by allowing it to remain on the notice-paper until a later date. </para>
                    <para>I may sum up by saying that the Opposition had no cause to move that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker</inline> was worthy of censure. They, themselves, by their conduct, made it necessary for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker</inline> to take the action complained of. Otherwise, it would not be possible to keep order in the House. Further, the Government has provided more opportunities for the discussion of domestic and international affairs than had ever previously been given in Parliament to the representatives of the people. Therefore, I believe that the House, should, by its vote, show conclusively that there is no reason why the Government should be censured for such action as it has taken. It will continue- to act in the same way. </para>

                        <para>. - The motion under discussion proposes that the Government be censured on three major grounds First, that it has, by its conduct, prostituted the institution of Parliament; secondly, that it has permitted, and condoned and encouraged the personal vilification of honorable members; and, thirdly, that, by its general conduct in the House, it has destroyed real liberty of speech, and brought the Parliament into contempt. </para>

                    <para>No one who goes among the people to-day can escape from the conclusion that the average man in the street thinks that the Parliament has been much lowered in its dignity and status during the last seven years. It is hardly incidental that this period is the one during which Labour has been in power. Public estimation of the Parliament reflects in a real sense its appreciation of what goes on in the Parliament. To-day, it is no longer regarded as a privilege, or as a matter for pride, to represent the people in the National Parliament. On the contrary, this Government more than any other in the history of the Commonwealth Parliament, has contributed to the genera] acceptance by the people of the belief that a man who goes in for politics is either a fool or a knave. He is a fool because he neglects his own interests in order to go into Parliament, or he is a knave because he uses Parliament for the advancement of his interests. Since that is the opinion held by so many people, it is necessary to look for the reason, and I believe that the reason can be found in the terms of the motion submitted by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies).</inline></para>
                    <para>I listened carefully, and with growing mystification, to the speech of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley).</inline> I had assumed, wrongly as it turned out, that on this occasion he would have faced squarely the issues before the Parliament but, in truth, he followed his usual tactics of evasion. He refused to face the issue, but not all his mental squirmings  could conceal the fact that, involved in the motion before the House, there is a serious charge, namely, that Ministers of the Government, from the Prime Minister down, have never sought to impose any restrictions on Ministers and supporters who resort to personal vilification and abuse of members of the Opposition. I believe that a great majority of honorable members, and I include members of the Labour party, endeavour to perform their duties in this Parliament to the best of their ability, but their efforts are nullified by the conduct of certain members of the Labour party, and particularly of certain Ministers, who should set a shining example of how members of this Parliament should conduct themselves. We have witnessed the Prime Minister not in any way seeking to condemn the conduct of honorable members on his own side of the House in indulging in personal abuse, not in any way seeking to find ways and means to prevent a repetition of such conduct, but instead raising a false issue. The right honorable gentleman made it appear that members of the Opposition parties were merely concerned with altering the Standing Orders. He said smugly, with tongue in cheek, that he was prepared to waive parliamentary privilege. Parliamentary privilege must be maintained if the Parliament is to function. I would be the last to surrender one iota of parliamentary privilege. Parliamentary privilege goes back deep into the institution of parliamentary government, long before it was incorporated in the Bill of Rights. It is the very keystone of parliamentary government. But because parliamentary privilege gives to honorable members an opportunity to say what they will, so the responsibilities of members of Parliament become greater. This is not the first occasion that attention has been drawn to abuses of parliamentary privilege. On a previous occasion I endeavoured to have set up special machinery in the Parliament to deal with honorable members who abuse the great privileges attaching to their membership of the Parliament, hut I got no support whatsoever from the Parliamentary Labour party. I sought to establish a committee of three members which would have vested in it by statute power to preside over inquiries into breaches of privilege in the course of which members of the public or members of tin-. Parliament were charged with corruption or criminal or other serious misconduct: That proposal, however, did not meet with support from the representatives of the Australian Labour party. It is strange that, whether knowingly or not, the Australian Labour party has done its utmost to destroy the parliamentary institution which we are all sworn to preserve. If this Parliament were destroyed as the result of the use of the technique of character assassination, and the vilification of its members and the lowering of the confidence of the public in their elected representatives, it would not be the first time that that kind of thing had happened. During the last ten years, the Communists have developed and perfected the weapon of character assassination which has been so freely used by members of the Australian Labour party in this House. Indeed, it fits the technique of the members of that party like a glove. The representatives of the Australian Labour party speak with the voice of Labour, but the tongue they use is the tongue of communism. It does not require very much evidence to support that statement. I shall instance one particular matter which the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman),</inline> who has  just concluded his speech, justifies. The culminating point which gave rise to this motion of censure was an attack made by the Minister for Information <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> on the honorable member for Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Adermann).</inline> It was said by the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction that that was the only instance to which reference was made. Many honorable members on this side of the House have been made the subject of attacks of that kind. Attacks have been made by Ministers of the Crown, not only on members of the Parliament, but also even on members of their families. They have been tacitly supported by the Prime Minister, who comes easily into the House and says : " This is all over nothing". That his Ministers have engaged in personal abuse of and attacks upon members of the Parliament is apparently of no consequence to the Prime Minister. The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction asked, "What do permitting and allowing mean - who permits and who allows ?" Is the Prime Minister of so little consequence that he cannot control gross misconduct on the part of his Ministers? If he cannot do so, he has no right to lead the Government of this country. If he can control such misconduct - and I believe that he can - he stands arraigned at the bar of public opinion for having failed to do so. On more than one occasion honorable members on this side of the House have been intimidated. A message was conveyed to the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett)</inline> by devious means indicating that if he acted in a certain way allegations which were known to be untrue would be made against him. Not long ago allegations of a most scandalous nature were made against the honorable member for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blain).</inline> Was that action ever condemned by the Prime Minister? Not at all. At all times the right honorable gentleman has stood by those who have made these scandalous attacks and has never exhibited his authority a9 leader of his party. On another occasion a certain high-ranking Minister, now overseas, conveyed to the honorable member for the Northern "Territory the information that, if he did not withdraw a question standing in his name on the notice-paper his conduct as a prisoner of war would be raised in this House. These are not isolated instances. They are merely illustrations of the kind of intimidation that has been  going on for a long time past. The message is usually conveyed to the honorable member concerned by some runner, saying, " You do this or do that and these things will he done ". Most honorable members are well aware of such occurrences. That is the technique of communism. It is the method by which the means of democracy are used to destroy democracy. That is precisely what is taking place to-day. I remember, for example, the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction challenging the _ Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> with having been false to his oath as a Privy Councillor by revealing secret information. I also remember a statement by the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard)</inline> which contained the gravest reflection on Australian troops who surrendered to the Japanese in Malaya. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister may conduct himself as he pleases knowing that nothing will happen to him. Confirmation of the statement to which he has objected will be found in <inline font-style="italic">Ilansard</inline> of the 25th March, 1947, at page 1102. and of the 19th September, 1947, at page 100. I do not make allegations which 1 cannot support by concrete evidence. The Minister regards my statement as offensive. What he said then was very offensive to those against whom it was directed. I remember another member of the Australian Labour party saying of a certain justice of this country that when he had entered the Parliament he had been a member of an anti-Labour party, and that there was no more vicious and anti-Labour appointee on the High Court than the present Chief Justice. Statements of that kind are made by honorable members opposite  with  impunity. They are not regarded by Government supporters as being offensive but when attention is drawn to them they immediately become offensive. Let us have regard to the incident that occurred in this House last week which the Prime Minister has sought to justify. The honorable member for Maranoa was charged on two counts by the Minister for Information. The Minister charged the honorable member with having induced people to invest their money in a co-operative concern and, after his re-election to the Parliament, having made a corrupt arrangement with Dalgety and Company Limited as the result of which the investors lost their money. That was a charge of corrupt conduct. The Minister said further that the honorable member for Maranoa had used his position as  Chairman  of the Peanut Board to urge a head grader to grade the honorable member's third-grade peanuts as first-grade nuts, and that when the grader refused to do so he was sacked. What does that amount to? Let us not bandy -words. It means that the honorable member for Maranoa, when holding the responsible position of  chairman  of the Peanut Board, sought corruptly to get more money than he was entitled to for his peanuts by bringing pressure to bear upon an official to give the honorable member's crop a higher grading than that to which it was entitled. If that is not an attempted criminal conspiracy, I should like to know what is. The Minister for Defence, who came so spontaneously to the aid of the Minister for Information, said that the Minister for Information had not made any charges against the honorable member for Maranoa, but had only repeated something that he had been told in a letter. My answer to that is that if we on this side of the chamber were to repeat all the information that we receive, both anonymously and otherwise, from the public about Ministers of the Crown and other Labour supporters, we should be doing nothing else for weeks ; but we know that such charges should never be repeated in this House. If any person wishes to make a charge against a man in public life, let him get to his feet and say so. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture also said that the Minister for Information had not made any charges against the honorable member for Maranoa, but had merely repeated information that had come to him in a letter. </para>

                    <para class="block">Minister of the Crown who receives a letter from some scurvy nameless person is prepared to be the mouth-piece of that person to traduce another member of the Parliament, the standard of politics has indeed sunk to a low level in this chamber. It is not unusual for Communists to employ just that technique. I recall an occasion on which the honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lang)</inline> drew the attention of the House to the activities of a certain individual and charged him with being a Communist. The Minister for Defence used the privilege of the Parliament, not merely to endeavour to prove that the person was not a Communist, but also to read a letter from him proclaiming his own integrity, and saying how vile the honorable member for Reid was to have made, such an allegation. Subsequently, the charges made by the honorable member for Reid were substantiated. On more than one occasion, information that has come into the hands of honorable members opposite, anonymously or otherwise, have been used to vilify and intimidate members of the Opposition. Every one of us on this side of the chamber knows that the Government has a dossier on him, prepared presumably by government employees whose salaries are paid by the public. I have no doubt that the dossiers contain every libellous statement that can be gathered from muck-raking letter writers. The attack by the Minister for Information on the honorable member for Maranoa was not something that came out of the blue in the heat of the debate.  His  words were not hasty utterances which, having been made, were withdrawn. The attack was premeditated. The Minister's attitude was not, " Here is something I have heard; it may or may not be true ". That would have been bad enough. He intended to convey the impression that what he had heard was true. He said that the honorable member for Maranoa had a few friends in Queensland who did not like the methods which he had adopted in regard to a number of matters. What did that mean? Clearly that was a charge that the honorable member for Maranoa had adopted certain methods which were not liked by certain people. The Minister then quoted from a letter that he  had received, containing the two charges to which I have referred. Then he said - </para>

                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">So he did make charges. Does any honorable member of this chamber suggest that the Minister, when he rose to speak on that occasion, did not intend to vilify the honorable member for Maranoa personally? Of course that was his intention and we all know very well that any one who attacks the Government in this chamber will receive the same treatment. Honorable members opposite believe that if they can intimidate their political opponents they will prevent criticism of the Government. It is quite a common technique these days and it is strange indeed that the Labour party, which pretends to fight communism on all occasions, should use in this House the technique of the Communists who engage in a sinister sabotage of democratic institutions. I venture to say that before this debate has concluded, other personal things will be said by honorable members opposite. It is one thing in a parliament to hit hard, but only in terms political. It is an entirely different thing, although apparently the Minister for Defence does not understand the difference, to attack a man personally. The attitude of the Prime Minister to the incident was, " What can I do? " I suppose he thought that he should " let the boys have a go ". I regret very much to say that, when personal attacks have been made in this chamber, I have seen the Prime Minister sitting on a back bench not merely unconcerned, but on occasions apparently quite amused with what was going on. I recall one occasion when the Prime Minister himself made a personal attack on the private secretary to the Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden).</inline> Those things should be remembered. Only by precept and example will debating standards be improved. </para>
                    <para>It is significant that during the lifetime of the 17th and 18th Parliaments there have been 21 suspensions, of which eighteen have concerned ex-Ministers of the Crown. Probably there is no need for me to stress that every one of the 21 members suspended has been a member of the Opposition parties. The assumption must be that we on this side of the chamber are guilty of disorderly conduct justifying the penalty of suspension, and that Labour supporters are never guilty of such conduct. Fortunately, for the Opposition, however, parliamentary proceedings are broadcast, and people are able to form their own judgment on such matters. I venture to say that the Opposition always endeavours to deal in strictly political terms with matters that come before this chamber. We may hit hard, but we do not make personal attacks. The contrary approach is made by honorable members opposite. </para>

                    <para class="block">The Minister for Defence said that, in the last five years four motions similar to that which we are now discussing had been placed on the notice paper. Because of that, he said the Government was entitled to treat this motion as being of no consequence. The honorable gentleman sought to draw the most extraordinary parallel between the Mother of Parliaments and this Parliament. It is well, therefore, that the difference between the conditions applying respectively in the United Kingdom Parliament and in this Parliament should be pointed out so that the people will not he confused by the Minister's obvious attempt to mislead them by claiming that the two are comparable. The  Speaker  in the British House of Commons represents a constituency, it is true. But when he has been elected to the high office of  Speaker,  he holds that office, subject to good conduct, and is unopposed in his constituency by any political party. Consequently, he is in office, in effect, for life as a man who sits as a judge over the assembly of the Parliament. This Parliament, on the contrary, has an entirely different procedure, and that is quite sufficient to justify  us in submitting a motion of no  confidence  in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker</inline> whenever we feel inclined to do so. It may be assumed that when the honorable member for "Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> submitted a motion of no confidence in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker</inline> some months ago,  he did so with a sense of responsibility, which was indicated by the grounds on which it was suggested in the motion that the House had no  confidence  in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker.</inline> I listened with amazement to what the Prime Minister had to say. As -I understoodhim, he said, " The Parliament elected him ". Technically, that is true. In truth, only one election takes placefor the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr, Speaker,</inline> and that takes place outside this Parliament. The right honorable gentleman's view apparently was, " We elected him and, whatever he does,, we are going to support him". Therefore, I gather that it does not matter, as far as the conduct of this Parliament is concerned, whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy</inline> Speakerdoes or does not reveal seriouspartiality, does or does not support the Government and crack down upon the Opposition, does or does nol regard himself as the instrument of theLabour party instead of as the custodian of the rights and privileges of this House,, and does or does not interpret correctly the Standing Orders of the House. </para>

With great respect, that is a proposition which I very strongly resist. I am not speaking of any individual case,, nor am I seeking to canvass the motion on the notice-paper. ' At any time in this Parliament, if a question arises as to whether the  Speaker  for the time being is deserving of the confidence of the House, he should not be blindly supported by the government of the day. Indeed, there was an occasion when the parties now in opposition, but then in power, did not support a  Speaker  who had been their own nominee. When the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Bell was  Speaker,  the Prime Minister of the day, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons,</inline> moved disagreement with the ruling of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> and the motion was carried. That was an indication that it was not the function of  a  government to support the  Speaker  in all circumstances whatever his qualification or disqualification might be. In point of fact, the Standing Orders provide that any motion by any individual member who claims that the  Speaker  has lost the confidence of the House may come before the chamber at any time. </para>

                    <para>I shall say only a few more words about this matter, as it is not possible to deal with the entire motion within a period of  35  minutes.

Some of these gentlemen have been drawn from the Government side of the House, and some have been drawn from the Opposition. I shall ask only one question and leave the subject at that. Can anybody remember how many times in the last ten years any of the  Deputy  Chairmen of Committees from the Opposition side have been asked to act as a  Deputy Chairman  of Committees ? I make no more comment. Secondly, I draw attention to the denial of information to members of Parliament who, in the pursuit of their public duties, are entitled to obtain information. This is of prime importance. As an example, I refer to one recent occurrence in connexion with a report upon the Northern Territory medical services. The honorable member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beale)</inline> has asked for a copy of that report, not once, but a number of times. He went to the Parliamentary Library and sought to obtain a copy by using the facilities that are open to every member of the Parliament. But he could not obtain a copy. A public document to which, by some means, the press gained access is denied to a member of the Parliament. Why? There is one reason and one reason only. The object is to stifle criticism of the Government. The report reflected gravely upon the Government's conduct of medical services in the Northern Territory. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. Whenever members of the Government quote from such a document in this House, the Government - in my opinion quite unwarrentably - claims that it is priviledged. It does so, not because the document is in fact confidential, but in order to prevent members of the public from reading it. We have experienced such conduct time and time again. Information sought by honorable members on this side of the House has been refused. In truth, when we seek information at question time, which is a very ancient privilege, we rarely obtain any real information from the Government. Apparently Ministers consider that they are here, not to dis; charge their duties to the country, but instead to engage in propaganda. Therefore, this Parliament now acts merely as a rubber stamp. It no longer has control over the finances of the country. It no longer functions as a deliberative assembly. We, in opposition, are here merely because the Constitution demands that we be here in order to pass legislation, whatever the word " pass " means. It is true that we have met in this House on 230 days during the life of this Parliament, but it is not the length of time that we spend in debate that matters. It is what we do in debate and how debates are conducted that is important. I contend that this motion has been fully justified. To-day we are witnessing a great deal of degradation of the functions of the Parliament. That degradation has been principally due to the fact that the Australian Labour party has permitted some of its Ministers - although I excuse the majority of them - to engage in vilification, personal abuse, and intimidation of honorable members for the purpose of preventing criticism and advancing, so they think, the interests of the party. If the Government does not clean out the Augean stable, I hope, the public will do so very soon. I believe that the public will demand a better standard in the conduct of the business of the Parliament. </para>

                        <para>. - The indignation of honorable members opposite could be understood if they had practised in the past what they now preach. This criticism applies particularly to the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender).</inline> Although the honorable member has spoken about the degradation of the Parliament honorable members can recall many instances of repeated interjections and misbehaviour by him when members on the Government side of the House were endeavouring to put a case or place facts before the House that were unpalatable to him. He has repeatedly been called to order by the Chair. I admit that in the past I have similarly offended. In this instance, however, I am defending the charge, not making it. In many instances the honorable member for Warringah has advanced second-hand information when addressing the House, and he has one of the worst records of attendance. </para>

This is a statement of fact and is relevant to statements that have been made by the Opposition during this debate. The honorable member for Warringah has said that the Parliament is merely a  rubber  stamp for recording decisions. So far as he is concerned that may be so, because in his absence he is paired with a Government member who, in respect of this motion, has not protested. En that sense the honorable member brands himself as a party " rubberstamper " so far as this Parliament is concerned. The honorable member re ferred to the inability of the Parliament to discuss the motion of censure of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker</inline> that was moved during a previous sessional period of the Parliament. Honorable members opposite are experiencing an irritation because the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> was suspended from the service of this House last week. </para>

Some honorable members can take suspension without protest. Last week the Leader of the Opposition was warned by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker</inline> to cease interjecting. As the right honorable gentleman continued to interject, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker</inline> took disciplinary action. I recollect an incident that occurred in this House in 1938 or 1939 concerning myself. The then <inline font-weight="bold">Speaker, Sir George</inline> Bell, although a rigid disciplinarian, was a very just  Speaker  in every way. During the course of a debate he warned me to cease interjecting. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. The necessity to maintain discipline is something that the Opposition is not now prepared to admit when its members offend against standing orders, thus bringing down on their heads the disciplinary rules of this House. On the occasion to which I have referred, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thorby,</inline> the then Minister for Agriculture, was addressing the House. Under provocation, I ignored <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker's</inline> warning and was duly suspended from the service of the House. However, I took my medicine and did not complain. It is evident that some honorable members opposite are incapable of taking their medicine. During this debate the honorable member for Warringah has accused me of reflecting adversely on Australian prisoners of war. Although he mentioned specifically the debate in this House on the 25th March, 1947, a reference to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> proves that the honorable member is a "  mud-slinger  " of the worst kind. Speaking to the motion by the honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Turnbull),</inline> for the formal adjournment of the House on that date, as reported in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> volume 190, at page 1101 I said - </para>

                        <para>This is a matter on which one speaks without any relish or enthusiasm. It is a difficult subject to speak on impartially and factually, if one takes a certain point of view, without being described aa unfair and unsympathetic towards the prisoners of war. I am convinced that the honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Turnbull),</inline> in stating the claims of the prisoners of war as ho has persistently done, is sincere, and that he believes that they have a legitimate claim against the Government; but I point out that all the men and women involved have been back in Australia for a considerable time after their trying experiences. Subject to correction, I say that they were all back in Australia prior to the last general election; yet not one political party, nor one candidate - unless it was the honorable member for Wimmera himself, for whom I have great respect in this regard - included this issue in a policy speech, nor stated that if his party were returned to power it would pay sustenance money to the persons concerned. </para>

                        <para>The honorable member for Warringah bought into this, and now he does riot like it. After the 1914-18 war and again after the recent war, the parties opposite consistently pointed to the Australian Soldiers Repatriation Act as a measure which provided full compensation due to all returned soldiers, whether prisoner* of war or not. If, as the result of his war service, an ex-serviceman suffers physically from wounds, sickness, or disease which prevent him from resuming his civil occupation as efficiently as he would otherwise have resumed it, he is entitled to the compensation provided under the terms of the Australian Soldiers Repatriation Act. </para>

                            <para>- It could, but that is a feature of this subject which must not be overlooked. The claim has been made on behalf of men who suffered acutely and desperately in durance vile at the hands of the Japanese. If it were allowed, however, would not similar consideration have to be given to those who escaped from Greece into Albania and other countries and were finally rounded up by the Germans, and, similarly to those who were captured on other fronts, and those who suffered maltreatment in German hell-ships and upon whom grave mental and physical strain was also imposed during their incarceration in enemy camps? It will be recalled that during World War I. the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> was captured by the Turks, deprived of his rations, lived as best he could on what he could " scrounge " from the Turks, and finally, when he escaped into Russia, had to pay out of his own pocket such  sums of money as were necessary to buy food to keep him olive. </para>

                            <para>- Honorable members opposite do not readily come to the defence of honorable members on this side of the chamber unless they consider that we have been wrongly and unfairly treated. That is my answer to the honorable member for Warringah. We are familiar with his heroics, and his infrequent attendances here. The people will not be misled by his attempts to convey that honorable gentlemen opposite are paragons of excellence in their conduct and demeanour here. In the nature of things the members of a political party that is in Opposition tend to be more unruly than are members of the party that supports the Government. That remarks applies equally to a comparison of my conduct as a member of a former Opposition with my behaviour as a member of the present Government. It is only natural that the Chair should experience more difficulty with members of the Opposition than with members and supporters of the Government. At times the conduct of members of every opposition is such that it incurs the displeasure of the Chair and they have to be dealt with. Honorable members opposite have complained that supporters of the Opposition have been victimized by the Chair. Talk about unruly conduct and victimization ! I recall an occasion in this House, not so very long ago, when I was subjected to  a  continuous barrage of interjection from the Opposition from the moment that I commenced to speak. In fact,  I  could not make myself heard above the din. Subsequently, I received a large number of letters from people who had heard the broadcast of the proceedings, in which they complained that the conduct of members of the Opposition was  a  standing disgrace. I had a case to present but I was not allowed to explain it.  I  shall not mention the name of the honorable gentleman who occupied the Chair on that occasion, but I must say that it was not you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker.</inline> The honorable gentleman concerned was probably asleep at the time, but in any event he was certainly partial to the Opposition. Among the members of the Opposition who persistently interjected on that occasion and prevented me from expressing my views were the honorable member for Warringah, and the honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen),</inline> who have complained so bitterly of the alleged prejudice displayed by you, sir, against the Opposition. After I had been so unfairly treated by the Chair on the occasion to which I refer, I did not complain and accuse the occupant of the Chair of bias against the Government; I just had to put up with it. It is nothing more than sheer humbug and foolery for honorable members opposite to endeavour to persuade people outside this chamber that you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker,</inline> favour members and supporters of the Government rather than members of the Opposition. Concerning their complaint of your alleged bias, let me recall the occasion not so long ago when you, sir, did me an injustice. </para>

                            <para>- I shall be generous, sir, and say that I do not know whether the injustice was conscious or unconscious. The fact is that I rose to speak on the third reading of a bill, but before I had an opportunity to say  a  single word, the question that the bill be read a third time was put and carried.  I  protested at the time and uttered some words of remonstrance. Had I been  a  member of the Opposition, it would have  been alleged that the reason why you did not permit me to speak was that you were prejudiced against the Opposition. It is about time that members of the Opposition, who have been kicking up a terrible shindy for some time, realized that over a lengthy period they have been guilty of disorderly conduct in the chamber. The time has come for them to review their conduct so that they may behave a little more decently in future and cease making allegations such as those made by the honorable member for Warringah this afternoon. That honorable member behaved in a dirty, despicable and dastardly manner when he endeavoured to blacken my reputation in the eyes of the ex-servicemen of this country. In the course of his remarks the honorable member also referred to the Government's refusal to make available a particular report. I remind him that when our respective positions in this chamber were reversed and he as the Minister for the Army was occupying the seat which I now occupy, I had occasion to ask him to make available for my examination a particular departmental file. He declined to do so, and I protested vociferously. I certainly made an emphatic protest against his refusal. Those honorable members who are sufficiently interested will find a report of what I said in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> At the time I pointed out that in the Parliament of Victoria, of which T had formerly been a member, the practice of all governments was to make official files available for examination by honorable members who expressed a desire to peruse them. Of course, with the knowledge of procedure that I have obtained since becoming a Minister of the Commonwealth, I do not now blame the honorable member for the attitude that he adopted. However, the point is that although I felt aggrieved at the time and vented my indignation, I did not accuse the Government of doing me some grave injustice or the Chair of partisanship. Contrast my attitude then with that adopted by the honorable member to-day. He indulged in a lot of mock heroics, and complained most bitterly and dramatically of the Government's refusal to make a document available for his perusal. Of course, all these grievances of the Opposition spring from the fact that they are suffering from a sense of political frustration. They have been in Opposition for nearly eight years, and there is not even a glimmer of political hope for them in the future. Indeed, they are doomed to extinction, with the Labour party in office in perpetuity. Under  those circumstances  they have to " kid " themselves that the people who are listening to the broadcast of their bedtime stories, such as those which they have been telling during this debate, will believe their tearful protestations of injustice. </para>

I was saying that I was not going to put my interpretation on the remarks made by the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture concerning the prisoners of war, but merely proposed to remind the House that the prisoners of war have placed their own interpretation on them I leave it to the people to judge what interpretation should be placed on the Minister's remarks. A circular letter was sent to me and to all my colleagues on this side of the House, and, apparently, to the Minister also, by the New South Wales Ex-Prisoners of War Association, Sydney.

Until the Minister complies with the request to withdraw the charge in the chamber in which it was made, a blemish will remain upon his reputation.

                    <para>The motion that is before the House claims that the Government is deserving of censure. The first charge contained in it is that the Government, by the use of its majority in this House, is unreasonably and improperly restricting the rights of private members and the electors that they represent. We know that that is so. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> has referred to two glaring examples of the suppression of the rights of members of this House by the Government shortly before he gave notice of his intention to propose a motion of censure. It is not often that a private member introduces a bill into the Parliament. In fact, I can remember only two or perhaps three such bills being introduced during the last fifteen years. It is the right of members of the Parliament to introduce private members' bills. </para>
                    <para class="block">The Leader of the Opposition is now seeking to avail himself of that right, not only in his personal capacity but also on behalf of the whole of  His  Majesty's Opposition. The right honorable gentleman has given notice of his intention to ask leave to introduce a bill to deal with a matter of the utmost urgency and importance. It is within the competence of the Government, recognizing that an Opposition in a British Parliament has certain rights, to provide an opportunity for that bill to be brought before the Parliament and at least to be explained if not debated to a conclusion. However, upon the decision of the Government, and, I believe, the personal decision of the Prime Minister, the bill that the right honorable gentleman desires to introduce has been placed in such a position on the notice-paper that there is no earthly hope of its objects even being explained to the Parliament. If that is not a suppression of the rights of private members by the use of the Government's majority, I do not know what is. The Leader of the Opposition referred to other instances of the rights of private members and the electors they represent being negatived by the Government's use of its majority in this House. I shall return to that matter shortly. </para>
                    <para>The second charge that is made in the motion is that the Government has disregarded the status of the Chair by permitting to remain for months on the notice-paper, partly debated but undetermined, a motion expressing want of confidence in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker.</inline> The most elementary requirement for the proper functioning of a deliberative assembly such as a British Parliament is that the Chair shall be occupied by a man of whose competence and impartiality at least a majority of the members of the assembly have no doubt. There is on the notice-paper a very strongly worded motion that was proposed by the honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> when he was acting as Leader of the Opposition. It was proposed, not by an irresponsible newcomer or backbencher, but by a spokesman of  His  Majesty's Opposition. The motion contains a grave charge- </para>

                            <para>- There is a motion on the notice-paper impugning the competence and impartiality of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker.</inline> The Government has treated that motion with contempt. It has not even sought to use its majority in the Parliament to bring the matter to a conclusion by taking a vote on it and discharging it from the notice-paper so that the Chair may be occupied by one whose competence and impartiality is not under challenge from within the Parliament. I am quite sure that this is not only without precedent in the history of this Parliament, but that it is completely in defiance of the established practices and traditions of British parliaments everywhere, to allow such a charge against a  Speaker  or  Deputy Speaker  to remain undischarged. The third count in the censure motion is, in effect, that the Government is permitting and encouraging personal, defamatory and threatening attacks upon Opposition members by Ministers, and so violating the decencies of political controversy. We know that that is true beyond argument. The records of Parliament are stiff with instances where Ministers as well as other Government supporters have made, and have continued to make from day to day, personal, defamatory attacks upon other honorable members, thus, as I have said, violating the decencies of political controversy. As the Leader of the Opposition said when he was speaking on this matter, it is not possible to dissociate the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> himself from this continued practice of his own Ministers of levelling defamatory attacks against other honorable members. We, who go into political life, are not thin-skinned. Surely none of us who come here expect to be immune from criticism. Those of us who take criticism of a legitimate kind too hardly will have a very unhappy life in politics. But surely there are some limits to criticism dictated by decency, which distinguish legitimate political criticism  from personal, scurrilous abuse and defamatory attacks. Surely if the reputation of a government is to stand examination at all, and if a government has any regard for its own reputation, we could expect that its Prime Minister would not be content to endure a continuous succession of this kind of attack by his own Ministers. Surely we should not expect the Prime Minister, when his Ministers are challenged, to stand up, as we have seen the Prime Minister do time after time, and give encouragement and incitement to them and to other Government supporters, by justifying, supporting and succouring them in every defamatory attack that they care to engage in. The final charge which is levelled in this motion is that the Government - io exhibiting a contempt for the institution of Parliament and its function as the democratic forum of the nation. </para>

                    <para class="block">The establishment of the three other charges certainly constitutes establishment of the final charge, because for a government to employ a majority of the Parliament to restrict the rights of private members and for its Prime Minister to encourage and support defamatory and intimidating attacks upon honorable members, is in itself to bring the institution of Parliament into disrespect. It is absolutely imperative, if we are to remain a well-governed country, if we are, in fact, to remain a practising democracy, that there shall be established, and continuously maintained, a respect for the institution of Parliament itself. </para>

                            <para>- In order to appreciate the reason for such a strongly worded motion of censure, honorable members ought to consider the character of this Parliament, how it is composed and what its functions are. In a parliament elected under the British democratic system there is a Government and an Opposition, the House itself being presided over by a  Speaker.  Members of the Parliament, whether they be Government supporters or members of the Opposition, have their duties, and what is no less important, their rights. The Opposition, as such, has certain established and positive rights, a fact which distinguishes our form of government from the totalitarian systems. Out of this situation arises the fact that the Parliament consists officially of  His  Majesty's Government, and also of  His  Majesty's Opposition, the latter possessing rights, limited it is true, but just as clearly recognized as those of the Government. Of all the duties that devolve upon the elected representatives of the people, none is more important than that of preserving the character of the parliamentary institution that we have inherited, and which ha9 evolved through the sacrifices of our forefathers, many of whom suffered imprisonment, and some even death, in asserting their rights. </para>

                    <para>This censure motion does not come out of the blue; it results from a long series of incidents which, taken together, provoked the Opposition to protest against an attitude of the Government. The cumulative effect of those incidents has been a lowering of the status of the Parliament, and a loss of that respect in which it should be held, together with a loss of efficiency. Those incidents culminated the other evening in the suspension of the leader of  His  Majesty's Opposition, an almost unique occurrence, which finally caused the Opposition to draw public attention to the arrogant behaviour of the Government towards the Parliament. The Leader of the Opposition was ejected from the chamber because he made three interjections. The Minister for Information <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell),</inline> in the course of his speech, said that not one Communist was installed in the " cooler " by the Menzies Government, and not one had been prosecuted. We know that that statement was not in accordance with fact, and I should be very surprised if the Minister for Information was not also aware of that.

                            <para>- The Standing Orders provide that if an honorable member is suspended from the service of the House for a second time during a session, the suspension shall be for a week, and if for a third time, the suspension shall be for a month. It may not be important to an honorable member or his constituents for him to be suspended for a day, but it would be a serious thing for him to be out of the Parliament for a week. It would certainly bc a serious thing for the Leader of the Opposition to be out of the Parliament for a week, particularly in the short period during which the Parliament will be sitting before the next general election, which will be of a critical character, a factor which has important bearing on the incident. Members of the Opposition are familiar with the attempts made to intimidate them. Only this afternoon, a Minister of the Crown attempted to make reflections on a former Minister for the Army with no purpose other than to frighten him into silence. Fresh in our memories is the attempt to intimidate the honorable member for the Northern Territory into silence. I have a vivid recollection of an attempt to intimidate the honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> into silence by saying that, during World War I., he was not a fighting soldier, hut was a clerk in the stores. The honorable member had to come into the Parliament, recount his military record and explain that he had served as a sergeant in a fighting unit. We are accustomed to attacks of that kind. One of the most recent examples of such conduct was the attempt made by the Minister for Information to intimidate and silence the honorable member for Maranoa by alleging that the honorable member had engaged in unscrupulous practices. I, too, have been the subject of intimidatory attacks of that kind. These attacks are part and parcel of the technique of the Australian Labour party, at the head of which stands the Prime Minister of Australia. Whenever we have a Blain incident, a Menzies incident, or any similar incident, the Prime Minister comes into the House to justify the intimidatory attacks of his own Ministers and, by <inline font-style="italic">so</inline> doing, incite them to continue their practices. The classic example of intimidation was the attack made on my leader, the right honorable member for Darling Downs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden),</inline> when he made a revelation which was inconvenient to the Prime Minister. Within 24 hours after he made his revelation two Commonwealth investigation officers, acting under the direction of the Prime Minister called upon the right honorable member for Darling Downs and attempted to interrogate him. </para>

                            <para>- We knew the purpose of the Prime Minister then, just as we know the purpose of other Ministers who engage in these nefarious practices. They hope to silence the Opposition but they will never succeed, no matter how often they try to do so. Consider the change that has been brought about in the procedural course followed in the Parliament on the naming of an honorable member by the Chair. Before the regime of the present Prime Minister, when an honorable member was named, all business ceased until the Prime Minister came into the chamber to move for the suspension from the service of the House of the honorable member concerned. That practice was followed by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons</inline> and by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin.</inline> Indeed, it was followed by every Prime Minister in the Commonwealth Parliament until the present Prime Minister took office. The present Prime Minister, however, signifies his contempt of parliamentary precedent and practice, and of the very institution of the Parliament itself, by not bothering to come into the House, even when a very prominent member of the Opposition has been named by the Chair. I cannot refrain from referring to the fact that during the regime of the present Prime Minister, without whose consent and approval no member of the House should be ejected from the Parliament, 21 honorable members have been ejected from the House, every one of them a member of the Opposition. Of the 21 honorable members ejected no fewer than eighteen were former Ministers or Prime Ministers of this country, which shows that the penalty of suspension has been imposed not on irresponsible or inexperienced honorable members, but to a large extent on those who have been members of the Executive Council of  His  Majesty. We take this opportunity to draw attention to this Chifley contempt for the Parliament. The motion of censure proposed by the Leader of the Opposition has the solid support of all honorable members on this side of the House. </para>

                        <para>.- It is quite obvious that this motion of , censure has been moved because the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> was ejected from the House last week for disorderly conduct. Until that incident occurred matters had been proceeding very smoothly in the chamber. This motion is being used as a counter-attack upon <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker</inline> and upon the Government because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker</inline> has done his duty in the high office that he occupies. This is the usual technique of the Opposition. Last November, three Opposition members, the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender),</inline> the honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony)</inline> and the honorable member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beale)</inline> were suspended from the services of the House within a relatively few minutes ' for disorderly conduct arising out of the same incident. Immediately, the Opposition moved a motion of no-confidence in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker</inline> which has never been excelled for malice, rashness and spite. Later, two Opposition members spoke to that motion. The honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> said that the motion was the strongest ever moved in this chamber on that subject. </para>

                    <para>Opposition members do not confine their attacks to members of this legislature. Public servants and private citizens have been the subjects of their calumny and vile innuendoes. Let us consider this newest piece of political humbug on the part of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition has accused Government members and supporters of being character assassins. That is a fine phrase. According to the right honorable gentleman, we can all be roped together and branded as character assassins because last week the Minister for Information <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> cast some reflection on the honorable member for Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Adermann).</inline> That honorable member immediately denied the Minister's allegations flatly, and there, apparently, the matter ended. Later, however, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> was asked whether he would appoint a royal commission to inquire into the Minister's statement. The Prime Minister said, as he had always said on such occasions, that members of the Parliament make their own rules for their own guidance and for the conduct of the business of this House, and that they must be prepared to abide by those rules. The Opposition has made some play on the fact that the Prime Minister refused to appoint a royal commission or a select committee. Notwithstanding the humiliation that honorable members opposite have attempted to cause <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker</inline> by the motion now on the notice-paper, the Leader of the Opposition, speaking to this motion of censure, again inferred bias and partiality on the part of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker.</inline> He said, in effect, that the Minister for Information had used words that were offensive to the honorable member for Maranoa, and that he should have been ordered to withdraw them. He then proceeded to deal with Standing Order 272. The House will recall that, when the incident occurred, the Minister for Information was reading a letter which he said he had received from a constituent of the honorable member for Maranoa. The honorable member for Maranoa interjected, " That is a lie ". J do not think that any honorable member inferred that the honorable member for Maranoa was calling the Minister a liar. He was referring to what the person had written in the letter. What he meant was that the statement contained in the letter was a lie. Without reflecting on the subsequent action of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker,</inline> I think that the words were offensive not to the Minister, but to the writer of the letter. However, the honorable member for Maranoa was called upon to withdraw the words. It is suggested now that after the honorable member for Maranoa had been called upon to withdraw his offensive epithet, the Minister, too, should have been asked to withdraw his remarks. But I point out that the Minister was not using offensive epithets. He was making statements. Rulings given in this chamber since my membership of it lead me to the conclusion that offensive epithets must not be used, but that matters can be raised by a statement of facts. Such statements may, of course, be most humiliating to the honorable  member about whom they are made. They may hurt him, but he cannot ask that they be withdrawn. If he so desires, he may later rise and make a personal explanation. Some people say that that ruling is wrong. It is a matter of opinion, but it is the precedent that has been established in this Parliament and it was followed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker</inline> at the time in question. The matter, seemingly, was then ended. But what happened after that? The Leader of the Opposition moved a motion of censure of the Government based on the charges made against the honorable member for Maranoa. Further, when speaking to his motion, he altered certain words that were used by the Minister. He magnified them, wrapped them up in his own cogent oratorical phrase " fraudulent rogue " and broadcast them throughout the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- I know the meanings of words just as well as does the honorable member for Barker. He will realize that it was objected by the Leader of the Opposition that the honorable member for Maranoa had been, referred to as " a fraudulent rogue ". Those were the words used by the right honorable member. He altered the meaning of the Minister's words, magnified them and broadcast them. The honorable member for Maranoa can scarcely be beholden to the Leader of the Opposition, who has done him a great disservice indeed. The Minister's charge against the honorable member, if it were a charge, was vague and indefinite. It was something that had been mentioned in a letter written by a person who so far remains anonymous to this House. The charges wore denied in a personal explanation, but the Leader of the Opposition, seeking to emphasize the importance of his censure motion against the Government put forward in his rhetorical manner, the cogent phrase "fraudulent rogue", and repeated his misinterpretation in a voice that made the words ring like a tocsin around the country. The Opposition has published the slander, if there was one. It has defamed itself by spreading the slander. What the Minister for Information said about the honorable member for Maranoa is the Minister's own affair. He does not consult the members of the Government party about what he proposes to say in the House. We did not encourage him to say what he said. Nevertheless, it is charged against us by the Leader of the Opposition that we did encourage him. That is not so. Furthermore, since <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker</inline> has charge of this House and controls its conduct, we cannot bo said to have permitted the Minister to make the charge. It i3 a unique and strange situation that a government should be the subject of a censure motion because of some action taken by the presiding officer. The Opposition is carrying on a feud against you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker,</inline> a most unedifying spectacle that is degrading to our parliamentary institution. The technique is simple and it may be stated in the following way: - "Quarrel with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker,</inline> and if you do not get your way, move a vote of no confidence in him. If you do not get satisfaction that way, then move a censure motion based upon the complaint and holding the Government blameworthy because rulings from the Chair do not suit you." </para>

                    <para>The Opposition alleges that the Government is improperly restricting the rights of honorable members in this House. In answer to that, I say that the Government is very sensitive about the rights and privileges of honorable members and has constantly gone out of its way to arrange that the Opposition leaders should have the limelight in the House at hours nominated by Opposition members themselves. They have demanded and have been accommodated, like prima donnas, with the most favoured broadcasting hours. Yet they say that the Government is restricting the liberties of honorable members! Every honorable member with a knowledge of the Standing Orders knows that it is possible for him to be heard in Parliament on any subject that he may care to raise. Furthermore, the present Government has met on an almost record number of days. Like most honorable members, I deplore personal attacks on individuals. There is too much of that sort of thing  from .both sides in all 'parliaments. But I do not think that the Government can reform politicians overnight. That sort of thing has been going on ever since democratic government has been established. What we can do is amend the Standing Orders to provide for disciplinary action to be taken against any honorable member who makes false statements regarding any person outside this House. I do not think that the people regard very seriously what one honorable member may say about another honorable member inside this House, because an honorable member who is maligned, can answer the charges on the spot. He has the right to counter attack here and make his reply immediately. But persons outside the House have not the same rights and privileges as we have. Irretrievable harm might be done by statements relating to people outside the Parliament. Fortunately, in my opinion, this does not often occur. However, as a member of the Standing Orders committee, I should welcome an opportunity to suggest some amendments to the Standing Orders of this House that are badly needed. Members of the public might very easily get a wrong impression of the Parliament from what they hear over the air and what they read in the newspapers. Generally there is a splendid feeling of friendship and understanding between honorable members of this House, whatever their political views happen to be, and there is no man in Australia with a more amiable, pleasant and charitable nature than that of the Prime Minister. I am sure that he would not condone an injustice of any kind. He has told honorable members opposite that, if they do not like the Standing Orders, he will be very accommodating and help them to reform the rules of conduct and debate. The censure motion is really an attack upon our Standing Orders, and the matters that have been debated have no great significance except in relation to much-needed amendments of the Standing Orders As I have said, honorable members opposite, with a knowledge of the Standing Orders as they are, can raise almost any subject that they want to air in this House. This Parliament has sat on almost a record number of occasions, and Opposition members have had plenty of time and opportunities to discuss matters in which they are interested. A member cannot be prevented from raising any matter that he wants to raise. The passing of motion; is another matter. But can honorable members opposite complain that the Government is blame-worthy because the electors did not return them with a majority in this House? The censure motion is unwarranted, unjustified, reckless, ill considered and ill advised. It deserves to be dismissed with contempt. </para>

                        <para>. '  - I have never before listened to so much humbug and nonsense in this House as was contained in the address of the honorable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline> Williams). The honorable member went to great length to explain his contention that the censure motion now before the House was intended by the Opposition to destroy the dignity of the Chair. He suggested that the Minister had every right to rely on the contents of a scandalous anonymous letter when attacking the honorable member for Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Adermann).</inline> I remind the House that the Minister prefaced his remarks by saying that he had waited for a long time to "get" the honorable member for Maranoa. That proves .conclusively that the Minister was making a premeditated attack upon the honorable member's character. The honorable member for Robertson endeavoured to show that that remark by the Minister was made merely by chance and did not mean anything. </para>

                            <para>- I withdraw the remark and hope that I shall be protected  by the Chair from any further interjections. The honorable member for Robertson then made play on the fact that when the honorable member for Maranoa used the expression, " It was a lie ", he was forced to withdraw the remark. I shall parallel that occasion with an incident that occurred earlier in this debate to-day. When the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender)</inline> made a certain statement concerning the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, although the Minister replied that it was a dastardly lie he was not called upon to withdraw that remark. If the dignity of the Chair is to be destroyed it will be done either by the Chair itself or by the Government. The honorable member for Robertson said that the Leader of the Opposition had applied his own interpretation to the statement of the Minister for Information concerning the honorable member for Maranoa and had used the words " a fraudulent rogue ". The honorable member for Robertson then said that the term " a fraudulent rogue " was not to be compared with the expression " Its a lie " which was used by the honorable member for Maranoa. He then asked what other inference could be drawn from the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition than that the honorable member for Maranoa was a " fraudulent rogue ". The honorable member for Robertson therefore appeared to be using the very technique which he asserted the Opposition was using. </para>

                    <para>I point out that all of the 21 suspensions from the service of this House during the present session have involved Opposition members,eighteen of whom were ex-Ministers. It is apparent that if there is any intimidation of Opposition members, it must be attributed to the government which takes such action with relation to the suspensions. Moreover, we have noticed repeatedly the cunning and knowing leers of honorable members on the Government side of the House when something happens to the detriment of the Opposition. In fact, this leering combined with the subsequent action usually taken by the Government, has come to be accepted by the general public. This technique and form of intimi dation is well recognized as being adopted by Ministers particularly. Not long ago the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett)</inline> was warned that if he persisted with a certain line of attack, matters associated with him would be exposed in this House. That was an attempt to prevent the honorable member from carrying out his duties. It matters not whether the implications inherent in these incidents are true or otherwise. I also recollect that on one occasion the honorable member for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blain)</inline> was told by a government official who is now occupying a high post overseas that if he did not remove a certain question from the notice-paper he would be subjected to some form of exposure with regard to his actions whilst a prisoner of war. The in timiddatory action that has been taken against the honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lang),</inline> who is subjected in this House to great personal attacks by Government members, is well known. An attempt has been made to intimidate him because- he dares to attack the Government on political lines. The honorable member for Reid has been forced to take action on his own behalf to protect himself. In the past censure motions have been moved by the Opposition against the Government 'because of acts of omission and commission. At times they have been moved because of lack of administrative action, and at other times because of some specific administrative action that has been taken. Censure motions have also been launched against the Government because of the way in which it has implemented its policy. But this is the most serious form of censure motion that can be directed against any government. It is a censure motion directed against the Government for attempting to interfere with parliamentary procedure. Indeed, the destruction of the Parliamentary institution itself is involved in our attack. There is no more serious form of censure that can be levelled against a government than that which has been adopted on this occasion. It is epitomized in the last paragraph of the motion which accuses the Government of exhibiting a contempt for the institution of Parliament as the democratic forum of the nation. Although this is the most serious form of censure possible it will not be given serious consideration by the Government. I am only the fifth member of the Opposition to be afforded an opportunity to speak on this motion, and I am confident that the Opposition will be gagged before the debate has run its full course. Being fully aware of the Government's technique, I shall be astounded if the debate is not gagged later this evening. Judging by the expression on the face of the " Minister for Gags ", he appears to be sharpening his teeth in anticipation. I am quite sure that this serious matter will be passed over in a cavalier fashion as being of no great moment. </para>
                    <para>It has been suggested by honorable members on the Government side of the House that this motion has been moved in a fit of pique because last week the Leader of the Opposition was suspended from the service of the House. That is entirely untrue. The moving of the motion may be regarded as the culmination of numerous incidents in this House which have caused the Opposition to view with concern the trend in connexion with parliamentary procedure and the maintenance of the parliamentary institution. I shall now examine the terms of the motion submitted by the Leader of the Opposition. The first paragraph of it reads - </para>

                    <para class="block">We have had some experience of the way in which the Government has used its majority in this House to restrict unreasonably and improperly the rights of private members and the electors whom they represent. The Leader of the Opposition has already made a dissertation in this matter. He pointed out that as the representative of the political parties constituting the Opposition in this chamber, he gave notice of his intention to introduce a private member's bill to amend the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act. The bill relates to a matter of considerable public importance, because it is directed against control of unions by Communists. But this Government, true to its policy and technique, decided to deny the Leader of the Opposition the right to introduce the bill, and resorted to political tactics to achieve its end. By the use of its majority, the Government ensured that government 'business should take precedence over private members' business, although only one day a month is allotted to private members to introduce bills or discuss matters of importance to their constituents. The Government also restricted the debate on " Grievance Day" last week. On such an occasion, private members have an opportunity to ventilate the grievances of their electors, but after the debate had proceeded for about an hour, the Government gagged it. Those examples demonstrate the way in which the Government is unreasonably and improperly restricting the rights of private members and the electors whom they represent. In my opinion, and, I believe, in the opinion of most thinking people, responsible government rests upon certain fundamental principles, such as the obedience of a government to the people; obedience to the tradition of collective Cabinet responsibility, and the recognition of the Parliament as the body in which the will of the people may be expressed and obeyed. But this Government has completely disregarded that principle, and it is treating the Parliament with the utmost Contempt. In a speech in this House recently, the Prime Minister said that he would determine what was to he debated and how long such a debate should proceed. Honorable members opposite may claim that the Prime Minister, as the leader of the Government, has the right to determine those matters, but I submit that the right honorable gentleman uses that right to excess. Repeatedly when bills are introduced, honorable members are told that the Government will not accept any amendments, because caucus has already considered and approved those measures. Under such conditions, this Parliament is no longer a responsible deliberative body, because supporters of the Government are pledged to follow the dictates and decisions of caucus. When the Prime Minister says that he will determine this matter  and that matter, he is disregarding the rights of His Majesty's Opposition, because he is assuming the role of a dictator, and saying, in effect, " I will determine these matters and members of the Opposition have no right whatever in this chamber, even though they represent a large number of people ". </para>
                    <para>The time allotted to me in this debate is rapidly running out, and I know that the Government will not grant me an extension of time. Therefore, I hasten to make a few observations about the second paragraph of the motion, which reads as follows: - </para>

                    <para>I have an excellent reason for referring to that matter, because I submitted that motion of no-confidence in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker.</inline> After a brief discussion, the debate was adjourned and the Government has not permitted the House to continue it. Is it to be wondered that a member of the Opposition has submitted such a motion? I remind the honorable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Williams)</inline> that the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rosevear),</inline> who is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> has violated the Standing Orders by criticizing very bitterly the justices of the High Court.

                    <para>My comment is that if the source of the stream is muddy, the stream can never run pure. I mention that matter in passing, because I have not derived any pleasure from submitting a motion of noconfidence in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker.</inline> However, I consider that I should make that observation because it gives some indication of the reasons that prompt the Opposition to criticize the Government on this occasion. </para>
                    <para>Replying to the Leader of the Opposition, the Prime Minister said that some honorable members of 'this chamber, including myself, had made charges in the House against public servants, and had gravely reflected upon private citizens. The right honorable gentleman then stated that an honorable member who made such statements in this chamber should be subject to the ordinary processes of the law. In his anxiety to defend the defamatory statement by the Minister for Information <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell),</inline> and while he was still smarting under the attack by the Leader of the Opposition, the Prime Minister forgot his own vulnerability. If his suggestion were  adopted, the Prime Minister himself might be forced to defend utterances that he has made in this chamber, which ho described as a " coward's castle in Canberra ". Honorable members will recall that, after seeking to intimidate the Leader of the Australian Country party in the secret documents . case, the Prime Minister referred to a public servant, the private secretary of the Leader of the Australian Country party, as an " urger ". The victim of that attack did not have the right to defend himself in this chamber. The general meaning of " urger " is a  low-down heel ", the " lowest of the low, found on race-courses ", or a " tout ". The Prime Minister was well aware of the implication that might be placed upon his use of that term. But the right honorable gentleman did not stop there. This Simon Pure of politics referred to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Simon</inline> Isaacs, who was conducting tha defence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. "Jock"</inline> Garden in the New Guinea timber lease case, as a " larrikin lawyer ". The Prime Minister made that statement, not outside the House, but in this so-called " coward's castle". What is a "larrikin"? _ The dictionary states that a larrikin is an Australian hooligan. If the Prime Minister were to repeat outside the Parliament the remark that he made concerning <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Isaacs</inline> he would probably find himself in a court of law.  His  scathing reference to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Isaacs</inline> not only antagonized the bar but also aroused resentment in five members of the jury that was empanelled to try Garden on a charge of forgery. The jurors concerned said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Isaacs</inline> did his job well, and commented favorably on his conduct of the case. I venture to say to the Prime Minister that if the parliamentary privilege that he has criticized had not been operating when he made those references he would in all probability have been the defendant in an action for defamation. The right honorable gentleman, who visualizes himself as an Australian edition of the homespun Lincoln, and sets himself up as a Simon Pure, would establish one rule for himself and another for other honorable members. The right honorable gentleman should reflect upon his own utterances before he castigates other honorable members for the statements that they have made in this House. </para>
                    <para>How did the Prime Minister react to the Mountjoy case? Honorable members will remember that in 1945 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mountjoy,</inline> who was then a member of this House, and is now a member of the Executive of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, placed a question on the notice-paper which implied that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline> R. de Barclay, the secretary of the Sane Democracy League, held an interest in a select house of assignation in Sydney, and that he was also financially interested in what was described as " a similar business at King's Cross". Can any one imagine a more dastardly assertion, particularly when Mountjoy must have realized that the tenant, apart altogether from the owner of the premises, must suffer for the libel? Indeed, the tenant wrote to me and said that he had no knowledge whatever of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. de</inline> Barclay and, of course, indignantly repudiated the other allegations. The statement was defamatory, not only of de Barclay, but also of the owner of the premises. How did the Prime Minister react to that incident? Did he discipline <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mountjoy?</inline> No, he gave him a position on the former Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, which was a position of trust and one of the highest posts in the public service. When the incident to which I have referred took place I attacked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mountjoy</inline> in the House. Do honorable members suggest that conduct such as his should go unchallenged ? The Prime Minister made no attempt to dis- cipline  the honorable member for Lang <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mulcahy)</inline> for the slanderous statements that he made concerning the honorable member for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blain).</inline> Indeed, the Prime Minister went out of his way to advise the honorable member for Lang that he should not speak in the House on the matter because he alleged that the Leader of the Opposition had " double-crossed " him. The right honorable gentleman knew perfectly well that there was not the slightest foundation for the statements made by the honorable member for Lang concerning the honorable member for the Northern Territory, who was a man of excellent character and possessed an impressive record of service in two wars. Eventually, of course, the honorable member for Lang had to retract his baseless allegation, but I emphasize that he did so only after the Privileges Committee had inquired into the matter and made a certain recommendation. The Prime Minister did not emerge too well from that incident. The right honorable gentleman, also criticized me for having made statements in the House from time to time concerning certain matters. I made those statements because I believed that the matters to which they related were scandals that should be exposed in the public interest. The duty of revealing such matters devolves more upon members of the Opposition than upon supporters of the Government because, as the Prime Minister appears to have forgotten, the purpose of the official Opposition is to exercise a check upon the activities of the government of the day. I remind the right honorable gentleman that had I not exposed those scandals, which reflected most unfavorably upon the Government and some of its members, the public might never have learned of them. Take, for example, the Keane trunks case. Trunks containing £1,230 worth of dutiable goods were seized by the customs. Those goods belonged to the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keane,</inline> who, until his death a short time previously, had been Minister for Trade and Customs. I first raised this matter during the election campaign, and outside the House. I was liable to the full force of law. </para>

                            <para>- I made a number of statements in connexion with the Keane trunks case outside the House, and my allegations were not challenged. I asked questions in the House concerning the matter, and the Government admitted that the information on which my questions were based was correct. The Government has taken no action to make a thorough investigation of that matter, which can only be regarded as a public scandal. The reason why I revealed that scandal was that it was a matter of very serious public concern, and it was necessary that it should he exposed. However, the Prime Minister suggested that we should have remained silent about it. To have done so would have been to betray the trust that we hold as the official Opposition, and indeed to have condoned the offence. </para>

                    <para>Consider  the  case of the honorable member for Watson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Falstein),</inline> which was another matter that probably irked the Prime Minister. In 1945 or 1946, the honorable member, who is a barrister-at-law, was given a licence to import £2,700 worth of Swiss watches. At that time regular jewellers and watchmakers could not obtain watches or watch parts. Does the right honorable gentleman suggest to-day that I should not have exposed that matter? If so, then I should like to know exactly why the Prime Minister, as head of his political party, took action to withhold from the honorable member the endorsement of the Australian Labour party for the forthcoming election. I am not dealing in any detail with the matters that I have mentioned, but they are most pertinent to the criticism that the Prime Minister has made of my actions. Let me deal for a moment with the dismissal, in April, 1947, of four officials of the Prices Branch. Some of those officials were prosecuted as the result of the revelations that I made. Had I not exposed the malpractices of the officials concerned, who were employed to protect the public by ensuring that butchers did not retail meat at more than the fixed price, a number of housewives would ultimately have had to pay higher prices for their meat to offset the cost of the bribes given to the officials concerned. Does the Prime Minister suggest that I should have remained silent and permitted the housewives to be exploited? Let me recall another scandal connected with the sale by the Commonwealth Disposals Commission of surplus military clothing. That clothing was sold to a dealer as rags. The honorable member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini),</inline> who was a member of the Government at that time, was involved in the matter, .because the commission was under the control of the department that he administered. The malpractices of certain individuals were exposed by the materials officer, who gave me permission to use his name. When I referred to the matter in the House I quoted his name, and his allegations were supported by members of the Minister's own advisory panel. The officers responsible for disclosing those dishonest practices were dismissed, and although some of them were subsequently reinstated, the honorable member for Werriwa had to admit that most of the allegations made against his administration were justified. Furthermore, the operations of the Commonwealth Disposals Commission were severely criticized in a report of the Auditor-General. Because of that criticism the Government appointed an officer to investigate matters, but he did not even deem it worth his while to get in touch with my informant before he furnished a white-washing report. Does the Prime Minister suggest that rackets of that kind by which the Australian taxpayers were defrauded should not be exposed ? </para>
                    <para>I turn now to the disclosure that I made that the Commonwealth Disposals Commission had sold aircraft to an individual who was one of the legal owners of Marx House,  which is the head-quarters of the Australian Communist party. That individual was then the managing director of an airline company known as Asian Airlines Proprietary Limited. I remind the House that for some time Asia has been the hunting ground of Communists, and that as the result of their activities, revolt and murder were at that time replacing the orderly rule of law in Malaya. Does the Prime Minister suggest that that disclosure should not have been made? The articles of association of the company that I have mentioned are available for inspection at the office of the Registrar-General in Sydney, where any one may inspect them after payment of a search fee. An examination of those documents revealed that the company intended to conduct an air service to Asian countries. Let me recall the incident that arose following the disclosures that I made. As I explained to the House on a former occasion, I was misled by an officer of the Commonwealth Investigation Service, who led me to believe that four individuals who were associated with the company were Communists, and I made that assertion in this House. Later, when I learned that I had been misled concerning those four individuals, I made amends by revealing the facts to the House, and I tendered a public apology to the men concerned. The statements that I made in the Parliament were, of course, privileged, and I was under no compulsion to apologize for them. Yet, in justice to the individuals concerned I declined to take advantage of a " coward's castle " to let the mud, which I had thrown, stick, and I took the honorable course of withdrawing the allegations that I had made. </para>
                    <para>A peculiar psychology appears to have been developed in Government circles since Labour has been in office. The policy pursued by members and supporters of the Administration is : " Save the Government's name at all cost, even if it involves covering up malpractices and irregularities. Above all, never hold a royal commission into anything, no matter how bad it seems, because royal commissions can call evidence on oath, and some nasty facts might be adduced against us in that way ". The only occasion when an exception to that rule is made occurs when the Government feels assured that if a royal commission is appointed its report will be favorable to it. The present Government, which <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> pledged to implement socialism, and intends ultimately to replace the Parliament, which is a democratic institution, by a supreme economic council to rule the " planned state," has no sympathy for an Opposition in the Parliament. In its view the Opposition is a stumbling block to the fulfilment of the Government's plans to socialize completely the means of production, distribution and exchange. The kernel of  thi9  motion is that the Government is exhibiting a contempt for the institution of Parliament and its function as a democratic forum of the nation. This is the most serious censure motion that has ever been launched against an Australian Government. It transcends administration and policy and goes down to the root of the matter. Does the Government intend to preserve the procedures and traditions of parliamentary institutions, or does it intend to destroy them? I believe that every action that has been taken by this Government, every leering look of honorable members opposite that has accompanied a decision unfavourable to the Opposition and every form of intimidation of members of the Opposition that it has indulged in form part of a pattern. This motion should be carried. I believe that the people are fed up with this Government and wish to see the institution of parliament restored to democratic lines. </para>

                        <para>. - Whether the people  of  this country are fed up with this Government or whether they still hold the Opposition in the contempt in which they have held it for the last eight years will be determined within a few months.  I  have no doubt that the Government's record in regard to administration, legislation and the conduct of the business  of  Parliament will be adjudged by the people to be better than that of any anti-Labour government that has preceded it. Honorable members opposite are working themselves up into a fine frenzy. We have just heard the honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison),</inline> in a somewhat ecstatic mood, plead the cause  of his party in the interests of parliamentary freedom. When the Prime Minister described this motion as a curious one, ha was being charitable. The right honorable gentleman might well have described it as both curious and spurious. There is nothing in either this motion or in the motion that has been submitted by the honorable member for Wentworth concerning you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker,</inline> that is not part of a smear campaign against the Government commanding as it does a majority of the votes of the electors of the country. The thing that is wrong with honorable gentlemen opposite, is that they are in the outer darkness of opposition and are unable to do the things that they did when they formed the Government of Australia. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The first portion of the motion that is before the House alleges that the Government, by the use of its majority, is unreasonably and improperly restricting the rights of private members. I have had some figures taken out which show how the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, Fifteenth, Sixteenth, Seventeenth and Eighteenth Parliaments of the Commonwealth  have  been conducted. During the lifetimes of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth Parliaments, from 1932 to 1940, the House met on 477 days. During the Sixteenth, Seventeenth and Eighteenth Parliaments - and I remind honorable members that the Labour party was in office for only two of the three years of the life of the Sixteenth Parliament - the House has met on 582 days, and the sittings have not yet finished. During the sittings of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Parliaments, when we were in Opposition, seventeen members of the Labour party were suspended. Nobody was suspended during the sittings of the Sixteenth Parliament. During the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Parliaments there have been 21 suspensions of honorable members opposite, some of them being for second offences. The suspensions have been accompanied by mock heroics and very often have been imposed as a result of the gangster tactics adopted by honorable gentlemen opposite in organizing themselves to shout down Government speakers. On one occasion three honorable members were suspended in one evening. Those are the people who talk about their conduct! During the sittings of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth Parliaments, when the anti-Labour parties were in power, the gag was applied on 171 occasions. Although the Sixteenth, Seventeenth and Eighteenth Parliaments have sat for 582 days, the Labour Government has applied the gag on only 77 occasions. When the anti-Labour parties were in power the gag was applied, on an average, once every three days, but it has been applied by us only once every fifteen days. Honorable gentlemen opposite, these paragons of parliamentary virtue, claim that they have not been given an opportunity to speak on " Grievance Day ". Listeners throughout the Commonwealth could be misled into believing that anti-Labour governments scrupulously honored a system of having a " Grievance Day " once every month. During the Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth Parliaments, when the anti-Labour parties were in office, there were only 26 "Grievance Days ". During the sittings of the Sixteenth, Seventeenth and Eighteenth Parliaments there have been 27 " Grievance Days ". Honorable members opposite have very little to complain about therefore, on that score. At the end of every sitting day the motion for the adjournment of the House provides an opportunity for honorable members opposite to make statement regarding administration, to suggest legislation or to deal with any matter about which they feel strongly. The honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> does not regularly take advantage of that opportunity. I think I heard him talk on one occasion about Phelan's  greyhound dog. During the 582 days on which the Sixteenth, Seventeenth and Eighteenth Parliaments have sat, honorable members opposite have exercised their right to speak on the motion on the adjournment of the House on only 75 occasions. </para>

                            <para>- I do not propose to wake them up. They have failed to utilize their opportunities because of their own physical indolence and their own intellectual sterility. When the antiLabour parties were in power they did not hesitate to apply the "guillotine", which was their favorite weapon. It was almost as popular with them as it was with the revolutionaries in the time of the French revolution. In those days many Labour members who wished to address the House were, owing to the operation of the " guillotine ", unable to do so. In the Fourteenth Parliament, the first Lyons Government applied the " guillotine " sixteen times. The Lyons Government and the Menzies Government applied it on six occasions during the life of the Fifteenth Parliament. It was not applied during the sittings of the Sixteenth Parliament because the anti-Labour parties did not have the necessary numbers to enable them to do so. </para>

                            <para>- We got the numbers later, and that is why honorable gentlemen opposite are where they are to-day. In the Seventeenth Parliament, we applied the "guillotine" on four occasions only, and in the Eighteenth Parliament we have applied it very lightly. Honorable members opposite want to maintain the pretence that we are denying them liberty of expression. We give them every opportunity to express their views,  but  they are either incapable of taking  advantage  of the opportunity or are unwilling to do so. On the 24th September, 1935, when the Labour party was in opposition, a want of confidence motion  based  upon a number of grounds was subknitted. The first ground was the flagrant  neglect  by the Lyons Government of its duty to the people by failing to call the  Parliament  together on more than 39 days in twelve months. The anti-Labour parties had large majorities in both Houses of the Parliament at that time, when 300.000 decent Australians were hawking their labour from factory gate to factory gate or walking the roads of this country. The people who were in power in those days wanted to keep the Parliament in recess so that the democratic members of the Parliament would have no opportunity to draw attention to the shocking sufferings of a very large but worthwhile section of the Australian people. Yet we hear this talk of negation of opportunity, and even in the motion it is stated that the Government - </para>

                    <para class="block">Among other things, honorable members opposite say that the Government has not brought forward for further discussion a motion of no confidence directed against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker (Mr. Clark).</inline> That portion of the motion itself is the quintessance  of everything that is indecent in political life. It represents just a smear campaign against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker.</inline> There is no foundation for any of the charges contained in the motion, yet honorable members opposite ask why we do not bring it forward and have it disposed of. They say that such delays should not occur. We can apply that criterion to events of the past. The honorable and distinguished member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard),</inline> who is a very brilliant member of this Parliament, on the 1st June, 1939, gave notice of motion of dissent from the ruling of the then <inline font-weight="bold">Speaker, Sir George</inline> Bell. That item was still on the notice paper on the 14th March, 1940, nine months later, without having been discussed once, and the prorogation of the Parliament wiped the notice-paper clean with that undiscussed notice of motion still on it. Yet those honorable gentlemen opposite who assisted in such acts tell us that we have been very unfair to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker</inline> by not discharging the motion regarding him. I ask the House and those, listening on the radio all over Australia to judge the truth or falsity  of that statement. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> has been attacked to-night. Yet, I say, he is the mostdignified member of this chamber, and suffers the provocation, the attacks and the innuendoes of honorable members opposite, with a quiet dignity that they might try to emulate. The honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> to-night attacked the Prime Minister for calling <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Simon</inline> Isaacs a "larrikin lawyer ". I leave <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Issacs</inline> to the tender care of the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> at a later date. </para>

                            <para>- That will be the night! The honorable member for Wentworth, who is so glib of tongue and such a self-righteous individual - when it comes to making attacks the halo seems to fit too  tightly  on his head - talked about what has frequently been called the Keane trunks case. I remember when he first raised that matter in this House. He asked a question about it on the 7 th November, 1946, and another on the following day. On the same night he also spoke on it during the adjournment debate. On the 13th November, 1946, he again asked a question, and a week later he asked another question, on the same subject. He asked a further question on it on the 27th March, 1947. He has repeatedly trudged through mud and slime from the front Opposition bench to the opposition side of the table to pour his bucket of filth on the memory of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keane.</inline> He did so again on the 31st October, 1947, on the 6th November, 1947, the 18th February, 1948, and the 27th February, 1948. The honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> also raised that matter in this chamber, but not in the same indecent fashion. The honorable member for Wentworth knew, when he spoke about the Keane trunks case - and ho spoke with great malevolence - that he was besmirching the memory of a man who was dead, that nobody could take an action against him because a dead man cannot be libelled. The honorable member for Wentworth had no right to use the word " Keane " in connexion with charges that allegedly affected the activities of public servants. By doing so he has smeared the name of the late senator, knowing full well that 90 per cent, of the articles contained in those trunks were purchased after <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keane</inline> died. The invoices prove that. He raised the same matter again to-night, quite gratuitously, and claimed that he had done a virtuous act by raising it.  His  actions have proved that the Prime Minister was right when he condemned him for the manner in which he has attacked honorable members both inside and outside Parliament, and also other people. I should have thought that he was the last man that the Opposition would choose to raise issues of this sort. The attack that he has made by implication upon the honorable member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini)</inline> was scandalous. He said that an officer had come and told him certain things, and as a result of what he had said in this House charges were made against certain officers, who were disciplined. The truth of the matter is that the officer who ran like a cur to him, thereby violating his own oath of office, was not a very respectable citizen anyhow. The honorable member for Werriwa, as the Minister in charge of the Commonwealth Salvage Commission, actually had an inquiry made, and completed, and the whole matter cleaned up six weeks before the honorable member for Wentworth raised the subject in the House. What the honorable gentleman did was to rake through garbage cans and throw a few of the diseased morsels he had fished out across the table of this House: Then the honorable member raised the subject of the secret documents. I was wondering when the Opposition would return to that matter again. But the less honorable members opposite say about it in future, the better for them. </para>

                            <para>- We know the criminals whom the Opposition employed to obtain them. Honorable members opposite have talked a lot about the characters of members of their own side. But they laugh with smug satisfaction when their <inline font-style="italic">de facto</inline> leader, the honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lang)</inline> attacks both honorable members and people outside this House. They  offered no protest when the honorable member for Reid attacked at least twelve reputable people, and called them Communists. As a result of that attack one person commited suicide. Honorable members opposite believe that such actions are fair and proper. All their attacks are designed to try to besmirch the record of this Government and its supporters. Last week the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> glared around this chamber, and waving his finger cut the air, in all directions, and said, regarding a statement from this side of the House, " This is character assassination worthy of the Communists ". The Communists have a lot to learn about whispering campaigns and character assassination from members of the Liberal party, who have been at it all their lives. Statements by the honorable member for Wentworth to-night against the honorable member for Watson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Falstein),</inline> who, he noticed, was not in the chamber when he made them, were false and improper. The honorable member for Watson will have his opportunity to say all he wants to say about that later. </para>

I hope that the honorable gentleman will not interject again. I made certain statements the other evening, and some honorable members opposite say that the motion now before the Chair is the outcome of that incident. Other members of the Opposition, however, including the honorable member for Wentworth, say that the motion arises out of a series of statements and incidents over the last two years. They say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> has discriminated in favour of the Labour party. Well, he has never favoured me or any other Minister. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender)</inline> ha3  nothing to complain of. The night he was thrown out of the House he deserved it; he should have been thrown out hours earlier. Honorable members opposite get plenty of warning before being dealt with, and the fact is that they are dealt with fairly, not savagely. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker (Mr. Clark)</inline> himself has been the victim of the Standing Orders. I remember when the honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lang),</inline> in the most dastardly fashion, attacked the honorable member for Darling, who is the  Deputy Speaker,  alleging that he was doing certain work for his father in this Parliament. It was ruled by the Chair that the honorable member for Darling could do no more than make a personal explanation. He was not entitled to demand the withdrawal of the statement. Honorable members opposite have claimed that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker</inline> has so twisted the proper interpretation of the Standing Orders as to prevent members of the Opposition from being heard; but, as I have pointed out, Government supporters also have suffered. I did, myself, only the other day. The honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett)</inline> made a particularly vicious and scandalous interjection while I was speaking. I tried next day to make a personal explanation, because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker</inline> ruled that I had no right to demand a withdrawal of the statement. The same day, the honorable member for Henty did withdraw the statement, and apologized, but he prefaced his explanation by saying that he believed his statement to be true when he made it. I say now that he never believed it to be true. He then made another outrageous statement, but I was told that I had no right to demand the withdrawal of that statement either. All I could do was to make a personal explanation, so I decided instead to treat the honorable member with the contempt he deserves. I cite those instances in order to show that honorable members opposite have no reason to claim that they have been improperly or unfairly treated. If they get into trouble it is because they get themselves into it. Some honorable members, if they had justice, would have been suspended for eight days for second offences. </para>

                            <para>- I have every hope that the electors will see to that at the next election. I come now to some of the remarks made by the Leader of the Australian Country party, who is one of those self-righteous persons who talks a great deal, but is himself quite irresponsible. He said the other night that the Leader of the Opposition should not have been suspended. Well, that was, perhaps, an unfortunate occurrence. Perhaps it would have been better if things had not gone that way, but no one can say that the Leader of the Opposition was badly treated. He was asked twice to cease interjecting, but failed to do so. He should have obeyed the direction of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker,</inline> and conformed to the Standing Orders. He has been given quite a character build-up by his supporters, and by the press, as one who behaves with great dignity in the House. Well, he has offended in the past, and so have I, and may the Lord forgive me. But the Leader of the Australian Country party, who himself offends very often, and who only to-day had to withdraw a statement that he made, had the temerity to castigate a number of honorable members on this side of the House. My colleague, the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman),</inline> interjected after the Leader of the Australian Country party had said that the Leader of the Opposition was named for having made two very pertinent interjections. I quote the following from notes which I took at the time: - </para>

I have no objection to the honorable member for Warringah looking after his profession, because he will need it before very long. I could quote some of the things the honorable member has said in this House and outside it. I could quote some of the things that have been said on the subject of communism, and I could refer to the smear campaigns against honorable members on this side of the House. When the honorable member for Warringah mentioned the Keane trunks case outside this House, he did not have the courage to name one public servant who, it was claimed, had been guilty of malpractice. The honorable member knows, of course, that the making of airy charges in general terms does not carry with it any risk of having to defend an action in the courts. The honorable member is one of the most vulnerable in this House when it comes to mud-slinging and the besmirching of characters. </para>

The newspaper did not misreport him, and the only interpretation that can be put on the statement, in the circumstances in which it was made, is that he was referring to the Australian Labour Government. This irresponsible, dishonest Government! But he said, " Oh ! I was not referring to this Government; I was talking about the Queensland Government, which had allegedly gerrymandered the electorates ". Where is there in his statement anything which by inference, innuendo or any other interpretative process could be regarded as referring directly or indirectly to the Queensland Government? He undoubtedly meant this Government, and he ran away from the charge. It is said that he is an honorable man, but I do not believehis statement that he was referring to the Queensland electoral redistribution scheme, nor does any honorable member of this House believe it, except those who want to do so. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Turnbull)</inline> would believe anything. The statement of the honorable member for Maranoa was a scandalous attack on this Government. If any one wants to charge a member of this Government with dishonesty, let him name the honorable member and the occasion. We have nothing of which to be ashamed. No member of this Government could be arraigned before the bar of public opinion, or anywhere else, for dishonest practices in the administration of his office. Honorable members opposite have worked themselves up into a paroxysm of simulated hate, a mere exhibition of ham acting led by the Leader of the Opposition and concluded by the honorable member for Wentworth. Their case is very weak because they have nothing with which to support it. All I have to say is that if, ultimately, a royal commission is appointed to inquire into activities of the Queensland Peanut Board - and I notice in last Sunday's issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Truth</inline> that there is a demand for a royal commission to inquire into the administration of the Peanut Board on a number of charges - I shall ask the man who wrote me the letter to give evidence before, and to subject himself to examination and criticism by, the royal commission. The charges made by honorable members opposite against the Government in this censure motion are fallacious. The allegations made toy the Leader of the Opposition and by the Leader of the Australian Country party and their supporters are not justified by the facts and do not even have an air of verisimilitude to lend them support. The Leader of the Opposition is a past master in the use of invective. I am not so bad myself, but I could take a few lessons from the right honorable gentleman when he is stirred up, or wants to appear to be stirred up. He said that I had made a most offensive and derogatory remark about the Leader of the Australian Country party. I had drawn attention to the fact that the Leader of the Australian Country party had spoken about the " Scullin " depression and I said that to make such a remark was dishonest. If there was one man whose hands were clean at the time of the depression, it was the right honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin).</inline> That right honorable gentleman is too ill to appear here and defend himself. Indeed, he will most likely never again appear in this House as he is to retire at the end of this Parliament. If any member of Parliament or of a government was responsible for the depression, in my view it was the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page).</inline> He was the man who floated loans in order to pay interest on loans that were still unpaid. I said that a man who borrowed money to pay interest on other borrowed money was guilty of an act which, if it were done in the operations of a company, would have resulted in his being put in gaol, and that it was a financial policy of that kind which was the very cause of the depression. </para>

                            <para>- We all know thai over-borrowing in London was one of the prime causes of the depression which the right honorable member for Cowper has falsely called the " Scullin " depression. I also said that the right honorable gentleman left office with an exhausted loan market and an empty treasury. I said, too, that he had been called the " tragic Treasurer " by one of his colleagues, the father of the present honorable member for Henty. Because I made these observations I was attacked for having made most offensive and derogatory remarks. </para>

                        <para>.- It is not my intention to compete with the Minister for Information <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> in vituperation and abuse.  His  speech speaks for itself, and is reason enough for the motion now before the chair. Before I speak to the motion of censure which I wholeheartedly support, I wish to answer one or two remarks by the Minister which otherwise might go unanswered. First, I wish to refer to the Labour theme song of the depression, when men were walking the streets unable to get work and our returned servicemen could not get employment, and the charge that responsibility for that depression rested upon the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page).</inline> That, of course, is a gross misstatement of the facts. Everybody knows that the depression was worldwide, and that the Labour Government came into power by deluding the people into thinking that it would remedy that state of affairs. How utterly inept it was is shown by the fact that the lowest depths of the depression were reached during the regime of the Scullin Government. At the succeeding election the indignant people swept the Labour Government from office, and the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> lost his seat in the process. I make these remarks because the Minister for Information, who said that he respects the feelings of others who are not in the Parliament to-day, does not respect the memory of the very distinguished husband of the honorable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons), who took office following the defeat of the Scullin Government. The honorable gentleman also said that in this Parliament we can speak about any subject we choose. The Prime Minister spoke in a similar strain. They know very well that although they may deceive the people by statements of that kind they cannot deceive honorable members. They know that no discussion may ensue on any subject which is included on the notice paper. The very matters about which the Leader of the Opposition has complained in his motion of censure, which concern the honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony),</inline> who objected to a ruling given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker</inline> ; a motion moved by the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mrs. Blackburn),</inline> relating to the initiative, referendum and recall; a motion of want of confidence in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy</inline> Speaker; and a private member's bill that the Leader of the Opposition has given notice of his intention to introduce, are all on the notice-paper, and some of them have been listed for months, and cannot be discussed. Thus, honorable members may not discuss any matter they choose. Particularly does that apply to a private member. The Minister boasted of the number of days on which this House has  sat.No doubt the number of volumes and the thousands of pages of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> that he and others have filled is something to gloat about or of which to be proud. Can they be proud that this Government has brought us to the state we are in to-day? Can they be proud of the long list of matters on the notice-paper about which we are forbidden to speak? It is regrettable that such a motion of censure as that moved by the Leader of the Opposition should be necessary in order to draw attention to the state of affairs that exists in this Parliament. How necessary that motion is, was shown by the speech which the Minister has just concluded. The terms of the motion are as follows: - </para>

Repeatedly, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> introduces legislation, stands at the table with folded arms, and says, " The Government will accept no amendments ". The Minister for Postwar Reconstruction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> used those words when he introduced the Re-establishment and Employment Bill in this chamber. That was a most important measure to ex-servicemen. The Minister sneered at the 35 amendments that were prepared by the Opposition. </para>

                            <para>- Later the Minister introduced some Government amendments on the lines of those that had been urged unsuccessfully by the Opposition. It is extraordinary that since the Labour Government assumed office, nearly eight years ago, only Opposition members of this chamber have been suspended from the service of the House. The total of suspensions is 21, and of that number eighteen were ex-Ministers, who were fully aware of the responsibilities, rights and privileges of Parliament. By some strange circumstance, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker, Mr. Deputy Speaker,</inline> or whoever named those honorable members, seemed to overlook the fact that Government members may sometimes err. Tirades of personal abuse reward Opposition members who make what they regard as proper criticisms of the Government. We have heard the judiciary maligned in this House by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> who left his chair and spoke from the floor of the House. Such utterances pass unreproved by the Prime Minister. When the right honorable gentleman was asked whether he approved of statements made by one of his Ministers in the Sydney Domain about the High Court, he made no comment. Such attacks are condoned by the Prime Minister. They are made under the privilege of Parliament - a privilege that protects honorable members against the legal redress of action for slander. But that privilege is being abused in a manner that makes this chamber merely a cowards' castle. We pride ourselves that we are a democratic people and the inheritors of a fine British concept of freedom, liberty, and fair government; yet the fundamentals of that great freedom are being whittled away. The three essentials of a free country are first, a free parliament elected by the people at free elections and by a secret ballot; secondly, an Executive that is responsible to the people; and thirdly, a judiciary which must be above reproach. Any whittling away of those fundamentals leads to despotism. Some Ministers in their craze for power have become petty despots. Having had an opportunity to push people around, they believe that they can go on doing it, but such action leads to tyranny in the Russian pattern, and finally, to the serfdom of a slave State. I say deliberately that Labour would abolish the Parliament. That is laid down in the objectives of the party drawn up at the conference of 1921. At that meeting, the Labour party adopted the Marxist maxim, " socialization of the means of industry, production, distribution and exchange ". That is precisely what Karl Marx advocated. That too, is the ultimate objective of the Communists. Every member of the Labour party has pledged himself to work to that end. In a recent broadcast from Tasmania, the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna)</inline> said that that objective had been reaffirmed regularly for 28 years. Of course, honorable members opposite say very little about socialism to-day because election time is near, and they hope that the people will forget the grab at the banks, the airlines, and the shipping companies, the harassing regulations, the soaring prices and the planned centralization that is making the people of the Commonwealth the mere puppets of a bureaucracy. The Prime Minister said in the House last week, "We do not intend to socialize everything. We shall be selective. We shall pick and choose ". The Minister for Health, who is seeking to reduce the doctor-patient relationship to the status of a squad of " vets." attending to a mob of cattle, has said that the Labour party does not seek to abolish private ownership ns an instrument of production so long as that instrument is utilized in a socially useful manner and without exploitation. Apparently, should the Labour Government receive a mandate at the next election, business people will have to prove to it that their undertakings are socially useful. If not, they will be socialized. That will be the fate of any industry, large or small. We shall have a completely socialized State. That is the policy of honorable members opposite to-day, and it is the qualification that they are quoting as if to prove that they are not complete socialists but only acting to save the people from exploitation. An essential feature of our parliamentary system whether it is in the Mother of Parliaments in Great Britain, or here, is that members of Parliament are not delegates but representatives. On that point there is a vital difference between Labour members and members of the anti-socialist Opposition. Labour members are chained to an outside body. About 40 years ago, Alfred Deakin said that the Labour caucus resembled a chain gang of deaf mutes at the funeral of their own liberty. How right he was, except of course that they are not so mute to-day! </para>

The Labour party cannot continue to delude the people, in spite of its propaganda. The people can be fooled for some of the time, but not all of the time. Labour members are delegates from an outside body. They are tied to the trades hall and to the violent, militant Communists in the Labour unions upon whom they depend for their continued membership of this chamber. They are not true representatives of the people. That is why the Prime Minister refused last week to permit this House to discuss private members' business. Private members' day is the one day on which rank and file members of this chamber have an opportunity to bring forward matters of importance. I remind the House that two of the greatest legislative enactments of the House of Commons were sponsored by private members. The abolition of slavery within the British Empire - not within Russia, because it still exists there - was brought about by a private member's motion introduced in the House of </para>

                            <para>- I know that I must not debate it, but I am making clear the purpose of the proposal. A discussion of that proposal in this House would, of course, embarrass the Labour Government, which professes to stand for the rights of working men. It knows that enactment of the proposed bill would liberate the unionists and let them regain proper control of their organizations. Therefore, the Prime Minister moved that government business should take precedence and scurvily had the matter removed from its position on the notice paper and listed for debate at some future date. That is the way in which the Labour Government behaves in this Parliament. It is afraid to face criticism of its administration. In my opinion, we could improve the Parliament a great deal by ensuring more frequent discussion of private members' motions.

                    <para>I want to be constructive in my criticisms, and I suggest that this House could well adopt a standing order that applies in the British House of Commons. If a member of that House is maligned by another member he may rise in his place, taking precedence over the man then speaking, and make his explanation there and then. We have seen what happens in this Parliament. The Minister for Information defamed the  well-esteemed  honorable member for Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Adermann),</inline> than whom there is no more popular person in the Parliament. When the honorable member interjected in his own defence, he was forced to withdraw what he had said and was not permitted to make a personal explanation until later. The report of his personal explanation will appear in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> at a much later page than the attack made by the Minister, and the broadcast of his remarks may not have been heard by many of th» people who heard the vituperative assault by the Minister. The Standing Orders Committee would be well advised to consider an amendment of the Standing Orders to provide honorable members victimized in that way with an opportunity to make an immediate explanation. Our own Standing Order 272 states - </para>

                    <para class="block">How often is that standing order ignored in this House ! Almost every speech made by an honorable member on the Government side of the House' in this debate has included a vilification of some honorable member on this side of the House, or has referred in scathing terms to statements that may have been made years ago. There is a saying in the armed forces that bad troops indicate bad officers. That  applies  in this Parliament. The Prime Minister cannot remain aloof. By his silence he has condoned the action oi every Minister who has made defama tory statements in this House. He must share responsibility for those statements with the men who uttered them; he countenances their calumnies if he does not reprove them. </para>

I am not being unduly critical when I remind him, as kindly as possible, that Abraham Lincoln, who certainly was not a socialist, said that government of the people by the people, for the people, should not perish. The emphasis in that famous statement was upon the people. Lincoln had no thought of government of the people by the caucus for the Labour party to please Communists. But that is the sort of government that we have in Australia to-day ! The right honorable gentleman might well take to heart some of Abraham Lincoln's maxims, which recently came to light when his son, upon his death, released many historic papers. I commend these samples to the Prime Minister in the hope that he may adopt a different attitude towards the Parliament - </para>

                    <para class="block">The Prime Minister's answer to the notable speech made by the Leader of the Opposition was more or less to say, in his characteristic way, "It's all in the game ". That was not the sort of answer that the Prime Minister of a great country should have given. He should uphold the dignity and decorum of this Parliament. Instead, he has allowed the prestige of this institution to decline and be debased by many utterances that have fallen from the lips of members of his Government, including some of the very senior Ministers. Unfortunately, it seems useless to read homilies or to exhort the Prime Minister, who, incidentally, is not in the House at present, haying left only a handful of his followers to play the game and help to conduct the pro ceedings of the House as they should be conducted. Only an election can influence the right honorable member. We shall have a vital election soon. This Government has already taken us a long way along the road, of socialism without having a proper mandate to do so. If it achieves a mandate at the election, there will be a swift acceleration of ite pace and the people will soon learn their fate and will deserve it. The next election will, in fact, be a referendum on our liberty. The Parliament is in the twilight. In 1921, when the Labour party adopted the Marxist maxim about socialization, it also declared that it would approve of the establishment of a supreme economic council to replace this Parliament. That is the Soviet system. Yet it was adopted in principle by. the Labour party in this country, not by Russia or any of its satellite .states, and it is reaffirmed by the Labour party every year. The declaration was included in that infamous decision that the Australian Labour party made at Brisbane in 1921. Therefore, the sooner an election is held the better it will be for Australia.

                        <para>. -Having listened carefully to the remarks of the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White),</inline> I can find nothing in them which ought to be taken sufficiently seriously to warrant rebuttal. Surely this House has never witnessed a more ludicrous spectacle than has been seen during the two days of this debate, with members of the Opposition putting themselves forward as champions of the parliamentary system and defenders of its healthy working. The height of absurdity in that respect was reached -to-night when the honorable member - for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> who is  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition supported the motion deprecating personal and baseless attacks upon other people. He is the man who has wallowed in mud and mire from the very first day of his membership of the Parliament! He has regarded himself as a licensed retailer of every bit of irresponsible gossip, libel, and slander that he could find to put his tongue to. He has covered himself in mud and picked up handfuls of it to throw at anybody who has come within sight of him. Yet that honorable member asks to be taken seriously as an advocate of restrictions on personal attacks on other honorable members. How can an Opposition, in whose ranks 21 suspensions have occurred, seriously put itself forward as the champion of the parliamentary institution? Each of those suspensions was for disorderly conduct and refusal to obey <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> who represents the supremacy of the Parliament. There have been 21 suspensions of Opposition members because they have shown themselves unwilling to abide by the standards of parliamentary conduct. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>In considering this motion by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> to deal with unreasonable and improper restriction of the rights of private members we have only to recall the first action of the right honorable gentleman when he became Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, which was to dispense with private members' day. To make sure that is was not an accident, on the very next occasion of private members' day he did so again. Now he puts himself forward seriously as the champion of the rights of private members. Although the honorable member for Wentworth complains about the pending application of the " gag " he was a Minister of  a  government which applied the "gag" to the Opposition as many as 30 times on one night, and an average of once every three days during the life of that Government. Yet he puts himself forward seriously as objecting to the " gag ". Members of the Opposition have claimed to be horrified at statements regarding the honorable member for Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Adermann).</inline> Although the Leader of the Opposition, may not have launched personal attacks he has sat silently by while his colleagues in the House week by week and month by month have launched most scurrilous attacks. He has not said one word by way of rebuke, and has been prepared to take every bit of political capital that may be gained by the launching of such personal attacks. Although Opposition members talk about the need for maintaining the rights of the Parliament and its members when they themselves were in office they restricted the sittings of the Parliament to an average of 50 days in a year. In my opinion no motion that has ever been put before this Parliament has been moved with such obvious hypocrisy as has the motion before the House. Although it is a four-pronged motion, there is only one reason why this House has for two days been debating this most futilemotion, when it could have been dealing with urgent and important legislation such as that to establish the Snowy Mountains hydro-electric scheme. That is the suspension of the Leader of the Opposition from the service of this House last Wednesday night. When an acorn fell on the poor bald pate of Chickenlicken she thought that the sky  had fallen and made such a commotion that a farmyard deputation set off to report the terrible happening to the king. There appears to be an exact parallel between that nursery fable and the happenings of the last two days. Many honorable members have been suspended over the years and never has there been such a hullabaloo as on this occasion. Some honorable members have been suspended after they have been given every latitude, when ultimately they have exhausted <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker's</inline> patience. Others have been jumped on rather severely and have considered themselves sharply and unjustly treated, but all have managed to smile and take it on the chin and have not felt themselves bigger than the Parliament itself. They have not adopted the attitude, " I will show you that you cannot do this to me". When they thought that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker's</inline> ruling was over-harsh or wrong, they have recognized that in life people get lots of lickings for things that they do not do, and have got on with the next business. But not so the present Leader of the Opposition. He has often seen his closest colleagues suspended from the services of the House. ite has seen his Australian </para>
                    <para class="block">Country party and Liberal party supporters tumbled out one after the other for disorderly behaviour and he has not turned a hair. But when it happened to him then, indeed, the political sky had fallen. In fact the spoilt darling had received a slap in the place where it hurt most, and the end of the world had come. Majesty had been outraged. Anxious groups assembled in the lobbies, the joint Opposition executive was consulted and the matter was discussed by the Opposition parties in caucus assembled. Then the great censure motion was launched. What happened to the Leader of the Opposition is something that has happened to hundreds of members of Parliament in the history of federation and in the hundreds, of years of history of the British House of Commons. The whole thing smacks of the ridiculous. It is indeed making a mountain out of a molehill. It is a demonstration of an egotistical personal conceit which shows indeed that the holder of that conceit is totally unfitted for national leadership. It is true thai the right honorable gentleman is a brilliant man. There is nobody to deny that, and he certainly would not deny it himself! But brilliance is not everything. It does not of itself earn respect, confidence, loyalty or devoted service. To get these momentous happenings of the lust few days into perspective, let us consider what has happened. The Minister for Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> said things which the Leader of the Opposition found it hard to take. He interjected repeatedly, despite the warning of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker,</inline> and was suspended because he disobeyed that warning. I admit that he was a little bit unlucky. From time to time other honorable members have succeeded in getting away with more than he succeeded in getting away with, while other honorable members have been suspended for very much less than was the orrance  in this instance. But there cannot be laid down any exact ruling in such matters. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> must be the judge, according to the atmosphere of the House. He knows whether he must maintain control at any particular time with a loose or tight rein. Even if the Leader of the Opposition considered himself severely treated he could not complain of unfair treatment, because he was suspended only after repeatedly interjecting and having been warned by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker</inline> of the consequences. It might have been expected in those circumstances that if he were a champion of the parliamentary institution, desiring to uphold the authority of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> he would have accepted the penalty imposed upon him, just as hundreds of other members have been compelled to do, even when they thought themselves harshly or even unjustly treated. It might have been expected that he would emulate the example set by his predecessor, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook, the only other Leader of the Opposition to have been suspended from the service of this Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> came back the next day, expressed his regret to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> and took his place again in the House. It might have been expected that the Leader of the Opposition, as a champion of the parliamentary system, and as a man required to set an example to his followers, would adopt that course. Instead, however, the Leader of the Opposition has submitted a motion of censure, and, for two days, the House has debated matters entirely irrelevant to the real issue, which arises only from the hurt dignity of the right honorable gentleman. </para>
                    <para>I believe that many of the matter? which are mentioned in the motion of censure are worthy of the serious attention of honorable members, but the Opposition parties, when in office, completely disregarded the rights of private members. In the last two days, the Opposition has shown itself to be concerned with those rights only in so much as it can make party political capital out of them for electioneering purposes. From that point of view, it has done far more harm to the parliamentary institution than could possibly be achieved by bringing those matters to the attention of the House by means of a motion of censure. One cannot conceive a more hopeless way of obtaining a calm and reasoned examination of our Standing Orders than to make them the basis of a party political motion of censure against the government of the day. They are, in fact, matters for the calm consideration of a parliamentary committee. If members of the Opposition really had any regard for the institution of Parliament or for the highest standards of conduct in debate, they would have taken steps, when they were in office, to establish the rights of private members. Instead of doing so, they, as a government, took every step to injure those rights. To-night, I heard the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> predict what will happen if the Liberal party is returned at the next election. One thing that ought not to be allowed to happen, no matter what views one may hold of the abuse of privilege in this Parliament, is any diminution of the right of an honorable member to say what he will, whether he is ill-advised, or whether he uses badly the privileges that he has. Without privilege, there is, and can be, no parliament at all. What is necessary, perhaps, is that there should be consideration of some means of providing a remedy for those who feel themselves unjustly or wrongly attacked under privilege, but there should never be in a British parliament any suggestion that privilege itself should be curtailed. But the men who have launched this motion of censure against the Government on these spurious grounds are persons who, I believe, have no concern whatever for the parliamentary institution. I am convinced that, if ever again they succeed in obtaining the reins of government in this country they will say, " Having warded off the threat to the financial institutions and the vested interests which we represent, we will take steps to ensure that the Labour party shall never again have the opportunity, by a democratic election, to achieve the government of the Commonwealth ". I sincerely believe that if, by any chance, the next election should place our political opponents in power, far from protecting or maintaining the rights of this Parliament, they will close this democratic institution, and Australia will never again see a free election. </para>

                        <para>In reply to the right honorable gentleman's question, the Postmaster-General has informed me that he expects that the report on the activities of his department for the financial year 1947-48 will shortly be ready for presentation to the House. The Minister has explained that it is very difficult to secure the early completion of a report and financial statements of a business of the size of the Post Office as it is necessary to obtain financial and business statistics from all over the Commonwealth. These must be co-ordinated and analysed before the data furnished in the report can be made available. The matter has also been complicated by the shortage of staff in the various State branches. I understand that the draft of the 1947-48 report ia now in the hands of the Government Printer, who has indicated that he will do everything possible to expedite the printing. However, under the present pressure of work in the Government Printing Office it is difficult to give any firm estimate of the date on which  the  Postmaster-General's report will be available The Postmaster-General does not expect that  the detailed report for 1048-49 will be available before the end of the present calendar year. </para>
