"Will the right honorable gentleman inform the House whether it is a fact that Trans-Australia Airlines has been, and, I understand, still is flying empty beer bottles from Sydney to Perth ? If so, is this a paying proposition for Trans- Australia Airlines? What is the average load of empties carried by each aircraft? Is the charge for this freight based on the scale of charges applicable to ordinary air freight? Have the rates been varied' in any way in respect of the carriage of empty beer bottles? What would be the liability of Trans-Australia Airlines in the event of breakages of the empty beer bottles? What proportion of petrol used on the Sydney-Perth flights is necessary to transport these fragile cargoes by air? What is the total quantity of petrol that has been required to transport them up to date? </para>

                        <para>- The carriage of freight by Trans-Australia Airlines is a purely commercial transaction. Neither the Minister for Air nor I would be aware of all of the details necessary in order to answer the honorable member's questions fully. The honorable member has inquired about the liability of Trans-Australia Airlines in the event of breakages of empty beer bottles. I should think that liability would1 be greater in the event of the breakage of bottles full of beer. I presume that the flights from Sydney to Perth, to which the honorable member has referred, would be flights on the ordinary passenger schedule, and that when freight is offering that remunerative trade is accepted. I shall make inquiries in this matter and inform the honorable member of the result as soon as possible. </para>

                        <para>- It is true that British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines Limited has an office in Sydney. I do not know the number of employees on its staff there. Australia is only a partshareholder in that company. It owns 50 per cent, of the shares, New Zealand owns 30 per cent, and the United Kingdom owns 20 per cent. The corporation which controls it is operating a service of two flights weekly from Australia to San Francisco and one flight each fortnight to New Zealand. As is the case with every airline operating to America, the number of passengers carried has been seriously affected by the dollar shortage. The purpose of the airline is to maintain a connexion between Australia and the United States of America and Canada, and it is hoped that, when the dollar situation clears, the patronage of the service will be greater than at present. I cannot say whether the number of employees in the airline's office in Sydney is more than is required. The report of British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines Limited has not yet been supplied to the Australian section of its ownership. However, as soon as it comes to hand I shall ask the Australian representatives to have the matter examined. I am satisfied that it is essential to maintain the air connexion between Australia and America, and I am also satisfied that British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines Limited is operating one of the best services in the world. </para>

                        <para>- I ask the Prime Minister whether the Australian Government, through its representatives abroad, has made a survey of the quantity of petrol that could be imported into this country from Russia, Roumania and Poland? If quantities of petrol are found to be available in those countries for sterling payment, is the Government prepared to grant the import licences that will bc required before the petrol can be imported? </para>

                        <para>- It must be remembered that the importation of petrol is entirely in the hands of private companies. The ramifications of those companies are very extensive. The Australian Government is concerned only with the dollar content of petrol that is brought into this country and does not make inquiries about the sources from which it is obtained. If a company applies for a licence to import petrol, the Government, in considering the application, is guided by what the petrol will cost in terms of dollars. The British Treasury has to meet the deficit between our dollar earnings and our dollar expenditure. I have already stated clearly to the press that if the purchase price and the cost of transport of petrol that comes as part of an ordinary transaction from countries behind what is known as the Iron Curtain can be met in sterling, we are prepared to issue the necessary import licences. We make a careful survey of all offers of goods from behind the Iron Curtain, because we consider that in many instances they are made for political reasons. We have been told that there is a shortage of petrol in countries behind the Iron Curtain, and that may or may not be true. If a company discovers that it can import sterling petrol, by which I mean petrol the cost and carriage of which can be paid for entirely in sterling, the Australian Government will issue the necessary import licences. </para>

                        <para>- The problem of earning additional dollars has been under close investigation by the Department of Commerce and Agriculture for a long time. In order to facilitate the investigations, the Government has established a special inter-departmental committee which works under a Cabinet subcommittee. Dr. Roland Wilson, the Commonwealth Statistician, is  chairman  of the committee, which was appointed to investigate every possible avenue by which additional dollars might be earned in the United States of America or, indeed, in the hard currency areas generally. It must be remembered that the field is very limited. For instance, as far as primary products are concerned, we have entered into contracts with the United Kingdom for the supply of meat, under which that country takes all our surplus meat. There is only a limited amount of butter for export to countries other than Great Britain. The United Kingdom meat contract applies also to pig meats and a number of other commodities of that kind. As I have said, there is a very limited field as far as additional markets for primary products are concerned, and I can assure the honorable member that that particular matter has been examined very closely. One of the factors that must bo remembered is that the American tariff  operates on a very high schedule of rates, a fact with which the Minister for Postwar Reconstruction is fully familiar, as the American tariff was discussed at very great length at the international trade conferences at Geneva and Havana. It is proving very difficult to induce the Americans even to reduce the rate of duty on wool. One of the other factors affecting this matter that is not clearly understood in this country is that apart from, the high American tariff rates, the interpretation and applicability of the rates often have the effect of making the American tariff most restrictive. All those matters have to be studied. Although a consignment of export goods to America may include only 10 per cent., 15 per cent, or 20 per cent, of a commodity of a standard subject to a high rate of tariff, the higher rate is applied to the whole of that particular commodity. It is a very complex matter. I repeat that every possible avenue is being explored to ascertain whether it is possible to increase our dollar earnings through additional exports to America. Our great difficulty at the moment is that the sale of goods by the sterling area to America, both in respect of volume and prices, has been very much reduced. In the June quarter of this year the returns from the sale of tin, cocoa, rubber, wool and several other commodities fell by one-third compared with the previous quarter. Some of our great difficulties are due to the fact that we are earning very much less in dollars now even when we are selling the same quantity of goods. </para>

It appears that New South Wales is not prepared at this stage to proceed with the work. Direct negotiations are now taking place with individual States. I am to visit Western Australia at an early date to discuss with the Government of that State the rehabilitation of its railways, and this will involve the standardization of the gauge on the trans-Australian line from Kalgoorlie to Perth. There are also to be discussions with officials in South Australia and Victoria, and it is hoped that, as a result, some progress will be made at an early date. </para>

I do not propose to say any more on the subject except that the necessary action will he taken when the necessity for it arises. </para>

During the war, he did excellent work in the Radio-physics Division of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, some of it of a highly secret nature, but there was no suggestion that information about the work was divulged to unauthorized persons. </para>

                            <para>- It has been alleged that Mr. Kaiser, at a later stage, became a member of the Communist party. He was awarded a two years' scholarship by the executive of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research to be taken out in the United Kingdom, and two years ago he went to the United Kingdom to take up the scholarship. The members of the executive of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research at that time were Sir David Rivett, Dr. A. E. V. Richardson, Dr. Clunies Ross, and Dr. E. W. G. White. There were then only four members on the executive and honorable members will appreciate that those four gentlemen are thoroughly loyal and trustworthy persons. Mr. Kaiser has been studying in the United Kingdom on the scholarship which was awarded to him. It is alleged that he took part in a demonstration in front of Australia House not very long ago. Immediately the Government received information to that effect it ordered an inquiry, which duly took place and a summary of that inquiry is in the hand? of the Government. As the result of consideration of the situation by the executive of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, Mr. Kaiser' appointment with the organization has been terminated. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps, as the honorable member for Balaclava suggests, it could go up to 1,500. The honorable member for Balaclava was commanding officer there in the Royal Australian Air Force in the days when the camp was a very large Air Force establishment. We want to employ some migrant male labour in that particular district, and we are examining the possibility of using the camp as a hostel for workers as well as for a holding camp for migrants' wives and dependants. The people who live in holding centres pay, on the average, 25s. a week whilst those occupying places in departmental hostels pay £2 12s. 6d. a week for board and lodgings. Generally, conditions at the hostels are much better than those at holding centres. Our original idea was to use Somers camp, which is within 40 miles of Melbourne, as a centre to which new Australians working in Melbourne could go at the week-end to see their wives and dependants. </para>

I have been in formed by some displaced persons and others associated with them that there is a great deal of discontent amongst displaced persons who are working under the terms of the contracts under which they entered Australia about what they regard as the breach of a promise that was made to them before they came to this country. They say that they were promised that, if they came to Australia, they would be permitted to live with their wives here. Will the Minister have inquiries made in order to find out whether or not such a promise was made to them in Europe? If it was made, will he make </para>

                        <para>- Promises were made to persons who were invited to volunteer to come to Australia under the condition," that we laid down that, at the earliest possible moment, we would enable families to be re-united so that the bread-winners would be able to maintain them in the localities in which they were working. Promises were made that we would give every other assistance within our power to make these people happy in their new surroundings. Because of the housing shortage which affects the Australian public - the honorable gentleman is probably not aware of it - it is not possible to enable every displaced person sent to a particular town to rent a house in that town. </para>

                            <para>- No. I have told the honorable member that we promised that we would do our very best to re-unite families as soon as possible. There may be some discontent amongst some of those people because they cannot all live in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Hobart or wherever they may want to live and cannot do just precisely what they want to do. However, it must be borne in mind that many Australians who follow seasonal occupations have to go away from their homes at various periods of the year. The new Australians, of course, come from very crowded districts in Europe and they are not accustomed to conditions that obtain in Australia. There may be some discontent amongst some of them. One finds unreasonable people everywhere. There are even unreasonable people in the Liberal party. </para>

                        <para>- Has the Prime Minister read a report published in to-day's press that a substantial increase of the price of gas has been granted by the Victorian Liberal Government to the Metropolitan Gas Company, and the Brighton Gas Company in Melbourne? Is the right honorable gentleman aware that this is the fourth price rise that has been granted to these companies since the rents and prices referendum was held in May of last year? Is he also aware that there is considerable dissatisfaction among consumers over this further substantial increase? Finally, is this not a striking indication of the ineffective manner in which prices are controlled by Liberal and Country party governments in the State sphere? </para>

                        <para>- I have not seen the press report to which the honorable member has referred, but I know that several increases of the price of gas have been approved, and that an application for a further increase of price had been made. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Apparently that increase has been granted as the press has indicated, if, of course, the press report can be taken as a reliable guide. I have said previously that, with divided control, great difficulties would arise in co-ordinating prices in the variousStates and inevitably great increases of prices would result. That has occurred. Because of all the difficulties associated with prices control the Commonwealth was anxious to retain that control on a uniform basis as far as possible so that rises in costs could be checked. It must be clear that there are certain elements affecting costs which would inevitably result in some price increases irrespective of who controlled them. Those increases, however, have been very much greater under the divided control, or the lack of co-ordinated control by the States, than would otherwise have been the case. </para>

                <para class="block">By this bill it is proposed to effect the amendments of the Income Tax Assessment Act which were forecast in the budget speech. The most important of the amendments extends the depreciation allowances for wear and tear of plant and machinery. Honorable members will recall that, in 1946, measures were taken by this Government to assist the post-war rehabilitation of industry and the establishment of new industries in this country. One of the taxation concessions granted to industry at that time was the allowance of an initial depreciation deduction amounting to 20 per cent, of the cost of plant acquired or installed during the period from the 1st July, 1945, to the 30th June, 1950. The allowance has provided great benefits to industry, as it has served to offset, to a large degree, the inflated costs of new equipment in the post-war period. Leaders of industry have represented to the Government that an extension of the period of the allowance is necessary, as the high costs of plant replacement have not only been accentuated since 1946, but also are likely to continue indefinitely. To meet the needs of industry, the bill contains a clause extending the concession for a further two years until the 30th June, 1952. This extension will assist manufacturers in long-range plans for plant replacement and expansion. </para>
                <para>At the same time, the Government has recognized that industry would be further assisted by increasing the initial depreciation allowance from 20 per cent, to 40 per cent. It is proposed in this bill, therefore, to afford taxpayers an opportunity, if they so elect, to deduct 40 per cent, of the cost of new plant in lieu of the 20 per cent, now allowed. This increased allowance conforms broadly with amendments of the United Kingdom income tax law which were made earlier this year. </para>
                <para>The bill also contains a provision regarding the concessional rebate of tax on life assurance premiums, superannuation fund contributions, friendly society payments and the like. Since 1936, the total payments in respect of which this particular rebate is allowed to a taxpayer have been limited to a maximum of £100 in each year. Taxpayers now find themselves obliged to expend proportion.tely greater sums in order to make suitable provision for their retirement or for ;heir dependants. In recognition of this "act, the Government proposes to raise he maximum to £150. A small technical amendment included in the bill will enable taxpayers to obtain credit in respect of tax instalment stamps which they have purchased but which have been destroyed before remission in pavment of tax. As is customary with bills amending the Income Tax Assessment Act, an explanatory memorandum has been prepared for the information of honorable members. 1 commend the bill to honorable members. </para>

Although early in March the circumstances relating to this ruling by  the Chair were fresh in the minds of all honorable members, the heavy volume of business that has since been dealt with by the House since then may have caused many of the details to be forgotten. My motion of dissent from your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker,</inline> arose as a result of an effort that was made by the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> to move the adjournment of the House to deal with specific matters relating to the health of the community. In this connexion, Standing Order 38 provides that a motion for the. adjournment of the House shall be proposed only under certain conditions. Thi? Standing Order is lengthy. In brief, it provides that an honorable member must rise in his place, and that his motion must be supported by five other honorable members. It does not provide that notice must be given of an honorable member's intention. The relevant portion of Standing Order 38 provides that an honorable member - </para>

I point out that if that ruling is to be insisted upon, honorable members will be virtually unable to, bring anything before this House after the budget session, because almost everything that one can conceive to be spoken about is discussed during that session. If it were insisted upon by the Chair that nothing that had been dealt with in a current session could be used as the basis of a motion for the adjournment df the House, there would be complete strangulation of the principles of debate in connexion with such motions. Immediately after <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker</inline> had ruled that motion out of order, the right honorable member for Cowper wrote out, and handed to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker,</inline> a fresh motion for the adjournment of the House for the purpose of discussing - </para>

That measure dealt with a matter that is substantially the same as that to which the right honorable member for Cowper desired to- refer on his motion for the adjournment of the House. Indeed, it might almost be said that in many respects the contents of the measure had been filched from the public announcement that the right honorable gentleman had been compelled to make to the press in lieu of making it to this House.

                        <para>-  I rise to order. The sincerity of an honorable member in proposing a motion to the House should not be impugned. The Minister has said that the right honorable member for Cowper, in attempting to bring his motion before the House, was acting as the spokesman of the British Medical Association. There is no justification for such a statement. </para>

                <para class="block">This is a motion of dissent from a ruling given by the Chair. The incident out of which it arose took place some time ago, and for two reasons I do not propose to occupy the time of the House with it. First, it has been made perfectly clear within the last 24 hours - if it needed to be made clear - that any such motion will be dealt with on party lines, and automatically defeated. I am no fonder of wasting my own time than I am of wasting other people's, and it would be a waste of time to debate this motion, which ought to be considered on its merits as a matter of interpretation, but which we are now told quite plainly will be dealt with as a party matter. Secondly, if a motion of this kind is to be discussed, honorable members with a point of view regarding it might desire an opportunity to express their point of view. Although it is Friday morning, and 70 minutes before the time the House is due to adjourn, one motion of dissent has already been gagged after one speech from this side of the House. I do not propose to instigate any more such foolish proceedings. I can only express my astonishment, and indicate that I do not intend to offer any argument at all on the motion. </para>

                    <para>. -  Since the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> does not propose to offer any argument on this motion, it is not necessary for me to do so, either. I merely wish to make this point : The right honorable gentleman suggested that every matter brought before the House should be considered on its merits. My reply  is  that every matter brought before the House is considered on its merits, but  it  can happen that a proposition which the Leader of the Opposition and honorable members opposite think has some merit, in the opinion of the Government has no merit at all. </para>

On the latter occasion the Australian Government's request was chiefly based on - (i) the infrequency ofocerrrence of pleuro pneumonia in States other than Queensland; (ii) the contention that the use of the complement fixation test along with other specified precautions would allow the importation of cattle from New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia into New Zealand with a high degree of safety.

It was also stated that, having regard to these aspects and the organized opposition of New Zealand farmers to the introduction of stock from any country from which contagious stock diseases might be brought, the New Zealand Government was not prepared at that stage to relax the existing prohibition on cattle from Australia, but was prepared to review the position from time to time with the object of permitting importation as soon as it should be abundantly clear that cattle could be imported from Australia without risk. </para>

                            <para>The possibility of a devaluation of sterling or of any alteration in the direct relationship of Australian currency to sterling, is not specifically mentioned in any of the long term contracts concluded with the United Kingdom Government in respect of the bulk purchase and sale of Australian primary products. In the case of the meat, butter and cheese and egg contracts, there is a provision in each whereby an annual review of the terms and conditions of the contract may be sought on substantial grounds. As regards all contracts, however, devaluation of sterling would be regarded by the Commonwealth Government as creating exceptional circumstances justifying reconsideration of such contracts. </para>

                            <para>This question was examined in 1944, when the limit of £50 applied to the total medical expenses of the taxpayer and bin spouse and children under the age of 21 years. Following the examination, the concession was enlarged so that the maximum rebatable amount of medical expenses became £50 for the taxpayer, £50 for his spouse and £5.0 for each of his children under 21 years of age. Thus, in the case of a taxpayer with a wife and two children, the rebatable amount may be as high as £200 each year. It is recognized that the limit is exceeded in some cases, but the concession does substantially assist taxpayers who are obliged to incur medical expenses. It is considered that the present allowance is reasonable and accordingly it ia not proposed to further increase the concessional allowance. </para>

I have investigated this matter, and desire to advise the honorable member as follows: - </para>

                        <para>The Commander-in-Chief, British Commonwealth Occupation Force, has intimated that his head-quarters has no knowledge of any officers serving in Japan having acted in conjunction with an engineer of the State Electricity Commission of Victoria in regard to the formation of the Empire Trading Company. The Commander-in-Chief further advises that, if any officers made any inquiries on behalf of the State Electricity Commisssion in Victoria, they were made without the knowledge or sanction of his head-quarters. Tt is a fact that an electrical, engineer of the State Electricity Commission visited Japan in 1948 and arranged contracts for the purchase of insulators on behalf of the Electricity Supply Association of Australia, members of which include the principal electricity authorities in Australia. The State Electricity Commission has informed my department that the engineer previously referred to is in no way associated with the Empire Trading Company, and that he is not aware of the identity of the principals of that company. </para>
