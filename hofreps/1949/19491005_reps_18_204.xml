            <para>- I am confident  that  all members regret the temporary indisposition of the Minister for Information. Has the attention of the Prime Minister been drawn to a statement in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> of yesterday that the Minister for Information, who went into the Canberra Community Hospital suffering from strain, was &#34; very well &#34; ? Is there anything sinister in  the  reported statement of the Hospital Superintendent, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. L.</inline> W. Nott, who,  I  understand, will be a candidate at  the  next general election, that the Minister  was merely resting for a couple of days, but that he would like to keep him in hospital longer! </para>

            <para>- The Minister for Information is, as the honorable member for Grey has said, in hospital. On Monday, the Minister left Melbourne when he was suffering from a cold or incipient influenza. He developed a very high temperature on board the aircraft and, on arrival at Canberra, he was sent to hospital for examination. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Nott</inline> told me that the Minister had a very high temperature and I gathered that he thought an attack of influenza was likely. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Nott</inline> expected that, with a couple of days rest, the Minister would be all right. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Nott</inline> later told me that the Minister was much better and that his temperature was down. I saw the Minister yesterday morning. He showed very great improvement. I am afraid that the Opposition cannot expect to enjoy his absence from the House for long. He will be back soon fighting fit again. I do not think there is anything sinister about the matter. I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Nott,</inline> despite his political opinions, will see that the Minister is well cared for. </para>

Soviet Union against the formation of the federation of Western Germany, which was made two or three days ago, is regarded as a preliminary to such a move in Eastern Germany. There is no news later than the press &#62;news this morning, but it looks quite probable that such a move will be made. </para>

The purpose of the new scheme is to enlarge the existing civilian assistance scheme in the directions that I indicated in my announcement. Students at present receiving benefits will, after 1951, receive somewhat more liberal benefits under the new scheme. </para>

That principle was recognized by the Australian Government some years ago when it set up the Secondary Industries Commission, of which Mr.J. K. Jensen was  chairman.  Our objective in that instance was not only to encourage existing indnstries toextendtheir activities to country areastothe greatest possible degreebut also to encourage the leaders of industry to establish industries away fromthe cities. Some measure of success has been achieved in that regard.I refer in this connexionto the BurlingtonMills and also to the spinningorganization that moved ont toRutherford in the heavy industry area aroundNewcastleand Maitland. Whenthe Government has beenunabletoobtaintheconsentofin- dustrialleaders tomovecertain industries tothecountry areas in any one State, it hasendeavouredtoencourage new industries to move totheless-thickly populated States.It hastherebyinduced a numberofindustriesofindustriestomovetoSouth </para>

          <para class="block">Australia. We have succeeded in encouraging some decentralization of industry. The secondary industries division of the Division of Industrial Development has pursued that policy on behalf of the Government, but there is no power to compel anybody to do anything. We can only offersuch assistance and advice as is possible. Where possible, Commonwealthowned buildings have been leased to private enterprise and in some cases an option to purchase at a reasonable price has been granted. In addition to that the Government through the new organization that has been established in association with the Department of Immigration is asking anumber of leaders of industry to be represented on an immigration council  so as  toenable an examination to be made of the possibilities of further decentralization of industry. The honorable gentleman may rest assured that thematterhehasraised is being pursuedveryvigorouslyby the Government. </para>

            <para>- The Australian Government at present hasno power over thedistributionof petrolto essential  or  other services. The Government has power to determine howmuch petrol shall ike imported, font : snch petrol, once it has entered thecountry,comesunderthe controlofoilcompanies,which may decidetowhomitshallbeprovided,and alsoofthegarageproprietors, who may decidetowhom it shall be sold. I very rauch regret that circumstanceshave arisenwhich allow thepresent inequitable distribution of petrol totakeplace. In addition to the essential services mentioned by the honorable member for Calaresuchservices asauxiliary power plants in Western Australia are also effected.Thegenerators inPerthbroke down, and although a greatdealofpetrol as being used for non-essential purposes, it has not been possible to obtain sufficient petrol to enable the auxiliary power plants in that city to produce power for industrial purposes. That position shows how inequitable the present situation can be. There should be a definite scheme of distribution. In addition to such essential services as auxiliary power plants there are also the needs of many primary producers to be considered. Under thelaw, however, owing to the Interpretation of the Constitution by the High Court of Australia, the Australian Government at present has no power to control the distribution of petrol. The High Court has held that the States have complete power to control petrol distribution, and the Australian Government <inline font-style="italic">ha*</inline> put. the position very clearly to the States&#39;, and has supplied them with all the information available on the subject. The States reached a decision last week. Certain States are prepared to refer the necessary power to the Commonwealth, whilst others are prepared to pass certain legislation, as they recognize at last that the present system is inequitable. I shall examine the matter that the honorable gentleman has raised, but I must emphasize that under present conditionsthedistribution of petrol rests entirely with the distributors andthe companies themselves, who alone have the power to decide whether ambulances, auxiliary power plants, primary producers or other essential users shall receive petrol or not. I hope to be able tomake a further statement on this matter, probably later this week. </para>

            <para>- I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Social Services what provision is made for the care of widows and children ofimmigrants who have died since entering Aus- tralia? If there are young children the mother cannot go to work, and she is not eligible to receive the widow&#39;s pension. She must apply for a pension from her native land.Will the Government arrange to have an interim widow&#39;s pension paid in such cases so as to provide for the care of the widows andchildrenuntilhelp arrives from overseas </para>

            <para>-The Department of Social Services co-operates with the Department of Immigration in connexion with the matter raised by the honorable member. If, after leaving the reception camps, the women mentioned should suffer the. disaster of losing their husbands, they would be eligible not only for widows&#39; pensions but also for other social services benefits that are enjoyed by the people of this country. I point out that some of the migrants now in reception camps will be released and placed in industry this week.For the period they are in reception camps migrants are provided with food, shelter, medical attention and other care, ; md the Department of Immigration defrays expenses associated with the death and burial of migrants whilst in those camps. Presumably the honorable member is concerned about how quickly women migrants may obtain the widows&#39; pension if their husbands should die and they are left destitute. Under existing provisions, if the husband of a migrant was killed while working in industry,, the widow would immediately become eligible for social services benefits similarly to native-born Australians in such circumstances. </para>

I do not now refer to the already successful transport ofcattle over distances of 250 to 300 miles in the Alice Springs district. &#34;Will the right honorable gentleman inform theHouse who were his advisers in this matter ? What is their status in the cattle industry,andwhat actual experience have theyhadofthecartage of cattle by road for long distances in the Northern Territory?

            <para>- I know that the honorable member for the Northern Territory has previously advocated the extension of the railway system in the Northern Territory. There is a very wide difference of opinion on this subject. Whilst some people contend that additional roads should be constructed in the Northern Territory to provide for the cartage of cattle for long distances by road vehicles, others contend that the position would best be met by the extension of the railway facilities. Another school of thought favours a combination of both rail and road transport of cattle in the Northern Territory. I can understand why previous governments during the past 25 years have not made a decision about this matter. When I presided over a large conference of people who were supposed to know something about these matters, particularly with relation to the Northern Territory, I found that there was a very wide diversity of opinion about the best method of transportation of cattle. In the light of the advice of the Cabinet sub-committee which is dealing with this matter the Government realized that, quite apart from the merits or demerits of the respective means of transportation, it would take a long period of time to lay down long stretches of railways in the Northern Territory, because the materials necessary would not be  available  for many years. This Government is anxious to develop that area as quickly as possible. I have discussed this matter with two men in high positions, closely associated with the cattle industry and meat production generally. I discussed the matter with one of them whilst T. was in London, and with the other in Australia. They both agreed that, in view of the physical difficulties involved, the Government should proceed with the construction of long-distance roads in the Northern Territory if it desired to further its plan for the development, of that area for cattle production. Opinions have been expressed that certain roads may be built, but to construct very long stretches of road would be physically impossible. If we waited for such roads to be constructed, the development of the Northern Territory would proceed very slowly indeed. Some people agree with <inline font-style="italic">thu</inline> honorable member&#39;s contention regarding the construction of railways, but others disagree with him. Many expertsbelieve that some railway constructionshould be undertaken and that otherareas should be  catered  for by road transport. Differing opinions have been expressed about the desirability of sealing such roads a3 are constructed. TheCabinet sub-committee includes the Minister for Works and Housing and theMinister for the Interior, both of whom know the Northern Territory very well. </para>

            <para>- Yes.. It is a well known fact that the staffs of our hospitals are over-worked.. Indeed, they. were over-worked before the outbreak of the recent epidemic of infantile paralysis. It is also true that something has already been done and that a good deal more can and will be done to help them. Recently, an investigation was made to ascertain how many women migrants in reception camps had had hospital nursing or medical orderly experience, either in their own country or in the camps in which they have been living. Some have already been selected and sent to hospitals. An urgent call was made for assistance to meet the extraordinary circumstances brought about by the infantile paralysis epidemic which is now raging and during the week before last, twelve migrant women were sent to the infectious diseases hospital at Fairfield, Melbourne. The matron of that hospital was very grateful for their assistance. We have notified the branches of the Commonwealth Employment Service in all States where such hospitals are established of the possibility of securing assistance in this way and we shall send additional women migrants from the various camps, if it is possible to do so. </para>

              <para>- What the.moves portend is quite clear. A state of acute tension exists between Russia and the countries which are accurately called the satellites of Russia in eastern Europe on the one hand, and Yugoslavia on the other hand. Pressure tactics are being adopted in relation to Yugoslavia, including the denunciation of one treaty and alliance and friendship after another, first by Russia, and then by the other members of the eastern group. The position is quite clear, and it has been shown at the meeting of the General Assembly of the United Nations at Lake Success, that there is a definite state of tension between the countries to which I have referred. Whether it is likely to go further is just ;i question of calculation. It does not seem likely that it will lead to war. The General Assembly of the United Nations is now meeting, and if there is any. further development, I have no doubt that the whole matter will come before that body. Nothing will please me more than a debate on international affairs either to-day or any other day. </para>

One complaint seems to be about the law of New Guinea which does not permit the unrestricted immigration of Chinese to that territory.

The Chinese are in .Nauru by agreement with the Nationalist Government of China, and the conditions under which they went to that territory for the purpose of producing phosphate were approved by the very government that has made the complaint to the United Nations. The honorable member for Wilmot has referred to the views of church leaders about our administration of New Guinea. I noticed a few days ago that a bishop of the Church of England has emphasized the same principle as that upon which the policy of the Australian Government has been based in administering the territories. That principle is the welfare of the native inhabitants, and the introduction of Chinese must be subservient to it. That is the policy which the Minister for External Territories has applied, and I have no doubt that when the Australian answer is given to the Chinese complaint, it will be convincing. The difficulty about these international gatherings is that only the complaints that are made against Australia are given publicity. For every complaint there are a dozen statements which express approval of what Australia has done. </para>

            <para>- I direct a question to the Treasurer concerning trade with Russia and the balance of payments between Australia and Russia. In 1947-48 Australia imported from Russia goods worth only &#163;59,0S9 and exported to that country goods worth &#163;2,858,0S8, or about 50 times the value of what we received. In 1948-49 the unbalance was even greater. Imports from Russia in that year were worth only &#163;189r707, and exports to Russia were worth &#163;12,360,186, or about 60 times the value of goods that we received. As Russia obviously does not pay for goods with goods, does Australia hold a large .and accumulating rouble balance? If not, is Russia paying in sterling and, in view of the rumours that Russia had a dollar surplus and was able to sell surplus dollars to the United Kingdom, would it be possible for the Soviet to pay some of the unbalanced trade debt in dollars? If Australia has a rouble balance, is there any immediate likelihood that it will be honoured with goods ? </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Mx. CHIFLEY. - It is true, as the honorable member has indicated, that Australia has had a very favorable trade balance with Russia, particularly during the last two years. That has been due to the fact that Russian commercial interests, or perhaps the Soviet Government, have been buying, wool extensively in Australia. I notice that there has .been no very great objection to receiving Russian money for our wool. Australia does not hold a special rouble balance, although Russia is, in effect, a semi-hard currency country. Russia has been able to earn considerable dollar balances in the United States of America. It has accumulated more dollars than it has been able to spend because, although the Americans had been buying considerable quantities of manganese ore and chrome from Russia, they recently denied certain capital goods to Russia. The Soviet Government then reduced the volume of manganese exports to the United States of America. However, I understand &#39;that America recently came to some arrangement wit-h the Soviet Government by which considerably increased quantities of capital goods are now being exported to Russia. As a result, America is receiving once more fairly large quantities of Russian manganese ore. Australia, of course, has imported about 10,000 tons of manganese ore, which was purchased by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited. Australia does not hold a special rouble balance. The Russian payments finally appear in our sterling balances. I have not seen any official statement on the su&#39;bject, and I understand that Russia at one time sold surplus American dollars to the Bank of England for sterling so that it could obtain capital goods  from the United Kingdom. That is an example of the anomalies that arise out of the present currency situation. With the sterling obtained by the sale of surplus dollars, Russia was able to buy capital goods from easy currency countries. We have not .asked the Russians to pay for our wool in dollars. I cannot see that the overall position would be relieved if they did pay in dollars. If Russia has surplus dollars, and sells them to the Bank of England, those dollars finally get into the sterlingdollar pool, so that, in the long run, we axe just as well off by getting the dollars in that way as if we received them in direct payment for our wool. I shall have a statement prepared explaining our trade relations with Russia. </para>

            <para>- I have no knowledge of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board having visited Canberra to submit anything to Ministers. I understand that two members of the board live in Canberra, or have homes here, and they may have come  to Canberra to visit them. However, so far as I know, no submissions were made by the board to Ministers, unless they were made to the PostmasterGeneral, who administers broadcasting. When the first order was issued, the honorable member for Reid, or some other honorable member, asked a question in which the matter of Communists being given free radio time, or of radio stations being compelled to accept business from the Communist party was discussed. Before the matter was raised in this House, the Postmaster-General discussed the proposed order with me and, after consultation, it was decided that it should be referred T&#62;ack to the board with a request that it be re-examined. The PostmasterGeneral expressed his view of what he felt to be the difficulty contained in the original order. When the PostmasterGeneral referred the order  back  to the board, he may have intimated that the order in its original form might be disallowed. He asked the board to re-draft the order in terms that would be likely to meet with the approval of the Parliament. I have not had time to deal with the matter this morning, but I understand that the board has re-drafted the order. I hope that to-morrow the Postm asterGeneral or I will be able to indicate to the Parliament the terms of the order that the board now proposes to make. No thought has been given to amending the legislation under which the board has been set up. It is most unlikely that the legislation will be altered. </para>

            <para>- The honorable member for Wimmera has asked a very important question. I treat it as important. What I said is perfectly correct, and I said it again yesterday. The Australian Constitution gives no general power - and those are the important words - to the Australian Parliament to nationalize industry. There is no single legislative power to nationalize possessed by the Parliament, unless one can point to a specific placitum of section 51 of the Constitution which deals with the subject-matter. Yesterday, the honorable member for Wilmot asked me a number of questions about the nationalization of businesses, the iron and steel industry and rural industries. In view of very misleading statements by bodies called constitutional leagues, which ought to know something or pretend to know something about the Constitution the sooner the trutn is known on this matter and understood generally by the public, the better it will be. As every honorable member of this House knows, the fact is that the Commonwealth&#39;s power of nationalization must be found within section 51 of the Constitution. It is quite consistent with that section that legislation was introduced to deal with a specific subject like banking, because that is one of the specific subjects referred to in section 51. The limitation on the constitutional power in relation to banking, as determinded by the High Court, was found in another section of the Constitution. I refer to section 92. Therefore the answer that I gave is indubitably correct. The fact that specific legislation has been passed on a specific subject only proves the truth of my assertion that there must be in section 51 of the Constitution some specific head of power before the Parliament can legislate; otherwise the legislation is invalid. </para>

        <para class="block">The purpose of this bill is to provide for the payment during the current financial year of special grants aggregating &#163;11,054,000 to the States of South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania. </para>
        <para class="block">The payment of these grants has been recommended by the Commonwealth Grants Commission in its sixteenth report which was tabled in Parliament yesterday. In arriving at its recommendations the commission has adopted, as it has done in past years, the principle of financial needs which, in practical terms, means that the special grants are intended to enable the recipient States, by reasonable effort, to function at standards not appreciably below those of the other States. Full details of the commission&#39;s calculations are set out in the sixteenth report, which I commend to the attention of honorable members. It will be noted that, in assessing the grants, the commission has made a searching examination of the finances of the claimant and non-claimant States in 1947-48 - the latest year for which audited figures are available - and it has derived certain standards based on the financial position and practices of the non-claimant States in that year. As in the last eight years, the commission has adopted a balanced budget standard in arriving at the initial approximation to the assessed grants. The commission has then made adjustments to these initial amounts to take account of differences as between the claimant and non-claimant States in standards of social services expenditure and in the rates of taxation and the charges of State business undertakings. The latter item is the subject of adjustment by the commission for the first time this year. The net amounts arrived at after making these adjustments aggregate &#163;7,396,000 and represent the assessed grants for the year of review 1947-48. </para>
        <para>In recent years the finances of the States have deteriorated substantially between the year of review and the year of payment and the commission has, therefore, followed the practice of recommending, in addition to the grants assessed on the year of review, advance payments designed to bring the grants into line with the indispensable needs of the States in the year of payment. Because of the extent . of the deterioration in recent years, however, grants recommended for payment each year have tended to be less than the grants subsequently assessed on that year. This has left the claimant States with fairly substantial deficits. In order to meet this situation the grants recommended by. the commission this year consist of two parts. The first part represents the difference between the grants now assessed for 1947-48 and the grants actually paid in that year. The amount involved is &#163;1,354,000 and payment of this amount is intended to recoup the States concerned for the deficiency in the grants actually paid in 1947-48. The second part of the grants, which amounts to &#163;9,700,000, represents the commission&#39;s estimate of the indispensable needs of the claimant States in the current financial year 1949-50. This second part of the grants will be treated by the commission as advance payments to be finally adjusted two years hence when, in accordance with the procedure that I have described, the grants for this year will be assessed on the basis of the final audited results. </para>
        <para>Last year the special grants to the claimant States amounted to &#163;7,450,000. The grants now recommended to meet the indispensable needs of the States, therefore, involve an increase of &#163;2,250,000, whilst the total grants recommended involve an increase of &#163;3,604,000 over last year of which South Australia will receive an additional &#163;1,324,000, Western Australia an additional &#163;2,018,000 and Tasmania an additional &#163;262,000. In arriving at the grants recommended, the commission has taken account of the prospective shares of the claimant States in the coal strike emergency grant and the tax reimbursement grant which together should give the claimant States amounts aggregating about &#163;3,315,000 above last year. As the special grants now proposed involve an increase this year of &#163;3,604,000, it will be appreciated that, the total increase arising from these three payments to the claimant States in 1949-50 will be very substantial, and will amount in all to nearly &#163;7,000,000. </para>
        <para>The Government has carefully considered the sixteenth report of the Commonwealth Grants Commission and has decided that the commission&#39;s recommendations should, as in past years, be adopted. The commission&#39;s report indicates that, while adhering to the general principles which have been proved over the years, the commission has preserved  due flexibility in its methods in order to meet changing circumstances and to further the objective of maintaining a proper relationship between the financial positions of the claimant and non-claimant States, so ensuring that all members of the federation shall be in a position to operate for the greatest benefit of the whole. </para>

          <para class="block">The proposed exchange, the site of which is in Inker man-street, St. Kilda, is- necessary to serve as the main switch ing centre for a network of branch exchanges known as the &#34; X &#34; group and also to serve 4,000 local subscribers within the St. Kilda area. During the course of its investigations, the committee gave consideration to the possibility of an extension to the exchange in future years and recommended that to preserve the harmonious- appearance and to facilitate the future extension of the building, the tower as depicted on the eastern end of the building on the proposal which it first considered should be revised so as to place the tower on the western end of the building.

The project was fully explained to the House on the 25 th February, when the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Johnson),</inline> on my behalf, moved that &#39; it should be referred for consideration by the committee. The estimated cost of the proposal is &#163;108,960. That figure provides for a third floor which was not included in the estimated cost of &#163;97,952 previously advised to this House.

            <para>.- When progress was reported last -night the committee was discussing item 3 of Division 8 &#34; Other Printing and Binding&#34;. I consider that there should be some control over the printing carried out in connexion with this Parliament. All kinds of publications which extol the activities of Ministers are being produced. They point out that some member or other is a genius and that the Government is the most wonderful that we have ever had. These productions do not give the facts, but they give half-truths and fiction. There should be some control over the expenditure of money for such purposes, because after all it is the people&#39;s money not the Labour party&#39;s that is being spent. I read in the press this morning that there is to be a comic strip in colour produced by the Government showing the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> and, I hope, some other members of his Cabinet. Is that strip to be produced at the cost of the taxpayer or of the Labour party? 1 shall not specify any other printing project, but Ministers know full well that there are many books of the kind to which I have referred. One of the worst offenders is the Department of Labour and National Service which has produced publications that do not bear the name of the printer. </para>

              <para>- But we should know the identity of the printers of that booklet. This and other productions put out by the Government have no imprint. It is an offence in any of the States to produce a publication without an imprint. Why should it not be an offence when the Commonwealth does it?

            <para>.- This is the last occasion during the life of this Parliament on which honorable members will have an opportunity to examine the vote for Parliament as an institution, and I consider therefore that it is the appropriate time for us to  examine the course of the Parliament during the period of its life, particularly to see whether the funds estimated to he necessary for its continuance next year are justified. I also consider it appropriate, so that the public shall be fully informed on these matters, to examine whether the funds proposed are adequate for the purposes for which they are intended, and whether the Parliament, as an institution, is carrying out the purposes for which it is designed. At the end of the Seventeenth Parliament I considered it necessary to point to a serious decline of this Parliament as an institution, a decline that indicated that parliamentary government, as understood by the British people down through the centuries of its development, had reached a stage in Australia, where its importance, influence and practice had considerably decreased. I pointed out then that the Parliament traditionally had been the allpowerful instrument. The Executive had been drawn from the Parliament in the course of the development of British parliamentary practice, was responsible to the Parliament and eventually, and from time to time, had to acknowledge the authority of the Parliament over it. 1 went on to say that such had been the decline in the conduct of this Parliament, as an institution, in the course of the Seventeenth Parliament that the Parliament itself had become a mere rubber stamp for recording the decisions of the Executive. I said that it had voluntarily surrendered a great deal of its traditional authority and control over national expenditure, and that its power had weakened as the power of the Executive had strengthened. If these criticisms were well-founded, as I believe they were in the course of the Seventeenth Parliament, we must ask ourselves whether this Eighteenth Parliament represents any improvement on that state of affairs. I say that the unhealthy trends that were evident in the course of the Seventeenth Parliament have continued so that the Parliament has degenerated, and that not merely has it forfeited a great deal of its proper authority to the Executive, but that the Executive in turn has become merely a recording instrument for one nian who dominates it, the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley).</inline> Without elaborating this matter, I believe that my own conclusions will be confirmed by other honorable members. There was a time when the Parliament as an institution was able, by means of amendments to legislation, to give expression to the views of minorities among the people who made their views known to their parliamentary representatives, and were able to have them adopted, if the reasoning behind them was compelling and if the facts were adequate. But what has been our experience in the course of this Eighteenth Parliament? From  time to time bills have been presented to us with the intimation that no amendments would be considered or accepted by the Government. Those bills had first been presented by the Government to the Labour party caucus and had been adopted by the caucus <inline font-style="italic">in toto.</inline> It is not the function of a government, merely by virtue of its Parliamentary majority, to adopt only the legislation of which its parliamentary majority has approved at a caucus meeting. A government should not represent only a section of the people but should represent all sections of the country. The views of minorities should not merely be heard but, where they are soundly based, they should also be reflected in suitable amendments to legislation. But what has happened during the lifetime of this Parliament? What opportunity has been given to members on the Opposition side or to independent members of the Parliament to have any useful suggestion adopted by a government which has merely presented its legislation to its own party caucus and refuses to adopt any alteration to it? Therefore I consider that the Eighteenth Parliament has failed the people as a true democratic instrument, and it is my conviction that that has not been an accidental development. I believe that this decline in the prestige, authority and the usefulness of the functioning of the Parliament has been a definite plan which was set in motion many years ago. There has been a good deal of discussion in this chamber recently about the objectives of the Socialist party, as outlined at the 1921 Labour party conference at Brisbane. </para>

              <para>- I hope to establish a very clear link between my opening remarks, which were of a general character, and the observations that I shall now make with relation to the institution of Parliament. My point is that we are here as the guardians of the Parliament. We have been entrusted by the people of Australia with the responsibility for continuing this democratic institution, which has been developed by the British people for the free expression of their rights and independence against the authority of the State, whether the State of a monarch, the power and authority of a dictator, or an Executive entrusted with the functions of an administration. All of these things should bow to the authority of the Parliament. I understand that that is what we, the representatives of the people, have been entrusted to maintain. I was about to develop the point that the socialist objective of Labour that was set out in specific terms at the 1921 conference had been watered down to some extent by explanations given in this Parliament during recent weeks by Government members. To my knowledge no attempt has been made at any time to water down, either in this Parliament or outside it, other proposals that were adopted at that conference and which relate directly and categorically to this institution of Parliament. I refer to the proposal that was brought foward at that time to take important financial functions and to place them under the control of a supreme economic council. No one could allege that that is not a matter of direct concern to the Parliament and one that should not properly be considered when we are dealing with the institution of Parliament. If it can be established, as I believe it can, that the Government is pledged to support not merely the socialist objective of 1921, but also the other proposals that were adopted by the conference of the Australian Labour party held in that year, and that in doing so it will take from the Parliament a great deal of its authority, it is very proper that we should consider the implications of such a policy and its effect on the future of democratic government in this &#39; country. Honorable members opposite will need very little reminder by me that at the time the socialist objective was adopted, there were also adopted proposals for the formation of a supreme economic council, which coincides very closely with the presidium that has been established in Soviet Russia. </para>

Surely that is in order? If this Parliament, as an institution, is under attack either by members of the Parliament or by people outside the Parliament, and proposals to reduce the authority of the Parliament are advanced by responsible public men, surely we, as members of Parliament, have a right to refer to the impact of those decisions upon us as an institution. I have some knowledge of relevance in these matters, and I assure the Chair that I am not trying to abuse or circumvent the ruling of the Chair. I shall confine my remarks strictly to matters having a direct bearing on the power of Parliament.

            <para>This was one of the immediate things to be done under the scheme. The first step was to employ Parliamentary machinery to nationalize the industry to give the community and the workers control of that industry. Then they would have government by the workers in the industry. That industry would then become a group, and each group would elect representatives to the Supreme Economic Council, which it would have to do with the chain of workers of the whole workers in industry. So far as the industry itself was concerned under the socialized State, it would really take the place of the political Parliament for all questions of industry. The Council would come only after the initial stages had been reached after nationalization. </para>

          <para class="block">The right honorable member for Yarra said that there would be quite a lot of things they could sum up as social that did not come under industry, and international matters which the industries could not control. Although I do not wish to transgress the ruling of the Chair, I desire to point out that the proposal that was adopted at that time, by the conference, many members of which are also members of this Parliament, envisaged the Parliament as an institution that would deal with some international matters, and certain social matters, but not with the great range of problems that come under the heading of commerce and industry. They were to be taken out of the hands of the Parliament and placed in the hands of this extra parliamentary body. This proposal, which has never been rescinded and still remains part- of the programme of the socialists, is directed at the very heart of the Parliament as an effective instrument for carrying out democratic authority. It is intended that the council, which is not to be elected by the people of Australia as a whole,  should have full authority to deal with matters of industry and commerce, leaving to the shrunken Parliament merely some attenuated authority to deal with social and international problems. Gone is to be the historic responsibility of the Parliament for controlling the nation&#39;s purse strings. That is the objective which the socialists are pledged to carry out. That is the proposal which they adopted in  1921  and have never to this day rescinded. Hand in hand with the objective to which they are pledged is the formation of a supreme economic council which is to rule with all the authority of parliament leaving in its stead this shrunken shell. During the eight years of Labour rule, there has been a steady diminution of the authority and prestige of the Parliament. The Parliament has become an instrument which merely rubber stamps the decisions taken in the caucus, which in turn, takes its orders from the Cabinet as the result of direct pressure from outside- </para>

              <para>- I thank the right honorable member for North Sydney for bringing a few more honorable members  into the chamber. Very often when attention is directed to the fact that a quorum is not present only a few Opposition members are present in the chamber. Usually, when I rise to draw attention to the fact that an honorable member opposite is in the wrong, the honorable member for Fawkner endeavours to draw a herring across the trail by calling for a quorum. On this occasion I note that be got one of his offsiders to do this for him. The right honorable member for North Sydney called attention to the state of the committee just after the honorable member for Fawkner, who poses as a custodian of the rights and privileges of this Parliament, had concluded a speech in which he ranted about subjects that have no relation to the proposed vote now under consideration. The honorable member for Fawkner, who resumed his seat with the satisfied air of a man who had nobly discharged his duty as a member of the Opposition, must realize that during the detailed discussion of the Estimates honorable members are obliged by the Standing Orders to confine their remarks to the proposed vote under discussion. The committee is now dealing  with  the remainder of the proposed vote for the Parliament. Under Division 1, provision is made for financing the cost of administration of the Senate. The honorable member did not deal with that subject. Division 2 provides for the salaries of staff and expenses of administration of the House of Representatives. As the honorable member did not question that provision I assume that he is satisfied that there is good reason for the increase in the vote from &#163;33,400 to &#163;41,000. The proposed vote for the Parliamentary Reporting Staff is &#163;21,000, but the honorable member did not refer to that item. Does he criticize the proposed vote of &#163;28,000 for the Library? He has not endeavoured to show that the proposed vote of &#163;57,000 for the Joint House Department is excessive. He has not criticized the provision of &#163;2,400 for the Public Works Committee, and of &#163;2,600 for the Broadcasting Committee. I admit that last night the honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony)</inline> referred to the proposed vote for the Broadcasting Committee, but the honorable member for Fawkner has not done so. </para>

          <para class="block">The honorable member for Richmond endeavoured to convince his listeners that the Government was wrongfully expending public funds on parliamentary printing for party political purposes against the interests of the people. References have been made to the cost of publishing a booklet which contains general information about social services benefits. Numbers of people have asked me for copies of the booklet in order that they may ascertain whether they are entitled to receive benefits. Because the Labour Government provides that service for the people, honorable members opposite seize the opportunity to query the cost. They do not seem to realize that expenditure is incurred in giving that information. </para>
          <para>The last division of the Parliament relates to provision for the conveyance of members of the Parliament and others, and the maintenance of Ministers&#39; and members&#39; rooms, including the salary of staff. Discussion of the estimates for the Parliament should be restricted to the items that are included in those nine divisions. Honorable members opposite frequently claim that they have a profound knowledge of parliamentary procedure and the Standing Orders, but 1 challenge them to show that their references to decisions that were made at a conference of the Labour party in 192.1 are in the slightest degree relevant to the proposed vote for the Parliament. Indeed, the mass of irrelevancies which honorable members opposite have spoken prove that they have found no legitimate grounds on which to criticize the budget. Instead of submitting constructive suggestions for curtailing expenditure, they have made wild rambling statements that are completely unrelated to the proposed vote for the Parliament. However, their statements call for a reply, because the absence of a refutation may lead some people to think that those assertions are accurate. </para>
          <para>The honorable member for Fawkner remarked that the manner in which the Government treated the Parliament reduced its importance and authority as the supreme legislative body in the land. Other honorable members opposite voice a similar opinion from time to time, but there is no substance in their contention. </para>
          <para class="block">The honorable member for Fawkner kas complained that when the Opposition submits a proposal, the Government or the Parliament does not adopt it. -I should like to hear the honorable gentleman explain his conception of a democratic institution. Does he consider that when a minority group submits a proposal, the majority group should say, &#34; We are opposed to it, but, in order to please you, we- shall adopt your view&#34;? The people have given the Labour party an absolute majority in the Senate and in the House of Representatives, but the honorable gentleman complains because- the Labour Government decides what the legislative programme shall be. The honorable member referred somewhat scathingly to caucus. I invite him to recall whether the Opposition parties, when they occupied the treasury bench, took heed of the submissions of the Labour party in this chamber. The honorable member spoke feelingly about the fact that the Labour Government seeks the approval of caucus before it introduces legislation. I recall that when the honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lang)</inline> was Premier of New South Wales, even his closest supporters did not know what he intended to do until he actually introduced a bill. I am. certain that rank and file members of the Opposition parties when they were in power were not given such a preview of legislation as rank and file members of the Labour party receive. All the assertions to the effect that the Parliament is an instrument which rubber-stamps the decisions of caucus, which, in turn, is dominated by Cabinet, are so much cant arid humbug. The Liberal party and the Australian Country party may truly be likened to rubber stamps, because they blindly supported in the Parliament legislation about which they had not been consulted. No honorable member will begrudge the amount that has been provided in the estimates for the Senate, the House of Representatives, the Library and the other departments that are associated with the official control and functioning of the Parliament. If honorable members desire to discuss their own parliamentary allowances, they will have an opportunity later to do so. </para>

              <para>- Instead of discussing the proposed vote for Parliament, honorable members opposite have opened up a wide field for debate. The honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> has referred to a suggestion that was made at the conference of- the Labour party in 1921 for the appointment of a supreme economic council. I remind the honorable gentleman that there are visionaries on both sides of the chamber. At various conferences held by the Opposition parties, delegates have made suggestions that have been adopted, but honorable members opposite have not attempted to give effect to them. Although the Labour Government has been in office for eight years, it has not attempted to put into operation the policy that was adopted by the Labour conference in 1921. </para>

              <para>- The return of the Labour Government to office is evidence that the majority of the people endorse the policy of the Labour party. One of the planks of the political platform of the Labour party is nationalization of industry, production, distribution and exchange. When the Labour Government  attempted  to nationalize banking, its opponents appealed to the High Court and subsequently to the Privy Council, <inline font-style="italic">io</inline> have the legislation declared unconstitutional. Members of the Labour movement and the Australian people generally are aware of the objectives that vere laid down at the Labour Conference in 192-1, but they are not alarmed, at the prospect. Honorable members opposite ire not likely to succeed with that bogy. C regret very much that the honorable gentleman took advantage of the  discus sion  on the proposed vote for the Parliament to raise matters that I consider  should  have been dealt with in a different way altogether. I admit that honorable  members  opposite have a difficult job. they have been unable to find any just  cause  for complaint in the budget, and  the  task of trying to gain the support of the people for their cause is too much cor them. Therefore, they raise irrelevant matters in the hope that they can  divert  attention from the fact that they lave been unable to produce any valid  critism  of the budget. They have tried n work off old scores, but they have been  unsuccessf  ul. The people know very well hat the Parliament has not been  functioning  in any improper way, and they mow that the present Parliament has lone more for them than any previous  parliament  did. Honorable members who leery this institution and say that it merely serves the purpose of a&#39; rubber  stamp  should read the history of the Mother of Parliaments, upon which we :laim that this Parliament has been modelled. If they do so, they will read about great men like Disraeli and Gladstone, not about less important men such as, perhaps, the honorable member /or Fawkner and I may be. History tells of the great men who controlled the des.tinies of their country from positions of leadership in the Parliament. The names )f such men are the only ones that survive in our memories. Our parliamentary institution has gained its place in his democracy as the result of great men n the past- </para>

              <para>- The Labour party did not kick him out. I still have a great deal of sympathy for the right honorable member. Nobody has heard me gibe at him for holding to his views at the time when he left the Labour party, and- 1 do not gibe at him now. The right  honorable  member knows that. But I repeat that he is judged, not on what he has done during the last ten years, but principally upon what he did when he was a member of the Labour party. He will retain his place in history for that reason, and will be remembered when most of his contemporaries are forgotten. </para>

          <para>To belittle this parliamentary institution, as the honorable member for Fawkner endeavoured to belittle it, is to belittle the Australian people. When the people place a government in power in order to do a certain job and that government honours its obligation and is returned to power again with a handsome majority, it ill behoves the honorable member and others like him to gibe at the achievements of the leader of the Government and his Ministers. The bogy of a supreme economic council is something like the New Guard.&#39; The honorable member for Wentworth will remember the New Guard, although I was not in Sydney when it existed and have little knowledge of it. The honorable gentleman no doubt recall* the occasion when the present honorable member for Reid, as Premier of New South Wales, was about to perform an historic ceremony and a member Of the New Guard came along and spoiled things for him by cutting a ribbon prematurely. The New Guard is almost forgotten now, and the idea of a supreme economic council has been placed in the same category in the minds of most people. I, for one. believe in the&#39;  present  system of representation of the people, and all of the influence that I can exert within the ranks of the Labour party, in this Parliament or anywhere else, will be used to defend the rights of the people. When the chosen candidates assemble in this chamber after the general election preparatory to electing a new  Speaker,  the  Clerk  of the House of Representatives will see gathered before him men and women elected in the democratic fashion that all true Australians know and depend upon. I am sorry that I have digressed as I have done, but I believe that I was entitled to do so because of the way in which the honorable member for Fawkner digressed. </para>
          <para>The  DEPUTY CHAIRMAN&#34;.  - I call the honorable member for Richmond, but before he rises to speak I wish to state my views concerning the latitude that should be allowed to honorable members in discussing the proposed vote now before the Chair. I have given a great deal of consideration to the matter, and it is -clear to me that a wide discussion would extend beyond the limits contemplated in the Standing Orders. I intend to confine discussion to the items in the proposed vote and, if necessary, will allow references to the Executive as opposed to the Parliament as a whole. I shall not allow references to  conferences and other such matters to be made. Such a restriction is necessary, because otherwise the discussion could range over all phases of parliamentary and non-parliamentary history. </para>

I merely point out that if this Government, which has the support of the Labour party, really believes, in accordance with the platform of the Labour party, that the Senate ought not to exist, then the item of &#163;25,000 which appears in these Estimates for the Senate ought not to be there. The Estimates provide &#163;41,000 for the House of Representatives. A considerable part of that money will be spent on maintaining the prestige of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> and the other occupants of the Chair.

              <para>- The honorable member for Martin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Daly)</inline> says that somebody has been pulling my leg. If somebody had done to the honorable member for Martin what was done to the honorable member for Swan, the Government would have instituted an inquiry at once. However, there is one rule for the Opposition and another for supporters of the Government, as has been demonstrated from time to time. This matter was raised by the honorable member for Swan during question time a few days ago, but, so far as I know, the Government has given no indication that an inquiry is being held. I do not think that the honorable member for Swan has bean informed what remedy he has, or what action the Government is taking. Apparently, so long as it is a member of the Opposition who has been injured, the matter can rest there, but if a Government supporter complains, every effort is made to trace the offender. </para>

              <para>- I am not concerned with what the newspaper does.

          <para>I wish to criticize some matters in connexion with <inline font-style="italic">Ilansard.</inline> I do not want to criticize <inline font-style="italic">Ilansard</inline> unduly, because the matter to which I refer is not entirely the fault of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> The staff does a very good job under extremely onerous conditions, but if we are to spend &#163;20,000 or &#163;30,000 on the production of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> it has to provide a useful and  efficient  service. One of the things that I complain  about is that it takes <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> two years to produce an index of members&#39; speeches. Without an index what is the use of countless volumes of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> to an ordinary member who wants to look up something said some time before and there is no clue to where it is to be found ? One has to go through thousands of pages to find what one is seeking. The purpose of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> is to make readily available to members, for their convenience, the speeches and events that have taken place in the chamber. The last index published is two years old. I do not entirely blame <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> for that. <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> probably wishes to provide an up-to-date and efficient service. It is up to the Government either to put more money on the Estimates so that <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> shall be able to provide an efficient service, or to reduce the service of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> altogether, because a partial service is of little use. </para>

              <para>- I did not, but I repeat that the government broadcasting services of Australia are one edifice superimposed upon another until we do not know whether we are at the bottom or the top. We have the Broadcasting Committee under the chairmanship of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Amour.</inline> Where does it stand in relation to the Australian Broadcasting Control Board? Which is supreme - the board or the committee? What is the function of the one and what is the function of the other? One, at least, is superfluous. I say that both are superfluous. But one at least is superfluous. There is no justification for the Government&#39;s placing &#163;2,600 on the Estimates for the purpose of providing jaunts for members of the Broadcasting Committee. When I said that last night, the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> said that when I criticized the committee I was criticizing members of the Opposition who were also members of the committee. But I remind the Minister that when the committee was reconstituted at the beginning of this Parliament, the Australian Country party would have so little to do with it that not one member of the party would accept nomination for appointment to the committee. Members of the party considered that to be a member of the committee would be wasting equivalent to condoning the public money. Not one member of the Australian Country party would accept appointment to the committee, although the party was invited to nominate a member. </para>

As far as one can gather from what has been said in various places, the machinery of the Parliament is in the present circumstances severely restricted. Provision for the printing of the noticepaper is made under Division 8, &#34; Parliamentary Printing&#34;. On to-day&#39;s notice-paper under &#34; General Business &#34; appears a motion dealing with the initiative, referendum and recall that was moved by the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mrs. Blackburn)</inline> many months ago.

            <para>. -  The committee is now considering the proposed vote for the Parliament. I do not propose to enter into any discussion with respect to the functioning of the Parliament, but I wish to explain several items to which reference has been made in thi* debate. Last evening the honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Turnbull referred to the item, &#34; Conveyance oi</inline> members and their luggage in Canberra &#34; for which the expenditure last year amounted to &#163;168. He referred also the corresponding item in respect of the Senate, and pointed out that whilst the suan of only &#163;1 was expended last financial year for the conveyance of honorable senators and their luggage in Canberra the sum of &#163;100 is now being provided for that purpose. Expenditure in connexion with transport services provided by the Department of the Interior for other departments in Canberra, including the Parliament, is shown under the vote for the Department . of the Interior. The amount of &#163;168 represents payments made to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bishop,</inline> who is the House of Representatives transport officer, for the use of his car on official business. At the commencement of the last financial year, the transport officer for the Senate, after having been reimbursed the sum of &#163;1, sold his car and subsequently arranged for the transport of senators and their luggage through the Department of the Interior. The cost of that transport would be debited to the vote for that department. The sum of &#163;100 now proposed to be provided for the transport of senators and their luggage in Canberra is required to cover the running cost of a utility truck which will be obtained from the Department of the Interior for use by the Senate transport officer. </para>

            <para>. -  I hope to keep within the Standing Orders in making the remarks that I intend to make this afternoon. I do not wish to refer to anything that has been done, but I desire to raise, as a matter of interest, certain things that have not been done in connexion with the conduct of this House, and if necessary I am prepared to move that a line in the Estimates be struck out. But for the time being I am prepared to continue without so moving. The matters that I desire to raise concern <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker,</inline> the honorable member for Darling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Clark).</inline> As we are now in committee there is nothing to prevent that honorable gentleman from rising in any part of the chamber in which he may happen to be, and explaining himself, if he can do so. The first matter that I desire to raise in this connexion is the failure of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker</inline> to take notice of an article which was published in the June issue of <inline font-style="italic">Liberal Opinion</inline> and which reflects upon his conduct as Deputy Speaker. The article to which I call attention is headed &#34; Menzies&#39;s suspension was malicious act &#34;. </para>

            <para>.- I tried to address the committee recently regarding the establishment of standing committees in connexion with customs and foreign affairs. I believe that all the statements that have been submitted about a supreme council are answered, in a democracy itself ; that Parliament in a democracy is the supreme body; and that Parliament represents the humblest persons in the community no matter how poor they may be or how low on the social ladder. No matter how distressing their circumstances may be they can be given a voice in the Parliament. I also point out that the King&#39;s justice flows from  His  Majesty the King down to the humblest and lowliest in the community. But it is not sufficient that that should be actually so; it must also appear to be so. In the same way, it is not sufficient for this Parliament to represent everybody in the community ; it must also appear to do so. I suggest, therefore, that when the Parliament itself is under discussion in the Parliament the greatest possible latitude should be given. That would be the answer to those who Say that democracy fails. Having said that I desire to address myself to the Estimates under discussion. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>There is no provision in these Estimates for the re-establishment of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Accounts, although the Auditor-General has recommended that it be re-established. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> promised me last year that he would examine that matter which is, I believe, one of great moment and great urgency. The Estimates grant the Government access to specific sums of public money but without stating the specific purpose for which they are to be used. Both the Government, as the executive body, and this Parliament as the legislative body must accept the responsibility for the expenditure of that money. We must accept the responsibility of seeing that that money is not only properly budgeted, but is also properly expended. We must be satisfied that machinery exists to supervise its proper expenditure. Those safeguards do not exist at the moment. Our financial affairs are being conducted in a slipshod fashion. The Parliament that votes this public money has no satisfactory checks or balances. I say deliberately that when this committee of the Parliament votes approval for this expenditure, it does so blindly. But after the Parliament meets and assembles, as we see it to-day, it is not absolved from the overriding responsibility of seeing that the money that has been extracted from the pockets of the  people is being properly expended under proper supervision. I am not satisfied - and. I hove that the committee is not satisfied - -that adequate precautions have been taken against maladministration, waste, extravagance and inefficiency. Precautions against those dreadful things do not exist to-day. They are all the more essential because of the revolutionary changes that have occurred in the field of public expenditure during the past few years. The Parliament, this committee, and the people should know that the Government expends almost half of the national income of over &#163;500,000,000. The Australian Government is by far the largest employer of labour in this country. </para>

              <para>- I rise to order. We are discussing the various Estimates under the heading of &#34; Parliament &#34;. There are nine divisions in this particular group of Estimates. I suggest that the honorable member for Reid must relate his remarks to one or other of these divisions, which refer to expenditure incurred as a result of legislative action under statutory authority. I contend that the honorable member for Reid is not entitled to deal with a subject-matter relating to the investigations of a committee for which, because it was suspended by legislative action, there is no provision in the Estimates. </para>

              <para>- Instead of the old Public Accounts Committee, we have a variation of the cost-plus system. Minor officials have authority to purchase huge quantities of stores, whilst Ministers have the backing of regulations and government departments without reference to specific items in this Parliament. They now regard millions of pounds as farthings were once regarded. All of these elements have created a financial position that involves every member of this chamber in very heavy personal responsibility when voting for the expenditure of public money. Unfortunately financial statements are too often regarded merely as irksome figures without meaning. They are not measured by the committee in terms of bread and butter, as they are measured by the taxpayers who provide the money. I point out that of the 75 members of this committee one man has the real say in determining the amount of money to be voted. He has all of the say with relation to how the money is to be distributed between the different departments, and what secret reserves are to be established. The man who does all of those things is the Treasurer. That is his job in the first place, and rightly so. But it is the responsibility of this committee to see that he carries out his job in the best interests of the taxpayers who provide the money which he expends. Honorable members are therefore in a very responsible position of trust. They have exactly the same responsibility to the taxpayers as have the trustees of an estate to the beneficiaries in that estate, and as has the director of a public company to the shareholders of the company. It is no defence for a director of a public company to plead ignorance if the financial affairs of the company are mismanaged. He is paid to watch the affairs of the company and to guard the interests of the shareholders. It is his duty to see that the financial affairs of his company are not mismanaged. In exactly the same way it is no defence for members of this Parliament to plead ignorance of the way in which public money is being handled by the Government. Yet there is an abysmal ignorance in this Parliament of the management of our public accounts. In the State parliaments there has always been a great awareness of how the pounds, shillings and pence that are supplied to the government are expended. Members of the State parliaments have a detailed knowledge of how money made available to the government is being expended. No stray millions are left lying around. During the last few years there has developed in the Commonwealth a rather chaotic jumble in the administration of public finance. The Treasurer is niggardly in matters in respect of which he should be liberal. He is nasty and unkind in matters in respect of which, as a Labour man, he should be truly liberal. On the other hand, powerful bureaucrats are spending public money on all kinds of undertakings. Their attitude could be summed up as one of, &#34;What is a million here or a million there? What does it matter? Money is easy to get these days &#34;. These are the people behind the Government. That policy is evidenced by the huge subsidies paid to international organizations, by the lavish expenditure . on embassies abroad and by the welter of boards that operate in this country. Prior to the outbreak of World War II., the Auditor-General had a comparatively easy task. Public expenditure flowed in normal channels and in accordance with a fixed code of practice. That code was, of necessity, scrapped during the war, but it appears to be in danger of being scrapped permanently, notwithstanding the fact that we are now expending more than five times as much as we expended prior to the war. In voting this money, it is the duty of every honorable member to satisfy himself that all possible safeguards are being taken in the supervision of the subsequent expenditure. Recently, I placed a number of specific questions on the notice-paper directing attention to paragraphs of the last report of the Auditor-General in which specific action was requested to deal with certain matters which arose during the year 1947-48. The Auditor-General was not satisfied that the present system of audit provides all the safeguards that are needed. He made serious strictures regarding contracts entered into by the Government in connexion with aircraft production. </para>

              <para>- I hope that I have not misunderstood the ruling of the Chair, but my view is that the Public Accounts Committee should be reconstituted in order to control expenditure, and to ensure that there is no crookedness and that nothing wrong is being done. The only way in which I can support my case for the reconstitution of the committee is to show that something that is not right has been or is being done. I make that statement without any intention of being offensive. If I say that I consider that the Public Accounts Committee should be reconstituted, I shall be asked to support my contention with reasons. I should like permission to adduce those reasons now. If you, sir, rule that I may not proceed in that way, the people will be voiceless in this chamber, and will be robbed of millions of pounds. </para>

            <para>.- I  desire to seek some information, and I shall not digress from the proposed vote for the Parliament, which is now under consideration. There are nine divisions under this heading and the proposed votes for eight of them show increases compared with the expenditure in 194S-49. In other words, the Government expects a reduction of expenditure only in respect of Division 8, &#34; Parliamentary Printing&#34;. The first item in that division&#39; is &#34; Printing of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> including cost of distribution &#34;, for which the proposed vote last year was &#163;18,000 and the expenditure &#163;30,304. The estimated expenditure on that item during this financial year is &#163;23,000, or &#163;7,304 less than the actual expenditure last year. As the number of senators and members of the House of Representatives will be increased after the forthcoming general election, 1 should like the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> to explain why the Government anticipates a reduction of expenditure on the printing and distribution of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> this year. Will the honorable gentleman state whether more machinery has been installed to reduce the cost of printing <inline font-style="italic">Hansard?</inline> We know that the postal charges will not be reduced. In passing, I pay a tribute to the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff for the excellent work that it does; but I cannot understand why the estimated expenditure for the printing and distribution of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> this year should be substantially less than the expenditure last year, when the increase of the number of senators and members of the House of Representatives indicates a larger circulation of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> I refrain from pointing out at any length that the Government, by reducing expenditure on the Parliament, could make this institution an example for other departments to emulate. </para>

            <para>. - The honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Turnbull)</inline> has stated that Division 8, &#34;Parliamentary Printing&#34;, is the only one of the nine divisions under the Parliament in respect of which the .estimated expenditure this year is less than the actual expenditure last year. The reason, T understand, is that in the twelve months in which a general election is held, the Parliament does not usually meet so frequently as in the other years. Therefore, in accordance with experience, it is estimated that fewer copies of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> will be produced and distributed in this election year. That accounts for the difference between the treatment of this item, and the treatment of the other divisions under the heading of &#34; Parliament &#34;. Last year, the vote was for the printing of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> &#163;18,000, and the expenditure was &#163;30,304. The increased expenditure was due to the fact that arrears of work in. the printing office, due to staffing difficulties, had to be overtaken. That situation is not expected to recur this year. </para>

            <para>. - It is regrettable that, within the precincts of this building, there should exist in the bar for use by persons other than members of the Parliament, conditions which are, to say the least, quite primitive. Extensive alterations are being  made to the building to accommodate an increased number of members. I suggest that something should be placed on the Estimates for the purpose of improving conditions in the downstairs bar, which is used by officers of the Parliament, public servants, and pressmen. Some years ago, pressmen and others were permitted to use certain parts of the main bar accommodation upstairs, but that no longer obtains. Conditions in the lower bar are appalling. &#91; say at once that it is not the fault of those employed there, but of the existing conditions. I ask that some notice be taken of my remarks, so that the position may be rectified. </para>

Seeing that more than 200 persons are affected, it is time the matter was looked into. Some time ago, I asked that provision for a staff room be made while the alterations were in progress. There is in this building no canteen, or place where employees may have their meals. There is no rest room. There is no staff room with lockers. There is no provision for recreation, or leisure-time pursuits. Members of the House of Representatives and of the Senate are employees of the public just as are members of the various staffs employed in this building. We, however, have pegs on which to hang our hats, but some of the employees lack even this amenity. That may seem a small matter, but it is one of great importance. The work of the Parliament could not be done effectively but for the members of the various staffs. Members of the Parliament have quite luxurious dining-rooms and billiardrooms, as well as other amenities. </para>

            <para>- By comparison, they are. Recently, a member of one staff employed in this building was taken ill. I went down to the lower part of the building to see what care was being taken of her, and I was shocked at what I saw.. Every member of the Parliament should make it his business to find out about thesethings. There is here no first-aid room, and no first-aid kit. There is no provision for taking care of any person who becomes ill. I have not mentioned the typists employed by members of the Parliament and Ministers, nor have I mentioned newspaper employees, because there is more opportunity for them, I understand, to have care taken of them. We have just heard that there is a downstairs bar, but there are no other amenities for the men and women employed in the building, and it is time that something was done about it. A room should be set aside for them. There should be recreation facilities. Lockers should be provided, and, if possible, a canteen. There should be, at any rate, a place where employees can eat. At present, some of them have to eat their lunch at their desks, with their hats under their chairs. I object to that situation. </para>

            <para>.- I support the references made earlier to the need for the re-establishment of a public accounts committee in this Parliament. It is too late, of course, in the life of this Parliament to take action along those lines, but I hope that it will be found practicable by the succeeding government to do so. It has been pointed out by other speakers that the Parliament had a standing committee on public accounts until 1932. But that was not the most recent occasion on which such a committee has functioned. Honorable members will recall that during the war the War Expenditure Committee operated. It was broadly a public accounts committee. As one of the members of the committee, I am sure that I speak for those who had the same experience as I had when I say that we felt that it did an extremely useful job and provided a useful check upon departmental extravagance. It was able to inquire into many matters. When investigation proved that there was  nothing amiss, at least we had the satisfaction of knowing that, and the public in whose interests we reported also had had that satisfaction of knowing that matters were on a proper basis. When the War Expenditure Committee was terminated, because its peculiar war-time function ceased with the coming &#39; of peace, all the members of the committee, conscious as they were of the usefulness of the work that it had done, combined in making a unanimous recommendation to the Government that a peace-time public expenditure commits tee be constituted. There is such a committee in the House of Commons, of course, and one is very necessary here, particularly at a time when government budgets are covering more than &#163;500,000,000 a year. Without elaborating the point, I content myself with saying that it is necessary to give back to the Parliament some of the control that it should properly exercise over the expenditure of public money. We should have a standing committee on public accounts in the new Parliament. </para>

          <para>I propose now to deal with the item under Division 9, &#34; Conveyance of members of the Parliament and others &#34;, for which an amount of &#163;96,000 is provided. I feel that there has not been a proper adjustment made in the accounts of the Parliament for the circumstance that so many members now travel by air on their parliamentary duties. The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> can correct me if I am wrong, .but I understand that the Government pays exactly the same amount now to the Stale governments for the use of the railways by members of the Parliament as it did before air travel was instituted. T understand that an amount of &#163;160 a year is paid in respect of each member of the Parliament so that we may have the privilege of travelling on parliamentary duties, on official occasions, or for any purpose on the Australian railways. Most of the travelling that we now have to do, is clone by air, either necessarily or by  choice. We make use of the Government&#39;s own service, Trans-Australia Airlines. </para>

              <para>- I agree that very few would spend more than &#163;1 a year on rail travel. In the last two years I do not think I have had occasion to use my own pass on the railways at all. There muse be many like me. That means that &#163;320 has been paid out unnecessarily on my account at a time when the Parliament is under criticism for growing expenditure, particularly expenditure on the privileges of members. This is a matter that might be properly examined by the Joint House Committee or by the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Johnson).</inline> I do not suggest that the opportunities for travel ought to be restricted, hut I think savings could be made if the Government instituted a system of travel vouchers whereby members could travel by rail or by air. Air travel is the modern form of travel. We have become accustomed to it. On the grounds of comfort and convenience, most of us prefer it. Choice of means of travel could be granted, provided that in any one year the amount thai has been paid previously on behalf of the member for travel privileges was not exceeded. That might not suit members from country electorates who have to travel long distances and for whom air travel facilities are not readily available. That could be examined. I believe that if my proposal were investigated, the overall cost to the Parliament could be reduced and that the facilities available to members for convenient and speedy travel might be increased. I ask the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction to have the matter investigated. I believe that we are paying for privileges which are neither not available or are not used under present -conditions. </para>

The honorable member for Fawkner has suggested that instead of gold passes there should be a system whereby members would have a series of vouchers which they could use for either rail or air travel. The fact is that the amount that is paid for the gold pass is the standard amount set by the railway authorities throughout Australia for an all-lines pass. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member for Fawkner said that he did not want travel privileges curtailed in any way. An all-lines pass cannot be obtained for less than &#163;160 annually, because that is the standard amount charged throughout the Commonwealth. If honorable members agreed to exchange that privilege for a series of vouchers to be used for either rail or air travel, it might be more costly than the present system. </para>

He has had three years during the life of this Parliament in which  he  could have raised the matter by resolution in the House, by a motion for the adjournment, by a censure motion, or by  other  means. </para>

            <para>. - I  should not have risen to speak on this item had it not been that the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt)</inline> raised the question of the parliamentary gold pass. I should say that he  has  special knowledge of the subject, as have other -honorable members who have served on the House Committee and on the Privileges Committee of the House, when those committees have been examining the possibility of adopting some substitute for the gold pass. The position is quite clear and I do not think that it admits of any equivocation. Modern methods of air travel have plainly superseded railway travel. I have not used my gold pass on the railways during the last five or six years, although, apparently, the Government during that time has been paying &#163;160 annually to the various State Governments for my privilege of holding that pass. The sole purpose to which I have put my gold pass during the last few years has been to obtain free entrance to race-courses. I consider that it would not be difficult to find some substitute medallion to take the place of the gold pass, if it is the intention that members of the Parliament should have some badge or other means by which they will be able to identify themselves to strangers or to certain authorities. </para>

I am only trying to assist the committee by re-emphasizing something that has been already put forward as, I am sure, purely a common-sense proposition. The gold pass as far as the great majority of members of this House and of the Senate are concerned is no longer being used for the purposes for which it was originally issued. That being so, it behoves the Government to inquire whether it is worth while continuing payments for a service which is no longer being utilized. </para>

            <para>.- I do not, desire the Minister or the House to take the opinions of the two honorable members who have spoken on the subject of the gold pass as being representative of the opinions of the committee generally. One of those honorable members lives at Randwick, in Sydney, and the other at Toorak, in Melbourne. Other honorable members who live away from the capital cities, and far from the hurly-burly of metropolitan life and who have no air transport operating between the country  town3  of their electorates and the capital cities, have to use the railways. When Parliament is in recess, I travel 50 miles on six days a week more often than not. from my home to the Federal Members&#39; Rooms in Brisbane. I trust, therefore, that the Minister will not accept the opinions of the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt)</inline> and the honorable member for Watson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Falstein)</inline> as the opinion of the committee as a whole. I consider that the matter should be examined, but not with a view to abolishing the gold pass as a means of allowing honorable members to travel by railway. I use the railways to travel to remote parts of my electorate. I consider that the object for which the gold pass was originally issued to members of Parliament was to permit such travel. Before anything final is done in relation to this matter the views of all honorable members should be considered. The matter should be referred to the House committee which should make its recommendations to the Government. I repeat, however, that I hope that the Government will not reach any decision to abolish the gold pass or adopt the suggestions made here to-day without giving the closest consideration to all aspects of the matter. </para>

            <para>.- I shall deal with, a point that arises from the remarks of the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mrs. Blackburn)</inline> in relation to the facilities in this building for the  9taff,  which, she said, were inadequate. Parliament House, in Canberra, unlike the parliament houses in the States, is the seat of actual administrative government as well as of the legislature. If one compares the Western Australian Parliament House in Perth, which is not a very good building, with this Parliament House, one finds that Ministers in that State have their offices scattered throughout the City of Perth instead of having them in the parliamentary building itself. Therefore, the problem of staff facilities does not arise there. When this Parliament House was built,  it was designed to- be a temporary Parliament House only. It was not intended to be an administrative centre as well as a Parliament House. As a result of its use for administrative as well as legislative purposes, accommodation for staff in the building has always been inadequate. Only a very large building programme would meet the suggestions of the honorable member for Bourke. I was surprised to hear that honorable member say that the staff had no dining-room facilities in the building. If that is so, it is quite wrong that pressmen should be allowed to use the minor dining-room on the northern side of the member&#39;s billiard-room. If there is any ukase that excludes members of the staff from using that dining-room while pressmen are permitted to use it, it should be altered. I do not say definitely that members of the press should be excluded, because I am certain that typists from ministerial staffs frequently use the minor dining-room. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I turn now to the accommodation provided for members of Parliament themselves, because I believe that underlying the planning of this building was an idea which has led to discrimination against the House of Representatives in favour of the Senate. That discrimination, in view of the Australian Constitution, was based on fallacious premises. I am sure that if the honorable member for Bourke were not an Independent with a private room to herself she would have raised the subject of the accommodation of members of Parliament. Members of the three main parties have to share common rooms in which they have to deal with a very considerable quantity of mail. Only Independents, certain ex-Ministers and Privy Councillors have private rooms. The locker accommodation of members, the mail facilities and the opportunity that they have of peacefully attending to their correspondence in each common room, are necessarily poor. The reason simply is that when this building was erected it was considered that, apparently because the American Senate is more important than the American House of Representatives, the Australian Senate would be more important than the Australian House of Representatives. There was no justification for that assumption other than that both the American Senate and the Australian Senate bear the name of Senate. The Australian Constitution definitely makes the Senate a weak house by comparison with the American Senate. Yet senators in this Parliament have private rooms in which to deal withtheir correspondence and to do otherwork such as preparing their speeches. It is an objective fact that the Senate meets very much lass frequently than does theHouse of Representatives and it is also an objective fact that members of theSenate, not being known personally within confined constituencies, get less correspondence than do members of the House of Representatives. I do not think that an honest case can be made out for the provision of private rooms for all members of the Senate and of only a large common room for members of the House of Representatives. I think that in disposing of the new rooms that will become available on the completion of the enlargement of this building consideration should be given to the allotment of rooms to members of the House of Representatives. A great many rooms in this building have been allotted to the press. I doubt whether in any parliament elsewhere such facilities have been granted to the press in relation to all the facilities available. I certainly doubt whether the facilities that are granted to members of other parliaments are as poor as are those made available to members of the House of Representatives in this building. I should like the Minister to state whether in the enlargement of the parliamentary building which is now taking place any consideration has been given to the allotment of rooms to members of the House of Representatives in the same way as, for a long time, rooms have been, allotted to members of the Senate. </para>

            <para>. - I enter this discussion merely to contest, the acceptance of the point of view that this chamber is now not only a permanent place of assembly for the Parliament of the nation, but also a permanent place in which administrative staffs, other than the parliamentary staffs, are housed. This building was not planned for that dual purpose. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Chairman,</inline> having been a member of the Parliament since it was transferred to Canberra, well know that this building has not always been an administrative as well as a legislative centre. Up to the outbreak of World War II., it was customary for Ministers to have their offices in their own departments, which are located in buildings scattered throughout this city. During the war when the War Cabinet and the Advisory War Council had to meet at very short notice and when continuous consultation between Ministers was necessary to deal with emergencies suddenly arising, a practice gradually developed in which Ministers left their departments and established themselves wholly in this building with one or two members of their personal staffs. The number of Ministers and their personal staffs who have remained in the building has increased with the years. I suppose that private members of this Parliament would face an extremely difficult task if they endeavoured to uproot those Ministers and their staffs and return them to their departments where they would be in the centre of their administration and able to exercise close and personal control over all their officers. To bring about that result would indeed be a difficult task. Nevertheless, I contest the suggestion that we should accept as permanent this intrusion upon the proper purposes of a parliamentary building. I trust that when the new permanent administrative block is completed Ministers will immediately, either voluntarily or by the vote of their fellow members, transfer themselves and their personal staffs thereto. It is desirable that private members should enjoy better facilities and privileges in the way of accommodation than they can possibly possess in this building as its rooms are now allotted. I happen to be one of the few members of this chamber who enjoys the privilege of a private room. I have a private room, because I live in Canberra and make Canberra my head-quarters for the conduct of my electoral business. I have a private room only because of considerable determination and insistence on my part that in these circumstances I should have a private room. The view was very clearly expressed to me that I had no right to a private room in this building and that I should ask the Department of the Interior to provide a room for me at Civic Centre, where I could conduct my business as a member of the Parliament. When the system was established of appointing typist-secretaries for each member, the typewriter which I had formerly used and which belonged to the House of Representatives was taken away from me. I made some protest about that. The officials said, &#34; You cannot have this typewriter; it belongs to the House of Representatives &#34;. I said, &#34;I am a member of the House of Representatives &#34;. They said, &#34; If you are a member of the House of Representatives, you should apply to the Department of the Interior for a typewriter. You are certainly not entitled to a machine which belongs to the House of Representatives &#34;. That is the position in which I and all other private members find themselves. It is wrong that members of the Parliament should be beholden in any way to the Department of the Interior for the supply of facilities to enable them to carry on their duties as members of the Parliament. It is wrong that in the employment of our typist-secretaries, and in the provision of facilities which we need for the discharge of our duties, we should be beholden in any way to an outside government department. Control over the provision of such facilities should be exercised by the  President  and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> and the officers of the Parliament who are under their control. I add my support to the request that further consideration be given to the provision of proper facilities for members of the Parliament who, as servants of the people, are required to work in this building. </para>

              <para>- I note that a considerable amount of money has been provided for the payment of &#34; temporary and casual employees &#34; in various branches of the Prime Minister&#39;s Department. For instance, &#163;146,000 has been earmarked under that heading for the High Commissioner&#39;s office in the United Kingdom, &#163;14,000 for the administrative section of the department, &#163;89,300 for the Audit Office, &#163;15,000 for the Public Service Board, &#163;1,600 for the GovernorGeneral&#39;s office, and &#163;4,000 for the National Library. The total of &#163;270,000 almost staggers me. The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> should explain why that extraordinarily large sum is provided for casual and temporary employees in various sections of the Prime Minister&#39;s Department. I am one of those persons who strongly believe in the principle of preference in employment for ex-service men and women. I know that the Commonwealth, under the Re-establishment and Employment Act, is obliged to grant preference to exservicemen and women when persons are being appointed to positions in the Public Service. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I shall be interested to learn whether other departments have made such substantial provision for casual and temporary employees as the Prime Minister&#39;s Department has done. A considerable number of temporary and casual employees are .ex-service men and women who have worked in Commonwealth offices since the end of the war and they should be given an opportunity to qualify for permanent appointment. I recall that after &#34;World War I., ex-servicemen were able to sit for an examination, at a standard somewhat lower than that which is set for other persons who desire co be appointed permanently to the Public Service, and the successful candidates were able to become permanent officers in certain groups of the Public Service and within certain salary ranges. I hope that temporary and casual employees of the Commonwealth at the present time will be given a similar opportunity to qualify for permanent appointment to the Public Service. This Government constantly prates about social security for the people, but exservice men and women, who are temporary public servants, have very little security in employment. We have experienced a protracted global war, during which the Government called upon all men and women to play their part to the best of their ability in order to bring the struggle to a successful conclusion. While the war was in progress, the recruitment of permanent officers of the Public Service almost ceased, and many vacancies occurred. After World War I., the vacancies were filled in two ways. University students were invited to seek appointment, and, as I stated, ex-servicemen had an opportunity to sit for an examination at a standard somewhat lower than that of the usual Public Service examination, with a view to qualifying for appointment to positions in certain groups. Reports on the anility of those applicants were also obtained from the permanent heads of the departments in which they had been employed. </para>
          <para>The time is long overdue when such important branches of the Prime Minister&#39;s Department as the High </para>
          <para class="block">Commissioner&#39;s office in the United Kingdom should employ a larger percentage of permanent employees to temporary and casual employees. I ask the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction to bring my protest to the notice of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley).</inline> I understand that a large number of the temporary and casual employees at the present time are ex-service men and women, who should be given an opportunity to become permanent employees in the Public Service. Probably, millions of pounds a year are being paid to temporary and casual employees. It is a monstrous state of affairs. Such employees are entitled to security, about which the Government members talk so much. The Public Service Board should consider the matter. </para>

              <para>- Yes. The honorable member has touched upon a matter which applies to the Public Service generally. Almost every day, we read in the newspapers advertisements inviting applications for various positions in the Public Service, but the fact is that the Public Service Board is finding it very difficult to get persons to fill permanent positions. The Government is already doing everything possible to make suitable appointments to permanent positions. It remains true, however, that in various Commonwealth departments, including the office of the Australian High Commissioner in the United Kingdom, it is necessary to employ temporary officers upon duties which, by their nature, are themselves temporary. For instance, many persons employed in the High Commissioner&#39;s office in the United Kingdom are engaged upon work in connexion with Australia&#39;s expanded immigration policy to deal with the large number of immi grants passing through London on their way to Australia. The present flow of displaced persons from Europe is not expected to continue. Indeed, we have been informed by the International Refugee Organization that the number of displaced persons coming to Australia is likely to diminish greatly at the end of two years. It is possible that immigration, even from the United Kingdom, may also decline in the future.  I  am sure that the honorable member would not wish us to appoint permanent officers to the Immigration Department to do work of a temporary character. </para>

            <para>. -  I should like the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> to inform the committee, if he can, whether the Government has given any consideration to filling the position of High Commissioner for Australia in the United Kingdom, and particularly whether he has given any personal consideration to the acceptance of that position. It would be a relief to the minds of many of us if he could say that he has definitely set his face against the idea. If, however, he has not done so, we should be much obliged if he would let us know, so that we may accustom ourselves to his absence. </para>

Apparently, those who control the newspapers did not think, the matter of sufficient importance to give it any prominence. The Government has not yet considered the filling of the position of High Commissioner in the United Kingdom. Honorable members will be informed in due course after a decision is taken. </para>

              <para>- The amount of &#163;310,000 is proposed to be set aside for the public audit of the Commonwealth accounts, and, in general, when an auditor is appointed by an organization, whether  it be a public company or a national parliament, it is customary for notice to be taken of the observations of that auditor. If the directors of a public company failed to take notice of the observations of the auditor, they would have to take the consequences in two different ways. One would be by prosecution for mismanagement of funds and the other would be by being supplanted by the shareholders. But, in the case of a government, there is no redress except that a government must face the electorate every three years. But there should be no necessity for any suggestion of that kind if the Government gave effect to the provisions of the Audit Act of the findings of the Auditor-General. We see that &#163;310,000 is to be voted, and properly so, for the protection of the public accounts so that no one may misuse public funds and there shall be no misappropriation or irregularities of like character. But we find each year - I am not referring specifically to this year, because the matter can be taken back over several years - that when the Auditor-General directs the attention of the Parliament, and particularly the Government, to some irregularities, his observations are completely ignored by the Government. He does his duty. He points out the faults. He cannot do any more if the Government refuses to take any notice. Let us look at some of the things that he reported on, and about which nothing has been done, so far as I know. In the 1947-48 report, he made the point that the total loss by the services departments for five years amounted to &#163;470,536. So far as the Parliament has been concerned, not a thing has been done about that. A year or so earlier he directed attention to the misuse by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> of certain motor car services and to improper billing of the department. So far as we know, that account was paid by the Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> said, in effect, that the Auditor-General meant nothing to him. If we are to expend the very great sum of &#163;310,000, which is the best part of one-third of &#163;1,000,000, to maintain the Audit Office, a highly necessary office, and then have the AuditorGeneral&#39;s report, when it is submitted to the Parliament, completely discounted, the taxpayer gets very little value from the supervision exercised over the Government. As a matter of fact, the Auditor-General&#39;s report has frequently been withheld from this Parliament for a period long after it could have been presented to it. I therefore hope that there will be a little more respect for the proper supervision of the public accounts than we have enjoyed in the past. I think I shall leave it at that. On your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Temporary Chairman,</inline> I cannot discuss the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization. </para>

I do not know whether I shall be ruled out of order if I refer to particular departments, but I understand that appointments to all departments are made by the Public Service Board. They include appointments to the Patents Office. I have recently had occasion, on behalf of a constituent, to inquire why there has been such unseemly delay in dealing with applications for patents. </para>

              <para>- Pardon me. I was informed that the reason for the delays was that the Public Service Board had not made the appointments necessary to enable the Patents Office to carry out its duties. The people in charge of the office claimed that the office is understaffed and is two years behind with many  applications. They say that the whole trouble is that they cannot secure the appointment of the necessary staff. I understand that only the Public Service Board can make the appointments. They told me that they were short of four examiners and that they have only one man doing the job of examining scores and perhaps hundreds of applications for patents. People who submit applications for patents, trade marks, designs and the like are entitled to reasonably prompt dealing. If appointments are not made because of the failure of the Public Service Board to make them, and no other agency can make them, there is a state of inefficiency in almost every department. The Public Service Board in its turn, will probably say that it has advertised vacancies. To be an examiner of patents in most cases a person must have had a university training; frequently a man with legal training is required. My opinion is that the salaries offered for the positions are so poor in contrast with what men with similar qualifications can get in other vocations, that no one, or practically no one, applies for the jobs. I say, therefore, that it is time that the Public Service Board reviewed the range of salaries that it offers in contrast with the range of salaries and rewards offered by outside organizations. Unless something is done about the situation, essential Commonwealth departments will be behind in dealing with the needs of the public in a score of ways. I have mentioned the Patents Office, but there is a back-log of applications in the Department of Trade and Customs and other departments, including, if you like, the Taxation Branch, from which it takes a long time to get a reply to a letter, as every honorable member knows. I refer to the administration of the Public Service Board, because each department is dependent for appointments to its staff on the salary range established by the board. I have had a little to do with the board in one way . and another. For a little while I helped to administer it. I know that the fault does not always lie with the men in charge of the board but it goes a little higher and involves government policy in relation to how far it will go in granting increased salary ranges or in giving the board authority to widen the advantages that applicants may have. But the fact remains that there is inefficiency in a number of departments of the Public Service. There is a delay of up to two years in the Patents Office, because of lack of staff. I hope that something will be done. When we come to the appropriate departments, I may be more specific, but within the limits of the proposed vote for the Public Service Board, I make the observation that unless some- thing is done, we shall have a very much inconvenienced public for some time to come. </para>

            <para>.- Division 12 deals with the Public Service Board. I direct attention to the fact that some members of the Public Service have been asking for increases of salary by 75 per cent, over the 1939 figures, so as to bring their salaries into line with those paid in outside industry. I hope that the representations that have been made by those persons are receiving consideration. If they are being paid at a lower rate than is paid by private employers, surely they have a just case. I hope that something will be done about it.

            <para>.- I  should like some information about the item &#34;Leasehold office premises - rental, upkeep and alterations&#34; that appears under Division 15, &#34; High Commissioner&#39;s Office, United Kingdom &#34;, which shows an estimated expenditure of &#163;56,820. Expenditure for this purpose last year was &#163;63,460. That expenditure has nothing to do with the expenditure proper in connexion with the High Commissioner, who is very well catered for and is by no means on the &#34; bread-line &#34;. The estimates show that this year he will have &#163;9,790 for incidental and other expenditure. That has nothing to do with his salary. This item, which amounts to &#163;56,820, or more than &#163;1,000 a week, is apparently for some premises that the High Commissioner is using. Where are these premises? Honorable members who know Australia House in London know that it has sufficient accommodation for all the activities of this Commonwealth in that city. It seems to me that the Government is displaying in London the same habit as it shows in Australia of taking over public buildings to accommodate obscure departments. I put a question on the notice-paper some weeks ago asking what leaseholds were held by the Commonwealth in Sydney and Melbourne and what properties had been acquired in recent years. That question does not now appear on the notice-paper because I was told that it would take some time to compile an answer. I presume that I shall get the answer some time after the next general election. It appears from this item that somebody has appointed a director of sorts in London and provided him with accommodation. I may, of course, be wrong. The premises may be in use for some very important department controlled -by some very important person in the  Government.  In any event, somebody has apparently appointed a director or controller or some other official with a high sounding title. In such cases an office is found for the official, a typewriter and two or three staff hands are obtained for him, and in no time he has a huge department. This must be a huge department if it accounts for &#163;56,820 for rental, upkeep and alteration of premises. To be quite fair to the department I quote a footnote which reads - </para>

              <para>- Provision is made in the Estimates for a number of private secretaries. I refer you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Temporary Chairman,</inline> to page 197 of the Estimates. Those private secretaries include not only those attached to the offices of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> but also to the leaders of other parties, and to at least one Minister. I should like some information regarding the industrial conditions enjoyed by the private secretaries that are employed by Ministers and other members of this Parliament. I understand that the private secretaries have some kind of an industrial association of their own which has been finding it very difficult to obtain any satisfaction regarding their industrial conditions. A private secretary is often at the beck and call of a Minister at all hours. When the House sits at night he has to stand by. He often works at the weekends and very often is expected to take an interest in the electoral affairs of the Minister. He attends meetings and frequently has no leisure time. The Prime Minister told us recently that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Coombs,</inline> the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, had had no holidays for eight years. Surely that was not in accordance with public service conditions. The 40-hour week is only a myth to the ministerial private secretary. Some private secretaries have been lucky enough to be appointed to higher positions, but the positions of others remain stationary. A Labour  government should he the first government to ensure that the working conditions of its own personal staff shall be above reproach. It should ensure the rigid observance of the 40-hour week in respect of its employees. A Minister is in a very different position from that of his secretary, because he is compensated for his long, hours of work. During the life of this Parliament Ministers have received a very substantial increase of their remuneration, but I am told that the only, occasion on which ministerial private secretaries received any recognition was during the very brief period when the Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> was Prime Minister. I should like the Prime Minister to investigate the conditions of private secretaries and to ascertain whether or not the Public .Service Board has ruled that they must take their annual recreation leave of three weeks within a calendar year, that if they do not do so they may carry the leave over for only one year on the authority of a certificate from the head of the department, and that the remainder of the accumulated leave shall be forfeited. Some private secretaries are no doubt in the same position as <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Coombs</inline> and have had no leave for many years. They might go for eight years without a holiday because Ministers could not release them, and they lose all their accumulated leave. In addition, applications for overtime on their behalf have been rejected. If a private secretary has to work at night or on Sundays why should he not receive the ruling overtime rates? Why should he be restricted to a flat weekly salary? Those are not trade union principles. I understand that applications by private secretaries for tea money also have been rejected. What other section of employees is expected to- pay for more than one. meal a day while at work ? It would be a very paltry action indeed to refuse tea money in such circumstances. I realize that these people are only temporary public servants; nevertheless many of them have very responsible positions. They are engaged in highly confidential work and are even called upon to make important decisions. They should be paid accordingly. When a government goes out of office the new </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para class="block">Ministers have the right to bring in their own private secretaries, which I consider to be right and proper. If a private secretary has been a known political supporter of a Minister - and several of them are - then he must expect to go out when the government falls. The jobs of private secretaries are a part of the spoils of office. For that reason, private secretaries have no security. They may be dumped on to the industrial scrap-heap after years of faithful service, without even having the right to claim holiday pay that is due to them and that has been due for many years. Many of them work on Six Hour Day. Other public servants receive a day&#39;s pay in lieu of such public holidays, but a Minister&#39;s private secretary does not come under any such provision. As they are apparently expected at all times to promote the idea that we have reached the golden age, it might be worth while to give them a slight personal interest in it. Most of them have performed, their duties faithfully for a number of years and there is no reason why they should not become permanent members of the Public Service. </para>

              <para>- I am putting up a fight for the&#39; under-dog. It is essential that persons  who  are engaged in work of that kind should have some security of tenure. A government may remain in office for from five- to ten years. Ministers&#39; private secretaries who have done their work well should not be cast to the wolves immediately after the Ministers whom they have served have relinquished office-. Irrespective of what government they have- served, the loyalty of these officers has never been questioned. Why, then, should they be kept on a slave labour status? I ask the Government to give them a fair deal. If no voice is raised in this Parliament on their behalf, what can they do to help themselves? We may yet see private secretaries picketing Ministers and demanding the same rights as are demanded by members of self-respect^ ing trade unions. I urge the Government to employ these officers on a permanent basis. </para>

            <para>. - The honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lang)</inline> has referred to the pay and conditions of employment of private secretaries generally. Only nine private secretaries are covered by the proposed vote now before the Chair. This vote does not cover the salaries of private secretaries to Ministers other than the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> and the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scully).</inline> The details are given at page 197 of the Estimates. It will be seen from a perusal of the details that provision is made for &#163;7,422 for private secretaries, numbering nine, who are filling unclassified positions. It covers the two private secretaries to the Prime Minister, both of whom are permanent officers of the Public Service; the  private secretary to the Vice-President of the Executive Council, who, I understand, is also a permanent officer ; the secretary to the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cooper),</inline> who, I believe, is a permanent officer; and the private secretary to the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies).</inline> I understand that the present private secretary to. the Leader of the Opposition in this chamber is a lady who has been seconded from the Public Service for that duty. It also covers the private secretary to the honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison),</inline> who is  deputy  leader of the Opposition, the leader (Mr.&#39; Fadden) and  deputy  leader <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen)</inline> of the Australian Country party and the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page).</inline> I understand that of the nine private secretaries concerned five are permanent officers of the Public Service. The salaries of private secretaries to other Ministers are included in the estimates of the department concerned. The honorable member could have had in mind only the nine private secretaries to whom I have ie erred, and since the majority of them have been allotted to Opposition members, any criticism of their rates of pay and conditions should have been directed to those members. The rates of pay and conditions of service of the private secretaries to the Prime Minister and the Vice-President of the Executive Council are laid down by the Public Service Board. They have a right to appeal against the conditions of their employment, if they desire to do so. They would not have applied for their positions when those positions became vacant had they not desired to occupy them. They applied for appointment knowing that &#39; the conditions of their employment had been laid down by the Public Service Board. Within the last twelve months or so the private secretaries have formed themselves into an association. As far as I am aware the newly formed association has not made any complaints about, nor has it discussed with the appropriate authorities, hours of work, overtime and the other conditions of employment that were dealt with by the honorable member for Reid. It is true that the association has considered certain matters affecting its members. I believe that in the near future certain recommendations will be made to the appropriate authorities in relation to those matters. Whether such recommendations will be submitted to the Prime Minister or to the Public Service Board, I do not know. When the submissions are made they will be carefully considered by the Government. As I have said, if the honorable member for Reid has any criticism to offer of the conditions of employment of the non-permanent private secretaries covered by this item, he should direct it to members sitting on the Opposition benches. Of course, he would not do so because he is their <inline font-style="italic">de facto</inline> leader. </para>

              <para>- It was necessary to obtain additional premises so that the staffs of the Department of Defence and of the service departments generally could be housed at one centre. These staffs have grown numerically as the result of the plans of the Government for achieving greater co-operation with the United Kingdom Government in defence matters. It would be impossible to carry out a plan such as this Government has conceived for accepting a greater share of responsibility for the defence of the British Commonwealth, without providing suitable office accommodation in London for the housing of the requisite staffs. The provision of accommodation at Africa House was made necessary because of the expansion of scientific research work in London. A British Commonwealth scientific research organization has been established in Great Britain, and at a conference held in London two years ago it was agreed that the interests of scientific research would be much better met if all the research officers of the dominions and of the United Kingdom were accommodated in the same premises. Obviously, if Canadian research officers were located at Canada House, Australian research officers at Australia House, and South African research officers at Africa House, it would not be easy to make the contacts that are so necessary in scientific research officers come under the adminis-it was decided that all the scientific research officers from the United Kingdom and the Dominions should be accommodated at Africa House. There is constant contact between the Aus tralian research officers at Africa House and the officials at Australia House. The research officers come under the administrative control of the High Commissioner. That should be a sufficient explanation of the reason for renting premises outside of Australia House. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member always complains that this Government is not doing very much about the defence of this country, but immediately it sets out to establish closer contact with the defence authorities of the United Kingdom- and the other Dominions, so that strategic planning and general defence plans may be properly coordinated and integrated, he objects on the ground of the expense involved. Obviously, he does not know whether he is coming or going. </para>

          <para>The honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony)</inline> referred to the staffing of the Patent Office. The Patent Office is administered by the Attorney-General, who can explain more properly than I can, why he has been unable to obtain the staff that is required to deal with the applications as they come forward. It is true that members of the staff must possess high qualifications, and that the Public Service Board determines the classifications that are applicable to those officers, and, therefore, has a considerable voice in fixing the salaries that are offered. In that respect, I suppose, it may be said that if the remuneration is not sufficiently high to attract a staff large enough to handle the work, the Public Service Board may be criticized; but I believe that the scale of salaries that is paid to employees in the Patent Office may be dealt with more appropriately under the proposed vote for the Attorney-General&#39;s Department., The Attorney-General himself is in a much better position than I am to give a detailed explanation of the shortage of staff in that section. </para>

          <para class="block">All I wanted to know waa the reason for this proposed expenditure, because the amount exceeds the cost of the upkeep of Australia House itself. Honorable members who are familiar with Australia House know that it is a huge building capable of containing these extra military sections. Members of the Opposition strongly support proposals for the closest co-operation with the United Kingdom Government. During the war, when the position was really serious, the Army and Naval staffs were accommodated in Australia House. The Royal Australian Air Force was housed in other premises, which it vacated at the end of the war. However, the Minister will not evade the issue by abusing members of the Opposition.  His  idea of providing adequate defence is to expend large sums of money. He has stated that in the course of a few years an amount of &#163;250,000,000 will be expended on the Defence forces. What protection shall we receive for that vast expenditure? In the Royal Australian Navy, the number of non-combatants compared with combatants is higher than it has ever been. In the Australian army the number of the &#34; chair-borne &#34; troops is now out of all proportion to the total strength. </para>

              <para>- I was merely drawing a parallel between what is happening here and what is happening elsewhere. The Minister has stated that the Commonwealth has hired a portion of Africa House to accommodate the staff of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization in order that the officers may keep in close touch with the scientific staffs of other dominions. Whilst I strongly support any move for closer co-operation between the United Kingdom and the various dominions, I point out that if the staff of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research could be accommodated in Australia House during the war, they could be housed there now. The Minister has stated that Canberra House has been acquired for the Army staff. What is the size of the army staff that Canberra House should be required to house them? </para>

          <para class="block">That is typical of the extravagance of this Government. We see evidence of it in our own cities, but overseas, extravagant expenditure is incurred for the glorification of some Ministers when they travel. The tittering Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Barnard)</inline> has not had an opportunity to travel. When he loses his seat at the next general election, perhaps he will be able to go abroad to some ministerial post in Brazil or Chile, on the maintenance of which the Government is expending dollars for no good purpose. The previous Minister for Repatriation, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Frost,</inline> who lost his seat at the last general election, was given a job as Trade Commissioner in Ceylon, so the Minister might yet have an opportunity to travel.

            <para>.- My remarks relate to the proposed vote for the High Commissioner&#39;s office in the United Kingdom. All that I desire to learn about that particular vote, which constitutes almost one-half of the entire vote for the Prime Minister&#39;s Department, is the reason for including it in the estimates for the Prime Minister&#39;s Department, because the proposed votes for high commissioners to various dominions are included in the estimates of the Department of External Affairs. Has the proposed vote for the High Commissioner&#39;s office in the United Kingdom been placed in this position in order to bolster up the Prime Minister&#39;s Department ? Would it not be more appropriate if the votes for all the high commissioners were placed in the estimates for the Department of External Affairs? Perhaps there is a reason for including the proposed vote for the High Commissioner&#39;s office in the United Kingdom in the estimates for the Prime Minister&#39;s Department, but I am not aware of it. </para>

            <para>.- I notice that the proposed vote of &#163;1,005,000 for the Department of External Affairs this year is slightly more than the proposed vote for 1948-49; but I have nodoubt that the expenditure this year will considerably exceed the estimate, because the history of this department over the years that I have been observing it shows that it is a constantly inflating body. It inflates itself rather like a bladder is inflated. The pumping is done by an industrious gentleman, and, in the process, he inflates the importance of the department that he administers. My observations on this department will be very simple, homely and easy to understand. The day must come when honorable members will decide that the Commonwealth cannot continue to expend more and more money on this kind of department. I observe that the proposed vote for the Australian Embassy in the United States of America is &#163;100,000. That estimate was made, of course, before the devaluation of the &#163;1 in relation to the dollar, so I assume that the revised estimate of our expenditure on our embassy in the United States of America this year will be approximately &#163;130,000. We must ask ourselves whether, in the light of the service we are getting, such an enormous expenditure can be justified. An amount of &#163;70,200 has been provided for the payment of salaries and allowances, whilst the estimate of expenditure on postage, telegrams, telephone services and cablegrams is &#163;21,600. The Australian taxpayer will want to know whether that expenditure is justified. I yield to no one in appreciating the importance of Australia having proper representation abroad but we should have some feeling for the taxpayer, who must meet the bill. The Government should give a detailed explanation of the reason for these astronomical figures of proposed expenditure. I consider that the services that we receive from our embassy in the United States of America do not justify expenditure at the rate of &#163;100,000 per annum. In addition to the cost of the Australian Embassy in the United States of America, we propose to expend &#163;25,500 on the general expenses of the office of the Consul-General in New York, and &#163;7,200 for a similar purpose on the consular representation in San Francisco. I assume that both consuls perform the duties of trade representatives of this country. As I have always understood the situation, representation at the embassy level is of much higher significance than is representation at the trade level. I am gravely suspicious that Australia is not getting its money&#39;s worth from the embassy in the United States of America. If the Government claims that Australia is receiving full value for the expenditure that is incurred thereon, honorable members should be given more information about it. </para>

          <para>I notice also that an amount of &#163;61,000 has been provided for the Australian Embassy in France. That figure includes salaries and allowances, &#163;39,500, postage, telegrams, telephone services and cablegrams, &#163;10,300, and a string of incidentals totalling nearly &#163;9,000. </para>

              <para>- I imagine that lurking concealed in some innocent corner of these items there may be some provision for wines. I do not begrudge expenditure on diplomatic representation provided it can be justified. What return does Australia receive from the expenditure of &#163;61,000 on our embassy in France? I have yet to be satisfied that it is adequate. In comparison with the proposed votes for the Australian Embassies in the United States of America and France, the estimated expenditure on our legation in Brazil is only chicken feed. The amount that is provided this year is &#163;12,200. </para>

              <para>- That may be the complete answer. Have we any relations with the Government of Brazil that justify this expenditure of &#163;12,200 of the taxpayers&#39; money? Some time ago, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> let slip some information that gave us the impression that the Australian Legations in Brazil and Chile had been established as a part of an arrangement when the Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> was seeking a little moral and political support for one of the claims that he was pressing at the United Nations. That might, in a cynical world, be said to justify the establishment of these legations, but it cannot justify their continuation. Yet, in 1949-50, it is still proposed to expend this large amount of money. </para>

              <para>- The only reason that Patagonia has been left out, I suppose, is that it was not prepared to vote in the right way. I note that expenditure on our representation in Chile has suffered a substantial decline, and I trust that the dignity of the Chileans will not be hurt. In 1948-49, the amount was &#163;6,278.&#39; For 1949-50 it is to be &#163;2,000. I suppose expenditure is being reduced because Chile is no longer of any use to us. That merely emphasizes the fact that the legation in Chile should never have been established. Indeed, it was the height of cynicism and poor, trashy politics to establish it in the first place. In Eire, it is proposed to expend &#163;13,000 on the High Commissioner&#39;s office. I am sure the honorable member for Griffith will appreciate that. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member for Griffith went there, but whether at the public expense or his own I do not know. Perhaps he can tell us that the High Commissioner for Australia in Eire, who is a friend of mine, is living under comfortable conditions. I hope he is. For the moment, however, I want to know, not whether he is comfortable, but what he is doing for Australia&#39;s benefit. It is proposed to vote a large sum of money for the upkeep of the High Commissioner&#39;s office in Eire. It is not our money but the taxpayers&#39;, and sooner or later we shall have to decide that we are not going to continue voting large amounts of money for which we do not obtain value. When I say that, I make no reflection on the person who now fills the office of High Commissioner in Eire. I am merely indicating that much of our expenditure on overseas representation could well be pruned in order to save the taxpayers&#39; money. </para>

              <para>- I was not, but some friends of mine were, and they told me the sorry story, which has already been related in this chamber. The story concerns a person who was at the time representing Australia in Pakistan. The aircraft was delayed for a week or longer. There was a fullcomplement of passengers, many of whom had business appointments in Australia. It was learned that another aircraft with six vacant seats was coming through two days later. It was arranged by Qantas Airways, the company operating the grounded plane, that the passengers should choose among themselves those who had the most urgent engagements in Australia, and that those chosen should be taken on in the second plane. At this point, the person acting as commissioner for Australia in Karachi intervened, and forbade the captain to carry out that arrangement, claiming that four of the six vacant seats should be filled by government servants travelling to Australia. The captain and the passengers protested strongly, but the official said, &#34; We own the aircraft and therefore our servants shall have priority to travel on it to Australia &#34;. That was, in fact, done. I think it was a scandalous thing that a government official, purporting to act for Australia, should dictate who was to travel on the plane. Two of the persons nominated by him were Australian government servants, and two were government servants from somewhere else. In that occurrence, we see the shape of things to come. That is the sort of thing that we may expect in the bureaucratic and socialist state. The matter was brought to my notice by some of the passengers when they reached Australia. I asked a. question about it in the House, and the Minister for Air <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Drakeford)</inline> wriggled and hedged in an extraordinary fashion. It was not until weeks later that I got an answer out of him in which he admitted the facts, and said that such a thing would not happen again. It might not happen in the immediate future, but it will certainly happen if we get a socialist state. </para>

          <para>Mr.TURNBULL (Wimmera) &#91;5.4&#93;.- I wish to refer to an item in the general administrative costs of the Department of External Affairs. It is the item which covers postage, telegrams and telephone services, in which there has been an increase of nearly 50 per cent. In 1948-49, the amount expended under this heading was &#163;67,405. It is estimated that for 1949-50, expenditure will be &#163;102,800. That does not include expenditure on cablegrams and radiograms, which is estimated to be &#163;40,000, as against &#163;38,158 for 1948-49. We all know that the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department recently increased telephone and telegraph charges, a fact which would account for an increase for this item in the costs of the External Affairs Department. However, I have examined the estimates for other departments, but none of them shows an increase comparable to the estimated increase for the Department of External Affairs. I should like to hear the Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> endeavour to justify the gigantic increase. </para>

            <para>.- Honorable members are uneasy over the continually increasing costs of our overseas representation, and they know that the increase will continue. A few days ago, the Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> informed the House that Australia was to have diplomatic representation in Cairo and Jerusalem, and that -representatives would be appointed later :to the Scandinavian states. That will involve increased expenditure in sterling, -as well as in semi-hard currencies. I  suggest that, in order to save expense, the one person might be appointed to represent Australia in more than one country. It would be convenient geographically few ais to be represented by one person in Cairo and Jerusalem, but in view of the bad relations between Egypt and Israel, it is very probable that any one appointed to represent Australia in both those countries would be regarded as a spy in one or both of them. Therefore, it seems to be necessary to appoint a representative to each country. The Scandinavian countries, however, are all on very friendly terms with one another, and there seems to be no reason why Australia should not be represented in all of them by a single officer. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I turn now to the United States of America. As the honorable member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beale)</inline> pointed out, our embassy there costs real money, not &#163;100,000 in Australian currency, but its equivalent in dollars, and that, of course, is a great strain on&#39; our economy. The most important place in which Australia should be represented after London is Washington, and I do not think the money that we expend on our representation in Washington is badly expended. In fact, I think that very soon the Government will have to consider increasing &#39; the emoluments of the Washington post. The schedule of salaries and allowances sets out the salary of the Ambassador as &#163;2,500. The representation allowance to the Ambassador is &#163;5,138. Translated into dollars, at the present value of the Australian &#163;1, that means that the Ambassador gets roughly 15,000 dollars, which, as every one who knows anything about the economy of the United States of America is aware, goes simply nowhere. The Ambassador has a special allowance for exchange purposes, but, even with that, he does not receive enough to cover his position. One thing that is true - and I have had experience of it - is that the less the head of a foreign mission is able to go about and entertain on a footing equal to that of the heads of other foreign missions, the more is his position placed in jeopardy. Therefore, the Government will have to consider increasing the salary and allowances connected with that post. The Government could consider how economies can be made in other directions. I agree that we cannot afford too large an expenditure on our foreign representation. I suggest economy in other places; for instance, in Brazil, and in some minor posts. I do not think that we should reduce our representation in sister dominions. It is most important that we should cultivate the closest possible relations with the United States of America. Heavy clouds hang over the Pacific, and Australia is the first country that will suffer if those clouds one day burst. Communist forces are sweeping down the south-east coast of Asia. I do not desire to enlarge upon that matter, except to point out that we no longer rely, as we did, on efficient help from Great Britain and the British Dominions. The United Kingdom is extended in every conceivable way, militarily and financially. Therefore, we have to look for friends to help us to defend ourselves should an emergency arise. Naturally, the first nation that we look to is the greatest in the Pacific, the United States of America. It is the only nation that we can logically expect assistance from. There is a great difference between our approach to the United States of America and its approach to us. It is very much in our interest to cultivate friendly relations with that great, nation. It would not matter much to the United States of </para>
          <para class="block">America if we were written off completely, for we have nothing to offer it. Therefore, it is up to us to cultivate in the United States of America interest in ourselves. That can be done partly by diplomatic means and partly by citizens. We must awaken in both the citizens and the Government of the United States of America interest in us. I pointed out in my budget speech that our relations with the United States of America have sadly deteriorated in the last few years. We were very closely in touch with the American people at&#34; the end of the war. We were very friendly with them and they with us. I do not think that friendliness has diminished to any appreciable extent, but they are taking far less interest in us than they did in 1945. There are many reasons for that. Of all our negotiations with the United States of America I know of hardly one in which a satisfactory solution has been reached, at least a solution satisfactory to it. I instance the ways and means of putting into operation the Fulbright Act. Then there is the matter of the navigation treaties between the two countries. Thirdly, there is double taxation, about which I recently put a question to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> . </para>

              <para>- Exactly. There is no question that financially we should be the losers, but what would the loss of a few hundred thousands a year matter if we got the friendship, co-operation and understanding of the United States of America in exchange? A few hundred thousand pounds amounts to far less than the support militarily, financially and commercially of the United States of America. </para>

          <para>Finally, I mention some of the pin-pricks of which the Government has been guilty in the way in which it has operated the provisions of our immigration laws. Quite unnecessarily, the Australian Government has offended a great many Americans who are far more tolerant than we are in immigration matters. </para>
          <para>I now come to the matter of our policy towards Japan as compared with that of the United States of America. Ten days ago, General MacArthur issued to the world which he called the new policy of the Americans towards the Japanese. He described it as one of friendliness towards and guidance of the J apanese. In pursuance of that policy, he relaxed the ban on fraternization between the American troops in Japan and the Japanese people. I asked a question in the House about what the Australian Government proposed to do. The Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> said that the Government proposed to continue the policy of banning fraternization by our troops in Japan. Proceeding with his, explanation, he said -  </para>

          <para class="block">The policy adopted by our troops in Japan towards the Japanese, compared with the policy adopted towards them by the American troops in Japan, is only a part of the larger question of the relations between ourselves and Japan and the United States of America and Japan. As an ally of the United States of America in the occupation of Japan, surely we should co-ordinate our policy with theirs. I do not believe that there have been any discussions on a high level, which is really what matters, between the Minister for External Affairs and the State Department about the Allied policy in the occupation of Japan as far as the Japanese people are concerned. I do not think public opinion in Australia would welcome any change with regard to fraternization, but there are other matters that rise far above that. The first question is whether there should be complete co-operation between ourselves and the United States of America on the big problem of Japan in the future, which far transcends any question of fraternization. Finally, what is the attitude of the Australian Government towards Japan? There has been no official pronouncement, on any level, on what we think the future relations with the Japanese should be. No pronouncement has been made on our view on the changed policy of the United States of America towards the Japanese people. These are matters that should be cleared up and I hope that the Minister for External Affairs will make some attempt to clear them up when replying to this debate. </para>

            <para>.- There are one or two things about which I should like some information in this discussion on the proposed vote for the Department of External Affairs. Last year I asked the Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt),</inline> in a written question for certain information, which he gave to me, but of course, last year we had no opportunity of addressing any further questions to the Minister personally in the chamber, because he was away in other parts of the world. I asked him what Australia&#39;s contribution was to the United Nations, on what grounds it was based compared with the contribution of other countries, how many Australians were employed in the organization and what was the salary range of those whose salaries exceeded &#163;1,000 a year. I received some very interesting information from the Minister, and from the Secretary of his department by letter. I wonder whether, in view of the changed monetary relations between ourselves and the dollar countries, because of the recent devaluation of the pound, and particularly in view of the fact that Australia must forgo the importation of many dollar goods, including petrol and machinery on that account we are justified in expending the huge amount that was voted to the United Nations by this Parliament last year. I asked the Minister last .year - </para>

          <list type="decimal-dotted">
            <item label="1.">

            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">The Minister told me that contributions were broadly determined by capacity to pay, taking into account national incomes, &#38;c. As a matter of fact, I understand that some members of the United Nations are not paying their levied contributions. No one would know that better than would the Minister, who was  President  of the United Nations General Assembly. But Australia&#39;s direct contribution to the funds of United Nations last year was no less than 543,000 dollars, which was more than half a million dollars. The Minister might justify that by saying &#34; This is a world organization, struggling to establish better relations between nation and nation, and that contribution is a good insurance policy for the future &#34;. But is it a good insurance policy for the future ? How far has the United Nations served the purpose that it was proclaimed it would serve when it was first formulated in 1945 in San Francisco ? I submit that in the major matters that concern world peace, the United Nations is an inconsequential organization. For instance, the matter of the atom bomb has not been considered by the United Nations, except in a negative manner by the appointment of some kind of a commission that neither Russia nor the United States of America takes the least notice of. If in 194S-49 our contribution in dollars to the United Nations amounted to 543,000 dollars, what is it to be in 1949-50? We are given no information at all on that point. The honorable member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beale)</inline> has referred to the establishment of legations that absorb dollars in South America and certain other countries. I have made some fairly careful research into what justification may exist for the establishment by Australia of dollar using agencies in those countries in the way of diplomatic representation and I have been unable to find any justification at all. This is the first occasion in the last year or two at least on- which the Minister has been present during a debate on the Department of External Affairs to answer personally some of the observations and requests for information that have .been put by honorable members on this side of the chamber. Another section of my question to the Minister reads - </para>

              <para>- The Minister may find out, but I doubt if I shall. These officials were also mentioned in the House by the honorable member for Bendigo <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rankin)</inline> and he received a most insulting letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs.</inline> Podbielsky  which stated that whether he was a member of Parliament or otherwise, he should mind his own business. But I am very much intrigued by the appointment of this lady when there are many Australian women, who were highly trained at our universities and hold arts and other degrees, with overseas experience, who should have been qualified for a position such as this. I should like to know how it is possible for a lady with the background and status that I have mentioned to be allegedly representing Australia overseas, because it is quite obvious that she has been regarded by the Department of External Affairs, in view of the answer that it supplied to me, as a representative of Australia. </para>

We shall be told that that is an outstanding distinction for Australia. </para>

I affirm that the United Nations organization, so far as Australia is concerned, is not worth a contribution of 500,000 dollars a year. Our contribution will probably be more than that, in fact, because of the recent change in currency relationships. </para>

              <para>- Then why did not the right honorable gentleman attend the recent General Assembly in order to hand over the reins of office to his successor? Is it to be understood that, having himself reached the highest position in that organization, it was not incumbent on him as the retiring  President  of the General Assembly of the United Nations to fly to America, even for a few days, in order formally to hand over the reins of office to his successor? I believe that the Minister&#39;s action shows how lightly he regards the United Nations, and how unnecessary he really believes it to be.  His  real opinion of the effectiveness and value of the United Nations&#39; was demonstrated by his decision to absent himself from the ceremonies that marked the transfer of office from himself to another gentleman. </para>

          <para>During the absence of the Minister for External Affairs I referred to the handing over by him of the trusteeship of New Guinea without any qualification whatever, as the result of which Australian representatives have to go to Lake Success each year and subject themselves to questioning by Chinese, Mexicans and the representatives of other foreign countries about the manner in which the trusteeship of New Guinea is being administered. &#34;We have read in to-day&#39;s press that the representative of the Chinese Nationalist Government which is now in flight, has put the Australian representative -on the carpet and &#39;has compelled him to answer charges alleging that Australia has improperly administered its trusteeship of New Guinea. I contrast the action of the Australian Minister for External Affairs in this respect with that of the United States Department which, in regard to the trusteeship of the Marshall and Caroline Islands said, in effect, &#34; These islands are &#39;strategically important &#39;to the defence of the United States -&#39;of America and our trusteeship of them will accordingly be based on strategic &#39;considerations. We shall -not answer to any organization for what we do there. &#34;We shall prohibit entry into the Marshall and Caroline Islands of any person whom we desire to exclude &#34;. The Minister for External Affairs, in his anxiety to demonstrate how extraordinarily valuable the United Nations is, was one of the first to hand over to the Trusteeship Council the trusteeship of territory that had formerly been held under mandate. As the result of his action Australia must in future send officials to Lake Success, or wherever the General Assembly of the United Nations may be held, to be subjected to all kinds of cross-examination by the representatives of foreign powers regarding its administration of New Guinea. Any foreign power which is a member of the United Nations may send its representatives to New Guinea to check up on our administration of the trusteeship and may subsequently pull our reputation to shreds in a ^manner it would not otherwise have a right to do. Contrast the action of the Australian Government with the more statesmanlike action taken by the United States Government. The United States made it clear that it would not accept trusteeship of the Marshalls and the Carolines except on the basis that those islands were of such strategic importance to the defence of the United States that that country had a right to administer them as though they were an integral part of the United States. Many questions were asked in the Trusteeship Council about Australia&#39;s administration of New Guinea. The representative of China said - </para>

              <para>- It is true that the honorable member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beale)</inline> referred to the Australian Legation in Brazil. I shall deal with that in a moment or two. Only two legations were specifically mentioned either during the present discussion or on other recent occasions. The honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony)</inline> and the honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Abbott)</inline> have referred at different times to the legations in Chile and Brazil. Both are Latin-American countries, and some honorable members opposite have contended that Australia does not need diplomatic representation in them. However, it is important for the committee to understand that Australia has only two missions in South America, one  in Brazil, and the other in Chile. We recently withdrew our <inline font-style="italic">charge-de-affaires</inline> and staff from Chile as a temporary measure, largely because of the dollar position. I believe that, ultimately, it will be essential for Australia to be represented in South America on a larger scale than it is at the present time, and that relations with Chile are important. Although the Australian Legation in Chile is included in these Estimates, the amount that is shown is simply lor the purpose of winding up that particular mission, and paying the salaries of the officers who have been withdrawn from it. </para>

          <para>E desire to take this opportunity to point out that any criticisms of the Australian Legation in Brazil that are based upon dollar expenditure are beside the point. That post is financed, not with dollars, -but through the sterling area. However, there are serious considerations which, in the opinion of the Government, warrant the continuance of at least one post in South America. In the view of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture, Australia has important trade prospects in South America, and we intend to conduct active trade negotiations in the near future mainly with Brazil, but also with Argentina and other South American countries. At the present moment, negotiations are being conducted by the Australian representative in Brazil with a view to making a  trade  arrangement with Argentina. A post for a trade commissioner in Brazil lias existed for a long time, but it has never been occupied. The whole of the trade work has been done through the legation at Rio de Janiero, and, in fact, it is being performed by the Australian <inline font-style="italic">charge</inline><inline font-style="italic">d&#39; affaires</inline> there. He was previously an officer of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture, but, in practice, it is often impossible to separate commercial representation from diplomatic representation. Therefore, it is often more convenient and necessary that the  commercial  officer should also have diplomatic status. </para>

              <para>- No, but it is modern practice because of the difficulty of drawing a line of demarcation between strictly commercial matters and other matters in which general political policy is involved. The honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> is aware of that fact. In my opinion, it is of considerable advantage that the commercial officers should have diplomatic status. Egypt provides a good example of that. Australia has its trade representative in that country, but often a matter affecting trade also has a political aspect, and it is impossible for trade representatives to discuss the subject unless they have some diplomatic status. In order to have diplomatic status the officials must bc, accredited as representatives of the Department of External Affairs. In view of the potentially important market in South America for Australian products, especially those of our secondary industries, the cost of maintaining what is, after all, a very small diplomatic mission in Latin America is a small price to pay for the benefits which even from the limited trade viewpoint, must accrue to this country. </para>

          <para>I shall now deal more generally with the estimates for the Department of External Affairs. The estimated expenditure this year is an overall increase of &#163;77,000 on last year&#39;s expenditure. I remind honorable members that expenditure last year was &#163;50,000 less than the estimate and we hope to make similar economies this year. Actually, the estimates for 1949-50 are less than &#163;30,000 in excess of last year&#39;s vote. The proposed vote has been increased because of anticipated additional costs that are quite unavoidable. The increases cover five items. First, overseas air-mail rates have been increased by 100 per cent., and 70 per cent, of those charges, which arc borne by the Department of External Affairs, represents expenditure on behalf of other departments. Secondly, rates for cables between Australia and France, America, Russia and other countries have greatly increased. </para>

              <para>- I am aware of that. I am dealing with the estimates as a whole, and not with the specific matter that has been raised by the honorable member. The committee may take it that the increased costs of communications are represented by such factors as higher rates for overseas air-mails. The department is concerned mainly with overseas rates. Internal expenditure on matters to which the honorable member has referred is comparatively small, but the overseas rates are heavy, and they have been increasing. Thirdly Australia&#39;s contributions to international organizations have increased. Australia has always been a member of that very important body, the International Labour Office, and we must maintain our membership of it. Its purpose is to increase labour standards throughout the world. All political parties represented in this chamber have supported the International Labour Office. Australia&#39;s increased contributions to that and other international bodies amount to more than &#163;30,000. Before leaving this matter, I 9hould mention the Food and Agriculture Organization. Surely honorable member&#39;s opposite, particularly members of the Australian Country party, will not complain because Australia is a member of that organization ! I was horrified to hear the remarks of the honorable member for Richmond on this subject. In fact, I think that we have to attribute to some of his remarks an over-estimated sense of humour. I do not believe that the honorable gentleman really considers that Australia should not be a member of the United Nations. Probably his purpose is to make a rather spoiling attack on a few items of expenditure in the estimates for the Department of External Affairs. Does any honorable member seriously propose that Australia should withdraw from the United Nations? All political parties that are represented here are pledged to support it. </para>

              <para>- Thefourth reasonfor the increase of the proposed vote for Shis item is that &#163;50,000 hasbeen expended on the purchase of new furniture and equipment for overseas postsin order to save the post of renting furnished premises. Finally the appointment of a High Commissioner to Pakistanhas involved the expenditure of an additional &#163;9,000. The estimated increase of expenditure in the Department of External Affairs . over, last year&#39;sexpenditure is &#163;77,312. Very substantialeconomies have been effected in the actual administration of the department. Taking into accountunavoidable increases due to higher costs, this year&#39;s estimates are &#163;100,000 below those of last year. This saving has been effected by refraining from making appointments in dollar areas until it becomes absolutely necessary to do so. This has caused some inconvenience, because it is in the dollar areas that our representation is very important. Posts at Washington and Ottawa .are carrying on with inadequate staffs because of the dollar shortage. We have delayed the making of appointments and the purchase of vehicles, &#38;c, as long as possible. The post in Chile has been temporarily closed for reasons of economy, and we have deferred the appointment of a Minister to Brazil. Thus, the utmost economy has been exercised, particularly in the expenditure of dollars. </para>

          <para>I now propose to discuss departmental expansion- more broadly. The Department of External Affairs has grown steadily according to plan since the Labour Government assumed office in October, 1941, nearly eight years ago. At that time, there were seven officers of the department in Canberra, and fifteen overseas. Besides London, in which we have had representations for many years, there were representatives at Washington, Ottawa, Tokyo and in China. With the exception of the London post, the others were created and filled after the beginning of World War II. The Labour Government has extended Australian diplomatic and consular representation to many parts of the world. The original five foreign posts have been increased to 28, and the diplomatic staff in Canberra has been increased to 64, while that overseas has been increased to 76. I speak now of diplomatic officers in the strict sense of the term. This great expansion was necessary, first, because of the war, and, secondly, because of the need to implement the international policy of the Government after the war. The war taught us that Australia had to exercise its status as a nation. It further taught us that Australia had to take an active part in all forms of international co-operation. </para>
          <para>Mention has been made of the United Nations, which is one of the most prominent forms of international co-operation. Australia must also maintain day-by-day relations with other countries. There is an enormous flow of information from abroad to Australia, and from Australia abroad. The promotion of such activities requires efficient officers to be available for duty every day of the year. That is of the very essence of a properly organized foreign affairs department, and is just one aspect of government. Active participation in the United Nations and associated organizations is the key note of the Government&#39;s policy. One of the first planks of the Labour party&#39;s platform is unwavering and unfaltering support of the United Nations. We make no apology for that. It is the policy adopted by the British Commonwealth of Nations, and. it occupies a prominent part in the policy of  President  Truman. By a coincidence, those very words, &#34;unwavering and unfaltering support &#34;, were used by  President  Truman in a recent important speech. He said that, in his opinion, the United Nations was the only bulwark guarding the ordinary people of the world against another war. It may be said that such a statement needs to be supplemented; and that, in addition to the United Nations, regional arrangements are needed. No one will deny that, but support of the United Nations has been the settled policy of this Government since we first sent our delegates to San Francisco to take part in the drafting of the original charter, which was inspired by  President  Roosevelt himself. There have been setbacks, even heartbreaking setbacks, but a- world organization is bound to have such setbacks. After a war like the last one, it is not easy to condition people to the normal ways of peace. The proposed expenditure on the External Affairs Department, is little more than &#163;1,000,000 a year, and it is less than the one day&#39;s expenditure by Australia during the height of the war in the Pacific. We must remember also that we receive something to balance our expenditure on overseas representation. It is not a one-way traffic. From 48 separate countries we have received in Australia diplomatic or consular representatives. When we speak of dollar expenditure by Australia on representation in the United States of America, we should remember the dollar expenditure in this country of American and Canadian representatives. </para>

              <para>- From day to day they spend sterling, but actually their expenditure over the whole field is in dollars. However, apart from the monetary side, which is an important, but not the most important, feature, there is the fact that Australia, as a nation, is entitled, by its international status and by its contribution during the first and second world wars, to take its place in the councils of the nations, and to discuss international affairs wilh the representatives of other countries, sometimes in Canberra, and sometimes overseas. We cannot say that we shall have representation in one country, but not in another. Our overseas representation must be extended. The Government that preceded the Labour Government had to extend our foreign representation. It began with the establishment of a post in Washington. Later, posts were established in Tokyo, in China and in Canada. The establishment of all such posts has been justified, and they must be properly staffed, and supported by the Government and the Parliament. In order to provide for their staffing, <inline font-style="italic">it</inline> has been necessary to establish a special scheme of recruitment which made allowance for the fact that, during the war, servicemen were deprived of opportunities to make places for themselves in the Public Service. Therefore, they were specially favoured in the granting of cadetships in the Department of External Affairs. Now, many of them have finished their training, and have been appointed to various posts throughout the world, where they are taking their part as important units in the service. The Australian diplomatic cadet system has been followed to some extent in Canada, and has aroused interest in other countries. The system ensures that Australia&#39;s overseas representation, whether in the diplomatic field, or at international conferences, shall be based on specially selected and trained career staff. This administrative development has been in accordance with the development of the policy of Australia in relation to foreign affairs. It is designed to protect Australia&#39;s interests abroad and I refer not only to governmental interests, but also to private and commercial interests, and that work is going on all the time. Australians abroad go to those posts for advice and assistance and they are never turned down. They are always getting assistance. The department receives numerous letters of appreciation of the work done in our posts from Australians who happened to be engaged in business or travel overseas. It is a fundamental part of our policy to have the closest association with both the British Commonwealth and the United States of America and to give whole-hearted support to the United Nations and its agencies. So, I submit that, looking at these figures and looking at these activities, they are completely justified. Indeed, in one sense, they have always been approved by the Parliament, subject occasionally to some particular form of criticism. </para>

          <para>Certain suggestions have been made of a practicable kind. The honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> suggested that we might consider the appointment of one officer to man two places. That is being considered. It is a suggestion that, is not particularly favoured by a foreign country that has a representative here. But it is being explored in order to carry out our obligations with the minimum expense. </para>
          <para>The honorable member for Richmond raised the matter of contributions to the United Nations. He wanted to know whether the contribution of dollars that had to be made by other members of the United Nations was the same as that which has to be provided by Australia. The answer is &#34; Yes, it is &#34;. The rules provide that a certain percentage of the contribution is to be made in dollars, and that applies to every one of the 59 member nations. Then he asked how the percentage was worked out. The percentage in the case of Australia is 1.97, which is practically 2 per cent, of the total contribution, or approximately one-fiftieth. It is reckoned in dollars, because the centre of the United Nations is in the United States of America. But that is a burden of dollar expenditure, not only to countries like Australia, but also to many other countries, and it has led to a desire, if not a. demand, by member countries at the present assembly that the dollar expenditure be lessened to some extent by holding some of the meetings of the United Nations and its agencies in other countries than the United States of America for the time being. That is a difficult matter. Certain other places have been suggested for the next meeting of the United Nations. One is Cuba and the other is Great Britain. Edinburgh has been suggested as a possible place for the next meeting. The honorable member for Richmond then referred to the fact that a number of Australians are on the staff of the United Nations. There is nothing wrong in that. We should be blamed if Australia did not have its proper quota of persons who happened to be selected by the secretariat for posts with the United Nations and in any of its centres. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member then referred to a list. I do not think it is necessary for mc to go through it. I want the committee to understand that these persons are not the nominees of the Australian Government. They are not the representatives of the Australian Government. This is an international public service, and each member signs an undertaking or takes something in the nature of an oath to further the interests of the organization and not of any particular country. Some of those people have been recommended by the department and many have not. </para>

          <para>That brings me to the broader question raised by the honorable member for Flinders, and it is very important that it should be dealt with. He suggests - and it is not the first time that it has been suggested on that side of the chamber - that the relations between the Australian Government and the Government of the United States of America are not so intimate or so satisfactory as they were a few years ago. The statement is completely and absolutely untrue. </para>

There is no advantage to be gained by not facing the facts. I shall deal with each point made by the honorable member for Flinders.

              <para>- Again we have thunder on the left. Because the honorable member for Warringah does not agree with another  speaker  he growls. There is not much argument in the growling, and the honorable member will not stop me from saying that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jarman,</inline> the recently appointed ambassador of the United States of America to Australia, on the occasion of his arrival in Australia and the presentation of his credentials to the Governor-General, indicated that the relations between the two countries could not &#39;be closer or more intimate than they are. That is true. Honorable members know it is true. The only trouble that I know of is that on a few occasions in this chamber, one or two honorable members, in the corner in which members of the Australian Country party mainly sit, have suggested that differences exist between the two countries. The honorable member for Flinders asked why the arrangement for the agreement under the Fulbright Act had not been completed. I understand the position is that Australia, under the lend-lease arrangement with the United States of America, provided what was called reverse lend-lease and the accounts nearly balanced. Approximately, it was &#163;1,000,000,000 on either side of the accounts, such was the contribution of Australia by reverse lend-lease. There was a balance in favour of the United States of America, which was settled by an arrangement to provide- </para>

              <para>- Only pin money? I should not mind having the pin money now. It was in dollars ! In an agreement like that referred to, various matters have to be provided for. They include, for instance a fair system of taxation of the scholarships to be provided out of the fund. Negotiations between the Australian Government, particularly through the Treasury, and the United States of America, have been going on for some time. They are approaching completion. There is no complaint of any kind about that. It is suggested that there should be a system of double taxation. That is very important. What has to be considered by the Government in the light of its policy is the policy of other countries, particularly the United States of America. When an honorablemember makes a speech to the effect that another government does not think the terms of an arrangement are very satisfactory, that does not indicate that any but the best relations exist between the two countries. The honorable member said&#39; that Americans were offended by Australia&#39;s administration of its own immigration laws. There is not a tittle of evidence of that. The United States of America enforces its immigration laws under the quota system, or under the previous system, with complete rigidity. It would be unusual to have such a complaint from the United States of America. There has been none. Yet that is the basis of the suggestion that has been made by honorable- members- opposite. In fact, the only  forum  at which such a suggestion&#39; as that has been&#39; made is in this chamber on One or two occasions by one op two&#39; honorable members who represent al small minority of the Opposition1. </para>

          <para>The honorable  member  for Flinders&#39; referred to a more important question about policy in relation to Japan.

That is purely a question of. military discipline and involves no general question of political policy, in which the Government would naturally be guided by military considerations-..

          <para>I turn now to the honorable&#39; member fbr Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie&#39; Cameron),</inline> who has been more frank about this matter than has the honorable member for Richmond, and who, before the&#39; suspension of the sitting said, in effect, that Australia could not expect any benefit- from the United Nations. Consistent&#39; with his other observations he also said that theonly&#34; arbitrament to&#39; which the people of the world, could look was the arbitrament&#39; of force. The&#39; honorable member may have historic parallels for so dismal a view which involves an attitude of resignation and- almost&#39; of despair in&#39; the face of the troubles&#39; that confront the world to-day, but I can hardly believe that the Honorable&#39; gentleman, whose pessimism on &#34;Wednesday is succeeded by a qualified optimism on Thursday, which is succeeded by pessimism on friday and optimism on Saturday, has abandoned hope in the United Nations. Everything that the honorable member for Richmond said in criticism of the United Nations was unfounded. So far from failing in the terrible crises that have confronted the United Nations in the last few year9 - and I say &#34; terrible &#34; because of the acute differences that exist between the great powers, caused mainly by the attitude of Russia - it has acted in a praiseworthy manner. Because of the differences between the great powers the United Nations has had placed before it for consideration matters that normally would have been dealt with under the peace treaties. </para>
          <para>I shall enumerate some of those matters. I have already referred to Kashmir. Tens of thousands, and perhaps hundreds of thousands of lives were saved as a result of intervention by the United Nations in the Kashmir dispute. The same remark applies to Greece. It is perfectly true that there has been fighting in Greece, but it has been restricted, and limited through the operation of the United Nations Balkans Commission. In Korea intervention by the United Nations led to the &#34;firm establishment of the Republic of Southern Korea free from oppression from the northern part of that peninsula. I turn now to Indonesia, which used to be the theme song of honorable members opposite. As a result of United Nations intervention, in which Australia took a prominent part through its distinguished representative, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Critchley,</inline> the parties to the Indonesian dispute are healing their differences at a round table conference at The Hague. The Australian Government is lending its best aid in that direction. I apply similar remarks to Palestine where United Nations intervention has met with substantial success. Although there was fighting in Palestine the intervention of the United Nations mediator and of the Palestine Commission limited the fighting, and in the end stopped it and produced agreement. The problem of Palestine is not yet solved, because there remains the question of the internationalization of </para>
          <para class="block">Jerusalem which has to be considered  by  the Palestine commission. </para>
          <para>The achievements that I have enumerated are important, but it is not only on the political side that the United Nations has a great record of success. It has a similar record on the economic side. The United Nations International Children&#39;s Emergency Fund is one of the greatest contributions to the alleviation of the conditions that obtain in many parts of the world in the post-war era, and the Government and I personally are intensely proud of the fact that, of the <inline font-style="italic">5&#38;</inline> member nations of the United Nations, Australia gave the second largest contribution to the United Nations in its great crusade for children. The people of Australia supported that action by their response to a voluntary appeal last year when the voluntary contributions of Australians to the United Nations International Children&#39;s Emergency Fund were, in the aggregate, greater than the voluntary contributions that came from any other country in the world. Those illustrations show that the economic side of the work of the United Nations is of supreme importance. The Economic and Social Council of the United Nations has done good work. </para>
          <para>That brings me to the curious remarks of the honorable member for Richmond about the trusteeship system. He told the committee that Australia, because it administers New Guinea as a trusteeship territory, has to answer the questions of the Trusteeship Council about the welfare of the native peoples, and he regarded that as wrong. It almost appears as if the honorable member is ignorant of the fact that from 1920, under the mandates system which applied to Australia, as the mandatory power, this country had to appear before the Permanent Mandates Commission of the League of Nations and answer the same kind of questions&#39; and give the same kind of informations as are required by the Trusteeship Council of the United Nations, because, by solemn treaty, Australia had pledged itself to govern New Guinea, which had been a German possession prior to 1914, in the interests of the native peoples. </para>

              <para>- There was great argument about whether the mandates system did or did not disappear when the League of Nations ceased to exist. When the conference of the United Nations met at San Francisco it was decided to convert the mandates system into the trusteeship system, and it is perfectly true that Australia voluntarily continued, under the trusteeship system, to administer the same territory that it had administered for twenty years under the mandates system. The British Government took the same action. That was not a socialistic government but a coalition government. In fact all the nations of the British Commonwealth that were concerned - the United Kingdom, New Zealand in respect of Samoa, and Australia - took the same action. In relation to Nauru there is a tripartite trusteeship in which Australia is administrator, and the three parties to which are the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Australia. It is almost like a summons to the Dark Ages to say that the administration of New Guinea, which had been conducted for twenty years satisfactorily and well by Australia under a system akin to the trusteeship system should not be administered in the same way according to a system under which Australia would undertake similar obligations. One of the most important functions of the United Nations is to raise the standards of dependent peoples and to ensure that colonies are no longer regarded as mere possessions of an imperial power, but are administered as British colonies were administered, according to the declara tions of the great colonial administrators, in a spirit of trust. I see no degradation, and nothing except honour, propriety and justice in Australia answering questions to a committee elected by the United Nations, half of the members of which must belong to trustee nations themselves. All trustee countries are members of the Trusteeship Council, and I can see nothing wrong in Australia answering the questions of that council about what has happened during the previous twelve months in respect of the welfare of native peoples. I am quite sure that that opinion is shared by the majority of the Australian people. Representatives of all the churches have acclaimed the principle. Only recently in a broadcast a distinguished leader of the Church of England praised the principle of the improvement of the standards of native peoples. The Government adheres to that principle which is a United Nations principle. Yet we have the honorable member for Richmond saying, &#34; Ah, you should have done what the United States of America did, and treated New Guinea as a strategic area &#34;. The United States of America treated as a strategic area the Caroline, Marshall and Marianas Islands which had been administered by Japan as mandates after World War I., and in respect of which the Japanese, by constructing fortifications there, did not honour their obligations. The United States of America succeeded in obtaining the approval of the United Nations for these islands to be deemed strategic areas. However, Article 83 of the United Nations Charter deals with that kind of trusteeship territory. It .provides that the Security Council shall, subject to the&#34; provisions of the trusteeship agreement, and without prejudicing security considerations, avail itself of the assistance of the Trusteeship Council to perform those functions of the United Nations under a trusteeship relating to political, economic, social and educational matters in the strategic area. </para>

That is the kind of policy we are pursuing now. I have tried to explain the deveolpment  of the Department of External Affairs. I had thought that in substance these things were not disputed. I know that they are not disputed by the  overwhelming  majority of the Australian people. </para>

            <para>.- We have listened to the Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> make one of his usual defences of the United Nations, but not until the last moment of his speech did he have very much to say about Australia, the country from which he sprang. Time and time again he has talked of Australia&#39;s interests being those of all the nations of the world. I dispute that contention. Some nation&#39;s would destroy this country if they were given a chance to do so. Yet the Minister, who is supposed to be our Minister for External Affairs, says that the best path for Australia to follow is the path of internationalism. As I have said on other occasions, the -Minister, in his pursuit of internationalism, has forgotten his duty to this country. In all of his discussions he does not say one word about this country and its difficulties. Indeed, he has used the debate on the Estimates very unfairly. Under the Standing Orders he is permitted to speak for an indefinite period, but Opposition members are limited to 30 minutes. Within that short period we are expected to sum&#39; up the whole international situation. I had hoped to hear from the Minister some statement- of the particular dangers that confront this country at the present time, but he did not mention one word about them. In truth the foreign policy of this country may be summed up in the five letters of the alphabet, &#34; E.V.A.T.T.&#34;. That has been the policy of this country for the last six or seven years. To-night the Minister, in defending his department, has sought to turn this debate into a debate on international affairs and the vital interests that affect the world to-day. Not one word was said by the right honorable gentleman in defence of his action in handing over New Guinea to the Trusteeship Council of the United Nations. He seems to have forgotten that there lie dead in that country no fewer than 6,000 Australians. He has told us what the late  President  Roosevelt and  President  Truman have said, but he did not say one word about what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Churchill</inline> has said. He did not tell us, as he could have done, that when the United States had to determine whether certain of its possessions or places occupied by it should be placed under the trusteeship of the United Nations it specified a special kind of trusteeship, known as a strategic trusteeship. New Guinea, which is so vital to our interests, and in which 6,000 of our men laid down their lives, was handed over by the Minister to the Trusteeship Council of the United Nations without consultation with the Parliament or even, I suspect, with the Government. The right honorable gentleman is a law unto himself. He speaks on behalf of this country with no authority other than that which devolves upon him by virtue of the office which he holds. He has handed over to the inquiry and inspection of all other nations, enemy or friendly, a territory which is of the highest strategic importance to us. I am not prepared to follow the course that has been followed by so many persons, even on this side of the chamber, and say, &#34; What a great man this is &#34;. In the pursuit of his own interests and in the cause of internationalism, the right honorable gentleman has sacrificed the interests of his country time and time again. I do not ask pardon for having made that statement. I stand by it. </para>

          <para>If we examine the map of this part of the world we shall find that Noumea lies within 1,000 miles of the whole of out eastern coast extending from Sydney to Rockhampton. It lies within 1,500 miles of the whole of our eastern seaboard from east of Melbourne to Cape York Peninsula. Australia is 1,000 miles from Timor. Prom those two points alone, as any man who has served in the Air Force knows, the whole of Australia is open to attack by a hostile power. Time and time again we have asked what the Government is doing to counter that threat, but all. we get in reply is a speech by the Minister for External Affairs in defence of the cause of internationalism. </para>
          <para class="block">Similar speeches to the one he has just made were made after the League of Nations had been established. If we cast our minds back to the speeches that were delivered at that time, we will recall that they were couched in terms almost exactly similar to the speeches that have been delivered by the Minister for External Affairs; but at least some -had the virtue of having been made with a better sense of reality. The right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> did not take the view that this country should be sacrificed in the cause of internationalism. Let there be no mistake about our stand in this matter. We on this side of the chamber believe in and support the principles of the United Nations, but we differ from the Minister in that we say that although we believe in the ideals of the United Nations, we must at all times put the interests of our own country first, since there are hostile forces in the world which are still determined to destroy us and our way of life. Time and time again, the Minister has told the people of Australia how he is fighting for its interests. I deny that he is doing so and all thinking people will agree with me. Let us consider what is taking place to the north of Australia. Not long ago, when the Minister made a speech on international affairs in this chamber, he omitted to mention two very vital matters. He did not say one word about what was taking place in China nor did he mention the North Atlantic Pact. Honorable members will recall how, when questions were directed to him about the position in China, the right honorable gentleman slid over them because he did not want to mention that country. </para>
          <para>The Minister for External Affairs has always shown a strange desire to placate Russian interests. When the light of publicity is thrown upon him he stands up as a world figure. He is even prepared on occasions to stand up to Vishinsky and make a bold statement in order to direct world attention on himself. I well remember the occasion some years ago in this chamber when, having walked with the mighty and spoken with the leaders of Russia, he said that he was satisfied that Russia&#39;s foreign policy was founded on self-preservation and on no other premise. What kind of nonsense was such a statement by a man who puts himself forward as the only man in this country who really knows anything about this subject? He may be judged by his own statements. Later, he said that the foreign policy of Russia was based on a desire to live in peace with the other nations of the world and that it was designed merely for the protection of Russia&#39;s own boundaries. What has happened since then? The world has been divided into two camps solely because Russia has not been prepared to compromise with the rest of the world. </para>
          <para>We have seen China overwhelmed. No doubt the Minister is waiting for the moment when he will be able to stand up in this chamber and say, &#34; We recognize the <inline font-style="italic">de facto</inline> Government of China &#34;. He may avoid making such a statement as long as he possibly can, but it will not be long before it will be made. What is the <inline font-style="italic">de facto</inline> Government of China but a government of force? During and since the war we have fought for the maintenance of certain principles, one of them being the right of people to determine their own destiny. The Chinese people have not been given the right to determine their own destiny. They are now governed by forces which were aidedand protected by Russia. Let there be no doubt about that. When Russia turned towards the west and found that it could not penetrate western Europe beyond its western zone in Germany, it directed its attention to the east. As I have said time after time, we are a white people occupying a geographical appendage of Asia. Because we occupy what is, in substance, an archipelago of Asia we have a very special problem to meet. I had thought that the Minister would tell us how he proposes to protect Australia from that threat, but he did not do so. The idea of a Pacific pact emanated, not from the right honorable gentleman, but from this side of the chamber. The Government played around with the idea and used it for political propaganda, but it did nothing whatever about it. So, to-day, the Government pursues its foreign policy at Lake Success and in all the capitals of Europe, but not in Asia, where our vital interests lie. </para>
          <para>Our lack of a defence policy constitutes-&#39; an open invitation to any aggressive hostile power. Only four years have passed since World War II. came to an end but on every occasion when the Minister for External Affairs has happened to be present in this chamber to make a statement on foreign policy he has delivered a speech which hae been neither more nor less than an apotheosis of the United Nations. I have waited for a long time to hear theMinister, who proclaims that he is a great Australian, state how he proposes to serveAustralia other than through the United Nations. When members of the Opposition mentioned the Pacific Pact, he made two statements, one of which was quite inconsistent with the other. He said that the Pacific Pact would merely bo supplementary to the United Nations, and then he said that it would be an alternative to that organization. Every honorable member will recall his references to those matters. He was trying to compromise with an idea merely for a political reason. He has always stood for internationalism. He believes in internationalism. He is an internationalist. He is not, in my view, an Australian, and that remark applies also to some  honorable  members opposite who interject. </para>

              <para>- I do not propose to enter into personalities, but I say that that is so. If the honorable members opposite so desire, I shall mention a few names. In point of fact, the Government has been infected for a long time by communism. Honorable members opposite pretend to dispute that fact, but there is no doubt about it. I remember perfectly well that just before the last election the Labour party issued the same kind of propaganda as it is pouring out today to mislead the people of this country. Honorable members opposite said, &#34; The Labour party will fight the Communists &#34;. The Labour party has fought the Communists only with words. Words are the only weapon with which the Labour party will ever fight the Communists. The Minister for External Affairs stood up for two Communists whom I had interned when I was Minister for the Army. Those men had been engaged in treachery to their country in war-time; but the Minister declared that they should be released. As soon as he became Attorney-General, he released them from internment. But he did more than that. When he became AttorneyGeneral, he supplied the Communist party with all the things that any government could supply to enable them to carry out their treacherous and traitorous work in this country. That is the kind of man that the Minister is, and that is the kind of political party that the Labour party is. To-day it tries to convince the people that it is fighting communism. Let there, be no doubt in the minds of the people about the attitude of the Labour party on that issue. The Labour party will stoop to any action at all to try to persuade the people that it stands against communism. But, in truth, the honorable members who sit on the right of the Chair are nothing less than the political wing of the industrial movement of this country, and the industrial movement is split asunder because of a division between the Communists and the non-Communists. So, when I say that the Minister is an internationalist, it is simply indicative of the attitude of many members of the Labour party. That remark does not apply to all of them, because I know that some of them are as bitterly opposed to communism as I am. I know also that the Labour party is quite incapable of dealing with this treacherous movement in our own country. So it does not surprise me that, when we listen to a debate on international affairs in this chamber, we do not hear the spirit of Australia being breathed at all. All that we hear is international jargon, and it is a jargon which we have heard for a long time. </para>

          <para>I am not one of those who believe for a moment that the ultimate solution of the world&#39;s problems can be obtained finally other than through the comity of the nations; but I am quite satisfied that, in this world of uncertainty to-day, the important thing for us to do is to put our defences in order, and adjust our foreign policy along lines which will preserve our own security. Our own security must be the first consideration. The Minister, and Labour members who seldom make a speech but who always interrupt, state repeatedly that Australia is closer to </para>
          <para class="block">Great Britain than it has ever been in the past, and, by the same token, that we are closer to the United States of America than ever before. That statement is absolutely false, as the Minister himself ought to know. It is quite wrong to mislead the public of this country into believing Chat there has been a smooth, harmonious relationship at official levels between the Australian Government and the representatives of the United States of America in this country. Those of us who have anything to do with these matters know that the contrary is the fact. For a long time the Americans have been seeking to consummate the Fulbright agreement and eliminate double taxation in order to encourage the investment of American capital in this country, but this Government has at all times placed barriers in the way of the fulfilment of either of those objectives. Yet we are told that our relations with the United States of America are closer than they have ever been in the past. I agree that the Government&#39;s relations with the Government of Great Britain are very close, but I take leave to doubt whether our relations are closer with the people of Great Britain than they have ever been before. The Government&#39;s relations with the Government of Great Britain are close only because both governments serve an out-worn philosophy known as socialism. </para>
          <para>I now desire to make some observations upon a minor matter, although it reveals how the Minister himself is prepared to avoid giving a direct answer to questions on public affairs. This touches a small matter, but the principle involved is important. On the 28th September, I asked the Minister for External Affairs whether any personal advances had been made to a certain high official in New York who was about to go to another post. I asked the right honorable gentleman whether it was a fact that between the 30th December, 1946, and the 11th April, 1947, advances totalling 10,500 dollars had been made to that official without any authority from Australia to do so. My question continued - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>If authority was given, by whom was it given ? </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I also asked what amount was outstanding to-day and whether those advances to a consular official constituted a permissible use of government funds. Before I proceed to deal with the answer that the Minister has given, I shall make a few preliminary observations. This Government imagines that any money which it expends belongs to it. The truth is that it holds the money only as the trustee on behalf of the people. However, the Government expends public money as if it owns it. Before I give the Minister&#39;s answers to my questions, I remind the committee that I did not mention the name of the official, but the Minister, who pretended a complete ignorance of the affair, mentioned him. He said that he was quite satisfied that the Australian Consul-General in New York had not engaged in anything irregular. I point out that I did not mention the Australian Consul-General, but by a strange circumstance, the Minister who pleaded ignorance of the matter knew of the person to whom I was referring. </para>

In that event, the Minister stands condemned because he did not pay the officer a sufficiently high salary to enable him to represent this country abroad.

          <para>That is a tortuous and misleading legalism, because there is no relation between one. transaction and another. If furnished accommodation is provided wherever possible and a reasonable amount is deducted for rent from an officer&#39;s salary, it is different from making a personal advance to him to enable him to acquire his own property. Australia is desperately short of dollars, and I should like to know whether that official has been placed in the position of being unable to carry on because the department has paid him a miserly salary and allowance. If that is so, let it be said by the Minister. If not, what is the reason for using public moneys to make a personal advance to any officer of the Commonwealth? If, in fact, a Minister or a permanent officer is able to say, &#34; You may have an advance for this or that purpose &#34;, what becomes of the boasted control by Parliament of public expenditure?

I assumed that the reference was to the ConsulGeneral in New York. I had no previous knowledge that an advance of the kind mentioned by the honorable member had been made. I do not even now know the details of the transaction. The honorable member&#39;s question was referred to my department, and the answer that was supplied to the honorable member was provided by the department and by the Treasury.

The advance was approved by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dunk,</inline> who was then Secretary of the Department of External Affairs, and is now  Chairman  of the Public Service Board. It was also approved by the Treasury. The case seems to be on all fours with that of officers for whom furniture is provided, the cost being recovered by deductions from their salaries. In this instance, the officer purchased the furniture himself, and paid for it from time to time by deductions from his salary. How absurd it is to suggest that the Government  i3  entering into business.

It is wrong to suggest that the transaction was improper, or that the Government is using public money as if it belonged to individual members of the Government. Throughout the whole of his speech, the honorable member exhibited malevolence and jealousy and hatred of a kind that was unworthy of him. I gave the information in good faith, and it is contrary to the fact to suggest that something has been kept back. I challenge the honorable member to persist with his amendment. </para>

              <para>- Well, the answer took the form of a written statement. The Minister said that he supplied an answer for the accuracy of which he cannot vouch. He does not know whether it contained one truthful statement, and apparently he does not care, either. It is time the committee took a good look at some of the things being done by the Minister for External Affairs. We have listened to a very long speech from him to-night. It began before the dinner recess and then, after a two-hour break, it was continued. It seemed to me that the committee, at the end of the speech, looked very much like the Privy Council must have looked after the right honorable gentleman concluded his address on the <inline font-style="italic">Banking</inline> case. He took great credit for what the Ambassador of the United States of America was reported to have said when he arrived in Australia. I shall never be an ambassador, because I am not sufficiently diplomatic, but I have always thought that it was one of the most important functions of ambassadors and ministers, to be friendly and courteous to the governments to which they are accredited, and not to say anything to which those governments or the people generally could take exception. I should be surprised if any minister or ambassador who comes to Australia from a foreign country should say anything different from what the American ambassador is reported to have said. What did the Minister for External Affairs expect? Did he expect the American ambassador to come here with a bouqueof roses fresh from California? Or did he expect a bouquet of stinkworor a crown of thorns, or perhaps an atomic bomb? The Minister should take a common-sense, objective view of these things. He lives altogether too much in a circumscribed world of his own creation. The rest of us are inclined to look on his comings and goings and his posing and posturings on the world&#39;s stage, with a good deal of amusement, and sometimes with some disgust. </para>

              <para>- No, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> and I have too much in common for him to believe that of me. We are, in fact, two of the greatest tories in the Parliament. What purpose has the Government in scattering ambassadors and ministers, and  consuls-general all over the world? One might search the public statements of the Minister for External Affairs since he took office without finding a coherent expression of the policy of the Government in thi9 respect. It appears that the Department of External Affairs, like Topsy, has &#34; just  growed&#34;.  If this spread of diplomatic activity is to be of any use to Australia, there should be some evidence of it already. Some of us have viewed at first hand the activities of foreign ambassadors and ministers in Australia. If our ambassadors and ministers overseas are no more usefully employed than are foreign representatives in Australia, the whole lot could be sen. back to their respective countries without any loss to the world, and there would bn no danger of war breaking out overnight. </para>

          <para>The Minister for External Affairs takes great credit to himself for the United Nations, and has twitted me foi being a person who does not believe in it. I never did believe in either the United Nations or its predecessor. For that reason I spoke and voted for the application of sanctions to Italy. I did not believe that the sanctions would be worth the paper they were written on. I never believed that the League of Nations would work. I did not believe that sanctions would stop the war in Ethiopia. History proves that the United Nations cannot prevent war. What is its record? Has the United Nations settled the trouble in Berlin? Did the Minister for External Affairs settle anything there, even after buying into the trouble? In spite of the efforts of the United Nations, and of the British Minister, Lord Cadogan, the trouble in Berlin was not settled. Berlin is a diplomatic and military cancer in the heart of Europe, and this great organization, to which we are told to look up as the guardian of world peace, has not done a darned thing about it. War has been going on in Greece for a long time, but the United Nations has done nothing about it. In Palestine, the United Nations submitted to force, which is the very thing that the Minister for External Affairs says it was created to curb. The United Nations saw its own mediator, the descendant of a Frenchman who left his country for a throne, murdered without any- thing being done about it. It did nothing more than the Australian Government did when Australians were murdered in Java. The Government left them in their graves, and did nothing. </para>
          <para>I turn now to India and Kashmir. A leading Australian officer and a wellknown pressman were selected to go there, but the United Nations went cold on the proposal, and they are still here. I have seen them. What did the United Nations do about Indonesia? It made a bad situation infinitely worse, and provided a supremo example of muddle. In Indo-China, the French are struggling against a Communist uprising. Has the United Nations done anything to assist in the preservation of law and order in that country? It has done nothing. If events in Korea are an example of intervention by the United Nations, then God forbid that we shall ever have to depend on that organization to save us. Now let us consider China, where there exists the most unlovely situation in the world. The honorable member for Warringah rightly said that Russia, checked to the west, would immediately turn- to the east. The time will come again when Russia will intrude into Asia and rightdown the Persian Gulf. The time will come when Russian divisions will approach the passes on the north-west frontier of India. I ask the Minister for External Affairs what the United Nations can do about it. It will do nothing more that it did in Palestine. Greece, Indonesia, Indo-China, China, and Korea. Its members will have a great big talking match at Lake Success, and, after they have talked themselves into a stupor, Molotov, or whoever may be acting for him, will get up and say, &#34; No ! &#34;. That is as far as they will go. So long as we have an organization of this sort in which the right of veto is vested in one nation, it cannot work. The right honorable gentleman can talk about the four freedoms and things like that. All 1 ask him to do is to come home for once and tell us what freedom is extended to himself or to any member of his party to speak against the policy of that party. If he did so, he would be tipped out quick and lively. Those who preach these things to the world, should remember that charity and freedom begin at home. Until such time as the four freedoms can  be  extended to the spartan-disciplined Australian Labour party, its members should maintain silence on the subject of freedom. </para>

He has devoted a lot of his time to it. I have had to work hard for my living, and I have not had much time for avocations of that sort, but I recall to the right honorable gentleman the fact that there is nothing new in the idea of a united nations organization. This is no new discovery by a few Marco Polos. It goes back into history. I shall not take honorable members back further than Alexander the Great, who thought that he would achieve a united nations of Europe and Asia by spreading the Greek language. He was wrong.

              <para>- The honorable member is wrong in his Scottish history. I advise him to look at the picture of Bonnie Prince Charlie and he will see what the McLeods did not do for the king of Scotland. He will want a much wider red stripe in his yellow tartan than he has up to date. We get down further. I do not intend to go into the whole history of the Holy Roman Empire. I mention only Charles V. when practically all Europe, the two Americas and a good slice of Asia were under the one king. That went overboard. There has been one league of nations that has been supremely successful. About it we seldom hear a word. It was previously known as the British Empire. One does not hear, it mentioned in this chamber very often. I have heard it spoken of disparagingly and most apologetically. I have seen it go into a form of voluntary liquidation since completing a successful war, an action for which there is no parallel in history. The Minister for External Affairs tells us about the successes of the United Nations, but he does, not seem to be doing much to increase the strength and cohesiveness of what has been the most successful league of nations, up to date. I refer to the British Empire. I ask the right honorable gentleman where he stands in regard to the Western Union Does he think it is fated to go in the same direction as ancient Greece? He has read Lord  Bryce&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Greater Greece.</inline> Does he expect Western Europe to go in the same way as Greece went or does he think it would be better to get a united Europe than a United Nations? I point out that, before the 1939 war, the boundary between Europe and Asia was not the Ural Mountains, but the Vistula River. The boundary is far west of the Vistula to-day. It runs through Berlin. To the west is Western Europe and to the east the barbarism of communism and all that barbarism has stood for in the last 4,000 years. Before there can be any approach  to a successful United Nations there must be a strong English-speaking union. That is the first essential. It must be the first stone in the foundations of anything of the character of a united nations organization. The next matter devolves upon &#34;Western Europe. Can we get Scandinavia, Germany, the Low Countries, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland and Australia, in other words, the very cream of Europe, to agree, first, to a customs union, and, secondly to a tenuous and perhaps rather shadowy form of political arrangement for common defence and a certain superior governmental authority? That is the first step. The right honorable gentleman asks us to gallop before we can even crawl. I think it is high time that he took a good look at world history. I am prepared to discuss it with him any time he likes, in public or private. I make no apology for my attitude to the United Nations any more than I did for my attitude to the League of Nations. </para>

            <para>.- If the cacophony of the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> and the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender)</inline> can be accepted as argument, the Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> must have been overwhelmed. When the statements made by- the honorable member for Barker are examined, it will appear first that what he had to say was mostly burlesque, which is a travesty on the Parliament, and, secondly, that what he had to say would not stand any analysis whatever. The honorable member for Barker, after disavowing the United Nations, went on to say that the United Nations has not settled anything. He illustrated his statement by making a reference to the Berlin air lift. Whether he knows it or not, the situation in Berlin was critical, and had there not been an air lift, there would have been war. </para>

              <para>- Let us call for the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report and find out what he did say. I call upon every honorable member who heard him to bear witness to what he said. It was unmistakable. If he declares that the air lift was not a substantial contribution to the preservation of peace, all that I can say is that he is not quite conscious of what took place. He concluded magnificently by calling for an Australian outlook, a British outlook, an English-speaking outlook and a European outlook. I wish that we could get him to put those points in this chamber when the debate centres on the matter of immigration and white Australia, because he would perhaps be able to give an influential lead to the Opposition in understanding the matters that the Minister for Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> has long been trying to make apparent to this country as being essential for its defence. </para>

          <para>I propose now to say one or two things about the concluding remarks of the honorable member for Warringah. Half of his speech was taken up with a long dissertation and an allegation concerning the Consul-General in New York, who had some advances made to him by the Department of External Affairs. Curiously, although the advances that were made to the Consul -General were made abnormally, the department was cautious enough to accept some security against the advances. I wonder what he would have 3aid regarding the abnormality of the transaction if the department had not taken that precaution. I consider that that portion of his speech was in bad taste in view of the fact that when the honorable gentleman was in New York he did not hesitate to accept the hospitality and generosity of the ConsulGeneral, or so I am reliably informed. Yet he is now seeking to vilify the ConsulGeneral in this chamber. Honorable members may make their own judgment about what kind of a person the honorable member for Warringah must be when, after having accepted a man&#39;s hospitality, he comes into the chamber and vilifies him although he is thousands of miles away. The remainder of the honorable member&#39;s statements are not capable of analysis, and that remark applies also to the statements of the honorable member for Barker. One of the things that the honorable member for Warringah referred to according to a note that I took was the situation in China. He said, in effect: &#34; I wonder what the Minister for External Affairs will say when it comes close to the time to recognize the <inline font-style="italic">de facto</inline> government of China. Will he do so, and what will he tell us then % &#34; The implication in his remarks was that there is something sinister in this recognition of another foreign government. According to my notes the honorable member also used the words &#34; recognition of a government that has come to power by force.&#34; The people of this country have not such a short memory that they forget that the honorable member who said that was a Minister in the Menzies Government which recognized the <inline font-style="italic">de facto</inline> Franco regime which came into power in Spain by force. The people are not going to forget that when the Soviet Government eventually assumed control of affairs in Russia in 1917 conservative governments of that time did not recognize what was a reality. I put this question to the honorable member for Warringah : What is the alternative, if we seek to preserve peace, to recognition such as must be eventually afforded even to the new Government in China? I told the House after I returned from China two years ago that the Kuomintang government was rotten and corrupt. I told the House that Chiang Kai-shek, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Soong</inline> and their minions were persons who retained power in China only by virtue of their corrupt practices and their maintenance of private armies. That was the only way in which they retained power but the people of China have removed them from a substantial area of the Chinese domain. If it appears that it is desirable or necessary in the interests of peace for Australia to accord <inline font-style="italic">de facto</inline> recognition to the new government of China, that recognition must be accorded even although it may be ideologically unsavoury, ot foreign to our desires. The honorable member for Warringah referred to what he described as the singular failure of the Minister for External Affairs to say what were the particular dangers that confronted this country. Having made such a statement the honorable member himself neatly passed on to tha consideration of another matter without specifying what the dangers were, thus leaving the people to conjecture what the dangers were. </para>
          <para>The maintenance of a force of 100,000 men in New Guinea would not give us any greater security in Australia than we can obtain by our co-operation with other nations through the United Nations, by entering into obligations such as, perhaps, a Pacific pact, and by our subscription to the North Atlantic pact and to the Western Union, as well as by our adherence to a form of collective security. No greater safeguards for peace than those could be obtained by our worrying about a few acres of ground in New Guinea, even although they may be held by a squadron or two of aeroplanes and by an aircraft carrier and a few battalions of troops. The plain fact of the matter is that the proposed vote of &#163;1,005,000 for the Department of External Affairs would provide . a far greater safeguard for peace than the maintenance of large forces and territorial stations in areas beyond Australia&#39;s shores. In case ithas been forgotten I shall remind honorable members that the Minister is asking for the sanction of Parliament for the expenditure of a sum of &#163;1,005,000 in the current year, which is the equivalent of 2s. 6d. a head of population per annum. That is a sum which some people spend by subscribing to membership of the Liberal party, either voluntarily or involuntarily. Let us examine what we shall buy for this 2s. 6d. each, because I consider that it is time that we had some practicality in this debate. </para>
          <para>What we shall buy for that 2s. 6d. is first, direct representation for Australia in all the other dominions of the British Commonwealth, which include Canada, New Zealand, India, Pakistan, Ceylon, the Republic of Ireland, and South Africa. Secondly, we shall buy direct representation for Australia at ambassadorial level in the countries of the permanent member nations of the Security Council of the United Nations. Those nations include the Soviet Union, France, China, Great Britain and the United States of America,  In  addition to that we shall buy direct representation, through our office in Brazil, in all the Latin-American countries. I do not think that any one would doubt for a moment that the expenditure of such a small sum of money <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> is an extremely wise insurance from the point of view of both security and trade. No honorable member who has spoken in this debate has suggested that the amount for which approval is being sought is in excess of what should be provided. Nobody has suggested that it is inadequate in any way. A full explanation has been given by the Minister about what I regard as the successful attempts by the Government and the Minister to conserve expenditure in areas in which we have to provide dollars to maintain our diplomatic representation. There has been no argument from honorable members opposite about the importance of the vote for the Department of . External Affairs. The argument by honorable members opposite in this chamber to-day has been based upon a worn out case on foreign affairs that has been advanced on every occasion on which statements on foreign affairs have been presented to the Parliament, irrespective of the contents of those statements. Honorable members opposite have simply said the same old things over and over again. The Minister did not initiate a debate on foreign affairs himself today but was provoked by the statements of honorable members opposite. The same old arguments have been adduced again and again by the same few honorable members opposite. I refer to the honorable member for Barker, the honorable member for Warringah, the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> and the honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison).</inline> We might as well have gramophone records made of their speeches, because having once been made they could be played over and over again and we should be just as well informed on the subjects that the honorable members speak on, as we are when they stand up and make a speech on them. If cacophony were to be accepted for argument, then we have been overwhelmed to-day, because all I got from the speech of the honorable member for Warringah was plenty of noise and not much sense. We also got that little bit of scandal about the Consul-General in New York that he threw in to make up the weight. I suggest that that piece of scandal was in the worst possible taste when we consider that the honorable member for Warringah had previously accepted the Consul-General&#39;s hospitality and generosity. </para>

          <para>There are some matters on which I seek information from the Minister. One of them concerns the provision, if any, by the Department of External Affairs for the maintenance of the Australian Mission in Tokyo. That does not appear to be covered in the Estimates. Can the Minister also tell me why the vote for the High Commissioner in the United Kingdom is included in the previous division under the Prime Minister&#39;s Department, rather than under the Department of External Affairs. I sought an explanation of this from the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman),</inline> but &#39;I regret to say that I was not satisfied with the answer he gave me. Perhaps the Minister for External Affairs can enlighten me on the subject. </para>
          <para>The total proposed vote for the Department of External Affairs is &#163;1,005,000, or 2s. 6d. a head of population per annum. That is a small individual contribution for each taxpayers to make for a department that is as important as this one is. The total proposed vote for the department represents two-elevenths of one per cent, of the entire budget vote, and, therefore, it seems unfair and unreasonable that the time of the committee should be occupied with the trivial and frivolous amendment that has been moved to reduce the vote by &#163;1. That amendment was moved merely to satisfy the vanity and desire for publicity of the honorable member for Warringah. </para>

In an address of that length, delivered on one of the rare occasions when he is present in this chamber, he should have explained his attitude to certain issues that are of vital importance, not only to this country, but also to the world at large. Instead of doing so, the right honorable gentleman made what can only be reasonably described as a political speech about our foreign policy. He did not give us an objective account of the policy of the Government in relation to the events in Europe and, indeed, over the whole face of the European and Asiatic continents, the outcome of which may well affect the fate of this country. What is the attitude of this Government to the trends that have unfolded in Europe? What is its attitude towards the North Atlantic Pact? What is its attitude towards the military implications of that pact on the nations of Europe? Where does Australia stand in that regard? The right honorable gentleman did not mention those matters. </para>

          <para>Where does Australia stand to-day with Asia aflame? Where does Australia stand in  regard  to the conclusion of a formal peace with Japan, an issue on which the Minister spoke with great vehemence and virility two years ago? To-day, the Communist-backed new nation of China is reaching right to the Pacific Ocean and is standing -before allied-occupied Japan, where Australian soldiers are still serving. What is the attitude of the right honorable gentleman and of the Government towards that issue? I have never been convinced that the Minister has treated Australia&#39;s position in Japan with the seriousness that his words have indicated. He chose to send as the Australian representative to J apan to sit opposite General MacArthur and to take his place in the deliberations of the Far Eastern Commission, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Patrick</inline> Shaw, an estimable young man, but one of the youngest and most junior officers in the Australian diplomatic service. That was the most curious appointment that one could conceive, it certainly did not fit in with the Minister&#39;s proclaimed earnestness about Australia&#39;s status in the international arena. How could we expect a young man in his &#39;thirties who, ten years ago, was a junior cable clerk in the Prime Minister&#39;s Department, to wield influence when seated opposite a man of the international stature of General MacArthur? I say nothing against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shaw</inline> personally, but I say that it was a fantastic appointment, though no more fantastic than some of the other appointments that have been made by this Government. What is the significance of replacing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shaw</inline> by the senior Australian career diplomat,  Colonel Hodgson?  Does this change portend greater activity in the Japanese area, or does it indicate that  Colonel Hodgson  has been removed from his former post as Australian Ambassador to France merely to make room for some one else ? Those are some of the matters that we expected the Minister to discuss. </para>
          <para>This country is vitally interested in the conclusion which the Minister draws from the revelation that the Soviet possesses the secret of the atomic bomb. We shall not be brushed aside by the sneering statement of an honorable member opposite that the association of diplomacy with the prospect and possibility of war is the task of the war-monger. One hears such accusations even from the ministerial bench. The truth is that the principal job of the diplomat is to avoid war. That is the <inline font-style="italic">raison d&#39;etre</inline> of the diplomat. It is his task to do everything possible to avoid war. If war cannot be avoided, it is his job to see that his own country is so situated that it is not likely to bo defeated and not likely to have to fight without the assistance of allies. That has been the historic function of the diplomat. History carries many messages to us of the services that have been rendered by skillful, assiduous foreign ministers to their respective countries, and of the disaster that has befallen some nations because of the failure of their foreign ministers. </para>
          <para>Where do we stand in that respect to-day 1 Are we merely floating along happily in the belief .that, because this nation subscribes to the principles of the United Nations, it is safe from agression? I support the principle of the United Nations. It is the one organized hope for the preservation of human society. I hope that we may be able to avoid the horrors of war, but I do not rate the prospects higher than a hope. I remind the Government and the people that the whole history of mankind is one of conflict after conflict. I simply cannot believe that I just happen to live on the earth, which has existed for millions of years, and which has been inhabited by humans for scores of thousands of years, at the moment when war has ceased forever. If that were true, we should have reached the age of miracles. This nation requires its Minister for External Affairs to devote his talents primarily to the historic function of all foreign ministers, and that is, to see that his country has a sound recognizable foreign policy ; that it knows where it is going and with whom it is going; that it knows who are its friends and who are its potential enemies; and that it know9, too, that, if the catastrophe of war befalls it, who its allies will be. That is the function of a Minister for External Affairs, as I conceive it. </para>
          <para>There is another job of work to be done. I refer to the carrying on of a crusade for peace in the United Nations and its subsidiary organizations. The United Nations must have vast powers. The General Assembly must have a  president.  The Minister for External Affairs has enjoyed the congratulations of honorable members on both sides of this chamber on the high honour he has achieved in being chosen to preside over the General Assembly of the United Nations. I remind him and the people that such an appointment places him in much the same position as that of a judge of a court or an umpire of a football match.. It lifts him above the level of partisanship. But we all are partisans in a partisan world. The task of our foreign Minister is to recognize that he is a partisan, and that his offices as Minister for External Affairs and as the  President  of the General Assembly of the United Nations have been completely irreconcilable. The office of umpire or judge and, at .the same time, leader of his own particular team are completely irreconcilable. If the Australian Government or the Australian people are able to produce a man who is so highly regarded as to bo elected  President  of the General Assembly of the United Nations, the honour conferred upon him i3 dearly bought. After the honour has been conferred upon him, he ceases to be able to take his place as a partisan. When our Minister for External Affairs was  President  of the General Assembly we were the only nation in the world without a leader. We should not be leaderless in this sphere in days when bitter, acrimonious and partisan argument has never been more acute in international affairs. That was our lot during a vital year when we, of all the nations of the world, were denied a representative to state our case, because the  President  of the General Assembly is like a judge or an umpire and cannot state a case for a litigant or for one of the teams. A judge must hold the scales of justice evenly between the contending parties. The Minister for External Affairs had to hold the scales of justice at the General Assembly of the United Nations, and sometimes it was his lot to hold the scales when they were tipped against the interests of the English-speaking peoples. I do not wish to be misunderstood on this matter. I am proud that an Australian has been chosen to fill such a high office, but I hope that never again will a Minister for External Affairs accept such an office. If, in the future, an Australian Minister for External Affairs is offered such a post, he should vacate his office as Minister and allow his place to be taken by another person who is not inhibited by his obligations to disregard the partisan spirit. I am sure that the Minister for External Affairs does not misunderstand the point which I am endeavouring to make. Australia should be represented at the General Assembly of the United Nations by a Minister for External Affairs who can state a case for his nation, and fight for it in a manner which has not .been possible in the past, because of conflicting loyalties on the part of our representative. The Minister for External Affairs, whoever he may be, is our frontline advocate in conferences that discuss measures for the avoidance of war, and for formulating plans against the possibility of war. He cannot satisfactorily, occupy two offices at the same time. I refer to the office of spokesman for his country, and to the office of an objective and impartial judge. I regard that as an important matter. </para>
          <para>What should be the policy of the Australian nation. I certainly shall not attempt to cover in detail at the present time what I consider the policy of the Australian nation ought to be, but the Opposition parties say collectively and unanimously that the broad course of our policy is clear. It is to maintain a complete and unbroken alinement of all the elements of the British Commonwealth. This should not be done in the expectation of getting our own way on every occasion, and we certainly should not pursue any course either through theoretical or selfish national and personal motives that will weaken the alinement of the whole of the British people. That is the first and simple objective of Australia&#39;s foreign policy. The second simple and recognizable point of our foreign policy is to lend the whole of our weight of influence towards welding all the elements of the British Commonwealth with the rest of the English-speaking world, including our great cousin, the United States of America. Unless that unity is achieved, there is no hope for us in this kind of world. When that objective has been achieved, we should try to weld the English-speaking elements with those who see democracy with the same eyes as we see it. In the world to-day, there is a <inline font-style="italic">Hoc</inline> of satellites circulating around one tremendously powerful nation which preaches the gospel of democracy but does not practise any principle of it.  We must ensure that we shall not drift into a position of weakness <inline font-style="italic">vis-a-vis</inline> that great <inline font-style="italic">bloc.</inline></para>
          <para>The Minister for External Affairs and members of the Opposition have referred at various times to the territories of the Commonwealth. It is true, as has been stated, that the territory of New Guinea was held under mandate, not because we desired to administer it in that way, but because the League of Nations  would not award it to us under any other conditions. Australia held New Guinea under the mandate system until the League of Nations dissolved after the outbreak of World War II. New Guinea is geographically our frontline of defence, and with the disappearance of the League of Nations it came into the possession of this country. It cannot be denied that Australia has given away New Guinea under the trusteeship system. The Minister for External Affairs can rightly claim to be the principal author of the doctrine of trusteeship at the San Francisco conference. That doctrine was not well received by the representatives of the United Kingdom. Indeed, they resisted the doctrine, and, in doing so, they had the support of the representatives of the United States of America. However, the doctrine of trusteeship and all the arguments in favour of self-determination and the like can be wrapped up in such plausible language that they become almost irresistible. The Australian Minister for External Affairs, as the principal spokesman for that doctrine, was immediately supported by the delegates of Soviet Russia and of all the little countries of the world which have not played a part of deciding national destiny but which were invited to the party at San Francisco. </para>

              <para>- I recollect clearly that the American State Department and the United Kingdom Government resisted those proposals. Be that  a3  it may, the position to-day is that the Australian Government defends the&#39; principle of trusteeship for the territory of New Guinea in the interests of the advancement and security of the native population. Last night, the Prime Minister said that the people of the United Kingdom were the same to-day as they were in 1939. May I express the opinion that members of the Labour party in this chamber to-day hold the same views as members of the Labour party held in 1939? What was the attitude of the Labour party ten years ago to the defence of the Mandated Territory of New Guinea? When the Menzies Government introduced legislation to extend the provisions of the Defence Act to New Guinea, every member of the Labour party voted against it. They desired that the mandated territory should be left without defences. The Minister for External Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward),</inline> speaking either on that bill or on the defence Estimates in 1939, said, in effect, &#34;Let those who want to defend New Guinea go there and defend it themselves &#34;. That gentleman is now entrusted with supervising the welfare of the backward peoples of the trusteeship territories that are administered by Australia. He had nothing to say in their favour in 1938-39, but to-day he holds the banner high aloft, or so he says. The scene has changed. We cannot put back the hands of the clock. Trusteeship is an actuality in the Charter of the United Nations. I hope .that the Australian Government will realize that we cannot go along in the certainty that Australia will never again be involved in war, and that Australians will not have to fight again in New Guinea, where their fathers or brothers He in their thousands as the victims of the last war. I hope that this Government will start to take a more realistic view in relation to the defence of New Guinea, as the Government of the United States of America has from the outset taken a more realistic view in regard to the strategic importance df some of the islands which that country holds under trusteeship.  I  shall say no more on that aspect,  but will hearken back to the principal motif of my speech, which is that one cannot be both a player and an umpire. This country cannot afford to be without a spokesman in the councils of the world to-day. We have been without a spokesman for a year, due to the high honour that was conferred upon our Minister for External Affairs. I argue most strongly that if ever again an Australian Minister is so honoured he should vacate his office as Minister for External Affairs during the time that he holds such a high position, and thus allow us to have a spokesman in the councils of the nations, as has every other country in the world. 3Hr. BURKE (Perth) &#91;10.26&#93;.- The honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen)</inline> has made a thoughtful and useful contribution to the debate. If the speech that he has just delivered represents Opposition policy there is very little difference of opinion between the Government and the Opposition on the vital question of foreign policy. I think that the Leader of the Liberal party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> has from time to time expressed sentiments similar to those that have been expressed by the honorable member for Indi. The utterances of other prominent members of Opposition parties, however, give us reason to doubt whether they give such unwavering support to the agencies that have been established to prevent war in the future. We all know that in time of war, or threatened war, such agencies may break down. As the honorable member for Indi has truly said, he puts his faith fully in the United Nations organization as one of the few organizations from which peace might ultimately be derived. That is a faith and a hope that each of us who supports the United Nations puts in that organization. The honorable member said that the Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> altered the tone of this debate so that there could be a full discussion on foreign affairs. That is not so. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony)</inline> made a definite attack on the United Nations as an organization. He indicated quite clearly, that he was completely without faith in the United Nations though he denied this later by interjection. The honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> also expressed lack of faith in the United Nations. Each of us could preach that gospel of despair. It is highly probable that we would be right if we said to-day that the United Nations will fail. As the honorable member for Indi has said, we must hope that it will not fail when a future crisis comes, as it surely will come. One of the major reasons why these organizations fail is that the nations of the world are not yet willing to sink their immediate national interests and sovereignty in order to give international organizations some real power by which to preserve peace in the world. The honorable member for Richmond also made sneering references to the high honour that had fallen to the Minister for External Affairs. In order to high-light his view of that honour, which the honorable member for Indi acknowledges, he cited all of the nations - all small nations - whose representatives have been honoured in this way. He implied that the representatives of small nations were chosen for this honour, without regard for the ability of their representatives, probably because they were the only ones who would accept the honour. That is wholly false. It ought to be accepted that any nation, no matter how small, may make a useful contribution to the world&#39;s discussions, and may, as we did, produce a man who could with dignity and good results fulfil the very high positions to which he was appointed. </para>
          <para>The honorable member for Indi stated a quite false analogy when he set out the principal object of his speech, to prove that the Minister for External Affairs, as  president  of the General Assembly of the United Nations, could and should be likened to a judge or umpire, because he was called upon to lay down or interpret rUles, and to give judgment on legal points placed before him. I think that the honorable member has misunderstood the nature of this position, at leastas it appears to him. Instead of being in the position of a judge or umpire, it appears to me that the  president  of the General Assembly of the United Nations plays a vital role as a leader in the councils of the world. He does not judge the issues or interpret the rules, hut gives a lead to a team of men and women who are seeking earnestly to spare the world the horrors of future war. The representative that Australia sent to the General Assembly last year was elected  president  of that body. In that position he played a vital role, and gave the lead in all of the United Nations discussions. He gave aid and assistance, and the benefit of his wide organizational knowledge, as well as diplomatic energy and sense, to the representatives of nations that were striving earnestly to preserve the peace of the world. I do not think that the argument of the honorable member for Indi that Australia was deprived of a spokesman can be sustained. Rather do I think, as I have already said, that we have had our spokesman in the most vital role to which he could be elected. Apart from that there is little in the arguments advanced by the honorable member for Indi with which one could quarrel. </para>
          <para>The item of the Estimates which is now being debated deals with the total work of the Department of External Affairs. The United Nations is only one of the variety of organizations in which the department is interested. The General Assembly and the Security Council are vital parts of this new world organization which seeks to find a formula for continued peace. I believe that the specialized organizations to which Australia subscribes play a vital role. The failure of the League of Nations was due in part to its failure to establish such specialized organizations. There were other reasons, however, which were associated with nations that were jealous of their sovereignty. The failure to establish specialized organizations dealing with finance, trade and commerce, and a host of other problems, was one of the major reasons why the League failed. That fault the present organization has sought to correct. Australia has diplomatic representatives in various parts of the world. These diplomatic posts are, as the honorable member for Indi pointed out, agencies for peace. They perform three functions - to stimulate and ex pand international trade, to improve friendly relations with other countries and to promote peace. Therefore, there is no reason why the Government should be criticized for establishing diplomatic posts overseas. Rather should it be commended for so doing. In addition to relying on the United Nations, to which we have given our full and unwavering support, we seek to maintain good relations with the United States of America and the United Kingdom. That has been Australia&#39;s traditional policy, and it is our policy today. The British Commonwealth, by whatever name it may be called, has always been a major force for peace. It can still play an important part in the world. The United States of America is a bastion of peace and liberty. It could well stand alone. It is the strongest, richest and the most highly industrialized nation in the world, but it has given full support to the United Nations. That ought to be sufficient answer to those carping critics who say that no reliance can be placed on the United Nations. Great Britain, with colonies and territories all over the world, has also, under Conservative and Labour governments alike, supported the United Nations. Yet we are told by some honorable members opposite that we should not be associated with that organization and that because similar organizations failed in the past, we should have nothing to do with the United Nations. The fact is that every country, great or small, that gives its support to the United Nations is seeking to preserve world peace, and to prevent the suffering and horror associated with modern war. </para>
          <para>The honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> discussed the work of the United Nations, and claimed that it had failed in every issue to which it had addressed itself. The reverse is the truth. It has succeeded in almost everything it has attempted to do. Most of the issues to which he referred were specifically excluded from the activities of the United Nations. For instance, the making of peace with Germany and Japan was specifically excluded in that way. It was to be left to the Great Powers to work out peace formulas, and only after that was done was the United </para>
          <para class="block">Nations to take up its task. In some instances, work which had at first been specifically withheld from the United Nations, had to be handed over to it. All the problems dealt with by the United Nations have not yet been solved, and some may not be solved for a considerable time. </para>
          <para>The honorable member for Indi made a valuable contribution to the debate. He has given almost unqualified support to the United Nations, and to the work of our own Department of External Affairs. I do not believe that we can spread our representation too widely throughout the world. Such representa-. tion should be the means of our getting to know other nations better, and of allowing other nations to know us better. We need to promote trade and good relations with other countries. It is proposed to expend just over &#163;1,000,000 on the work of the Department of External Affairs, and I believe that the expenditure of even more would be justified. The Government has no case to answer. Its foreign policy has been wise, and the Minister for External Affairs should be commended for his work, and urged to continue it. </para>

            <para>.- I notice that whenever we embark on a discussion on external affairs, the Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt),</inline> when he is here, which is not very often, rather cunningly seeks to turn the discussion into one on the United Nations. It seems that the United Nations is with him a ruling passion, strong in death. Everything else is subordinated to the United Nations. Let me point out that the first duty of the Minister is not to the United Nations, but to the people of Australia.  His  performances during the last few years have indicated that he is. in truth, an internationalist, and  noL, in  truth, a good Australian. I made a similar statement when he was in the House during a fleeting moment last year. He was annoyed at the remark, and said that it was not true,  but he had fled back to Lake Success  or  Timbuctoo or somewhere else before 1 could justify my statement. I shall endeavour to justify it now in. his presence. With the exception of the honorable member for Watson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Falstein)</inline> and the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Burke),</inline> honorable members who support the Government have been strangely silent about the Department of External Affairs. The honorable member for Perth was also completely obsessed by the United Nations. The committee is not discussing the United Nations. It is discussing the estimates for the Department of External Affairs, which amount to a little more than <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1,000,000,</inline> as the honorable member for Perth has airly put it. This amount of the taxpayers&#39; money is to be expended, at the behest of the Minister for External Affairs. I do not propose to discuss whether the United Nations is any good, whether it should occupy this place or that in the heirachy or whether it should be first in our scale of values, or last. I think that it falls somewhere in between. The United Nations certainly does not come first in my scale of values. </para>

          <para>The honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender)</inline> raised a very material matter when he moved an amendment that the proposed vote of the Department of External Affairs should be reduced by &#163;1. The honorable member took that action in order to draw the attention of the committee to a question that he asked on the 28th September, to which the Minister for External Affairs supplied a written answer a few days ago. The honorable member has already discussed the matter at some length, and I do not propose now to do more than to draw the attention of honorable members to the answer supplied by the Minister. <inline font-weight="bold">His</inline> answer was profoundly unsatisfactory, more so because the question related to a matter of such importance. Surely it was a serious matter if a high consular official in the course of his activities, used public funds without proper authorization. The honorable member for Warringah asked the Minister - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Has the Minister for External Affairs given any direction that members of the Australian diplomatic or consular corps shall have the right to draw upon government funds as personal loans to themselves? </para>
          </quote>
          <para>The Minister&#39;s reply to that question was -  . . no ministerial direction was given in relation to the advance, the matter being dealt with administratively between the department, the Treasury and of the officer concerned. . . . </para>
          <para class="block">Apparently the Minister intended to convey the impression that the officer concerned did not have authority to draw upon the funds at his office. The next question the honorable member asked was - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Is it known to the Treasury and to the secretary of the Department of External Affairs that a certain high consular official in New York who is now about to &#39; go elsewhere, arranged, between the 30th December, 1940, and the 1 1 th April, 1 947, for advances to himself totalling 10,500 dollars without any authority from Australia to do so? </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Minister replied -  . . I have made inquiries and have ascertained that the officer referred to did obtain certain advances in 1947. The advance was made necessary as a result of accommodation commitments. . . . </para>
          <para>There is not a single word in that reply to suggest that there was any authority whatever for the officer to obtain the funds. Was his action authorized <inline font-style="italic">ex post</inline><inline font-style="italic">facto?</inline> If so, why was not the Parliament informed of the fact? Reading between the lines of the evasive answer furnished by the Minister, I suspect that when some one had discovered that the officer concerned had got the money, the Government sought to hush the matter up by approving retrospectively of the officer&#39;s action. But why was the Minister not frank with the House concerning the circumstances of the transaction? The honorable member also asked the following question : - </para>
          <quote>
            <para class="block">Is it a fact that, in order to have those advances made to himself, the official to whom  I have referred issued certain instructions to the finance section of the Australian ConsulateGeneral in New York to make out vouchers payable to him, seven of which were in the amount of 1,000 dollars, one in the amount of 2,000 dollars and one in the amount of 1,500 dollars V </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Again, the Minister failed to deal with the question. In fact, he did not answer the question at all, and we have not been told whether the officer concerned did give instructions to his own finance section in New York to make advances to him. We ought to be told whether he did so or not. It is highly important to know whether a consular officer, whoever ho may be, issued instructions to his subordinates to advance money to him. It does not matter whether or not his irregular action was subsequently ratified. Even if such  conducwere  approved <inline font-style="italic">ex post facto,</inline> we ought to be told how the officer concerned came to get the money. The honorable member also made the following inquiry : - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Is it also a fact that in March of this year &#171; sum of 8,500 dollars in advances to this official was still outstanding? </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">In reply to that question, the Minister stated that the amount involved was now only 4,000 dollars. Then he was asked whether the facts were known to the Department of External Affairs and to the Treasury. The Minister replied to the effect that they were known to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dunk.</inline> There is a cloud of doubt even now around the Ministers or senior officials to whom details of the transaction were known. I am still not clear whether the Minister, the Secretary of the department, the  Chairman  of the  Public Service Board, or any one else, knew about it. The honorable member also asked - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Do those advances to a consular official constitute a .permissible use of government funds? </para>
          </quote>
          <para>That question has not been answered. The Minister has not expressed any -view about whether the advances constituted a permissible use of government funds. Every honorable member of the committee must be driven to the conclusion that the .transaction was not a permissible use of public funds. Finally, the Minister was asked whether he was prepared to lay the  file on the table of the House, but he did not reply to that portion of the question. </para>
          <para>It is clear, therefore, that the answers supplied by the Minister to the honorable member covered only part of the questions and that some aspects of the questions were not answered at all. In those circumstances, I submit that the honorable member for Warringah was amply justified in moving that the proposed vote of the department be reduced by fi. Are the public accounts to be dipped into by people in the manner suggested by the circumstances of this Case? If, and when, such irregularities Occur, are .they to be approved of subsequently by the Government? Is it permissible for a consular official to do such a thing as has been suggested? If a consular official is entitled to do such <inline font-style="italic">&#60;i</inline> thing, why should not any other officer of the Public Service be permitted to do likewise? In other words, is any official who finds himself short of money and who deems his allowances insufficient for his needs to be permitted to draw upon the public funds? Is a senior official to be permitted to instruct his subordinates to issue funds to him? I repeat that none of those questions have been replied to in the answer submitted by the Minister. The matter has been left in a shady and unsatisfactory state and the committee would be quite justified in voting for the amendment in order to show its disapproval of the Government&#39;s attitude. </para>
          <para>I turn now to Australia&#39;s participation in the trusteeship agreement in respect of New Guinea. A question was recently asked in the House about the matter, and a reply was furnished by the Minister. To my mind that reply was quite unsatisfactory. I have already expressed my views on this matter in the House in the absence of the Minister, and I now propose to repeat, them while he is present, so that he mayhave an opportunity to reply to my criticism. I say that when the Minister, at various international conferences, including that which was held at Dumbarton Oaks in 1945, agreed to place New Guinea under trusteeship to the United Nations he betrayed the vital interests of Australia. I make that statement without any equivocation whatever. I remind the committee that when World </para>
          <para class="block">War II. occurred Australia was holding New Guinea under mandate, as distinct from Papua, which was a British Crown colony administered by Australia, and part of Australia&#39;s territory. New Guinea was held by Australia as a C class mandate from the league of Nations. At the peace conference of 1919, the Australian representatives, in common with the British representatives, desired that Australia should annex the territory as being strategically vital to it. That was opposed by  President  Wilson, who favoured a different arrangement altogether. He was entirely opposed to annexation. He had alongside him many advisors with great experience in his own State Department who did not share his views. One of them was Byers, the chief of his colonial department, who favoured annexation of New Guinea by Australia. He said that a country so close to Australia was vital to it and should be absorbed by it. However, the Wilson view was against annexation. A compromise was reached under which New Guinea and German South-West Africa became 0 class mandates. Those territories were to be administered as integral parts of the mandatory countries. There is ample evidence in the documents, most of which I have taken the trouble to read that it was understood by all concerned that ultimately the administration of those territories would lead to their absorption. That was the position from 1919 to 1939. It is true that during that time we made reports to the League of Nations on our administration of New Guinea. Those reports did not receive the sort of reception that our reports have received since the the trusteeship arrangement of 1946. Under the mandate, it was clearly and widely understood that Australia&#39;s interest in New Guinea was vital and strategic, and our reports were accepted almost universally without criticism. The League of Nations folded up and died in 1939. When it died, the legal arrangement, if one may so describe it, under which we held the mandate for the administration of New Guinea died with it. Another factor emerged in 1942 when Japan invaded New Guinea. We had to fight for our life in New Guinea. </para>
          <para class="block">Australian lives were lost there to defend it. </para>
          <para>The view held in 1919 by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> M. Hughes, the Australian delegate, and by the British delegates was that New Guinea was essential to our safety, and this was amply demonstrated in 1942 when Australia was nearly overwhelmed. We had to fight for New Guinea. The blood of Australian manhood was shed there. A new situation altogether arose with the death of the League of Nations. At that moment, we ceased to be under any legal or moral obligation to regard New Guinea as a country to be held under any form of mandate or trusteeship. We had been administering it for the benefit of the natives as we had administered Papua for the benefit of the natives. Our administration of Papua was a model to the world. Every one knows of the wonderful work done by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Hubert</inline> Murray and others in Papua. We did the same thing in New Guinea proper. There was no reason to suppose that we should not go on doing it. So no argument can be based on the fact that we had an obligation to the natives. We observed that obligation. We did an extremely good job, and, when the war came, and the League of Nations collapsed and died, we were entitled to regard New Guinea as our country and to take possession of it and fortify it and exclude all other people on the ground of its being essential to our safety to the end of time. That is what the Prime Minister of our sister dominion South Africa did about German South-West Africa. South Africa held a similar mandate over German South-West Africa, and when the time came, the then Prime Minister of South Africa, Field-Marshal Smuts, declined, in one form of words or another, to accept the position that South-West Africa automatically came under the trusteeship of the United Nations. There has been argument ever since, but .the position has never been yielded. South Africa regards SouthWest Africa as strategically necessary to it. We have a much stronger case for the retenetion  of possession of New Guinea, because of its geographical situation in relation to that of Australia. The learned Minister for External Affairs tries to justify the dumping of New Guinea into the lap of the United Nations. I quote the words that he used in 1946, when he said - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The future of native races 13 the subject of legitimate international interest. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">But what about Papua? On that ground, why did he not take Papua along, too, and dump it into the lap of the United Nations for trusteeship? What about all the British Crown colonies? What about all our own aborigines if the future of native races is a proper subject of international interest ? Why does he not dump Australia itself into the lap of the United Nations for trusteeship? Let us see what really did happen between the Dumbarton Oaks conference and the United Nations conference in 1946, because the Minister for External Affairs has not been frank with honorable members. He suggested that the British Government had acquiesced in the arrangements, but that is not so, for it was presented by him with a <inline font-style="italic">fait accompli.</inline> After objections had been made, the original proposal was modified. The draft treaty prepared for the Dumbarton Oaks conference left a blank space under the headings indicating international mandates or trusteeships. That space was never filled, for the reason, as I interjected during the Minister&#39;s speech, that the Americans &#34; jacked up &#34;. They were not going to have this proposal, which was apparently inspired by the Minister, and some people associated with him, by which all native races and their countries came under trusteeship. As the result, the Carolines, the Marshalls and Ladrones came under strategic trusteeship. The Americans said that they would take them over under that arrangement. That was done. To put the  case  at its lowest level that could have been done about New Guinea. Then we could not only have fortified New Guinea but could also have excluded other people from it, whereas under the trusteeship we cannot exclude other people as all honorable members well know. However, the ideas of the American State Department did lean towards an increased international control over colonies, including, by the way, British colonies. The Americans did not have many colonies, so some members of the </para>
          <para class="block">State Department thought it would be a good idea to have increased international control over colonies. The State Department&#39;s views were not accepted by the American service departments, on the ground of American security. Those departments insisted that either the United States should annex the former Japanese mandated territories of the Carolines, the Marshalls and the Ladrones or at least that they should be available as &#34; floating aircraft carriers &#34;. The service departments held that at the very least American control of those islands should take the form of a strategic trusteeship, and that was what ultimately happened. I remind the committee that in the meantime a .treaty was concluded by Australia and New Zealand which referred to trusteeships in the Pacific. As the result of that treaty a declaration was issued early in 1945 by the Australian Minister for External Affairs and the New Zealand Prime Minister, the effect of which was to give approval to the trusteeship principle with international supervision by countries that were members of the Trusteeship Council. I also remind the committee that that declaration was intended to cover the British colonial mandates as well as the Australian and New Zealand mandates. To say the least it did not obtain the approval of the British Government. Shortly after that a conference of the Prime Ministers of the British Commonwealth was held. </para>

We have never been told the full story in the Parliament before. We have had to fossick it out for ourselves. Now we have been told that the British Government has agreed to this, that and the other, but that is not true. The original proposal for a ten era 1 colonial trusteeship was not adopted by the British Government. Yet step by step the territory of New Guinea was brought into a position where is was handed over to the United Nations and we are now obliged to make reports each year to the United Nations on our administration. We have been obliged to submit ourselves to the humiliation of being criticized, on one occasion by the Chinese, on another occasion by the Patagonians  or somebody and on still another occasion by some other nation, in respect of our administration of that territory which is so essential to our security. </para>

We are no longer masters in our own house. I believe that we should have taken the territory over and made it ours when we could have done so in 1939, just as the present right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> wanted to do in 1919 when he was Prime Minister. We should certainly have taken it over in 1939 or 1940 when we had the legal and moral opportunity to do so after the League of Nations had collapsed and we had to defend it by force of our own arms. Our plain duty then was not to hand it over to the United Nations but to make it our own territory. One person to whom I mentioned my view on this particular matter said, &#34; But that is an annexation ! &#34; I describe it only a., claiming a country that is geographically, strategically and on every other basis, essential to Australia. Anyhow at the very least we should have followed the American lead, because the arrangement that the United States made in relation to the former Japanese mandates let it open for other members of the United Nations to adopt the same policy. Instead, however, we adopted this incredibly unwise proposal to hand  over New </para>

            <para>. - The honorable member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beale),</inline> has referred to New Guinea. In many respects he has been completely inaccurate. He has been most dogmatic about this matter. First of all be stated that by accepting trusteeship over the former Mandated Territory of New Guinea we had betrayed the interests of Australia. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member states that it was debated a few months ago during my absence. I take it that that would be in 1949, when the Papua and New Guinea Bill was introduced. I do not desire to take up unnecessary time over this matter, but I consider that the inaccuracies of the honorable member for Parramatta should be placed on record. In rebuttal of those inaccuracies I refer the committee to the statement made by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> on New Guinea trusteeship to this House on the 7th August, 1946, long before the arrangements for the trusteeship were made. The facts in relation to the San Francisco conference at which the United Nations Charter was drawn up, are quite clear. I stated them earlier to the committee, but was contradicted quite wrongly by one honorable member. I said that the trusteeship system agreed upon at San &#34;Francisco was worked out in detail by the representatives, not only of Australia, but also of the United States of America and the United Kingdom. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard)</inline> attended that conference as one of the Australian delegates, and so did the honorable member for. Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen),</inline> but he has apparently forgotten all about it. </para>

              <para>- I am speaking of the United States representative at the San Francisco conference. Now we have another interjection by the honorable member for Parramatta to the effect that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Stettinius  was one of the delegates at San Francisco and was actually responsible for the form of the trusteeship agreement. I cannot believe that the honorable member has even the sigh test basis for such an assertion. These things are part of the work that was going on then. The honorable member for Parramatta has referred to Dumbarton Oaks. Australia was not represented at Dumbarton Oaks. The honorable member has referred to it six times as though we were represented there, but that was simply a conference of great powers. It was a conference at Washington of representatives of the United States of America, the United Kingdom, Russia and China simply for the purpose of preparing a draft for San Francisco. It acted as n drafting committee. The Dumbarton Oaks proposals were submitted to a conference of 50 nations at San Francisco. Trusteeship was of great importance. What was to happen about the mandated territories? The honorable member, dogmatizing as he so often does on dimcult questions of international law, said that the mandate system had come to an end. That was the question. Had it come to an end? </para>

              <para>- There is not the slightest foundation for saying that the outbreak of war brought that system to an end. Such a doctrine was never accepted by any international lawyer.

          <para>I repeat, and the records of the San Francisco conference establish beyond doubt, that the main paper, the working paper of the trusteeship committee, was  Stassen&#39;s  paper presented on behalf of the United States delegation. That was a broad outline of the trusteeship system as it applies to New Guinea to-day. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Strassen  was the leader of the committee. As the proposals were put forward, he would speak as the leader of the house. The United States was active in support of the trusteeship system, and the United Kingdom delegate played an almost equally prominent part in the elaboration of it. It is perfectly true, as the honorable member for Parramatta says, that Australia and New Zealand favoured the system. But then we had not just a few countries imposing a trusteeship system. We had the United States of America, the United Kingdom, and Australia and New Zealand in favour of it. The working paper was, in substance, adopted with some modification. </para>

          <para class="block">Therefore, the arrangement did not contemplate any weakening of Australia&#39;s defences. It was the mandatory terms which limited defence in New Guinea. The mandate prevented the erection of fortifications in the territory and granted a very limited right of defence. However, under the trusteeship system, Australia is entitled to defend the integrity of New Guinea to the same extent as though it were Australia itself. Therefore, the assertion of the honorable member for Parramatta is completely erroneous. He has been misled by some statement. From the defence and security point of view, the trusteeship system gives Australia ample protection and ample security. The other question referred to was the welfare of the native peoples. Protection of the natives&#39; rights was binding under the old mandate system. It is also binding under this system. </para>
          <para>The only other matter that I want to mention is the speech that was made by the honorable member for Indi, who, I agree with the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Burke),</inline> made a contribution to the debate on a level worthy of a proper statement on foreign affairs. The honorable member was critical of one or two aspects of policy. I think that I can answer him very shortly. In my statement to-night I did not attempt to traverse the whole field of international affairs. I merely followed up some observations that had been made by the honorable member for Flinders&#39; <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> with regard to our policy in regard to certain countries in which we have established embassies and legations. The United Nations had to be discussed because one of the largest of the proposed votes covers our contribution to the United Nations. I did not pretend to deal with our relationship with every other country. The honorable member for Indi has referred to our relationship with the British Commonwealth. I entirely agree with his remarks. Our relationship with the British Commonwealth goes hand in hand with our friendship for the United States of America and our unwavering support of the United Nations. There is no question of priority ; these things dovetail together because it is the policy of the United States of America to support the United Nations and also the British Commonwealth. The honorable member for Parramatta asked which we place first, second or third. I remind him that there may be occasions when a choice has to be made, especially in relation to questions involving peace or war. As the honorable member for &#34;Warringah has freely admitted, our relationship with the British Commonwealth is very intimate. Honorable members opposite will see the danger of arguments which tend to draw a distinction between the British Government and the British people. Britain remains the same to Australians whether Britain be governed by a Conservative or a Labour Government. Our relations with the present Government of the United Kingdom, intimate as they are, are the same as were our relations with the coalition government led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Churchill.</inline> These things go hand in hand. They are not contradictory. I agree with the honorable member for Indi that we cannot rely on the United Nations and forget everything else. It is not fair for honorable members opposite to say that I am not carrying out my duties to Australia. I do not think that honorable members opposite really believe that I have not carried out a policy which is in the best interests of Australia. The honorable member for Indi made the astonishing suggestion that if an Australian Minister for External Affairs is ever again elected as  President  of the </para>
          <para class="block">General Assembly of the United Nations he should immediately resign his portfolio. I point out that if he did so, he would no longer lead the Australian delegation. The  President  of the General Assembly is always selected from the leaders of the delegations from the different countries. As everybody knows, the first  President  was the Belgium Foreign Minister, M. Spaak. When I was at Lake Success I had the benefit of the advice of the Australian ambassador to the United States of America, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Makin,</inline> and of the other Australian delegates. During my term of office as  President  of the General Assembly they did not cease to put the Australian case, in regard to Nauru and New Guinea; indeed they fought very hard for it. It is not criticism that hurts the Australian case in relation to New Guinea. The mere fact that the representatives of a few great or minor nations criticize Australia does not hurt us. The General Assembly is a place where there is criticism of one country after another. The fact that we have criticism of the Government in this Parliament does not constitute an argument against the parliamentary system of government. On the contrary, it is an argument in favour of the continuation of that system of government. Let alleged defects be pointed out. If they are proved to be true, they will be corrected. In all our activities in the United Nations we fulfil our duty to the Australian people and to this Parliament. There is no conflict between our obligations to the United Nations and our duty to safeguard the defence of Australia. I was amazed to hear the honorable member for Parramatta speak of the betrayal of Australia. Not one honorable member who was in this Parliament during the war against Japan can accuse this Government of ever having betrayed this country. We took care that the trusteeship agreement would leave us completely free to administer New Guinea as we thought fit. </para>

            <para>- The majority of the nations, including Great Britain, Canada and New Zealand, decided that we would keep up the spirit of the mandate system. Had we said after the war, which, among other things, was supposed to have been fought for the improvement of the status of dependent peoples, &#34;We shall not be bound by the restrictions of the mandate any longer ; we believe in simple accession of our mandated territories&#34;, we would have dealt a blow to international cooperation. The mandate system did not hurt us except that it prevented us from establishing defences in mandated territories. Under the trusteeship system we are free to establish defences in territories under our trusteeship.

            <para>. - I was interested to hear what the Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> had to say on the third occasion on which he has spoken on thi9 subject to-day. The right honorable gentleman &#34; protesteth .too much, methinks &#34;. Some of his statements will hear Very close investigation. In that idealistic way which he has, he spoke without knowledge or cognizance of the hard practical facts that face this country. We have already experienced the effects of his idealistic compromise with regard to mandates. Before I give that subject its proper colouring, let me have something to 6ay with regard to the United Nations. I take the same attitude towards the United Nations as I took to the League of Nations. I believe that if the League of Nations had not been brought into existence after World War I. the nations would have had to establish some other similar body. I believe that some organization such as the United Nations is necessary to preserve our hope for the future. Every honorable member on this side of the chamber will, I am sure, subscribe to that view. If we abandon our ideals and the hope of achieving something better than a world constantly ravaged by warfare, the outlook for the future will be black indeed. The Minister for External Affairs is prepared to sacrifice Australia on the altar of the United Nations in order to attempt to achieve within the short space of a decade an objective  that will take us centuries to achieve. He does not hesitate to sacrifice his country on that altar if he feels that by so doing he can contribute something towards the achievement of the objective of the United Nations. Let me develop that argument because I believe that I should do so. The right honorable gentleman has said that we have gained something by placing New Guinea under the trusteeship of the United Nations. I agree with him that we have done so on paper by comparison with what we formerly had under the old &#34; C &#34; mandate of the League of Nations. As a former Minister for External Territories for a brief period, 1 know something of the difficulties that confronted Australia on the eve of the war as the result of its inability to fortify the Mandated Territory of New Guinea. We were well aware that Japan had defied the League of Nations and had fortified its mandated territories as best it could. Although it deliberately violated its mandate the League of Nations was absolutely powerless to force its will upon so great a belligerent nation. But Australia, which was prepared to honour its obligations, was made the scapegoat on that occasion because of our own foolishness. What led up to that position? It is perfectly true that if we had not accepted the mandate in respect of New Guinea, those who failed to appreciate the significance of that territory because of its proximity to Australia might very well have left it wide open to Japanese migration. That mandate gave certain powers to Australia, but denied us the right, even though we were administering that territory, to fortify it, and therein lay the great weakness of that mandate. Unfortunately, we have not yet learned to the full, even by the expenditure of Australian blood, just what it may mean to take full control of an outpost for our protection against aggression in the future. We failed to obtain the necessary safeguards under the old &#34; C &#34; mandate. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It is true that to-day we have, on paper, the right to fortify that territory, to establish naval and air bases there and to send troops into New Guinea, but, side by side with that provision, it is equally true that members of the Trusteeship Council, even those who may be opposed to us in political ideology and ideals, or even opposed to us physically, or who may wish to witness our destruction, have the right to go to New Guinea, and examine the territory and the circumstances associated with our mandate. In view of modern methods of espionage, can we not realize that a nation that has that right as a member of the Trusteeship Council could easily find ways and means of obtaining the information it might require with respect to the defences of that territory? Of course, we have, on paper, the right to do the things that I mentioned, but from a practical point of view, the trusteeship is a very weak thing and something that we should not rely upon. The United States of America was fully concerned with that aspect. That country would not agree to place the Carolines, the Marshalls or the Ladrones under a trusteeship similar to the one we now hold in respect of New Guinea. The United States of America insisted upon being granted a strategic trusteeship in relation to the islands I have mentioned, and under that class of trusteeship the representatives of any nation that it does not wish to admit to those territories can be refused admission to them. In that respect the United States of. America has adopted a. realistic attitude. It has not been prepared to sacrifice its interests on the altar of the United Nations organization. But the Minister for External Affairs is prepared to sacrifice Australia&#39;s interests in that way. He did a great disservice to this country when he did not insist that Australia should be given a strategic trusteeship in respect of New Guinea. </para>
          <para>I believe that the ideal of the United Nations is something that will be realized ultimately, but not immediately or even within a few decades. I believe that many world cataclysms will occur before that ideal can be attained. It must be worked for step by step. I am aware of the attitude of the Minister on this matter.  His  attitude has some virtue in that he is aiming to attain that ideal, and I do not wish to discredit him on that score. He has the right ideal, but in striving to attain it he has no right to sacrifice the interests of his own country or those of the people of any other country. In his approach to problems affecting Greece and other members of the </para>
          <para class="block">United Nations, he has sought to interfere on the basis that the interests of the nations concerned must be sacrificed on the altar of the United Nations. This is not an age when he can in that way demand sacrifices for ideals; this is not an age when he as Minister for External Affairs can afford to sacrifice Australia&#39;s interests for that ideal. He must take the realistic view, as Russia, the United States of America and each of the countries that can exercise the veto in the United Nations have done, namely, that they must first protect the interests of their own countries and then do all in their power towards the attainment of the ideal of the United Nations. However, in the immediate future, we must at all costs protect the security of this nation. Although the Minister can be commended for his idealistic approach to this matter he must realize that he must first do for his own country what other countries will first do in their own interests, and that is to ensure the protection and preservation of the Australian people, whom he claims to represent. </para>

            <para>.- The committee is discussing the estimates in respect of the Department of .External Affairs. The honorable member for Watson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Falstein)</inline> said that no honorable member criticized the proposed voteHe worked out the cost to his own satisfaction and calculated that it amounted to only a few shillings <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> of the population. I say definitely that both the proposed expenditure and the policy of the Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> are being discussed. Within the last half-hour the debate has centred on the Minister&#39;s action in allowing the New Guinea mandate to go to the Trusteeship Council. We know the reasons and the ideals that guided him <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> that matter. But he has let Australia down. Had Australia adopted a similar attitude in the League of Nations in 1919&#39; towards the administration of the New Guinea mandate, we should not have been able to make of New Guinea a bastion against the Japanese in World War II. with the result that the Japanese would quickly have advanced to the Australian mainland. The Minister, apparently, was persuaded by the- representatives of other nations that the present trusteeship was a good thing and should be accepted. It is natural that influences of that kind should be exerted in the councils of the nations, upon the representatives of individual nations ; but he must remember his own loyalties first. Iri spite of his ability he has forgotten that his first loyalty is to Australia, his second loyalty is to the British Empire and his third loyalty is to the nations of the <inline font-style="italic">world</inline> as a whole. Let us work gradually towards the attainment of the last-named ideal but, at the same time, do not let us sacrifice our own vital interests. The United States of America may have supported the idea that the New Guinea mandate should go to the Trusteeship Council, but that country did not follow that course when it sought to protect the Marshalls, Carolines and other islands which it captured from the Japanese. In its own case, the United States of America insisted upon being granted a strategic trusteeship under which it has the right to prevent inspections of the territories concerned from being made by any other nation. We know that Russia has refused to agree to any plan for the inspection of resources for the production of the atomic bomb. Russia advocates the complete abolition of the atomic bomb; but it will not agree to any system of inspection. Yet we have agreed to a proposal that the Russians themselves have refused to accept. Our defences in New Guinea will be open to inspection by the representatives of other nations, including Russia, which has shown an extraordinary interest in the administration of our trusteeships. At meetings of the United Nations at Lake Success, the Russian representatives have criticized our administration. The Minister for External Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> rules the rich and fertile territory of New Guinea in a manner that is more in keeping with that of a tyrannical colonial governor or dictator than anything else one can imagine. He has been obliged to send his departmental officers post-haste to Lake Success to answer some of the questions that the Russians and others have asked about our administration of the trusteeships. Although we have the privilege of defending that territory, our defences are open to inspection by the representatives of other countries. Incidentally, I should also like to be given some information about the kind of defence works that have been undertaken in our territories. But we should not allow this &#34; snooping &#34; by Russia. The position is bad enough when Australian Communists sabotage our defence programme, but it is worse when the representatives of the power that threatens to uncivilize  the world with its barbarous creed is able to inspect our defences. I regard that position as infamous, and the Minister for External Affairs must take the responsibility for it. Whatever his minions may have said, he advised the adoption of that policy. If, unhappily, war should occur, he alone will be responsible for the lack of secrecy in relation to cur defences in the trusteeship territories. I make that statement now because honorable members opposite frequently refer to Australia&#39;s unpreparedness for war in 1939. I recall that the Minister for External Territories expressed the opinion in that year that those people who considered that New Guinea should be defended should go there and defend it themselves. I point out that Australia had more squadrons in the field in 1941 than the Royal Australian Air Force possesses to-day. </para>

              <para>- I shall do so. If, unhappily, Australia is again plunged into war, the guilty men will be the members of this Government, and the most guilty man will be the Minister for External Affairs, who has allowed Australia&#39;s front line of defence to be open to inspection by the representatives of other nations, including those of a potential enemy. This is the last occasion before the general election that honorable members will have an opportunity to discuss the estimates for the Department of External Affairs. Perhaps the Minister for External Affairs feels that some of the criticisms that have been voiced in thi3 debate have been rather sharp and even barbed, but he must be able to &#34; take it &#34;. He &#39;has been away in other fields, where he has received, very properly, a good deal of laudation and praise for th-3 work that he has done in that sphere, but we are entitled to disagree strongly with his policy, and I definitely believe that the right honorable gentleman has made a colossal mistake. The Territory of New Guinea is in close proximity to a continent where one-half of the people of the world live. Expressed in another way, New Guinea is only two days&#39; flight from 1,000,000,000 people, or one-half of the number of people on the face of the globe. Australia is an outpost for the white race, almost adjacent to the teeming millions of Asia, and yet the Minister for External Affairs, who is chasing an international ideal, throws away a valuable and realistic defence outpost. That is a cardinal error. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>In my opinion, the Department of External Affairs is due for reorganization. The right honorable gentleman has dotted embassies, legations and consulates throughout the world like so many post offices. That policy deceives no one. Does the right honorable gentleman believe that the establishment of those embassies, legations and consulates gives Australia enhanced status among leading nations of the world? In the past, the United Kingdom provided those services for us, without expense. I note that Australia has legations in Brazil and in Chile, and that the estimated expenditure on those establishments this year exceeds the vote last year. I calculate that the expenditure on those two legations this year will amount to 42,000 dollars. Earlier, the Minister for External Affairs stated that the payment for one of those two legations was made in sterling. How was that possible? I agree that 42,000 dollars is not a large sum, but I contend that the expenditure on those two legations is unnecessary. We buy scarcely a bag of nuts from Brazil, and our contacts with that nation are remote indeed. However, the establishment of a legation in that country may be helping to enhance the prestige of the Minister for External Affairs. I do not desire to attribute dubious motives to him, but he has most expensive ideas in the international sphere. What justification is there for having legations in Brazil and Chile? They should have been abolished long ago. In respect of the legation in Brazil provision is .made for a Minister, a first secretary and a third secretary. Australia is incurring that expenditure at a time when it is desperately short of dollars. If the Commonwealth could increase its petrol imports by 10 per cent., the necessity for rationing would be averted. I realize that I am not in order in discussing petrol rationing when the committee is considering the Estimates for the Department of External Affairs, but the Government should seize every opportunity to reduce the expenditure of dollars. </para>

              <para>- Because of the shortage of dollars,&#39; the primary producer, the businessman and industry generally will have to submit to a severe form of petrol rationing, and I am pointing out that, in my opinion, Australia could save dollars by abolishing unnecessary legation in South America. Unfortunately, the Minister is able to go gaily on his way. If, unhappily for Australia, the Labour party is returned to office at the forthcoming general election and the honorable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beazley)</inline> is defeated, the right honorable gentleman may find a position for him in a legation in Patagonia or Kamschatka,  with a staff consisting of a first secretary and a .third secretary, provided the legation is similar to our legations in Chile and Brazil. Perhaps the Minister will be able to arrange for the honorable member to have a second secretary as well. Among the politically slain at the last election was the Minister for Repatriation, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Frost,</inline> who was appointed to the office of Trade Commissioner in Ceylon. Probably that gentleman had not previously seen Ceylon on the map. The former member for Calare, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Breen,</inline> was whisked off to the Middle East, but he returned to Australia shortly afterwards and became secretary to the Minister . for External Territories. The former Minister for the Army, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Forde,</inline> was appointed High Commissioner to Canada, a highly lucrative post. The former Minister for the Navy, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Makin,</inline> was appointed Australian Minister to Washington. That is one method of providing full employment in the political service. But why should the Australian taxpayers have to foot the bill? The Minister for External Affairs, who has this retinue, does not bear the cost. The unfortunate taxpayer meets the expenses, although taxes have been increased by 550 per cent, since 1939 and the national income has not risen proportionately. </para>

          <para class="block">Since that time, Czechoslovakia has come under the domination of Soviet Russia. That great republic, with an industrial population, is now under the heel of Soviet tyranny and imperialism. Poland has been destroyed, and Greece is just holding out, as a nation, with the greatest difficulty. Has the Minister ever told us about the plight of the Greeks? Do honorable members know that since the end of the war the Greeks have had 80,000 casualties in a civil war that has been promoted by the satellites of Russia ? Even if the Minister has said a word about that matter, he has not told us where his sympathies lie. Does he know that the Turkish army has been mobilized in the Caucasus since 1941, and that a Russian army is facing it across a noman&#39;s land? The Minister for External Territories jeers at that statement. When he speaks, he will probably praise Russia, from which he has drawn his inspiration ever since he has been a member of this Parliament. I note a strange change of front among honorable members opposite. They boast that they have a great friendship for Great Britain. </para>

              <para>- Yes, he is a great man who, like the Minister, is in line with Russia. Because both he and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Stafford</inline> Cripps have become obsessed by international ideas to the detriment of their own <inline font-style="italic">heritance</inline> they are bringing ruin upon us. If the Minister for External Affairs believes that he is in the category of Palmerston, Castlereagh, or Joseph Chamberlain in relation to this matter, let him take a leaf out of their book. The Minister knows his history. Does he intend to abandon all that he ever learned ? Toes he not know that there is a practical League of Nations, at the head of which stands Great Britain, the country that fought the battle of Britain nine years ago, and is now in its tenth year of austerity and fighting a second great battle, the economic battle of Great Britain? Does he not realize that if he were to devote some of his great energy towards greater co-operation between Australia and the other nations in the British Commonwealth of Nations, Great Britain would be lifted out of some of  the difficulties that it is facing to-day? 1 ask these questions because of the ability of the Minister and irrespective of -what we think about his policy. Had there been Empire parliamentary conferences at which he and the leading men of Canada, New Zealand, and other countries got together to consider the economic difficulties associated with defence, shipping, and finance, we should be in a better position to-day. Honorable members know that devaluation is only an emergency measure, a break as it were, which gives us breathing time. Of course, it may have been necessary. Trade within the Empire group should instead have been fostered and improved. Instead of the Minister devoting himself to international issues of a kind alien to our own peoples, and which were outmoded and unsuccessful, he should have applied himself to the subjects that I have mentioned. By playing the game in accordance with an admission that he made about a Russian statesman, he is bringing about the chaos that must come the way of any democracy that adopts that line. I deplore that the Minister has not seen fit to establish a foreign affairs committee in the Parliament as proposed by me in 1943. The Senate Committee in the Parliament of the United States of America has done great good for that country. If our foreign policy had been framed in accordance with a cross-section of the opinion of the people, and a foreign affairs committee composed of members of the various parties of both Houses of the Parliament had been established, it would have been continuous. That was done in Great Britain. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bevin,</inline> who succeeded <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anthony</inline> Eden as Secretary for Foreign Affairs, carried out the traditional British policy. He is opposed to the Russians. He does not support Gromyko and Vishinsky and yet a representative of the Australian Minister at one of the conferences stated that the Dutch action in the Netherlands East Indies was worse than Hitler&#39;s invasion of Holland. That was an infamous thing to say. Honorable members know who said it. I do not want to mention his name, because he must have had the authority of his Minister to say that. The Minister does not deny that his representative said anything of that kind. If, instead of wandering around the world and sitting in conferences at what should be called Lake Non-Success, while never going to Israel, Java, or Greece, where the real trouble is, to study conditions on the spot, he had tried to elucidate the problem of the Netherlands East Indies, possibly we would not now be so unpopular with the Dutch. I point out that the Dutch colonized those islands 200 years before our ancestors came to Australia and have been our loyal allies. </para>

          <para>Yet with the approval of the Government, the policy of the waterside workers in this country is in keeping with Communist policy. That is a terrible state of affairs, because before the war we were doing a trade of millions of pounds yearly both ways with the Netherlands East Indies. Yet, to-day, because a Communist leader in a trade union becomes a dictator and says that there should be no trade between here and those islands, the Min&#39;ister abdicates and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Healy</inline> becomes the <inline font-style="italic">de facto</inline> Minister for External Affairs. This lamentable state of affairs has gone on for years ! It remains for this man, who recently served a term of imprisonment for contempt of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, to say when that trade will again operate. Of course, some trading is going on. For instance, petrol, such an inflammable political subject, is coming through. Many people appreciate the assiduity of the Minister, and concede that he must enjoy very good physical health in order to be able to attend so many conferences and go from forum to forum and from banquet to banquet. However, he could have done greater good for his country had he treated the New Guinea issue as did the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> in 1919. Had he so devoted his knowledge instead of pursuing wider international ideas some good would have resulted. </para>

            <para>. - Despite protests from the Government side of the chamber because of the lateness of the hour, I shall address myself to this matter because it is not often that we have had the opportunity  to discuss foreign affairs when the Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> has been present. The Minister has had a great deal to say to-night answering the questions that have been posed by various honorable members. I do not propose to deal with any matter other than the trusteeship of New Guinea, because the Minister has endeavoured to defend both himself and his Government for the handing over of New Guinea to a trusteeship council under the United Nations organization, to which Australia must tender an account of its stewardship every twelve months. The Minister&#39;s representative for the last twelve months has had to go to Lake Success to be subjected to an inquisition by various small nations about what Australia has attempted to do for the natives of New Guinea. I do not think that Australia should be under challenge at all by minor foreign powers in respect of its treatment of the natives. Nevertheless each twelve months the Minister for External Territories has to send <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Halligan</inline> or some other officer abroad to answer all sorts of questions, many of which are not intended to assist Australia. Some of them are questions put to our representative publicly by Ukrainian or Soviet representatives in such a light that they are intended to place Australia on the defensive, instead of relating to its administration of the mandate. </para>

              <para>- I know the Minister does not mind, but the people of Australia have a right to object. They are not so tough in the skin as is the Minister. The Minister for External Affairs, who sits beside the Minister for External Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> at the table, voluntarily sacrificed the right of Australia to tell these people to go where they wish. I remind honorable members that 6,000 Australians laid down their lives in defence of New Guinea in order to preserve it as Australian territory, and as an outpost for our protection. They believed that New Guinea was essential to our defence. The Minister for External Territories has said that the present arrangement about New Guinea has many advantages over the old mandate system. For instance, we have the right to fortify </para>

          </continue>
          <para class="block">New Guinea, and that is true. It iB also true that the mandate system lapsed when the League of Nations lapsed in 1939, and there was no obligation upon Australia, which held New Guinea by right of conquest, to surrender it to any outside tribunal. New Guinea is more important to the defence of Australia than are the Marshall and Caroline Islands to the defence of the United States of America. Honorable members opposite may smirk, but few of them have taken any interest in New Guinea. The Minister for External Affairs said to-night that there was not very much in the trusteeship which the United States of America exercised over the former Japanese territories in the Pacific. I have here a book entitled <inline font-style="italic">Trusteeship in the Pacific</inline> with which the Minister for External Affairs is probably familiar. It contains contributions by many notable Australians who are qualified to write on the subject. The Minister for External Affairs may laugh, but it was no laughing matter to give away a territory that cost so much to win. </para>

              <para>- It is true, as the records of the Parliament will show. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> brought a bill dealing with the subject before the Parliament, but that was after the Government had agreed to hand New Guinea over to the control of the Trusteeship Council of the United Nations. That was done in 1946, and the bill was not brought in until two years later. The Minister for External Territories, who now unfortunately administers New Guinea, ought to know the facts. Australia should have insisted upon a strategic trusteeship of New Guinea, as the United States of America did for the Marshall and Caroline Islands.

            <para>The United States draft was approved unanimously practically unaltered.

          <para class="block">The United States of America was so insistent upon a strategic trusteeship that it was prepared to smash the whole trusteeship system rather than submit the Marshall and Caroline Islands to the control of the Trusteeship Council. I wish to point out the difference between the trusteeship that Australia has accepted over New Guinea and the strategic trusteeship which the United States of America has obtained over the Caroline and Marshall Islands, which are much less necessary to its defence than is New Guinea to ours. The United States of America has not to make a report each year to the Trusteeship Council on its administration of the islands, as we are required to do in respect of New Guinea. The Trusteeship Council consists of representatives of Iran, the Philippines, United States of America, Mexico and some other countries. Membership changes from year to year, but each year it is necessary for the Minister for External Territories to send an officer abroad to report upon our administration to the representatives of Iran or Mexico, or some other country. </para>

On the other hand, the United States of America is not required to present any document at all to the Trusteeship Council of the United Nations, but only to report to the Security Council. If anything arises in the discussions of the Security Council that is inimical to the interests of the United States of America that country has the power to prevent discussion by the use of the veto. </para>

The only honorable member opposite who is qualified to speak on the matter is the Minister himself, who is, of course, very well qualified. </para>

              <para>- I know sufficient  to  realize that what has been done is detrimental to the interests of Australia, and  I  have studied the situation sufficiently  to  convince myself that it is in the interests of Australia that these facts should  be  made public. I point out that under  the  United Nations strategic trusteeship  the  United States of America can exclude any foreign representatives from its mandates. Can the Minister for External Territories take similar exclusive action in respect  of  New Guinea? Has he the power to prevent representatives of foreign powers who may be appointed by the United Nations from visiting New Guinea ? </para>

              <para>- I point out that when I spoke before the suspension of the sitting I was not in possession of the evidence which I now have to enable me to contradict the Minister&#39;s statement in respect of strategic trusteeships. Had the Minister desired, and had he displayed a little less enthusiasm for the United Nations, and a little more enthusiasm for his own country, he could have insisted on obtaining for Australia a similar strategic trusteeship to those granted to the United States of America. I have endeavoured to point out that Australia could have held New Guinea as an integral part of the territory of this nation, and it could have told the rest of the world to do what it liked about it, but because of the type of trusteeship agreement into which the Government has entered, we are committed for all time to an unsatisfactory arrangement. The Parliament was not consulted until after the trusteeship agreement had been made with the United Nations. In spite of the fact that the Minister for External Affairs shakes his head, he was not here to state the case when the Prime Minister, acting on his behalf, placed the matter before the House. Members of the Parliament have had very few opportunities in this chamber to discuss foreign affairs in the presence of the Minister, who, had he been here could have corrected us if we had been wrong, or could have supplied information that was lacking. </para>

          <para>In this matter there is no doubt whatever about the attitude of the Opposition. We believe that New Guinea was sacrificed. We believe that something was given away to the Trusteeship Council for which 6,000 Australians had laid down their lives. We believe that no good can come of the trusteeship agreement; that no advantage will be reaped from it ; and that what was done by the Minister for External Affairs was done in pursuit of his own personal aims and ambitions, and that it was to the detriment of Australia. </para>

            <para>- The answers to the honorable member&#39;s questions are as follows : - 1 and 2. It is normally the practice for Forestry School students to travel to camps by rail. When arrangements were being finalized for the camps which commenced late in August, traffic by rail was extremely uncertain on account of the coal strike. The possibility of postponing the camps until rail facilities were assured was considered, but it was found such a course would involve losses with contracts already entered into in. respect of the camps and would, in addition, seriously interfere with the curriculum of the school. Prices were obtained for the transport of the pupils from bus operators in Canberra.  Cusack&#39;s  quotation was accepted. Actually it meant a saving when compared with the cost of normal rail transport. In addition, it provided transport from the school to the camp, thus avoiding the charges usually necessary for transport from the school to rail and rail to camp. The vehicles used in the Canberra omnibus service are unsuitable for this long distance travel. The students returned from the camps by rail. 3 and 4. One of  Cusack&#39;s  buses was utilized earlier for the transport of students to a camp at Mathoura, in the Deniliquin district. There is no direct rail link between Canberra and Mathoura. I have no knowledge as to whether other departments are hiring private vehicles for the transport of passengers. </para>

Whilst in the United States of America <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Foot</inline> discussed this question with the United States of America authorities, the United States Steel Export Company and other United States of America steel companies. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Foot</inline> had no authority to enter into any agreement or commitments on behalf of the Government. The agreement with the United States Steel Export Company was made by the Government after consultation with the United Kingdom Government and after fully considering the difficulties of obtaining sufficient tinplate to maintain essential food processing industries. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Foot</inline> resigned his appointment in November, 1948, and is now employed by the United States Steel Export Company. No other former permanent or temporary officer of the department is in the employment of that company. </para>
