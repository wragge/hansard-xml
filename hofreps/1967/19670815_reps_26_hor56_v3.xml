At the time of his death <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gray</inline> was a member of the Public Accounts Committee and from March 1962 until November 1963 he was a member of the Library Committee. He was a member of parliamentary delegations that visited South East Asia in 1963 and 1966.

        <para>George Gray enlisted in the Australian Military Forces in September 1939 and served overseas as a captain with 17th Australian Ordnance Ammunition Company and 10th Australian Advanced Ammunition Depot. As many honourable members will recall, he retained an active interest in defence matters, particularly those technical aspects that he had become familiar with during his own service, and we remember that his interest took him to the extent of producing plans for a combined tank and tank carrier. </para>
        <para>George Gray won the respect of all honourable members of this Parliament with his quiet earnestness and his obvious sincerity. He was a champion of the many causes to which he devoted himself and he worked untiringly for the Australian Labor Party in the electorate he represented. He had a personality and character which, as we all recall so vividly, inspired friendship in all who came to know him. He will be missed and mourned by the many friends he made in both Houses of this Parliament. George Gray had a large family of children and our sympathy goes to them and to his widow in their sad loss. I move: </para>

        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Harold Holt)</inline> has moved. My colleagues and I appreciate the Prime Ministers tribute to our lal  j  colleague. We similarly appreciate the tribute paid to the late George Gray immediately after his death, ft was appreciated throughout the many areas and in the many organisations in which George Gray had served and in which he was deeply respected and will be long remembered. </para>
        <para>The Prime Minister has referred to the parliamentary career and some of the public career of our late colleague. He led a very active., full and varied life indeed. At the age of nineteen George Gray joined the Chinese customs service in Shanghai. He was a very proficient sportsman, particularly in tennis and rifle shooting. He served throughout the Second World War from its first month to its end. After the war he took a reconstruction training course and obtained the Diploma of Economics at the University of Sydney. He was a qualified accountant. After the war, however, he decided to go on the land and he began dairy farming in south Queensland. He later moved to the Tully district as a cane grower. He had been a member of my Party ever since the war. </para>
        <para>As the Prime Minister said, George Gray was elected to this House at the end of 1961. In addition to his activities on parliamentary committees and in parliamentary debates in which he was an effective speaker on an extraordinarily wide range of subjects, he was also very active in many of the affairs of the parliamentary party. </para>
        <para>He was of course, particularly interested in matters of northern development and of defence, the defence not only of northern Australia but of the whole of Australia. The Prime Minister has very properly referred to the interest the Chiefs of Staff have taken in the tank carrier prototype which he demonstrated to many members of the House, from both sides, last year. I have never known a man who has belonged to so many organisations. At the time of his election to the Parliament he was secretary or president of twentytwo associations or societies in the Rockhampton area. I first met him ten years ago when I was a member of the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review. He gave evidence before the Committee at Rockhampton, in regard to new States.  1  think it can be said that he and a member of the Committee, the late David Drummond, were principally responsible for the recommendation which the Committee unanimously made on that subject. </para>
        <para>In all of his very great range of interests, he was a man of creative imagination and engaging ingenuity. His family can well be proud of the manner in which he contributed to life in this country and of the manner in which he served this country. He was justly proud of the service which members of his family have given and are giving to this country. His eldest son is a member of the Regular Army and has just recently returned from service in Vietnam. His second son is at the Army&#39;s radio electronics base at Balcombe in Victoria. His youngest son is not yet one year old. He has three daughters, the eldest being in the Department of the Navy. For six generations the Gray family has served Australia. This family dates its Australian history to 1804, when the founder of the Australian branch came here as a member of the New South Wales Corps. My colleagues and I join in the tribute that the Prime Minister paid to a very valued contributor to this institution of which we are members. </para>

          <para>- I would like to associate the members of the Australian Country Party with the condolence motion and with the remarks of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Harold Holt)</inline> and the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> concerning our late colleague and friend. George Gray was universally liked by all who had an opportunity to know him. He was a quiet, dedicated man who held very strong convictions on anything he believed was right and in the public interest.  His  whole life seemed to be associated with one cause or another. However, if he appeared to be an ordinary type of man his demeanour belied him. George Gray was a most unusual person. As the Leader of the Opposition said, he lived a full and varied life with a tremendous experience of different places and of different types of occupation. People who were closely associated with George would have heard htm reminisce about his experiences in China where he was a customs officer for many years.  His  stories, some in humorous vein, would keep his friends intrigued for many an hour. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>In his capacity as a customs officer in China he was an assessor in the courts and could tell of many and varied experiences. He also had a distinguished military record and was a member of a unit which managed to hold Wau at the time of the Japanese attack in New Guinea. As honourable members are aware, Wau was held only by a thread&#39;s breadth. George was there on that occasion. He was also a farmer and a union organiser and was associated with many organisations. He was devoted to the New State Movement. All round, he had a great knowledge of human affairs and was a most suitable person to come into this House as a member of Parliament. We will remember him with affection and we will all miss him. On behalf of the members of my Party, I would like to express our sympathy to his wife and family. </para>

During the last two years I became very closely associated with him. Remarkable though it may seem, my electorate of Dawson completely encircles the mainland portion of the electorate of Capricornia. For this reason, many of my electoral activities were of interest to George Gray and things that he did were of interest to me. Travelling between Canberra and Rockhampton with him as frequently as I did was an experience that 1 shall never forget. I believe that few people could really appreciate his remark* able background. The number of issues and events with which he somehow or other became involved was truly astonishing. As the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> has said, George Gray was associated with a tremendous number of organisations. This was evidenced particularly at his funeral. The number of people representing all walks <inline font-style="italic">at</inline> life and various religious denominations showed clearly the respect in which this man was held by the people of the area that he represented in this House. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I spoke to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gray</inline> only a few hours before he died. But he did not speak of death.

If there is one small recompense  Tot  his death. I belike it is the fact that he died in a way Hu: he would have approved. 1 know that <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Gray</inline> also thinks this. He died in his own home, among his family, with the two babies which were his and which he loved so much close at hand. George Gray was a remarkable man. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir. and</inline> I believe that this Parliament will miss him greatly. He was an extraordinarily good Australian. </para>

          <para>That the Bill be now read a second time. In so doing, I present the Budget proposals for the financial year 1967-68. </para>
          <para>This Budget presents the sum of many proposals, each with its own purpose. The amount involved is large and grows inevitably year by year. Total Budget outlay this year will equal about one-fourth of our Gross National Expenditure. Spending on this scale, and the measures required to finance it, must have powerful effects. The precise impact will depend on the trend and strength of many other influences running through our economic life. Therefore, 1 want to speak briefly about our recent economic experience, take stock of the economy at the moment, and then say something about our prospects. </para>
          <para>A year ago, the effects of drought were still lingering, consumer spending was sluggish and private capital expenditure seemed to be slowing down. For these reasons, last year&#39;s Budget was designed to he expansionary. </para>
          <para>The economy responded much as we intended. The year 1966-67 was one of strong and varied growth. On the demand side, public authority expenditure led the way. With a much better season, rural output and incomes both increased notably. Consumer spending, comprising normally about three-fifths of all expenditure, also revived. While building and construction for commerce and industry and private spending on plant and machinery tended to fail away, there was a considerable lift in dwelling construction. </para>
          <para>For 1966-67 as a whole, gross national product rose by 9%. After making full allowance for price increases, there was an increase of between 5 and 6% in national production in real terms. This achievement was close to the best of recent years. Plainly, there must have been some good gains in productivity. </para>
          <para>The number in employment in 1966-67 was 2.5% greater than in the year before. This was a smaller increase than has been usual. By all accounts employers have had less difficulty in finding either skilled or unskilled labour than in recent years although overtime working has been fairly high. The lower migrant inflow has been a factor in the smaller rise in civilian employment. </para>
          <para>Domestically, therefore, supply and demand seem to have been pretty much in balance. </para>
          <para>Wage rates have increased strongly: over the year to June, minimum weekly wage ra&#62;es rose by about 7%. As to prices, the consumer price index rose in the first three quarters of 1966-67 at an annual rate only a little above 2%. However, in the most recent quarter, the rise approached an annual rate of <inline font-style="italic">5%.</inline> This of course is much too high. </para>
          <para>Externally, results have been mixed. Taken as a whole, the export performance over the past year has been splendid - the best we have ever had. Imports increased little as compared with 1965-66, though the rate was rising in the later months of 1966-67. The substantial trade deficit in the preceding year thus gave place to a useful surplus of S95m. With defence and civil aid and other payments abroad increasing, the net deficit on invisible payments widened and net receipts of capital from abroad fell a long way from the record level of 1965-66. In the outcome there was a loss of SI 77m in external reserves. The offsetting increase in our drawing rights in the International Monetary Fund and the credit extended to New Zealand reduced the net adverse movement to $125m. That was a pretty good result. The financial year has <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> fact opened well for the balance of payments. There were good trade results in July, with shipments of wheat, wool and minerals running at a high level and with imports a little lower than they have been in recent months. </para>

It provides for total expenditure in 1967-68 of &#167;6,4 83m and total revenues and similar receipts of $5, 887m. Thus the estimated gap to be financed from borrowings of various kinds is S596m. This would be $61m more than the amount borrowed last year. </para>
      <para>On these figures, expenditures will be $56 1 m or 9.5% greater than those of last year - when the increase over the previous year was 11%. The increase in revenue will be S499m- or 9.3%: last year it was S309m Or 6% . </para>
      <para>Statements No. 2 to 4 attached to the Budget Speech give details of these estimates. </para>
      <para>With the concurrence of honourable members I incorporate in Hansard these statements and others to which I shall refer in the course of my speech. </para>
      <para>These aggregates of expenditures and receipts crystallise the Government&#39;s decisions. They reflect our judgment as to the kind of Budget the economy needs to keep it healthy during the year and beyond. </para>
      <para class="block">To a considerable extent the shape of the Budget is pre-determined by past commitments and by such necessities as defence. So the scope for policy adjustment lies chiefly in decisions about new expenditure proposals and on whether taxes and charges shall be increased or reduced. It is these decisions which determine whether the marginal impact of the Budget will be one of stimulus or restraint. </para>
      <para>As I now see the prospect, we can expect another good year. The supply of labour, material and plant is adequate to sustain a good rate of growth. With normal additions to the work force from our own population and net immigration, a rise of 3% in employment seems feasible without putting much strain on the labour market. It would be normal to expect some further gain in overall productivity. Indeed, the big additions to industrial plant during recent years ought to go on boosting output per man hours for some time to come. The capacity for expansion is certainly there. </para>
      <para>The rural industries will depend, as always, very much on seasonal conditions. For some major districts a good season is not assured as yet. But there can be no doubt that the rural industries, especially the wheat industry, are capable of greater production. Given a good season greater production will certainly be achieved. </para>
      <para>On the side of demand there are also grounds for confidence. Consumer spending is the major component of national expenditure. It has been growing strongly and we can expect this trend to continue. Employment is bound to go on rising and so are average earnings. Generally, conditions seem set, not for a boom, but for a good steady expansion of consumer demand. </para>
      <para>Let us now consider the prospects for the other main segment of private spending, that rs, capital expenditure. Expenditure on dwelling construction has been increasing steadily. There are no signs of slackening. The flow of finance appears to be keeping up. If anything, the year ahead might see some further increase in dwelling construction. An increase in non-residential construction also seems likely. The value of approvals for commercial, industrial and other non-residential buildings in the recent June quarter was 16% higher than a year earlier. We were aiming to achieve a figure something like this. </para>
      <para>Increased consumer spending can be expected to make heavier demands on production and hence on plant capacity. Various big projects associated with minerals, oil and gas are in train. Bank lending and unused overdraft limits are high and monetary liquidity is adequate to support a substantial increase in business expenditure. All told, therefore, the indications are that private capital expenditure in general will gather impetus as the year goes on. </para>
      <para>Let us turn now to public authority expenditure. The allocation of resources between the public and private sectors was the crucial question we faced when framing the Budget. </para>
      <para>I have indicated that there is scope in the economy foi&#34; production to rise at much the same rate as last year. Total expenditure also could increase about as fast as production without upsetting the balance of demand and supply. But if expendiure increases faster than that it must outrun the resources available with adverse effects on costs and the balance of payments. This, in fact, is what must happen if all the main segments of expenditure rise strongly together. Consumer spending has revived and we expect private capital expenditure also to do so. There could obviously be trouble if, at the same time, public spending were allowed to continue to rise at the rate of the past few years. We could quickly find ourselves over-spending, with resources over-stretched, prices rising fast and a heavy external deficit. </para>
      <para>The Government does not want lo take the risk that these conditions will emerge. Already rising wage rates have created a cost problem, worrying for all; serious for the exporting industries and acute in the case of some sections of the wool industry. Externally our position is under some stress; it could become difficult if an excessive rise of demand led to a strong upsurge of imports. I emphasise that we are not prepared to take this risk. </para>
      <para>While we keep the progress of the economy sure and steady, our balance of payments can be manageable. Our export prospects are certainly good and, in particular, The big mining developments now under our earnings abroad, lt seems possible that, even in the medium term, the fruits of oil discoveries will serve to replace a considerable quantity of imports. On the other side of the ledger we expect imports to increase. Additionally, we face some big external commitments in the period immediately ahead, especially for defence. Of this 1 shall say more later. Capital inflow is unpredictable. Allowing for a rate of inflow comparable with that of 1966-67, 1 think some further loss of external reserves is likely in this financial year. We do not want that loss to be aggravated by an overstimulated demand for imports. </para>
      <para>On a balancing of these probabilities, we do not think it would be in the nation&#39;s interest to put further restraints on consumption. The taxes imposed in 1964-65 and 1965-66 in order to shift resources to defence are still effective and new restraints could immobilise rather than divert resources. </para>
      <para>It must be emphasised that a large part of industry and the employment it provides are geared to the needs of the consumer. If we cut back consumer demand too hard not only are living standards affected but the immediate result is more likely to be unemployment than a transfer of resources to other activities. It could also affect immigration adversely. For these reasons we do not want to reduce disposable income. Equally, however, we do not think that consumption expenditure needs any stimulus now. The tasks to be done and the demands to be made on resources are too numerous and heavy for us to be able to afford too strong an increase in consumer spending. </para>
      <para>Nor do we wish to depress private capital expenditure. Some of it might not pass the test of high national priority but the private sector is responsible for the largest part of production and has, therefore, a critical role to play in national growth and progress. </para>

        <title>GROWTH OF THE PUBLI1C SECTOR</title>
        <page.no>8</page.no>
        <type>miscellaneous</type>
      </debateinfo>
      <para>One reason why we have drawn the reins on public spend ng more lightly than before is to provide room for balanced expansion of the private sector. For some years now the public sector has been setting the pace and doing so strongly. That it should have done so is in part based on historical need; that is, the need for large and rapid defence expansion coinciding with unparalleled demands for works to serve great new developments and improve facilities for education, transport, power and fuel supply - in a word, to establish the foundations for larger economic growth. In the four years from 1962-63 to 1966-67 public authority spending as a proportion of total spending has grown from 19% to 21%. In the past two years 44% of the increase in employment has gone to the public sector. A few years back 25 to 30% would have been more like the ratio. Public expenditure has also been calling more and more heavily on our overseas resources. </para>
      <para>In the main, these necessities could not be denied and they are likely to increase. To recognise these necessities does not mean, however, that the requirements of the public sector must override everything else. Essentially, this involves the problem of choice and allocation of resources to which I referred in my Budget speech last year. Pressed hard by competing claims, we had to decide what the broad allocation of resources should be. As I said earlier, the private sector has a major part to play in growth. I add that it also has a major role to play in national security since basically defence must be built upon the growth of our manpower, our industrial capacity and our ability to pay our way abroad. </para>

      </debateinfo>
      <para>These are the reasons why we have made a strong effort this year to bring the increase in expenditure within tighter limits. The goal we set was 9% and within the practical limits set by our commitments for defence, we have gone close to achieving it. I shall now explain what we propose in respect of the main expenditure groups. </para>

          <title>Defence</title>
          <page.no>9</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>Again this year defence commitments have been a dominant element in the Budget. Last year, expenditure was S950m. This was $50m below the estimate. Even so it was 27% above expenditure in the previous year. </para>
        <para>This year we are providing $1,1 18m for defence - an increase of $168m or 18% on 1966-67. </para>
        <para>May I recall that in 1962-63, five years ago, our defence bill was $428m, nearly $700m less than the estimate for this year. </para>
        <para class="block">Over the four intervening years the rate of increase has averaged 22% per year. </para>
        <para>We have accomplished this expansion without serious distortion or disruption of our domestic economy. We have done it through fiscal and monetary means without the direct controls associated with a proclaimed state of war. In other words, the defence effort has been accommodated within our available resources. Lest any one should suppose that it has all been costless, let him reflect how much could have been done if all those additional expenditures and the resources they represent had gone into the enlargement of our industrial capacity and other basic facilities for growth. </para>
        <para>It is not, however, the present level of defence spending so much as the rate of escalation that concerns us most. Plainly we cannot continue for long to meet anything like the rate of increase of recent years without deep impairment of the economy. As it is, estimated defence costs this year will be equivalent to 5% of what we think gross national product is likely to be, calculated at factor cost. Among the countries of the Western World, only the United States, Britain and France are at present devoting a larger proportion of their resources to defence than we are. Britain now considers that the burden of defence expenditure is more than her economy can stand and the Government is putting into effect plans to reduce the proportion of her resources that go into defence. The United Stares, with her immense productive capacity and a gross national product per head more than half as great again as ours, is finding her external defence cos Ls a heavy strain on her balance of payments. </para>
        <para>Total defence expenditure is one aspect of the problem: our mounting external defence costs are another and more serious aspect. Five years ago, our external costs of defence were well under $100m a year. This year they could rise above &#167;350m. At this level they would represent 1 1 % or more of our export earnings. Some of this expenditure will be met from credits arranged abroad but, though helpful in spreading payments, credits simply carry the liabilities forward. Even so the net cash outgo this year will bc well above S200m. Out. sending defence orders abroad for ships, aircraft and other equipment and supplies at 30th June last were costed at more than $600m. Further orders will have to be placed overseas this year and later for replenishment or replacement as well as to provide for new and additional requirements. </para>
        <para>Defence must, and does, rank high in our national priorities. We must be prepared to play an effective role in our own defence and, in co-operation with our Allies, in the security and stability of this part of the world. Our effectiveness will grow as our resources develop. But we would not be helping either ourselves or our Allies were we to attempt to overreach our capacity. Defence subtracts from the resources available for growth. Seriously weaken the potential for growth and the capacity to support an expanding defence effort is whittled away. </para>

        <type>miscellaneous</type>
      </debateinfo>
      <para>We propose to seek an amendment of the legislation governing Defence Forces Retirement Benefits to give common entitlements to all servicemen on full-time continuous duty for periods of twelve months or more by admitting to the benefits of the scheme those now excluded because they are enlisted for periods of less than six years. This extension of the scheme will give cover to national servicemen, who are enlisted for two years. If any of the servicemen now to be covered is discharged through invalidity or dies, he or his widow and children will receive the same pensions or other benefits as permanent members of the Forces. </para>
      <para>While serving in special areas such as Vietnam, servicemen are, in addition, covered by the Repatriation legislation. Thus, for example, a married private soldier totally and permanently incapacitated as a result of war service will receive a pension of $31.50 per week under the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits legislation, together with a basic pension of $34.55 per week under the Repatriation legislation. Additional Repatriation benefits are, of course, provided in respect of children and by way of medical and hospital treatment. </para>

        <para>I shall refer next to the contribution we are making to the economic advancement and security of developing countries. Both in our foreign policy and our defence planning our goal is international peace. Along with this must go economic progress. These are the aims of our international aid. </para>
        <para>The scale of our economic aid to developing countries is not as well known as it should be. Unlike other aid-giving countries, we give all our official aid in grants not in repayable, interest-bearing loans, tied or untied. Our official aid this year, estimated at $142m, will probably represent about 0.75% of our estimated national income. Only France among the countries of the West can point to a better performance than that. Australia&#39;s aid, moreover, has grown rapidly in recent years whereas that of other donor countries has been static or declining. </para>
        <para>This year, our expenditure under bilateral and multilateral aid programmes will increase by $9m to $50m - that is by 23%. We are providing aid these days under more than twenty separate headings. The main increases will occur in our contribution to the International Development Association and in emergency assistance for Indonesia. The IDA expenditure is a further instalment towards the second replenishment of IDA funds for which Australia has agreed to provide $ 17.7m in all. The amount of $5. 2m for Indonesia is special assistance over and above normal Colombo Plan aid to that country. We are providing $9.5m in anticipation of the coming into effect of food aid obligations under the International Grains Agreement. A gift of 1 50,000 tons of wheat to India, valued at nearly $9m, has already been arranged. </para>
        <para>Defence aid of some $6m will be given to Malaysia and Singapore. </para>

        <para>Over and above the grant. Commonwealth Departments will incur in the Territory expenditures of an aid character amounting to about $l4m. Other Departmental expenditure, including defence expenditure there, will run to more than $30m. Together, the outlays from this Budget in the Territory will amount to more than $120m. </para>
        <para>In alf of this aid-giving we clearly recognise our obligation to help the needier people of the world. We do this, knowing that the transfer of resources to others must subtract from our own resources and especially our external resources. These are anything but unlimited. </para>

          <page.no>12</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>There can scarcely be a facet of our national affairs that attracts more widespread attention than education. A community quickly growing in numbers and in economic capacity needs continuously to raise its educational standards. The basic responsibility for education, constitutionally and in fact, still remains with the States. Nevertheless, the Commonwealth&#39;s ro!e in this field has been growing and its financial contribution has been increasing rapidly. For example, over the past six years the increase has been almost fourfold. We have seen dramatic developments in university education-: new universities have been established, standards of buildings and equipment have been improved and enrolments have more than doubled in eight years. These achievements would have been impossible without Commonwealth support. </para>
        <para>This support has net, however, been limited to universities; it is being extended to new tertiary institutions providing broadly-based educational opportunities for those being trained &#39;for technological vocations. The Commonwealth also has recognised the needs of secondary schools in the teaching of science and has given financial assistance for this purpose. It is giving capital grants also to improve facilities in technical colleges. Now, in this Budget, we are for the first time providing grants to the States for the building of teachers colleges. All this, of course, is additional to the financial assistance we give to students and the educational needs we meet in full in the Commonwealth territories. </para>
        <para>The cost to the Budget is in conseqence mounting rapidly. </para>
        <para>Total Commonwealth expenditure on education this year is estimated to be about $194m. This is S51m or 35% more than in 1966-67. </para>
        <para>This total includes payments to the States specifically for education. These will increase by 50% to SV 18m. Within this amount grants for universities and colleges of advanced education will account for nearly $81m. More than $29m will be for science laboratories, technical training and research grants. Provision is being made for grants of $8m for teachers colleges </para>
        <para>Additionally, the Australian National University and ils affiliated colleges will receive just on &#167;24m or more than $4m in excess of last year. </para>
        <para>The cost of the various Commonwealth scholarship schemes will rise by $4.7m to nearly $29m. </para>
        <para>Current expenditures by the Commonwealth on education will this year amount to about $107m - this includes some $3m for the Soldiers&#39; Children Education Scheme, which is a Repatriation item - and capital expenditures will total about $83m. Administrative expenditures associated with education amount to another $4m. </para>
        <para class="block">Revenue Assistance to the States </para>
        <para>Except for expenditures on business undertakings, education accounts on the average for nearly a third of State expenditures from their revenue funds. Revenue grants to the States by the Commonwealth represent more than half of State revenues excluding business undertakings. These Commonwealth grants therefore help them in a big way to meet their education costs. In 1967-68 Commonwealth general revenue grants to the States will be about $93 6m as at present estimated or $5 8m more than last year. Other specific purpose revenue payments are estimated at $44m - about $7m less than last year, when payments related to drought were heavy. These figures do not include the Commonwealth payments specifically for education to which I have referred; these will add about S49m to Commonwealth revenue-type grants to the States. For the first time total Commonwealth revenue assistance will exceed a billion dollars - about Si, 028m in all. </para>

          <page.no>13</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>On capital account Commonwealth specific purpose payments to the States will this year be S3 19m - a 28% increase on last year&#39;s figure. This includes S69m for capital expenditure on education to which I have referred. It includes also $160m under the Commonwealth Aid Roads arrangements and more than S6m for beef cattle roads and the Gordon River road in Tasmania. For railway standardisation projects in Western Australia, South Australia, and New South Wales, more than $37m is to be provided. Over $6m is included for Tasmanian hydroelectric development and $5m for the South Australian natural gas pipeline. Natural disaster payments of a capital nature will approach $13m. Other payments will be made for water conservation, rural development and health and welfare. </para>
        <para>These specific purpose payments are additional to the funds the Commonwealth borrows or provides from its own resources for State works and housing programmes. These programmes will this year total $677m or 5% more than last year. When it approved this amount, the Loan Council also agreed that the borrowing programmes for S.ate semi-governmental authorities should be increased by 16% to $3llm </para>
        <para>The effective increase was actually greater than this because the Loan Council agreed that these programmes should in future apply only to authorities seeking more than $300,000 within the financial year. Previously, the limit was $200,000. The semi-governmental authorities arrange their own borrowings. It is significant, however, that the combined borrowing programmes of the States and their authorities for capital works and housing in this financial year will be close to $ 1,000m. In addition, as I have pointed out, they will receive revenue assistance from the Commonwealth of more than one billion dollars. </para>
        <para>Expenditure on Commonwealth capital works and services will rise this year by 9% to $5 16m. The largest single item is Post Office capital works, on which expenditure will rise by 17% to $240m. I want to refer to the Post Office in detail later. Here I point out that the net requirement from the Budget to finance this expenditure will be 5181m. The remaining S59m will be provided from internal Post Office sources, mainly depreciation funds. Most of the capital expenditure this year will be for extending and improving telephone services. In our quick-growing economy, demand for services involving new lines rose by about 12% last year. With the growth of traffic, trunk and local networks have to be extended and improved. New Post Office buildings are also needed and some existing buildings require remodelling or replacement to cope with expanding business. </para>
        <para>Capital expenditure for civil aviation will total more than $35m - a 23% increase on last year. Most of this will be for airport development, mainly at Sydney and Tullamarine. More will be spent also on navigational aids and equipment. </para>
        <para>Expenditure by the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority will taper off. It is estimated at less than $42m - nearly $7m less than last year&#39;s expenditure. </para>

        <para>On beef cattle roads in the Northern Territory expenditure is estimated to exceed $3m. Two new projects estimated to cost $4,650,000 will be started - one, the Daly Waters to Cape Crawford road and the other, the restoration and sealing of the road from the Barkly Highway to Anthony&#39;s Lagoon. </para>

The group includes bounties and subsidies, support of industrial research and assistance to the Queensland sugar industry. With increasing sales, bounties and subsidies on phosphate and nitrogenous fertilisers are expected to rise by nearly $7m to almost $40m. </para>
        <para>The average export price for wheat from the 1966-67 crop is expected to be above the previous year&#39;s level and it is estimated that this will reduce the Commonwealth payment into the Wheat Prices Stabilisation Fund this year by $3m to SI 3m. </para>
        <para>Under arrangements made last year, an amount of almost S20m is to be made available to the State of Queensland to enable it to meet interest and repayment obligations in respect of advances by the Reserve Bank to the Queensland Sugar Board in respect of 1966 season No. 1 Pool sugar. We have decided to provide further assistance to the State to enable it to provide assistance to the sugar industry in respect of the 1967 sugar crop. The provision we are making for this purpose is SI Om. Depending on prices realised for export sales we are prepared to increase this assistance up to a total amount not exceeding $15m. The assistance we are providing in respect of both the 1966 and 1967 crops will be repayable by the State in future years. </para>
        <para class="block">Administrative and Other Expenditures I come now to the residual group of expenditures which in ali are estimated to increase by 4% to $689m. They include the running costs of Commonwealth Departments, estimated to rise by 9 per cent to $378m. Debt charges are estimated to rise by 8% to SI 02m. </para>
        <para>Current expenditures in the Territories other than Papua and New Guinea - that is, in the Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory and the minor territories - are estimated to increase by 16% to $52m. This excludes educational costs covered by the figures for education I have already mentioned. I add that we are providing SI. 4m for operational expenditure and $1.2m for capital expenditure on a programme due to come into effect at the beginning of 1968, to increase facilities for the education of aboriginal children in the Northern Territory. </para>
        <para>These increases are substantially offset by reductions in other expenditures. Payments amounting to S27m were made last year to finance drawings in Australian currency by other countries from the International Monetary Fund. No provision has been made for similar payments this year. Expenditure on the introduction of decimal currency is expected to decrease by 50% to S8m. </para>

This will be of considerable benefit to former Commonwealth officers and members of the Permanent Defence Forces, and their widows. The estimated cost is $7.7m for a full year and $5.45m in 1967-68; this will be offset to some extent by reductions in entitlement to social service benefits. </para>

      <para>Mainly because we expect economic conditions this year to be more buoyant than last year, we estimate that the rate of increase in total taxation revenues will be greater - about 8%, compared wilh last year&#39;s 6%. Details of the Estimates of Receipts are contained in Statement No. 4 attached to the Speech. </para>
      <para>The central objective of the Budget is to promote conditions favourable to sound and efficient growth, with consumer spending and private capital outlays rising steadily. To avoid overstraining our resources we have put a close limit on the rise in Budget expenditures We do not think the added restraint of a general increase in taxation necessary to restrain demand. Postal and some other charges will be increased; but they are directly related to the increasing costs and outlays of the Post Office and other Departments and to the necessity to provide increased and expanded services. They are not general taxation measures. </para>
      <para>On the other hand we have not felt that general reductions in taxation are needed. We are therefore leaving the general level of taxation unchanged. What we have done is to survey the whole field of taxation in order to ensure that, as far as it was financially practicable, we would provide concessions wherever we felt there was a real need and benefits could and should be given, especially for those with, family responsibilities.

      <para>In the last two Budgets temporary measures were adopted for wool-growers who were forced by drought to advance shearing dates and shear their sheep twice in the one year.

An alternative method of accounting for the proceeds is proposed in relation to sales in the 1967-68 income year and subsequent years. Under this proposal, a primary producer may elect that the profits of a forced sale be applied to reduce the value of replacement stock for taxation purposes. The broad effects of an election will be to defer tax on the profits until the stock has been replaced and sales are made in the normal course of business. </para>

        <para>During 1967-68, the expected higher level of business activity and of housing development will place increasingly heavy demands on the Post Office. When speaking of the capital expenditures from this Budget, I said that Post Office capital works this year would require an amount of $240m, of which $181m will be the net requirement provided from this Budget. </para>
        <para>The Post Office also faces the problem of rising costs in running its services. It continues to install the latest technical equipment and to improve operating methods and techniques. By these means, productivity has been steadily improved, as is shown by the fact that business done has increased faster than staff numbers. For example, between 1959 and 1966 the postal staff increased by 10% but handled 31% more traffic. By their nature, however, the services provided by the Post Office require a lot of labour and labour costs have gone on rising. This year it is estimated that Post Office wage and salary costs will rise by more than $19m. Of this increase, over $13m is due to the increases awarded in the National Wage Cases and other recent arbitration decisions, including the full year cost of the Interim Margins Award. When higher prices for materials used and other cost increases are also brought to account, the Post Office will be headed for a loss of over $40m in this financial year if charges are not increased as proposed. Financing a loss of this order would pose a serious budgetary problem. Without the estimated increase in revenue of $36m to be obtained from the higher charges, the net call of the Post Office on the Budget this year would, it is estimated, rise from $181m to $2 17m. There has been no general increase in postal tariffs or telephone local call fee and trunk charges, since 1959. </para>
        <para>With one or two minor exceptions, the increases in charges now proposed are the same as those put before Parliament towards the end of the last financial year. They are to operate from 1st October next. The adjustments proposed are expected to yield in 1967-68 an additional $36m in Post Office revenue, or $17m less than if they had been introduced from 1st July as originally planned. They will yield $64m in a full year. </para>
        <para>Other changes of an accounting and procedural kind are proposed to help the Post Office operate as a business undertaking. The Post Office is required to conduct its operations in accordance with the best business practice. The Government is convinced that this objective would be better served if the financial machinery of the Post Office were changed from the standard Treasury and Departmental system to a commercial form more suited to business requirements. After a thorough study the Government has decided to create a Post Office Trust Account into which Post Office revenues will be paid and from which its expenditures will be met. The Department&#39;s net requirements for capital purposes each year will be provided annually under one-line appropriations from the Budget and paid to the Trust Account. </para>
        <para>The Department will thus operate its own trading account, but will remain subject to the control of the Postmaster-General and, of course, of Parliament. The new arrangements will, in fact, give Parliament greater opportunities to examine the affairs of the Post Office, its commercial accounts and annual report will, as now, be tabled in Parliament each year. An innovation will be the tabling at Budget time in Parliament of a White Paper giving estimates of commercial results and expectations, the proposed capital programme, together with the way it is to be financed, and other information on Post Office affairs. </para>
        <para>Further information concerning the proposed new financial arrangements will be given shortly by the Postmaster-General, and legislation will be introduced during the current financial year with the objective of having the new administrative arrangements operate from 1st July 1968. </para>
        <para>While it has important national obligations to meet, the Post Office should earn sufficient revenue to cover its operating costs over a period of years. It is reasonable also that its earnings as a business undertaking should make some contribution towards the expansion of the telecommunications network. Some retention of profit for capital purposes is standard business practice. </para>
        <para>Against this background the Government decided to increase Post Office charges. </para>

        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>In accordance with the policy of progressively recovering from the air transport industry a greater proportion of the large and increasing cost of providing, maintaining and operating airports and airway facilities, the Government has decided to increase by 10% the rates of air navigation charges payable by all aircraft operators. These increases will take effect from 1st January 1968 and are estimated to bring in $257,000 additional income in 1 967-68 and $893,000 m a full year. </para>
        <para>The rates of air navigation charges have been increased by 10% in each  of  the last five years. Despite this, the gap between the amount that it costs the Commonwealth annually to provide aviation facilities for the industry, and the amount of revenue received annually from the industry for the use of these facilities, has continued to widen. Thus general taxpayers, rather than the aviation industry and the users of air services, are required to meet the cost of these facilities to an increasing extent. The Government has decided that additional measures are necessary if this trend is to be arrested and further progress made towards the objective of requiring commercial aviation to meet an increasing share of the cost of facilities provided for it at public expense and properly attributable to it. lt has therefore been decided, in addition to increasing air navigation charges, to introduce a passenger service charge which will be payable by passengers on both domestic and international air services. Details of the scheme will be announced at an appropriate time by the Minister for Civil Aviation. Legislation to give effect to it will be introduced during the current financial year. The charge will be calculated to yield revenue of between $4m and $5m a year at present traffic levels. </para>

      <para>I said earlier that estimated expenditures of &#167;6,483m will exceed estimated receipts of $5,887m by $596m. This amount will have to be covered by net borrowings at home and abroad. </para>
      <para>This &#39;financing gap&#39; between expenditures and receipts is not the same as the Loan Council borrowing programmes for State works and housing which this year total $677m - 5% more than last year. In last year&#39;s buoyant monetary conditions, the net cash proceeds of public loans in Australia totalled S646m and those of oversea loans, $52m, giving total proceeds of </para>
      <para class="block">S699m. With redemptions a. home and abroad of S393m the net proceeds were S306m. </para>
      <para>Despite the relative easiness of last year&#39;s domestic loan market, the Commonwealth had to subscribe from its own budgetary resources for the States just on $90m to complete the Loan Council borrowing programmes. We do not expect the domestic loan market to be more buoyant this year than last. We must also consider the increased semi-governmental borrowing programmes for State semi-governmental authorities which, at $31 lm, exceed last year&#39;s programmes by $43m. It is practically certain that the State works and housing programmes will again make a heavy call on our Budget this year. </para>
      <para>Part of the borrowing requirement arising will be met by net drawings on the credit arrangements for defence purchases in the United States - this year estimated at S123m compared with last year&#39;s $91m. That will leave another $473m to be borrowed from other sources. The comparable figure in 1966-67 was rather less at S444m. </para>
      <para>We will continue to borrow abroad on acceptable terms. At present, however, the European dollar market is the only source of new money we can feel reasonably sure about and I must emphasise that this is a sensitive and crowded market. We intend to maintain the good position we have established in this market and to make any other borrowings abroad that prove practicable; but it would be a delusion to suppose that great sums can readily be borrowed overseas. </para>
      <para>There is another side to this story: the weight of maturities and repayment obligations on our external debt is now heavy and oversea capital markets being what they are, refinancing is difficult. </para>
      <para>So far as our borrowing prospects abroad can be assessed, we would expect redemptions again to exceed new loan proceeds although to a smaller extent than last year when the excess was $82m. The amount then remaining to be covered by net borrowings in Australia should not exceed Hie net S527m borrowed locally last year. </para>
      <para>We cannot estimate with any accuracy how much of the amount to be raised locally will come from the Australian public. We shall aim at raising as much as we can from that source. We can be sure that a considerable amount will come directly or indirectly from the banking system. In all probability, some borrowing from the Reserve Bank will be necessary. The substantial direct payments abroad financed from the Budget will, however, have offsetting monetary effects. </para>

      <para class="block">We cannot measure precisely either the monetary effects or the economic impact of the Budget. What we can do to assist interpretation is to break down the estimates into economic categories. This is done in Statement No. 6 attached to the Speech which sets out the estimates in the national accounts form. </para>
      <para>In this form, the estimates are comparable with the national accounting statistics for the economy as a whole. Expenditure on goods and services, which adds directly to demand, is distinguished from transfers such as pensions, and loans, which add to the capacity of the recipients to spend. Direct payments abroad are separated from those that make demands on domestic resources. Receipts are analysed as between those that are likely to offset the effects of rue Budget spending and those that are not. Finally, the national accounting presentation gives a general indication of the extent to which demand-increasing outlay will exceed or fall short of demand-reducing receipts. </para>
      <para>So presented, the estimates indicate that total Budget outlay will this year increase by 10% compared with an increase of nearly 12% last year. This outlay includes direct payments abroad. Mainly because of defence commitments, these external payments are estimated to rise to $652m or $I47m more than last year. </para>
      <para>Outlay within Australia is estimated at $5,554m and will exceed estimated receipts by only a small margin. Receipts include an estimated $330m of revenue which is expected to result from the growth of incomes and economic activity. This revenue being itself the consequence of the economic expansion expected this year will not have offsetting effects on those Budget outlays that add to incomes and spending in Australia. </para>
      <para>At the beginning of this Speech I said I would say something to you about the prospects - immediate and long-term. Let me say we are confident that the effects of this Budget, combined with the steady rise in private spending for both consumption and investment, will keep the economy growing at a healthy rate and will keep resources tully employed. The Budget will help us achieve our central aim, which is to strengthen the economy and give greater scope for private spending. </para>
      <para>As the year goes on, the Government will as always be ready to meet particular needs or eventualities. Monetary policy can and will be used as necessary to help keep the economy on the right course. </para>
      <para>In our view businessmen can with confidence make plans with the expectation that the economy will continue to grow steadily. Indeed, if we all plan in this way our expectations are the more likely to be realised. </para>
      <para>Even the most cautious amongst us can scarcely fail to be confident of the future of this country. Vast new discoveries of resources are becoming almost a commonplace. In this recent phase, each discovery has inspired further effort and further effort has led to new discoveries. </para>
      <para>As far ahead as we can see Australia has all the potentialities for sustained growth and we in Australia are in truth making creditable efforts ourselves. I say this against the background that we plough back a quarter of all we produce into investment for the future, allocate 5% of our national production for defence, and make a large contribution to international assistance. This I repeat is a worthy and creditable effort. </para>
      <para>These efforts together with these great natural resources are the source and foundation of growth. </para>
      <para>There are, loo, other pre-conditions of growth we cannot afford to neglect and there are many questions we should ask. Our workforce is growing and gaining in competence. Is it growing fast enough for all the tasks now crowding upon us? Management has a critically important task to fulfil. Is management everywhere doing the job national greatness demands? Are we mobilising the capital we are accumulating and allocating it to the right uses? Are we sufficiently conscious of the critical necessity to control costs of production? Are we efficient? To ask these and other questions is not to belittle the achievements of those who are in fact finding the answers to our problems. They simply remind us that if the opportunities that lie before us are great, the efforts they demand are equally great too. </para>

      <para pgwide="yes">In 1966-67, the excess of Commonwealth expenditures over receipts - the amount to be met from borrowings- was $535 million. This was $284 million greater than in 1965-66. </para>

      <para pgwide="yes">Total expenditures were $5,922 million in 1966-67. Excluding the effects of changes in accounting procedures, expenditures were about $593 million, or 11 per cent, greater than expenditures in 1965-66.

      </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Total receipts amounted to $5,388 million in 1966-67. Excluding the effects of changes in accounting procedures, they were about $309 million, or 6 per cent, greater than in 1 965-66. Taxation collections increased by $267 million, including an increase of $191 million in income tax collections from individuals and an increase of $55 million in excise collections. Collections of income tax from companies declined by $17 million. Receipts of the Business Undertakings increased by $32 million. The increase in other Trust Fund balances was $19 million less than in 1965-66. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Part B of this Statement contains more detailed comments on expenditures and receipts in 1966-67. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">In national accounting terms, total Commonwealth outlays increased by 1 1 .  5 per cent in 1966-67. This comprised increases of 23.8 per cent in Commonwealth outlays overseas and 10.4 per cent in outlays in Australia. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The high rate of increase in Commonwealth outlays was a major factor in the increase in expenditure by the public authorities sector as a whole in 1966-67. Expenditure on goods and services by this sector is estimated to have increased by 12.8 per cent. Gross National Expenditure isestimated to have increased by 7 .  5 per cent. Personal consumption expenditure is estimated to have risen by 6.8 per cent while private fixed capital expenditure is estimated to have declined slightly. Thus public authority expenditure, and particularly Commonwealth expenditure, contributed largely to the increase in 1966-67 in demand in the economy. </para>

        <para>The main variations from the Budget estimates were as follows: </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">
          <inline font-style="italic">Defence Services.</inline>Expenditure on Defence Services fell short of the Budget estimate by $50 million. Expenditures on purchase and manufacture of aircraft for the R.A.A.F. and the R.A.N. were, respectively, $21 million and $14 million less than estimated. In addition, expenditures on equipment and stores for the R.A.A.F., on naval construction, and on general stores were, respectively, $12 million, $1 1 million and $9 million less than estimated. The cost of maintaining the Australian Military Forces in Malaysia and Vietnam was $6 million more than estimated and expenditure on arms, armaments and equipment, $4 million more. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">
          <inline font-style="italic">Payment to the National Welfare Fund.</inline>The payment to the National Welfare Fund exceeded the Budget estimate by $11 million, mainly because of greater than estimated expenditure on Age and Invalid Pensions, Pharmaceutical Benefits and Widows&#39; Pensions. The number of pensioners and their average pension entitlement, which was affected by increases in pension rates granted in the 1966-67 Budget, were greater than had been allowed for. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">
          <inline font-style="italic">Other Special Appropriations.</inline>Expenditure under Other Special Appropriations exceeded the estimate by $22 million. Drawings of Australian currency from the International Monetary Fund by other countries involved expenditure of $27 million. No allowance for these drawings was made in the Budget estimates. On the other hand, the payment into the Wheat Prices Stabilization Fund was $5 million less than estimated mainly because world prices for wheat were higher than had been expected. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">
          <inline font-style="italic">Departmental Running Expenses.</inline>Expenditure on Departmental Running Expenses exceeded the Budget estimate by $9 million mainly as a result of arbitration determinations, including the interim margins decision, made after the Budget. (In all, arbitration decisions resulted in an increase of about $26 million in Departmental Running Expenses in 1966-67.) </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">
          <inline font-style="italic">Business Undertakings.</inline>Expenditure by the Business Undertakings was $10 million greater than the estimate mainly because of higher wages and salaries paid following arbitration determinations. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">
          <inline font-style="italic">State works and housing programmes.</inline>As State domestic raisings yielded $14 million more than was allowed for at the time of the Budget, the amount of State works and housing programmes met from Commonwealth borrowings was less than had been estimated by that amount. (The increase in programmes before taking account of State domestic raisings was $40 million, or 7 per cent.) </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">
          <inline font-style="italic">Customs Duty.</inline>Customs collections fell short of the estimate by $11 million mainly because imports subject to duty represented a smaller proportion of total imports than had been estimated. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">
          <inline font-style="italic">Excise Duty,</inline>Excise collections were $19 million less than the estimate. Clearances of motor spirit and beer rose less rapidly than estimated and clearances of tobacco products, which had been expected to show a small increase, declined. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">
          <inline font-style="italic">Safes Tax.</inline>Collections were $20 million less than estimated mainly because sales of passenger vehicles which are subject to 25 per cent tax declined slightly in 1966-67. The estimate had allowed for an increase in sales of passenger vehicles in 1966-67. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">
          <inline font-style="italic">Income Tax-Individuals.</inline>Income tax collections from individuals subject to provisional lax were $28 million greater than the estimate. Incomes of individuals other than primary producers rose more in 1965-66 than estimated. These 1965-66 incomes were assessed to tax in 1966-67. Downward variations of provisional tax by self-assessment were less than had been expected. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">
          <inline font-style="italic">Income Tax - Companies.</inline>Collections were $15 million greater than estimated. Company income in 1965-66, which was assessed to tax in 1966-67, declined less than estimat d. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">
          <inline font-style="italic">Pay-roll Tax.</inline>Gross collections of pay-roll tax were $192 million, which was $2 million less than was estimated in the Budget, and rebates to exporters exceeded the Budget estimate by $5 million, with the result that there was a shortfall in net pay-roll tax collections of $7 million. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">Cash proceeds received during 1966-67 from public loans in Australia and overseas and from the International Bank loan for the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority amounted to $699 million. As redemptions totalled $393 million, net loan proceeds for the year amounted to $306 million. In Australia, loan proceeds exceeded redemptions by $388 million, but overseas loan proceeds fell short of redemptions by $82 million. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">There were four Commonwealth public cash loans in Australia in 1966-67. Securities totalling $554 million were issued in these loans and the cash proceeds, after allowing for discounts on the issue price, were $553 million. After excluding loan proceeds received before 30 June 1966, but including receipts in 1966-67 from outstanding instalments and advance subscriptions received up to 30 June 1967, proceeds from public rash loan* in 1966-67 were $563 million. Cash proceeds of $84 million from the sale of Special Bonds during the year brought total borrowing proceeds to $647 million, or $646 million after deducting net expenses of $462,000 charged during 1966-67. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Three public cash loans raised overseas in 1966-67 - two US dollar loans each of $US25 million and a loan for Sf. 50 million issued in Switzerland- yielded $52 million alter deducting loan expenses. A final drawing of $499,000 was made on the International Bank loan for the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority. </para>
        <para>Redemptions in 1966-67 totalled $393 million. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Of the $715 million maturing securities in Australia (other than Special Bonds) which were offered for conversion in 1966-67, an amount of $177 million was redeemed. In addition, Special Bond redemptions of all Series, including Series B and C Bonds finally maturing in 1966-67, amounted to $57 million. Market repurchases and other contractual repurchases in Australia in 1966-67 amounted to $25 million. Total redemptions and repurchases in Australia were $258 million. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Overseas redemptions in 1966-67 were $135 million. This was substantially higher than in previous years because two New York loans and one London loan matured during (he year. The London loan maturing on 1 September 1966 was paid off at a cost of &#163;56 million and the New York loans maturing on 1 December 1966 and 1 June 1967 were also redeemed at a cost of $31 million. Repayments on International Bank loans were $22 million and other contractual commitments and repurchases in New York, London and Canada totalled $25 million. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">In 1966-67, expenditure on Defence Services amounting to $198 million was charged to Loan Fund. To finance this expenditure, a similar amount was borrowed from the Reserve Bank, by the issue of $75 million of securities and $123 million of Treasury Bills. As this was in excess of the amount required for residual financing purposes. $59 million of Treasury Bills were redeemed from the Loan Consolidation and Investment Reserve and $1 million was added to the cash balances of the Commonwealth. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">There was a decline of $26 million in 1966-67 in the value of Treasury Notes on issue. In accordance with arrangements authorised by the Loan Council, there was a corresponding re-issue of Treasury Bills. </para>

        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The main element in the prospective increase in expenditures in 1967-68 is an estimated rise of $168 million, or 18 per cent, in expenditure on Defence Services. This follows an increase of $202 million, or 27 per cent, in 1966-67. Of the total amount of $950 million expended on Defence Services in that year, $91 million was financed under credit arrangements for defence purchases in the United States of America, lt is expected that about $138 million of the estimated amount of $1,118 million to be expended in 1967-68 will bo financed in the same way </para>

        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Further details of the 1967-68 estimates of expenditures are given in Statement No. 3. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">After allowing for the effects of the proposed increases in Post Office charges and the other revenue proposals referred to in the Budget Speech - these are expected to result in a net addition of $19 million to revenues in 1967-68  -  total receipts are estimated to increase in 1967-68 by $499 million, or 9.3 per cent. In 1966-67. total receipts increased by 6 per cent. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Within the total, taxation collections are estimated to increase by $365 million, compared with an increase of $267 million in 1966-67. It is expected that income tax collections, as well as collections from other taxes, will benefit from a strong increase in employment, incomes and spending in 1967-68. Income tax collections in 1967-68 will also reflect the improvement in 1966-67 of incomes of primary producers and companies, which had declined in 1965-66 </para>
        <para>Details of the estimates of receipts are given in Statement No. 4. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Total Commonwealth expenditures in 1967-68 are estimated to exceed total receipts by $596 million. This would be $61 million greater than the excess of expenditures over receipts in 1966-67. (In 1966-67, the excess was $284 million greater than in 1965-66.1 </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">As 10 the financing of the prospective excess of expenditures over receipts of $596 million, it is expected that net drawings under the credit arrangements for defence purchases in the United States of America will amount to $123 million, compared with $91 million in 1966-67. That would leave an estimated $473 million to be obtained from the other categories of borrowings. The comparable figure in 1966-67 was $444 million. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">As regards overseas borrowings, redemptions are again likely to exceed new loan proceeds but the excess is likely to be smaller than in 1966-67, when it was $82 million. Consequently, the net amount to be borrowed locally to finance the prospective excess of expenditures over receipts is not likely to be larger than in 1966-67. In that year.a net $527 million was borrowed locally. The Government will be seeking to obtain the major part of the amount required by way of net subscriptions to Commonwealth loans and Special Bonds, especially from sources outside the banking system. It is expected, however, that some borrowing from the Reserve Bank will be necessary. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">What the eventual composition of borrowings will be and what they will involve in the way of finance, not only from the Reserve Bank but also from the rest of the banking system, cannot be estimated in advance with any degree of precision. Much will turn on the ability and willingness of the non-bank public to add to its holdings of Commonwealth securities in 1967-68. That, in turn, will depend on, amongst other things, how other factors affecting the monetary situation develop during the year. The implications of the Budget in relation to the monetary situation are discussed further in Statement No. 5 and in Chapter II of the Supplement to the Treasury Information Bulletin entitled &#39;National Accounting Estimates of Public Authority Receipts and Expenditure&#39; published concurrently with the Budget. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The estimates of expenditures and receipts that have been summarised above are estimates compiled on a conventional basis. To indicate more clearly what they imply in terms of the effects they may have on the growth of expenditure, income and demand in the economy, these prospective transactions may be expressed in national accounting terms. They are shown in that form in Statement No. 6. As pointed out there, a substantial part of the estimated increase in Commonwealth outlays in 1967-68 will represent direct expenditure overseas. It is expected that outlays overseas will increase by about 29 per cent, and local outlays by about 8.5 percent in 1967-68. In 1966-67, the comparable increases were 23.8 per cent and 10.4 per cent, respectively. </para>

Substantial payments will be due in 1967-68 in respect of aircraft (Tracker, Skyhawk, FI I l-C, Orion, Mirage, Macchi, H.S. 748, BAC-I1 1), ships (Submarines, Destroyers) and other equipment purchased under the current three year Defence Programme.

The estimate allows for the expected effect of the decision taken al the June 1967 Premiers&#39; Conference to include that $5,000,000 special assistance in the formula &#39;base&#39; for purposes of determining the financial assistance grants for 1967-68 and subsequent years. <inline font-style="italic">Or.</inline> the other hand, payments amounting to 810,750.000 were made in 1966-67 to assist the budgets of New South Wales and Queensland, which had been adversely affected by drought, but no such payments are to be made in 1967-68; and the special grants recommended by the Commonwealth Grants Commission for payment to Western Australia and Tasmania in 1967-68 are $4,665,000 less than the grants paid to these States in 1966-67. </para>

On the other hand,the proceeds of other loan raisings overseas fell short of redemptions overseasby$82 million, thus leaving a net amount of only  $9  million in respect of overseas borrowings. (These figures do not include borrowings overseas for aircraft financing purposes on behalf ofQantas Airways Limited and the Australian National Airlines Commission.) </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">In  1967-68,  drawings under the credit arrangements for defence purchases are estimated at  $123  million, comprising drawings of  $138  million less repayments of$1  4  million. This would be  $33  million more than the amount drawn last year. It is not possible to  make  a reliable estimate of other loan raisings overseas in  1967-68  as much will depend on how circumstances affecting international capital markets develop during the year. It is expected, however, that overseas redemptions will be less than in  1966-67,  when there were two New York maturities. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">
        <inline font-style="italic">Borrowings in Australia.</inline>It is not possible to make a firm estimate of the amount which will have to be raised locally. Nevertheless, it seems reasonable to assume that, despite the prospective increase of  $61  million in  1967-68  in the excessof expenditures over receipts, the net amount to be borrowed in Australia will not be larger than in1966-  67  when a net  $527  million was borrowed locally. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The Government will be seeking to obtain the major part of this by way of net subscriptions to Commonwealth loans and Special Bonds, especially from sources outside the banking system. In  1966-67,  a net amount of  $388  million was obtained in Australia from public loan operations and the issueof Special Bonds. Gross cash proceeds of public loans amounted to$563 million and the gross proceeds from the issue of Special Bonds were  $84  million; on the other hand, redemptions of market securities totalled  $177  million and of Special Bonds  $57  million, and other repurchases and redemptions totalled  $25  million. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Commonwealth inscribed stock and bonds other than Special Bonds outstanding at  30  June  1967  and due to mature in  1967-68  totalled  $819  million; the comparable amount at  30  June  1966  was  $792  million. Redemptions could be at least as large as last year and net loan raisings in Australia could show some decline from the abnormally high level reached in  1966-67.It  is expected, therefore, that some borrowing from the Reserve Bank will be necessary </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The prospect that borrowings from the Reserve Bank will be necessary to complete the financing of the excess of expenditures over receipts is, of course, relevant to the question of what the effects of the Budget might be on the money supply and on the liquidity of the public arid the banking system. Borrowings from the Reserve Bank cannot be considered in isolation as many other factors also influence the relationship between the Budget and the monetary situation. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The main effect of the Budget on the monetary situation derives&#39; from the size and rate of change of the excess of expenditures over receipts. Any increase in that excess, except to the extent that it is due to expenditure overseas, will make possible an equivalent increase in the Budget&#39;s contribution to the increase in the money supply. This is simply a reflection of the fact that, broadly speaking, Budget expenditures domestically add to the money supply and Budget receipts subtract from it. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Given the excess of expenditures over receipts, the way in which it is financed will also affect the monetary situation. At this point, however, analysis and prediction are complicated by the fact that the monetary situation - which is the product of a complex of interacting factors including not only the Budget but the balance of payments (in which Government transactions figure substantially), Rural Credits Advances and bank lending - in turn itself influences the way in which the excess is financed. There are complex interactions between the two and no straightforward cause and effect relationship can be isolated. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">There is one useful concept that can advance analysis of the monetary effects of the Budget a little further than is possible by focusing attention on borrowings from the Reserve Bank. Spending financed by borrowings from the Reserve Bank does, of course, tend to add commensurately to monetary expansion. However, the same is essentially true of spending financed, directly or indirectly, by the rest of the banking system whereas, to the extent that the non-bank public adds to its stock of Government securities without drawing on bank credit, there is an offset to the expansionary effect on the money supply of the spending of the funds concerned. It is, therefore, important, for purposes of assessing the monetary effects of a Budget, to make a distinction between Government borrowings from the banking system as a whole and borrowings from the non-bank public. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">That this point might take on some significance in practice can be illustrated by experience in 1 966-67. In that year, the amount borrowed locally was $527 million. As shown earlier, $165 million was borrowed from the Reserve Bank but, as a result of other transactions in Commonwealth securities, the net increase in Reserve Bank- holdings of such securities was $124 million. However, during 1966-67 the banking system as a whole increased its holdings of Commonwealth securities by $277 million (face value); an amount equivalent to a little more than one half of the amount financed locally. The remainder was represented by an increase in the security holdings of the non-bank public. It is apparent from the size of the increase in holdings of securities by the banking system that a significantly greater volume of bank credit: than is evident in the net figure of borrowings from the Reserve Bank was involved in the financing of the excess of expenditures over receipts in 1966-67. lt should be added that the influence of the banking system on net security transactions is not fully reflected in the figures mentioned above. For example, an increase in bank <inline font-style="italic">lending</inline> to t he short term money market may have the ultimate effect of increasing the money market&#39;s holdings of securities - and also of reducing those of the banking system. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">In the event, the total money supply in 1966-67 increased by the large amount of $886 million. It is not possible to disentangle the effects of the Budget on this monetary expansion from the effects of all other relevant factors. However, the substantial increase in the banking system&#39;s holdings of securities does provide a firmer starting point in analysing relationships between security transactions, including those arising out of the need to finance the excess of expenditures over receipts, than does the figure of borrowings from the Reserve Bank. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">In 1967-68, the excess of expenditures over receipts likely to be financed locally is not expected to be any larger than in 1966-67. It is impossible to predict the direct and indirect role the banking system will play in financing it as that will depend on many other factors affecting the monetary situation. Nor is it possible to make any firm predictions as to the extent to which the total money supply might increase in  1967-68.  Nevertheless, a further sizable increase in the money supply does appear to be in prospect - though not perhaps as large as in the financial year just closed. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The relationship of the Budget to the monetary situation is discussed in more detail in Chapter II of the Supplement to the Treasury Information Bulletin entitled &#39;National Accounting Estimates of Public Authority Receipts and Expenditure&#39; published concurrently with the Budget. </para>

It is not expected that it will be necessary to use this proposed authority to anything like the full extent, but, as usual, it will provide against possible contingencies. The Loan Bill will also seek authority for the proceeds of any borrowings made under it to be expended on Defence Services. The effect of charging expenditure on Defence Services to Loan Fund would be to increase the estimated payment from the Consolidated Revenue Fund to the Loan Consolidation and Investment Reserve and provision for this has accordingly been included in the Appropriation Bill (No.  1) 1967-68. </para>

      <para pgwide="yes">As a general proposition it may be said that outlays from the Budget tend to add, directly or indirectly, to demands on production or imports and that receipts tend to subtract from the level of demand which would be forthcoming in their absence. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Total outlay is estimated to increase by S582 million or 10.3 per cent in 1967-68, compared with an increase of S579 million or 11.5 per cent in 1966-67. Total receipts are estimated to increase by &#167;435 million or 8.5 per cent in 1967-68, compared with an increase of S293 million or 6. 1 per cent in 1966-67. &#60;&#39;) A Supplement to the Treasury Information Bulletin entitled &#39;National Accounting Estimates of Public Authority Receipts and Expenditure&#39;. being published concurrently with the Budget, provides corresponding data tor Commonwealth authorities outside the Budget and additional information on various aspects of the national accounting presentation employed in this Statement. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">In order to assess the implications of the Budget for the trend in incomes and expenditures in the economy, it is necessary to bring together estimates of movements in outlay and in receipts. A first step towards an assessment could be made (though in a simple way which does not take account of many important factors) by comparing movements in the excess of <inline font-style="italic">total</inline> outlay over <inline font-style="italic">total</inline> receipts. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">This excess is estimated to increase in 1967-68  -  that is, total outlays are estimated to rise by more than total receipts. The size of the estimated increase is, however, much smaller than the actual increase in 1966-67. As the last une in the table above shows, the gap between outlays and receipts increased by $286 million in that year, whereas in 1967-68 the estimated gap is $147 million greater than in 1966-67. So far as this simple test goes, it indicates that the initial impact of the Budget should be expansionary, but not to the same degree as that of the 1966-67 Budget. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">This comparison is, however, a very crude one. The effects of individual outlays and receipts differ so significantly, one from another, that it is, in practice, not possible to measure the totality of the complex effects of a Budget upon an economy by any single figure, lt <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> possible, however, to distinguish particular categories of receipts and outlays according to their implications for the economy including the balance of payments. Some of the mora important of these distinctions are discussed below, under the following headings: </para>

      <para pgwide="yes">On the outlay side of the Budget there is an important distinction between payments made within Australia and payments made overseas. Payments abroad by the Commonwealth are relevant in assessing balance of payments prospects in the year ahead, and in any longer-term assessment they also have important implications for the domestic economy. They do not, however, add to domestic incomes and the demand for locally-produced goods and services. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">On the other hand, payments by the Commonwealth within Australia add, for the most part, to domestic expenditure and incomes. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">To some extent, payments within Australia may still add indirectly to overseas rather than Australian incomes, because orders met by local suppliers may include an import content. It is not possible to make reliable estimates of the import content of Commonwealth expenditure within Australia. However, the proportion would not be large, and it may be assumed that it is unlikely to change markedly between one year and -the next. By contrast, direct payments overseas by the Commonwealth may fluctuate widely between one year and another; since these fluctuations are not relevant to an assessment of the impact oi&#39; the Budget on the domestic economy in the year immediately ahead it is necessary, for the purpose of such an assessment, to exclude payments made (or to be made) directly overseas.( This is done in the following table: </para>

      <para pgwide="yes">It will be noted that, as was the case last year, overseas outlays are expected to rise much more rapidly than domestic outlays in 1967-68. Thus, whereas total outlay in 1967-68 is estimated to rise by $582 million or 10.3 per cent, the estimated rise of $435 million in domestic outlays represents an increase of 8.5 per cent. This is a smaller increase than in 1966-67 when domestic outlays rose by $482 million or 10.4 per cent. </para>

      <para pgwide="yes">On the outlay side of the Budget there is a further basic distinction between expenditure on goods and services, which adds directly to demand for domestic production or imports, and transfers and loans from the Budget, which increase the capacity of other sectors to purchase goods and services. In either case, &#39;multiplier&#39; effects induce further increases in demand, additional to the initial effects here described. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Payments from the Budget to purchase goods and services add immediately to demand (that is, to Gross National Expenditure) to the full extent of the payments involved. Except insofar as such payments add (directly or indirectly) to demand for imports, they also represent an addition to demand for domestic production - that is, Gross National Product. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">By contrast, transfer payments and loans from the Budget do not add directly to demand for output or imports. The impact of such payments on total demand depends on their effects on the spending of the recipients. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Almost one-half of the transfer payments and net loans from the Commonwealth Budget are to the States. Together with the funds available to the States from their own resources, these outlays are used by the State governments and their authorities to finance their expenditures, which are predominantly expenditures on goods and services. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The other main types of transfer payments from the Budget are cash benefits to persons and payments of interest on Government debt. Increases in such payments do not <inline font-style="italic">directly</inline> affect total expenditure in the economy. Their effects depend on the proportion spent (rather than saved) by the recipients. This would vary, and would almost certainly be greater in respect of cash benefits than interest payments. </para>

      <para pgwide="yes">Domestic expenditure on goods and services is again estimated to rise by a larger percentage than transfer payments, but the increase is considerably smaller than in 1966-67. On the other hand, the increase in payments and net loans to the States is estimated to be significantly larger in 1967-68 than in 1966-67. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The estimated increase in the other main component of transfer payments - cash benefits to persons - is S49 million in 1967-68, compared with an actual increase of &#167;91 million in 1966-67. A large part of the difference between these increases arises because of variations in the incidence of payments as between financial years, which have no significance for economic analysis. The net effect of this factor was to add $5 million to the increase in outlay on cash benefits which would otherwise have occurred in 1966-67 and to reduce the estimated increase by S20 million in 1967-68. These changes thus account for S25 million of the difference between the increases in cash benefits to persons, and in domestic outlay, shown in the table. </para>

      </list>
      <para pgwide="yes">The effects on the economy of changes in the Commonwealth&#39;s receipts are more con.ectural than the effects of changes in outlays. The main reason for this is that movements in receipts, while they also influence trends in economic activity, are at the same time very much influenced by those trends. Those trends are in turn determined by the Budget and by all of the other forces, domestic or external, operating in the economy. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">A rather arbitrary but useful distinction may be made by dividing the change in total receipts into three categories, according to the influences determining the respective movements. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">In the first place there is the movement in total receipts between one year and another which results from (or is estimated to result from) changes or proposed changes in rates of taxation and charges. This movement may be described as the &#39;discretionary&#39; change in receipts. In assessing the impact of the Budget, such increases must, generally speaking, be regarded as an offset to the effects on total demand of increases in outlays from the Budget. Whatever the <inline font-style="italic">purpose</inline> of particular changes in rates of taxation and charges, one of the <inline font-style="italic">effects</inline> of such changes is on the expenditure of the private sector.(l) </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Secondly, there is the movement in receipts, at unchanged rates of taxation and charges, which is essentially a product of concurrent trends in expenditure and income in the economy as a whole. This movement, which will be described as the &#39;induced&#39; change in receipts, may be determined approximately by taking the total of the changes, other than &#39;discretionary&#39; changes, in indirect taxes, public enterprises income and gross collections of P.A.Y.E. instalment deductions. &#39;Induced&#39; increases in receipts differ from &#39;discretionary&#39; increases in that they are a <inline font-style="italic">consequence</inline> of, rather than an <inline font-style="italic">offset</inline> to, the trend in activity resulting from Commonwealth expenditures and other influences. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Finally, there is the net change in those items of receipts which do not depend to any significant degree on economic trends in the year concerned. The principal items are income taxes on companies and on persons subject to provisional tax, which are related to incomes in the year prior to the collection of the tax.(*) This category also includes interest, some minor items of receipts and (negatively) refunds of excess P.A.Y.E. deductions. The change in these may be termed the &#39;independent&#39; change in receipts. This term connotes no-more than that they are largely independent of economic trends in the year of collection. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The effects of such increases on spending are particularly difficult to determine. They are, for the most part, similar to &#39;discretionary&#39; changes in that they are not affected to any significant degree by economic trends occurring in the year of collection. In other respects, however, they are very different. The effects of such increases largely depend on business decisions rather than personal decisions to spend; they involve, to an important degree, (&#39;) The effect on private spending is unlikely to be as great as the change in receipts, because there would also be effects on savings. </para>

      <para pgwide="yes">In both years, the &#39;induced&#39; increase in receipts, which is essentially a product of the concurrent growth in economic activity, accounts for the greater part of the total increase. As already noted, the increase in receipts arising from this growth cannot be regarded as offsetting the effects on demand of increases in budgetary outlays. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The net increase in receipts resulting from changes or proposed changes in rates and charges is relatively small in both years. (However, the movement between 1965-66 and 1966- 67 largely reflects the residual &#39;full year&#39; effects of changes in the 1965-66 Budget, while the movement between 1966-67 and 1967-68 represents the estimated net increase in receipts in 1967-68 which is attributable to changes in taxes and charges proposed in the 1967- 68 Budget.) The estimated increase in collections of taxes related primarily to the previous year&#39;s income (referred to above as &#39;independent&#39; increases) is much larger in 1967-68 than the actual increase in 1966-67.

        <item label="(a)">
          <para>Although total outlay (which tends to add to demand for production and imports) is estimated to rise by about the same amount as in 1966-67, the rate of increase is expected to fall from 11.5 per cent in 1966-67 to 10.3 per cent in 1967-68. </para>

            <item label="(6)">
              <para>At the same time, total receipts (which tend to subtract from the level of demand) are estimated to rise by 8.5 per cent as compared with 6. 1 per cent last year. </para>

          <para>Thus, whereas the gap between outlays and receipts increased by $286 million in 1966-67, the increase in 1967-68 is estimated at $147 million. So far as this simple test goes, it indicates that the initial impact of the Budget should be expansionary, but not to the same degree as that of the 1966-67 Budget. </para>
        </item>
        <item label="(d)">
          <para>However, the implications of the Budget for trends in expenditure and income in the economy depend not on <inline font-style="italic">total</inline> outlays and receipts, but primarily on the size of the increase in domestic outlays which is not offset by <inline font-style="italic">certain elements</inline> of the increase in receipts. </para>
        </item>
        <item label="(e)">
          <para>As overseas outlays are estimated to rise much more rapidly, in percentage terms, than total outlay, the estimated rate of increase in <inline font-style="italic">domestic</inline> outlays, of 8.5 per cent, is less than the overall figures might imply. The comparable increase in 1966-67 was 10.4 per cent. (/) In assessing the implications for the economy of domestic outlays from the Budget, trends in the main components are also relevant - particularly the movements in expenditure on goods and services on the one hand and in transfer payments on the other. </para>
        </item>
        <item label="(g)">
          <para>Those components of the total increase in receipts which may be regarded as offsetting, in greater or less degree, the effects of increases in domestic outlays are estimated to rise by a somewhat larger amount in 1967-68 than in 1966-67. The prospective effects on private spending of this larger increase are. however, particularly difficult to assess or predict. (/i) The implications of the movements in those components of outlays and receipts referred to above reinforce the tentative assessment made above that the initial impact of the 1967-68 Budget should be expansionary, but not to the same degree as its predecessor. </para>

      <para pgwide="yes">Numerous changes have been made in the financial accounting arrangements of the Commonwealth Government since 1953-54. The figures for that and subsequent years have been adjusted so as to produce the greatest practicable degree of consistency but it has not been possible to remove all inconsistencies. The more important ones that remain arise from accounting changes made in 1963-64 and 1966-67. Since 1963-64, credits amounting to $44,034,000, which in earlier years had been offset against expenditure, have been paid to revenue, tn 1966-67, following the revision of the National Debt Sinking Fund Act, a reduction of about $82,000,000 in the income of the Fund was offset by an addition of about $32,000,000 to Other Revenue.

        <graphic href="056131196708156_66_44.jpg" />
      </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The various items shown in this table accord with the criteria of external economic aid adopted by the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD and the figures are, therefore, broadly comparable with the economic aid statistics published by that body for Australia and other donor countries!1). These figures do not include, of course, the amount which Australia is providing by way of defence aid. Nor do the figures allow for the hidden &#39;subsidy&#39; involved in the fact that the numerous private and officially-sponsored overseas students at various educational institutions in Australia are assisted indirectly by the subventions which the Commonwealth and State Governments make towards the running expenses and capital costs of such institutions. (*) The figures of Australia&#39;s aid effort published by the Development Assistance Committee, in fact, tend to be somewhat higher than the above figures. For example, the Development Assistance Committee includes as official aid portion of the annual contributions made to the regular budgets of the United Nations and of such U.N. Specialised Agencies as the World Health Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization, the International Labour Organization and the U.N. Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization. </para>
      <para>Some brief comments follow on the more important items in the table. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">
        <inline font-style="italic">International Development Association (IDA).</inline>The main function of IDA, which is an affiliate of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, is to help developing countries by providing loans on concessional terms. Thus, IDA extends development credits repayable over fifty years without interest, although a small service charge is imposed to cover administrative expenses. When EDA was set up in 1960, Australia agreed to contribute $18 million over a five-year period, and in 1963 Australia agreed to contribute a further $17.7 million over a three-year period to help replenish the Association&#39;s resources. As cash payments to IDA during the period to 30 June 1967 amounted to $20.8 million, an amount of $14.9 million remains outstanding in respect of these commitments. Calls on this amount by IDA during 1967-68 are estimated at $8.3 million, compared with $6 million last year. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">
        <inline font-style="italic">Asian Development Bank.</inline>Australia agreed to subscribe $US85 million ($75.9 million) to the capital stock of this Bank, which was set up recently in Manila to promote the economic growth of developing countries in the ECAFE region. One-half of this subscription will remain at call while the balance is payable in five equal annual instalments - half in convertible currency and half in domestic currency. The amount of $3,795,000 provided in the Budget estimates represents the second annual instalment of the convertible currency portion of Australia&#39;s capital subscription. The domestic currency portion of these instalments is made available initially by way of non-negotiable, non-interest-bearing demand securities lodged with the Reserve Bank of Australia. These securities may be cashed as and when the Asian Development Bank needs funds for the purchase in Australia of goods and services required in its lending operations. As the Bank has not yet commenced lending operations, no provision has been made in the Budget estimates for any calls by the Bank during 1967-68 on the domestic currency portion of Australia&#39;s subscription. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">
        <inline font-style="italic">Other Multilateral Programmes.</inline>For the most part, the estimates provide for a continuation of existing rates of contribution to various U.N. aid programmes. It has been decided, however, to increase Australia&#39;s contribution to the U.N. Development Programme by $132,000 consequent upon the establishment of the new United Nations Industrial Development Organisation: this increase will be applied to industrialisation projects in developing countries. The higher provision for the World Food Programme allows for an expected increase in calls upon Australia&#39;s pledge to contribute a total of SUS2.25 million to this Programme over the period 1966 to 1968. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">
        <inline font-style="italic">Colombo Plan.</inline>The Colombo Plan is the most important of Australia&#39;s numerous bilateral aid programmes. Aid to Colombo Plan countries has taken the form of providing both technical assistance facilities and help in undertaking specific development projects. Technical assistance has included not only the training in Australia of students, government officials and other people from member countries but also the provision of Australian experts to work overseas in developing countries. Under the Economic Development Programme, machinery and equipment, etc., is provided for particular projects undertaken in developing countries. Expenditure under the Colombo Plan in 1967-68 is estimated at $18.6 million, or $5.9 million more than last year. This includes provision for special emergency assistance of $5.2 million for Indonesia. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">
        <inline font-style="italic">International Grains Agreement - Food Aid Programme.</inline>Arising out of the recent GATT cereals negotiations in the Kennedy Round, Australia has undertaken to contribute 225,000 tons of wheat (or its equivalent in flour), valued at $13.5 million, each year for a period of three years to a new food aid programme to be set up m the context of the proposed International Grains Agreement now being negotiated in Rome. As this programme is not expected to operate for the full year 1967-68, an amount of $9.5 million has been provided in the Budget estimates for this purpose. A gift of 150,000 tons- of wheat to India, valued at $9 million, has already been arranged. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">
        <inline font-style="italic">Other Bilateral Programmes.</inline>The estimates provide for minor increases in various technical assistance programmes, such as the Special Commonwealth African Assistance Plan and the Commonwealth Co-operation in Education Scheme, and a new provision of $60,000 has been made to cover the administrative costs of setting up a Register of Experts&#39; Services under the auspices of the recently established Asian and Pacific Council. The S.E.A.T.O. Aid programme will be increased to $2.5 million in 1967-68 and it is expected that this year Australia will be called upon to contribute $126,000 more to the Indus Basin Development Fund than in 1966-67. The provision for the South Pacific Aid Programme has been increased by $253,000. The reduced provision for the Foreign Exchange Operations Fund in Laos reflects the fact that Australia was called upon to make a supplementary contribution to this Fund in 1966. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">
        <inline font-style="italic">Papua and New Guinea.</inline>Provision has been made in the Budget for a grant to the Administration of Papua and New Guinea of $77.6 million, which is $7.8 million more than last year <inline font-style="italic">(see</inline> Statement No. 3). In addition, various Commonwealth Departments and instrumentalities incur in the Territory expenditures of an economic character which are currently running at an annual rate of about $14 million. </para>

          <para>That the Bil&#93; be now read a second time. </para>
          <para class="block">As my colleague, the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon),</inline> indicated when presenting the Budget for 1967-68, the Government proposes to amend the Post and Telegraph Rates Act to provide for increases in a range of postal and telegraph charges. Honourable members will recall that the Senate has twice rejected such measures, which dealt with certain basic charges, and disallowed regulations covering a range of other charges. There can be no question that these increases are necessary and the Government is concerned about the financial effect of further delay in the introduction of the new rates. In addition to this Bill, I will shortly be introducing further legislation dealing with those rates previously the subject of regulations. It is the Government&#39;s intention that the full range of new charges be open to debate during consideration of this first Bill. </para>
          <para>I am presenting statements showing in detail the proposed adjustments in postal and telecommunications charges. These include not only those covered by this legislation but also those adjustments which will be the subject of the further Bill. The Government is proposing that all the new rates take effect from 1st October next. </para>
          <para>When these matters were last before the House I stressed that, although the Post Office has obligations of service to the community, it is also a national business which should pay its way. The Government views as a business investment the substantial capital funds provided from annual Budgets for the expansion of the Post Office&#39;s services, and expects the Post Office, like any other business, to earn sufficient revenue from the sale of its services at least to cover its costs, including interest on capital. </para>
          <para>This leads me to refer to another statement made by the Treasurer in his Budget Speech regarding the Government&#39;s decision to create a Post Office trust account. Appropriate legislation to enable the introduction of this new financial arrangement as from 1st July 1968 will be brought down in due course. It will, however, enable honourable members to view the Post Office tariffs and finances in better perspective if I outline briefly the changes proposed and the main reasons for them. </para>
          <para>The Post Office is continually involved in making business judgments and decisions, it must react quickly to variations in demand for its services, and it is subject to the added discipline of planning its expenditure with an eye to the revenue and the net financial out-turn it will yield, as well as to the service rendered to the community. </para>
          <para>While the Government and Post Office management recognise all this and expect the Post Office to conduct its affairs on a business basis, it nevertheless still operates within the same financial machinery as any other department of state. The Post Office is required to pay all of its revenue into the Consolidated Revenue Fund, and it must draw all of the funds it needs for operating and capital purposes from annual parliamentary appropriations. These financial arrangements are not suited to the operations of a business undertaking and in fact detract from the ability of the Post Office to operate efficiently on a business basis. They also pose difficulties, rather than assist, in bringing about effective parliamentary control and public understanding of the Post Office&#39;s finances. The new financial arrangements will do much to remove these difficulties and will provide for the Post Office to operate its own trading account into which all its revenues will be paid and from which all expenses, both capital and operating, will be met. </para>
          <para>Because of the likely levels of capital investment required, particularly in the telecommunications area, the revenues of the Post Office will not be sufficient to meet all its needs in any year. It will be dependent therefore upon Parliament for its cash requirements over and above its revenues, and requests for additional funds, or net borrowings, will be dealt with through the normal Budget procedures and the Estimates debate. </para>
          <para>To give a better appreciation of its operations and prospects, the Post Office will submit a White Paper to Parliament at the Budget session each year outlining its affairs generally and including estimates of its commercial results for the year, the proposed capital programme, and the method of financing it. There will still be presented an annual report, together with financial statements and the report thereon of the Auditor-General. The Post Office will thus be still subject to parliamentary and ministerial control and honourable members should be in a position to be much better informed than under the present system. </para>
          <para>It is against this background of the Post Office being regarded as a business enterprise and the Government&#39;s intention to give it business-type financial arrangements, that the measures I am now bringing before the House should be considered. When these matters were before the House recently, I outlined in some detail the nature and scope of the proposed new charges, and I do not intend to go into the same detail again. Since the matter was last dealt with in the House, however, several changes have been made in the proposals, and I will, of course, deal with them fully. </para>
          <para>It needs to be emphasised that there have been no overall increases in postage rates for eight years, since the basic postage rate of 5d was introduced in 1959. In fact, the only significant change has been the reduction in the basic rate to 4c at the time of the changeover to decimal currency last year. This has so far cost the postal service almost $lm in lower revenue. </para>
          <para>Although there have been continual improvements in efficiency and productivity, in recent years it has not been possible to absorb the increases in wage rates which have been granted to postal staff. Consequently, losses on postal operations have occurred and are increasing rapidly. The postal service was able to maintain a breakeven financial position over the five year period from 1959-60 to 1963-64, averaging a profit of about $900,000. </para>
          <para>In 1964-65, however, a loss of $2.6m was incurred and this was followed in 1965-66 by a loss of $10.3m. The loss incurred in 1966-67 is expected to exceed $20m and in the current financial year, with current postal tariffs and allowing for a continuation of recent cost trends, might exceed $30m. Over the last two years, the extra wages payable as a result of variations to awards totalled more than $12m compared with an increase of only $7m in postal revenue in the same period. Awards have already added almost $6m to postal service costs this financial year, the recent national wage decision alone adding $2m. </para>
          <para>Increases in postal rates are required to offset these increasing losses. Australian postage rates compare more than favourably with those in other countries, especially when allowance is made for the huge size of our continent and the scattered nature of a large proportion of our population. A proposal for a 6c basic postage rate, equivalent to 5.7c Australian, is before the United States Congress at present; and I understand that the British Post Office is considering an increase to 5d, equivalent to 5.2c Australian. The United States Post Office this financial year is expected to have a deficit of $ 1,800m. The basic postal rate for letters in the European Economic Community countries is 7c Australian and each country concerned is recording a continuing loss in mail service operations. For example, the West German Post Office last year incurred a loss in its mail operations of $A90m. </para>
          <para>The proposed changes in postal rates and conditions are set out in the statements which I have circulated. The most important single change is the increase in the basic postage rate from 4c to 5c. As I have already said, I do not intend to repeat the detailed explanations of the various postal rate proposals I gave previously, for no alterations have been made to the increases I submitted earlier in the year, except in respect of postage discounts. </para>
          <para>The postage discounts of up to 25% will be welcomed by the business community. These will be available to large users who reduce Post Office handling costs by presorting their mail and by meeting certain other posting conditions concerning make-up and transmission. The discount allowed will vary according to the size of the consignment and the amount of presorting by the customer. Two variations have been made to the discount conditions previously submitted. Firstly, the minimum quantity of mail which must be posted to be eligible for a 5% discount has been reduced from 5,000 to 2,500. This change will allow many smaller firms to participate in the scheme. Secondly, postings in large envelopes, as well as those in small and medium size standard envelopes, will be eligible for discounts. </para>
          <para class="block">The inclusion of postcodes in the addresses on discount mail will be a requirement from 1st October 1968. </para>
          <para>A variation has also been made to the postage discount which it is proposed to apply to the householder mail service, by which articles addressed to &#39;The Householder&#39; or similar title are delivered to each point in a designated area. At present a flat 30% discount applies. Earlier proposals envisaged a flat 40% discount, but the Government now proposes a 40% discount on articles up to 2 oz in weight and a 60% discount on articles over 2 oz. A survey has shown that this will not incur a loss of revenue. On the contrary, the increased business that will result is expected to increase it. Attention is also drawn to the revised date of effect of new size limits for enveloped mail eligible for conveyance by air free of airmail fees within Australia and its Territories under Operation Post Haste. This will be effective from 1st October 1967. Fu:4 details are set out in the statements which I am presenting. </para>
          <para>It will be necessary for the proposed increases in domestic rates to be applied to several international rates for surface mail. The price for aerogrammes will also be increased from 9c to 10c. These will be effected by Executive action as authorised by the Post and Telegraph Act. The variations in postal charges which I have outlined, together with those which will be dealt with in detail in a further Bill and some miscellaneous charges which will be covered by administrative action, will, if introduced on 1st October 1967, bring in additional earnings of approximately $22m in 1967-68 and $30m in the first full year. </para>
          <para>It will be appreciated that the additional earnings of $22m in 1967-68 will not now offset the predicted loss, at current tariffs, of at least $30m. If the new tariffs had operated from 1st July last the postal service could well have broken even during 1967-68. Even with the tariff adjustments now proposed it is estimated that a loss exceeding $10m will be incurred in 1968-9. This figure is, in fact, higher than the estimate I gave to the House when this matter was last debated. Before the end of the financial year it could only have been an estimate. The Department is continuing to explore all means of arresting the loss trend in the postal service, but because it is a labour intensive enterprise these efforts are largely nullified by the continued wage increases granted to Post Office employees along with other members of the community. In the circumstances, it would appear that our experience may be similar to that in, for example, the United Kingdom where a select parliamentary committee drawn from all parties concluded in a report of February 1967: </para>
          <list type="lowerroman-dotted">
            <item label=".">
              <para>. the need for periodic tariff increases appears to your Committee to be inescapable if the general standards of the postal services are to be preserved. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>The telecommunication tariff proposals in this Bill cover only increases in telegram rates. Telephone call fees and trunk rates, together with some adjustment of charges for miscellaneous telecommunication facilities and services, will be dealt with in the further Bill I have already mentioned. Apart from a minor adjustment in 1964, telegram rates have not been altered since 1956. The telegram service is operating at a loss unci it is proposed to increase telegram rates by 20%. The new charges for ordinary rate messages will be 36c for the first 12 words and 3c for each additional word, compared with the current rates of 30c for the first 12 words and 5c for each additional two words. The revised telegram rates will bring in additional revenues of about $600,000 in 1967-68 and $lm in a full year, but the telegram service will continue to operate at a toss. </para>
          <para>In the White Paper presented recently in the British House of Commons outlining certain changes within the British Post Office, this paragraph was included: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Corporation will inherit a number of public services which cannot be made financially viable at any reasonable level of charge. The outstanding example is the inland telegraph service, which has run at a loss for many decades and cannot hope to pay for itself as its use continues to decline. Obligations of this kind are normally taken into account when financial targets are fixed. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>I found during my recent visit overseas that the problems faced by the Australian Post Office have a parallel in almost every country in the world - namely, that telephone services are generally profitable, but profits are dwindling each year, telegraph services show a small but continuing loss, and postal services invariably are operated at a great loss. Every administration has, or is, considering increasing its charges, not only for mail services but for others too, because other profits are becoming smaller each year. All administrations are looking forward to some mechanisation to handle the mails more speedily and economically. </para>
          <para>There is no doubt in my mind that Australia&#39;s communication services compare favourably with those of other countries, particularly as we have the problem of a large area and a small and scattered population outside the capital cities and principal provincial centres. The electronic mail coding equipment Australia is using is undoubtedly the best in the world. The nearest approach to its efficiency and sophistication I saw was in Germany where it is still in very limited use. </para>
          <para>It has always been held by succeeding governments, irrespective of their politics, that the Post Office should be operated as a business undertaking and that those who use the services should pay for them. For this reason it has been the custom for measures varying Post Office charges to be given free passage through both Houses of Parliament. The previous Bill to vary certain charges, whilst it passed this House, was rejected twice in another place. Similarly, regulations to amend certain other charges were rejected by the Senate in an unprecedented special sitting. </para>
          <para>It is quite apparent to the Government that this action was taken for political purposes only - an endeavour, in fact, to gain political kudos from the Australian people. What it has done in the result is to reduce the ability of the Post Office this year to be reasonably profitable and perhaps to affect adversely the essential services being demanded by the Australian public. It would be interesting to have an explanation by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> of the reason why the Australian Labor Party has changed its Post Office philosophy. I commend the Bill to honourable members. </para>

            <para>- I move: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Postal, Telephone, Telegraph and Picturegram Regulations in order to vary the charges for certain Post Office services. Provision is made also for the introduction of a special mail despatch service. In addition, the opportunity is being taken to convert to decimal currency equivalents, where necessary, money amounts specified in these Regulations. </para>
          <para>The changes are the same as those which were the subject of regulations recently disallowed in the Senate. Under the provisions of the Acts Interpretation Act, they cannot be again presented in the same form within a period of six months from the date of disallowance. It is for this reason that it has become necessary to deal with the changes in the form of legislation. I would point out that, although this Bill replaces action by regulation, the method of fixing tariffs in the future will be covered in the Bill to be introduced in due course in connection with the new financial arrangements for the Post Office. </para>
          <para>The amended postal charges relate to miscellaneous facilities and services and are the same as those previously proposed for introduction on 1st July. These are set out in full in the statements circulated and refer to a new special mail despatch service to operate from 1st October this year, commission on money orders, fees on some postal orders and charges for philatelic services. Honourable members will recall that in previously announcing the introduction of a special mail despatch service, I pointed out that it was designed for highly urgent mail between the business areas of capital cities. This service will allow mail posted at specified locations after normal mail closing time to be available for collection or to be delivered early the following morning in all but the most distant capital cities. </para>
          <para>I come now to charges for telecommunication services. It will be appreciated that telecommunication costs in recent years have been affected significantly by higher wage rates and by the capital charges associated with expenditure on new facili ties. It is necessary to take heed of the current trend in the operating results of telecommunication services. Taken together, telephone and telegraph services showed a profit of $10.2m in 1965-66, most of the expenditure and revenues being associated with telephone facilities. Higher wage rates and other increased costs are expected to result in only a marginal profit in 1966-67 and, unless telecommunication charges are increased, a loss of some millions of dollars will be inevitable this year. </para>
          <para>The dependence of the business community and the public generally on the Post Office for adequate and effective communication services places a heavy responsibility on the Post Office. With these growing needs is associated a corresponding demand for capital and it is also for this reason that increases in some telecommunication tariffs are inevitable. About 95% of the proposed Budget appropriation of $240m for Post Office capital works in 1967-68 will be spent on telecommunication facilities. </para>
          <para>Demand for telephone services rose by about 12% last financial year and, with local telephone calls and trunk traffic increasing steeply, the capital needs for telecommunications will almost certainly show a sharp rise in future years. Apart from connecting new services, the major emphasis is on providing improved facilities and services to the existing 2,200,000 subscribers within the network who derive increasing benefit from this continued development. </para>
          <para>The telecommunication tariff proposals in this Bill cover increases in telephone call fees and trunk rates together with some adjustment of charges for miscellaneous telecommunication facilities and services, some of which will be dealt with by administrative action. All of these proposed adjustments are detailed in the statements which have been distributed. </para>
          <para>With regard to telephone charges, the local call fee is to be increased from 3J cents to 4 cents, with corresponding adjustments in trunk call fees. This is the first increase in call charges for eight years, apart from a few minor variations in trunk call fees at the time of introduction of decimal currency. There are variations to the trunk rates previously intimated to the House. </para>
          <para class="block">These now provide for uniform three minute rates for all trunk calls from subscribers services, irrespective of whether they are booked through an operator or subscriber-dialled; there is no change in the principle that with STD calls the subscriber pays only for the time he speaks. The variations will mean that earnings from this source will be $3m less in a full year than proposed earlier. The adjustments in charges for miscellaneous telecommunications facilities, which include a reduction in the rates for the longer distance private telegraph lines, will increase overall earnings in this area by about 20% . </para>
          <para>Overall, increased telecommunication tariffs including those covered by the earlier Bill will bring in additional earnings of about S26m in 1967-68 and $34m in a full year. However, in 1967-68 additional cash receipts will be only Si 4m because of the six monthly billing cycle for most accounts. </para>
          <para>I have already, in this session, dealt at some length with the financial position of the postal service and I will not take up the time of the&#39; &#34;House by repeating these details. I am sure that honourable members will agree that, in the light of the information already placed before them, any further delay in the introduction of new charges would have a serious effect on Post Office operations. It is proposed, therefore, that the increased charges covered by this Bill should take effect from 1st October this year. These increases in a full year are expected to bring in additional earnings of about $34m - $4m postal and S30m telecommunications. I commend the Bill to honourable members. </para>

          <para class="block">The Australian Loan Council decided at its meeting last June that the borrowing programme for States works and housing for 1967-68 should be $677m. Within the limits of this borrowing programme the States themselves have nominated the proportion of the funds that they wish to receive as advances for housing. Thus, with Loan Council approval. an amount of $122,840,000 will be made available to the States this financial year in accordance with the provisions of the Housing Agreement Act 1966. These advances will be repayable over 53 years and bear interest at 1% per annum below the long-term bond rate. The distribution, by States, is as follows: </para>

          <para>This Bill seeks the necessary authority for the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon)</inline> to borrow the amount of $122,840,000 in question. Last financial year advances to the States under the Housing Agreement amounted to $120m. This year the amounts nominated by the States represent, in aggregate, an increase of a little more than 2%. </para>
          <para>As honourable members will be aware the current Housing Agreement continues the provision that requires each State to appropriate at least 30% of the advances they receive to a Home Builders&#39; Account from which loans for private home building are made available through building societies and other approved institutions. The balance of the advances is used by the States for the erection of homes either for rental or for sale to families with low or moderate incomes. I commend the Bill to the House. </para>

          <para class="block">The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act to give effect to the sales tax alterations which the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon)</inline> foreshadowed in the Budget Speech. As the Treasurer mentioned, a review has revealed a need for some adjustments to sales tax exemptions and classifications. With the rapid strides of modern technology there is the inevitable flow of new products and new techniques that could not be envisaged when many of the existing exemption and classification provisions were incorporated in the sales tax schedules. This Bill is designed to effect various alterations that are now considered necessary in the light of technological and other developments. </para>
          <para>A number of the new exemptions will benefit persons engaged in primary industry or in handling primary produce. Among this group of exemptions are gas welding equipment for use in agricultural industry, machines for grading, sorting and cleansing vegetables and equipment for canning butter. Exemption is also to be provided for refrigeration equipment for use in the preservation of eggs by poultry farmers, egg marketing authorities and persons who grade and store eggs on behalf of egg marketing authorities. </para>
          <para>Hitherto cranes and winches fitted to tractors used in the timber-getting industry in the hauling of log timber have been exempt but this has not applied to cranes fitted to other types of motor vehicles used in the same operations. In many forest areas cranes and winches fitted to motor trucks are now being used for hauling and loading logs. It is therefore proposed that these cranes and winches for attachment to motor trucks should be exempt also. </para>
          <para>Certain other exemptions are designed to assist the Australian film industry. For many years a wide range of imported films has been exempt from tax but comparable Australian films have been subject to tax. The Government intends to remove this disadvantage to the Australian film industry by providing a uniform exemption for practically all motion picture films other than advertising films and those filmed by home movie makers. The industry will derive further benefit from an exemption to be granted for a wide range of equipment, including cinematograph cameras and sound recording and film processing equipment, used by professional film producers. </para>
          <para>Other exemptions cover a wide and varied field. Optometrists are to be placed on the same footing as medical practitioners, dentists and physiotherapists as regards exemption of instruments and equipment used in their sight testing activities. Retailers will benefit from the exemption of further wrapping and packaging materials such as rubber bands and plastic and other netting which is now widely used in packaging fruit, vegetables and other foodstuffs. Most of the other types of wrapping and packaging materials used in the retail trade are already exempt. </para>
          <para>There is at present a limited exemption applicable to fork-lift trucks used in certain stevedoring operations. The exemption applies only where the fork-lift trucks are for use partly in shipboard cargo handling activities. This exemption is to be extended to cover fork-lift trucks for use only on wharves, provided that they are to be used exclusively or primarily and principally in the handling of cargo in the course of loading or unloading ships. </para>
          <para>Household articles affected by the proposed changes include candles which are to be taxed at a uniform rate of <inline font-style="italic">2i%</inline> in common with other household lighting appliances. This will involve the withdrawal of the exemption of plain wax candles and a reduction in rate on other candles. The rate of tax on household incinerators is to be reduced from <inline font-style="italic">12i%</inline> to <inline font-style="italic">2i%,</inline> and a similar reduction is proposed for household articles of pewter which are now taxed at 12$%. Pewter ware will thus be taxed at the same rate as silver-plated ware. </para>
          <para>In recent times there has been a noticeable trend towards the use of tape recorders and tape players to provide musical entertainment. It is not unlikely that, in time, tape recorders and players will in this field displace the conventional record players which are now taxed at 25%. It is accordingly proposed that the rate of tax on tape recorders and tape players should be increased from <inline font-style="italic">12i%</inline> to 25% to place these machines in the same sales tax bracket as record players. The increase will not, however, affect office dictation machines or other appliances designed primarily and principally for the recording and reproduction of speech. These will remain taxable at 12i%. </para>
          <para>A similar increase is to be effected in the rate of tax on tape recordings of music or other entertainment that are produced for sale or lease. Disc records for radiograms and record players bear tax at 25%. These tape recordings will now be taxed at the same rate. </para>
          <para>Photographic equipment and photographs are in genera&#93; taxable at 25% but 35 millimetre photographs, including transparencies mounted in slides, have been taxable at 12i%. This came about because the 35 millimetre size photographs are produced on film which is identical with cinematograph film. As a consequence they came within the scope of a provision designed to exclude motion picture films from the field of photographic goods taxable at 25%. It was never intended that the exclusion applicable to motion picture films should apply to still photographs. This Bill will rectify the situation by placing still photographs and transparencies of this particular type in the 25% rate class with other still photographs. </para>
          <para>Vinyl floor tiles have previously been exempt under a provision originally drafted with the object of exempting various classes of building materials such as ceramic tiles. Other floor coverings, including linoleum tiles, rubber tiles and cork tiles, are taxed at <inline font-style="italic">2i%.</inline> Vinyl floor tiles are now to be taxed at the same rate. </para>
          <para>During the war years, car covers made from cloth weighing less than 10 ounces per square yard were coupon goods under the rationing system applicable to clothing, drapery, piece goods and soft furnishings. The goods which had been on the coupon scale were subsequently exempted from sales tax and, as a result, the light weight car covers were brought within the field of exempt goods. Although marketed as car covers, many of those in the smaller sizes are suitable for use as beach shelters and they are regularly purchased with this end in view. Beach shelters and car covers made from heavier cloth are taxable at 12fr%. In the interests of consistency, exemption of the light weight car covers is to be withdrawn so that they also will be taxable at 12i%. </para>
          <para>Among the other items affected are clutch pencils, the rate on which is to be increased from 12i% to 25%. They will then bear tax at the same rate as propelling pencils which operate on a different mechanical principle but are otherwise comparable with clutch pencils. </para>
          <para>I do not propose to detail all of the amendments included in this Bill. Those I have touched on are illustrative of the adjustments which are to be effected by the Bill. Details of other alterations may be found in the summarised statement of sales tax amendments that is being circulated. A memorandum explaining the clauses of the Bill is also being made available to honourable members. </para>
          <para>Some of ,the amendments will result in a loss in revenue: others will bring in additional revenue. The net result overall will be an increase in revenue estimated at approximately $1.5m per annum. In addition, it should not be overlooked that many of the proposed amendments, through the removal of complications, will result in material savings in administrative costs. I commend the Bill to the House. </para>

          <para>That the Bin be  now  read a second time. In his Budget Speech the right honourable the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon)</inline> announced the Government&#39;s intention of increasing the rates of child endowment for the fourth and subsequent children in a family. The purpose of this Bill is to give legislative effect to that decision. As honourable members will recall it was the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Harold Holt)</inline> who, as Minister for Labour and National Service in the 1941 Liberal and Country Party Coalition Government, introduced the original Commonwealth child endowment scheme in this House. Since then child endowment has become an accepted feature of the family income and the present proposals represent an important extension of this social service. </para>
          <para>At present child endowment is paid at the rate of 50c for the first child under sixteen years in a family, $1 for the second child and $1.50 for each of the subsequent children. The proposal in the Bill before the House is to increase to $1.75 a week the rate of endowment for the fourth child under sixteen years in a family; fo increase the rate to $2 a week for the fifth child with cumulative increases of 25c a week for each subsequent child so that in the case of the ninth child $3 a week will be payable. The increase of 25c a week in the rate payable for each successive child will apply cumulatively irrespective of the number of children in the family. For example, a family with six endowed children will receive an increase of SI. 50 a week bringing the total endowment payable to $9 a week; a family of nine will receive an increase of $5.25 a week bringing the total endowment payable to $17.25 a week. </para>
          <para>For some time the Government has been concerned with the fact that large families are adversely affected by wage and price increases when compared with the smaller family. The need to spread any wage increase over a greater number of dependants results in a smaller relative improvement of the position of all family members. We believe that the most effective way of bridging the gap between the economic needs of a family and the income of that family is the payment of an allowance that will increase with the size of the family. The financial burden becomes increasingly heavy with the number of children in a family and the introduction of a graduated scale of endowment rates acknowledges this fact. </para>
          <para>One original purpose of child endowment, that of being a complement to the basic wage, has lost much of its force because of the fact that wages today are now related to the capacity of industry to pay rather than to the actual needs of a man, wife and one or two children. Originally endowment was payable at the rate of 50c a week for each child other than the first or only child. The rate was raised on two occasions and when the present Government took office stood at $1 a week. In 1950 the Menzies Government extended endowment to the first or only child under sixteen years of age. This marked the beginning of a differential child endowment, 50c per week being paid for the first or only child and St per week being paid for second and subsequent children. </para>
          <para>The principle of graduated payment was further extended in 1964 when the Government increased the rate of endowment for the third and subsequent children in a family to $1.50 per week. At the same time eligibility for endowment was extended to include student children, over sixteen but under twenty-one years of age who receive full time education at a school, college or university and are not in employment. </para>
          <para>While the standard of living has increased immeasurably since this Government came to office, it is axiomatic that the parents of medium and large sized families are in need of greater help than the parents of smaller families. The proposed progressive increase of 25c in the endowment for the fourth and subsequent children will help correct this position. Internationally the principle of government assistance to children was supported by the United Nations in its Declaration of the Rights of the Child. There it was said: &#39;Payment of State and other assistance towards the maintenance of children of large families is desirable&#39;. This Bill conforms to this principle. The family is an integral part of our society. Today some people see the disintegration of the family unit with the economic and social pressures of contemporary living. Yet in the larger family the dependence of children on brother and sister and on parent is still more pronounced. In a society of large families the family unit appears of even greater importance. It is in these families however that the financial pressures are more acute. The parents and particularly the mothers make tremendous personal sacrifices for their children&#39;s sake. </para>
          <para>The extended endowment assistance provided by this Bill will help to ease the financial stress facing many of these parents. Beyond this the benefit will give greater opportunities to the children who tomorrow will be the responsible citizens of Australia. Endowment is not the only direct assistance provided by the Commonwealth for the family man. In the field of education the Commonwealth plays a major role. This assistance is not only available to individual children through secondary and tertiary scholarships but also through capital grants to help in the construction of science and technical facilities in secondary schools. The Commonwealth also gives substantial assistance towards administrative and capital expenses in Australian universities. Milk is provided for children attending primary schools and preschools, while indirect assistance to the family is given in many other forms. The value of Commonwealth assistance in all fields helps to reduce the cost of raising children. Child endowment is only one form of Government aid. </para>
          <para>It is estimated that about 240,000 families with a total of over a million children will benefit from the increased rates payable under this Bill. Rates of endowment will be increased for some 400,000 children at a cost of some $8.3m in a full year. Endowment will represent nearly one-fifth of the total expenditure from the National Welfare Fund of over $l,000m a year. The number of endowed children now approaches 3,700,000 and payments are made to 1,650,000 families and nearly 500 institutions. </para>
          <para>The Bill provides for the increased benefits to become effective from 19th September which will allow payment at the increased rate on the child endowment payday 17th October. For those endowees who receive payment by credit to a bank account each twelve weeks the increase will be payable on 12th December. </para>
          <para>The measures contained in this Bill are seen by the Government as the most effective way in which child endowment can be extended at the present time. The necessity to maintain a national policy of economic growth is universally recognised. This policy is supported by internal domestic policies directed at the maintenance of a high and rising standing of living. To maintain our population growth both by natural increase and by sustained migration is a course to which the Government is firmly committed. It may be arguable whether the birth rate can be stimulated by increased endowment payments. The assistance this Bill provides for parents who undertake the obligations and responsibilities for raising large families is unarguable. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> I commend the Bill to the House. </para>

In some cases there are evident and justifiable reasons. My Department continuously endeavours to emphasise the important contribution that older agad workers can make. Never to be forgotten is that more than 1# millions, or about 35%, of the work force are aged forty years and over. </para>

              <para>The Decimal Currency Board is examining whether it has power to demand repayment of compensation made for scales which were wrecked after compensation was paid. Compensation is paid only for price-computing scales which have been passed by weights and measures authorities as operating satisfactorily after conversion.

              <para>Fifty-five scales are known :o have been scrapped by two scale-vending firms, following payment of compensation for the machines by the Board. 3 and 4. The Board at this stage has no direct evidence that the procedures described in question 3 wire followed but is investigating this possibility further. 5 and 6. The Board does not consider that the practice of converting scales and then wrecking them after compensation has been paid would be profitable to the owners of scales. Before setting its compensation rates, the Board carried out a full investigation of conversion methods and costs and had lengthy discussions with manufacturers and importers in this field. The compensation rates do not include allowances for some costs which are not involved in the conversion itself. Because it would not be able to exercise direct control over the charges made, the Board advised scale owners to obtain competitive quotations where the price quoted by a converting firm for the conversion of scales was greater than the compensation payable by the Board. </para>

            <item label="7.">
              <para>The Board has no information which would suggest that competitive quotations cannot be obtained in Victoria, and it knows of a number of firms in Victoria which are prepared to convert scales of the various makes. </para>

              <para>Since October 1966, the Board has asked weights and measures authorities for a formal acknowledgment of receipt for voucher books supplied to them. This was a precautionary measure adopted on the suggestion of a Commonwealth Audit Office inspector. </para>

            <item label="10.">
              <para>Since the inception of the compensation programme, weights and measures authorities have been fully aware of the possibility of more than one serial number being used in respect of the one set of scales. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="11.">
              <para>The Board does not have a complete record of the serial numbers of all scales eligible for conversion. It does, however, possess records which would indicate whether a serial number quoted in respect of a particular make of scale would warrant further examination. It was the absence of complete information on price computing scales in use in Australia which led the Board to employ a system of checks, which in turn led to its investigation of cases where more than one amount of compensation has been paid to the one claimant. 12 and 13. There has been a long-standing practice in the industry for scale firms to make up their own serial numbers. The practice also extends to changing scale brand names. However, records kept by the Board, in addition to showing whether a particular serial number has been claimed on previously, also show details of each set of scales claimed by a particular scale owner and this has enabled the Board to carry out a series of routine checks of cases where compensation has been paid more than once to Hie same person or firm. </para>

            <para>I would draw the honourable member&#39;s attention to an answer to a previous question by him on this matter (Hansard 11th October 1966, page 1598) in which I said that it is not customary to make information of this type public without the prior agreement of the State government concerned and that no such agreement had been made in this case. </para>
            <para>However, as the honourable member will be aware, the Commonwealth Government has announced that it will provide up to S50m over the next five years for a national water resources development programme, drawn up by the Commonwealth and the States, with the object of increasing water conservation activity, reducing the hazards of drought and expanding primary production. </para>
            <para>The Press on 31st May 1967, when referring to this development programme, reported that the Premier of Queensland has said that one of the projects he has suggested for the programme is the Nogoa Irrigation Project. The proposal will be considered, along with projects suggested by the other Premiers, when the Government is considering the details of the national water resources development programme. </para>

              <para>Bulletin 72 of the Bureau of Mineral Resources entitled &#39;Australian Mineral Industry: The Mineral Deposits&#39; discusses and catalogues 180 mineral commodities in 55 chapters covering the main groups of commodities. The information on each mineral commodity includes ore reserves where these have been assessed and published. The question of defining ore reserves is a complex one, as they are a function of many factors, including tonnage and grade; amenability or otherwise to low cost mining and concentrating methods; geographic location relative to transport facilities and ports, power and water supplies; size of local and overseas markets; prices, etc. These factors are changing constantly and are affected also by technological developments in a wide range of fields. At present major deficiencies in Australian mineral production include the following: Asbestos, chromite, industrial diamonds, diatomite, some of the ferro alloys, fluorspar, graphite, nickel, petroleum, potassium fertilisers and brimstone. In a number of the above cases there are raw materials available in Australia but the Australian market is too small or too scattered to warrant production units in the face of larger scale, lower cost production overseas and Australian freight costs. There have recently been announced discoveries of deposits of nickel and phosphate. It will be some time before these deposits are fully evaluated to a stage where we can be assured of self-sufficiency in these minerals. </para>

              <para>and 3. It has been found by experience that the best way to ensure that the search for, and assessment of, our mineral wealth continues is for governments to create a climate in which private enterprise will undertake exploration. An essential part of this climate is that the discoverer has the incentive to develop any viable deposit found during the search. Such development in Australia is usually dependent on the right to export some of the production and permission is normally given. There are cases where, because of the need for conservation of our resources, a careful control of our exports is maintained. Examples of minerals in this category are phosphate and uranium. </para>

            <para>It is normal oil company policy for refinery to supply only to the parent company and its subsidiary companies. However, to minimize transport costs, most companies participate in intercompany borrow and loan arrangements whereby a refinery may supply products to competitors in its particular area in exchange for a similar amount of products in, say, another State. Tt is also possible for a refinery with spare capacity to refine t&#62; competitor&#39;s crude oil for an agreed upon processing fee. It is understood that this practice is not widespread in Australia. </para>

          <item label="4.">
            <para>Refining costs depend on the type and size of the processing units incorporated in the refinery, the type of crude ofl processed, and the required product pattern. Costs for individual Australian refineries are not available to the Government but as each refinery is different to the others and each processes a different crude oil blend, it would be expected that each would have different refining costs. Breaking down the overall cost of refining crude oil into the cost of refining individual products such as petrol can only give an arbitrary figure because of the number of products involved. </para>

        <para>On5th April 1966, each of these banks established a separate fund in the form of an account with the Reserve Bank; approximately two-thirds of the fund was provided by transfers from its Statutory Reserve Deposit Account with the Reserve Bank and approximately one-third from its other assets. In total, an amount of $50m was transferred to the banks&#39; Farm Development Loan Fund accounts. Published figures show that to 26th July 1967 the aggregate amount drawn from the accounts by the banks was $20.4m. Figures of the drawings by each participating bank are not published. </para>

            <para>It has been agreed with the banks that the rates of interest on loans from the Farm Development Loan Fund are to be within the range of preferential overdraft rates normally applicable to rural customers. Within this range, the rate on an individual loan will of course be determined by the bank concerned in the light of all the circumstances relevant to the particular proposition. Currently the statistical information published concerning interest rates charged by trading banks relates to advances other than those for term and farm development lending. However, consideration is being given to the possibility of extending the information. </para>

            <para>- On 18th April, the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> and the honourable member for Mallee <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Turnbull)</inline> asked me questions without notice about the national water resources development programme in which the Commonwealth will provide financial assistance to the States for a programme of water conservation works additional to those carried out by the States in their continuing programmes. My colleagues and I have determined details of the programme and I have written to the State Premiers outlining our plans for its implementation. The scheme is essentially one for extending the conservation and use of water in rural industry. Works wholly or principally for urban purposes or for hydro-electric power generation would be excluded. The Commonwealth contribution to the programme could amount to $50m in the form of non repayable grants over the next five years. It is envisaged that the States will maintain at least their existing pattern of growth in this field from their own financial resources. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Premiers have been asked to provide an outline of proposed water conservation programmes over the next five years including information on anticipated production from those programmes, together with a comparison of the proposed level of water conservation activity with the level in the immediate past At the same time, they have been asked to submit lists of projects for inclusion in the national programmes. After examination of these submissions, the Commonwealth will select those projects which appear to it sufficiently attractive to warrant closer examination. The Commonwealth will be primarily responsible for the necessary detailed studies which will be carried out in collaboration with appropriate State authorities. </para>
          <para>Parliament will then be invited to make the necessary financial appropriations in respect of the projects selected for inclusion in the programme. The State will be expected to provide any supplementary works that might be required to enable effective utilisation of the water made available by the project. </para>

            <para>- On 13th April, the honourable member for Macquarie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Luchetti)</inline> asked me a question without notice concerning water conservation projects in Australian States and Territories. In reply I said that I would treat the question as though it were on notice and give him a considered reply. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Information about requests for assistance submitted by the States is regarded by the Commonwealth Government as confidential between itself and the State Governments concerned unless it is agreed to make the information public. The Commonwealth has, however, provided assistance to the States for the following water projects since 1950: </para>
          <para>Comprehensive Water Supply Scheme, Western Australia (grant of SI Om). </para>
          <para>Ord project (Stage one), Western Australia (grant of $ 12.2m). </para>
          <para>Chowilla Reservoir, South Australia - under the River Murray Waters Agreement the Commonwealth, along with the States of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, is contributing towards the cost of the Chowilla reservoir; in addition the Commonwealth is making a loan to New South Wales of its share of the cost. </para>
          <para>Blowering Dam (New South Wales)the Commonwealth is making a loan to New South Wales of half the cost of the Blowering Dam. </para>
          <para>South-west Region Water Supply (being the second stage of the Comprehensive Water Supply Scheme), Western Australia - the Commonwealth is providing financial assistance of up to $ 10.5m by way of loans. </para>
          <para>With regard to the Australian Territories, there are no firm proposals for water conservation projects which will be commenced within the next three years. The task of recording and collating basic data is however proceeding at an accelerated rate. In Papua and New Guinea a stream gauging programme is being undertaken. In the Northern Territory during the 1964-67 period, the Commonwealth Government has provided S2.07m to enable the Territory to carry out a programme of surface and underground water investigations which formed part of a ten year national programme sponsored by the Australian Water Resources Council. This programme, involving the assessment, measurement and systematic recording of the Territory&#39;s water resources, aims at providing a sound basis for the proper planning of developmental projects, which include dam construction and the reticulation of water supplies for domestic purposes as well as for agricultural, pastoral and industrial development. Programmes will continue at a similar level for at least the next three years. </para>
          <para>In addition to the work mentioned above, the honourable member will be aware that in my policy speech prior to the last election I announced that the Government had in mind a national water resources development programme aimed at increasing water conservation activity, reducing the hazards of drought and expanding primary production. </para>
          <para>My colleagues and I have since determined details of the programme and I have written to the State Premiers outlining our plans for its implementation. The scheme is essentially one for extending the conservation and use of water in rural industry. Works wholly or principally for urban purposes or for hydro-electric power generation would be excluded.

            <para>- On 18th May the honourable member for Bendigo <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Beaton)</inline> asked me a question without notice about Commonwealth assistance for the provision of additional wheat storages. In reply I said that I would examine the matter and give him a detailed reply. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The provision and management of storage facilities for wheat come within the responsibilities and prerogatives of the governments of States in which the wheat is produced. This has been made clear when approaches have been made to the Commonwealth for assistance in providing additional storage capacity. The raising by State authorities of loans for the purpose of providing storage facilities, as for other purposes, is of course a matter for consideration by the Australian Loan Council, which I understand approved special borrowing allocations totalling $4m for the New South Wales Grain Elevators Board for 1966-67. </para>
          <para>The first advance, the payment of which is made possible by the Rural Credits Department of the Reserve Bank making the necessary moneys available to the Australian Wheat Board, is payable, in accordance with the terms of the Wheat Industry Stabilization Act 1963-1966, on wheat delivered to the Board. I understand that the last of the wheat in No. 29 Pool - 1965-66 season - was sold some months ago. </para>
          <para>The speed of construction of wheat storages must depend on a number of factors including the size, location and type of storage. The matter of assessment of needs and priorities is something which comes within the ambit of State responsibilities to which I have referred earlier in this reply. </para>
