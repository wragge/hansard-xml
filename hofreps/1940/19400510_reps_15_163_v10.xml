Under the old arrangement, Australian manufacturers obtained wool at the Appraised price, plus¼d. per lb. From the point of view of the grower, the present arrangement will be more satisfactory. </para>

                    <para>- On the 8th May, the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blackburn)</inline> asked me why an applicant for appointment as a special peace officer is required to state his religion, and whether I would lay on the table of the House a copy of the application form for such appointment. I then promised I would have inquiries made into the matter. I now desire to inform the honorable member that the form used in recording particulars concerning special peace officers includes provision' for a statement by them as to their religion. This follows the practice which prevails in most, if not all, of the States in connexion with the engagement of members of police forces. The form is identical with the form that was in use in New South Wales when the first appointments of peace officers were made in 1925. It has continued ever since. There is no discrimination against any religious denomination. I notice that the form for enlistment of members of the Australian Imperial Force contains provision enabling any person who has conscientious objections to stating his religion to decline to do so. I propose to have the application form for special peace officers amended to bring it into conformity with  the enlistment form. As promised on the  8th  May, I now lay a copy of.: the application form on the table of the House. </para>

Further, can he say why, having regard to the purport, and particularly the spirit, of section 116, any citizen of Australia should be asked, other than for statistical purposes, a question which conflicts with that section, and how it is that any candidate for employment, or any person whose services are sought for salary by the Commonwealth Government, shall have to indicate his religion ? </para>

First, as to the interpretation of the Constitution. That is a matter of law, upon which it is not usual to express an opinion offhand. I do not propose to break such an excellent rule so early in the morning. As to the question asked of applicants, I remind the honorable gentleman that he and I have been members of this assembly for some years, and that although this practice has been going on all the time it has left him with an untroubled mind until this morning. </para>

                            <para>- I have received report on the matter. The march was made via Grey-street instead of Queenstreet for two main reasons - first, to avoid congestion of traffic; and, secondly, because the route chosen was slightly shorter. As the honorable gentleman knows, there is no tram traffic over Greystreet Bridge, whilst very heavy traffic passes over Victoria Bridge, and consequently any march over the latter bridge would have caused considerable traffic congestion. It is, perhaps, incorrect to say that the route over which the troops passed consisted of back streets, because several of them cross main arterial highways. With regard to the second part of the question, it is regretted that very little time was allowed to relatives at the railway station. This was due, not to any fault of the railway authorities, but to misunderstanding between the records office and the embarkation staff: Steps have been taken to ensure the avoidance of a similar occurrence  in  future, </para>

                            <para>- There seems to be some misapprehension as to the Government's function in respect of the raising of finance by co-operative societies. The present practice is for those societies to make application to me for permission to raise money. The only limitation imposed on the raising of money by such societies is in respect of the interest to be paid. On one occasion when permission was sought to raise in respect of four items a total amount of £200,000, the interest rate required was 5 per cent. I refused to consent to the request except on the condition that the rate was 4¾ per cent. The money was finally raised at that figure. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline> - In response to the request made to. me yesterday by the honorable member for Wannon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scholfield),-</inline> I have pleasure in making this statement. A great deal of what I shall say has already been said by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> or myself, but as there seems to be a great deal of misunderstanding about the undertaking, and ;as a number of points have not been" emphasized to any degree, I think an elaboration of what has been said is justified. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Honorable members will recollect that, towards the end of September last year, the Prime Minister announced  that it had been proposed that the Dominions of Canada, Australia, and New Zealand should co-operate with the United Kingdom in a scheme for training pilots, observers, and air gunners on a scale never before contemplated. I was sent to Ottawa with air force and finance advisers to discuss the proposal with representatives of the other three governments. Upon our arrival in Ottawa, Lord Riverdale, the leader of the mission from the United Kingdom, outlined the need for this great air training scheme and the lines upon which it should be organized. He explained that, in spite of the tremendous expansion of the Royal Air Force and of the efficiency of its per- sonnel and aircraft, it was considered by the Allied leaders that, if an end were to be put to German aggression, it would be necessary to develop an air force on  a scale that would-.not.only match the German aircraft numerically, hut also have such a superiority as would give the Allies a command of the air comparable to their command of the sea. It had been calculated that British and French aircraft production, plus the production of the United States of America, which would be available to the Allies, could produce sufficient aircraft, for this purpose. He went on to explain, however, that owing to the definite limits imposed by the size of the British Isles and the handicaps inseparable for haying to carry on .offensive and defensive operations in the air, it would' npt be- possible to train, in the United. Kingdom, sufficient- air crews to man such . an aerial armada. So it was suggested that., the three dominions, with their unlimited, spaces, ideal climatic conditions, and freedom from the handicaps imposed by air operations against a powerful enemy, should set up a vast training organization, which would supply rather more than half of the air crews that would be necessary. .  The original proposal .was? that - the dominions, in approximate proportions to their populations, should each set up training establishments to carry out the elementary training of their quotas, and that the more advanced intermediate and service training should be completed in a vast organization to be set up in Canada. It was at once agreed that each dominion should undertake its share, and the details of the necessary organization were then discussed. </para>
                    <para>Australia's share in this original proposal was to establish nine elementary training schools for pilots, and a corresponding number of schools for observers and air gunners, who would complete their training in nine schools. A corresponding number of observer and air gunner schools was to be established in Canada. </para>
                    <para>While the mission from the United Kingdom was outlining the original proposal, I noticed that the aircraft to be used for the advanced training in Canada were all to be supplied from the United Kingdom with the exception of one American type, which we happened to be manufacturing in Australia. I was surprised, as I had imagined the main -reason for concentrating the advanced training in Canada was that dominion's proximity to the aircraft factories of  the' United States of America. I thereupon made a counter proposal. </para>
                    <para>After a good deal of consideration and consultation with the Government, I proposed that, as the aircraft were all either to be sent from the United Kingdom or to be produced here, Australia might "undertake seven-ninths of the advanced training with this country. This counter proposal, which was finally agreed upon, was, in several directions, a considerable improvement on the original proposal. The organization originally proposed might well have proved beyond the capacity of Canada, whereas the alteration has reduced it to manageable proportions, though it will still impose a tremendous strain upon our sister dominion. </para>
                    <para> The alteration will also effect a great reduction of the dollar exchange. Under the original scheme, it would have been necessary to find, in- the first three years, £51,000,000 worth of ^Canadian dollars, which would have meant incurring a considerable debt in dollars and almost certainly most drastic reduction of our imports from Canada, thus causing great loss to the exporters of that dominion and [considerable hardship to Australian industries and individuals requiring Canadian goods. </para>
                    <para class="block"> Under the revised proposal it will only be necessary to find, in the first three years, £11,000,000 worth of Canadian dollars. In other words, the variation has effected a saving of approximately £40,000,000 worth of dollar exchange. </para>
                    <para>Another point of very considerable importance to us is that, under the present scheme, we shall have concentrated in Australia more than 1,200 service aircraft with a very great striking capacity, in addition to our nineteen active service squadrons. To illustrate the security value of this force, I point out that 1,200 service aircraft are considerably more than double the number of seaborne aircraft of any navy in the world. So when we take into consideration that only seaborne aircraft can come against us and are at a very considerable disadvantage when opposed to land based aircraft, it can be realized what a tremendous addition to local security the aircraft to be used in this training .scheme will give to the Commonwealth. These 1,200 aircraft, added to our existing squadrons, will give us a superiority of three to one over the aircraft carried by any navy in the world. </para>

                            <para>- It is a strength of numbers. Its striking force would probably be very much greater, for aircraft which can: be -carried upon, and catapulted from, ships at sca are, generally speaking, considerably lighter types than the aircraft that will be used in connexion with this scheme. </para>

                    <para>Another not inconsiderable merit of the revised scheme is ' that it will cost Australia more than £4,000,000 less than the scheme originally proposed, and that more than £30,000,000 which would have had to be spent abroad will be spent in and circulated throughout Australia, thus increasing our capacity to bear the financial burden of our war effort. </para>
                    <para>Two questions will naturally arise in the minds of. members from the foregoing observations. First, why is training in Australia so much less costly than in Canada, and, secondly, if so much less costly, why are Ave not completing all of our training within the Commonwealth? </para>
                    <para>The answer to the first question is that in Canada the great majority of the landing grounds will have to be prepared at ah estimated average cost of about £50,000 each, whereas in Australia Ave already have more adequate landing grounds than will be required. Owing to climatic conditions, hangars and buildings will also have to be built on much more expensive lines in Canada. Hangars there, for instance, have to be centrally heated and' fitted with mechanically operated doors that can open and close very rapidly so  as to minimize the intake of intense cold every time an aircraft is taken out Or brought in. Another additional cos.t is the necessity for the continual rolling of the snow during the winter to keep the landing areas consolidated. Let me add, by way of re-assurance, that apart from the cold adding to the cost for these reasons, winter flying conditions in Canada are very good. I make that remark because some people have certain misgivings about winter flying conditions in Canada. The fact is that, though the cold is intense during the winter in Canada, the weather, ia crystal clear and very good indeed for flying. </para>
                    <para>The reason why there is a definite limit to the amount of training we can do in Australia is that our supply of fitters is inadequate. That will be one of our great problems. Canada, however, has the great advantage of being able to draw on. a vast reservoir of man-power from across its border in the United States. </para>

In such a case, the dominion concerned will be at liberty to increase the pay of the men. The Government of the United  Kingdom  has even undertaken to pay pensions at the rate applicable to the Royal Air Force. If a pension scheme in operation in any particular dominion is more liberal than 'that applicable to the Royal Air Force personnel, the dominion concerned will be required to make up the difference if it considers .it desirable to do so. </para>

                    <para>Although all personnel,' on completion  of  training, are to serve in Royal Air Force squadrons, every .effort is to be made to maintain their dominion identity. Australian personnel ' will romain members of the Royal Australian Air Force during the whole of their service, and will wear the Australian uniform. They will also be grouped into squadrons, which will bear the name of Australia. For instance, a. squadron would be called No. 1001 Australian (Bomber) Squadron. It is planned to exchange Australian regular officers with Royal Air Force officers to enable' them to obtain experience of active service flying prior to the arrival of Australian trainees at the theatre of war, so "that these officers, with the experience thus gained, may command the -flights and squadrons in which Australians are to serve. Exchanges will also be arranged for more senior officers. If&gt; later, it is found possible to train more ground personnel in Australia than are necessary for our home defence squadrons and the air training scheme, ground personnel will be sent over also so that a certain number - of squadrons, at any rate, will be 100 per cent. Australian. All squadrons in which .Australians are grouped will be affiliated with squadrons of the Royal. Australian Air Force, so that their records may be added to the traditions of those squadrons. </para>
                    <para class="block">On being enrolled, air crew trainees will be selected for training as .pilots, observers or air gunners and will undergo their training as airmen. On completion of their training 50 per .cent, of pilots and observers will receive commissions and the remaining 50 per cent, will have the rank of sergeant. Air gunners, on completion of training, will serve as aircraftsmen, or. leading aircraftsmen, "according to  how  they pass out 'of their course, except for approximately 10 per cent., who will be granted commissions. " ! Apropos of air gunners, I should like to correct any erroneous impression that the air gunner is a comparatively unimportant member of an air crew. It is true that the air gunner- does not need quite such a high standard of education 1 as a pilot or observer, as he does not have to master the intricacies of navigation; but, as the war progresses, more and more importance is being placed on getting fighting men of the right type to fill positions as air gunners. Often the safe return of a formation of bombers is due even more to the skill and courage of the air gunners in fighting off the enemy than to the skill of the pilots and observers.  </para>
                    <para>Conditions of service are' contained in pamphlets which I have circulated to honorable members and which are being circulated throughout the Commonwealth. T should be pleased at any time to discuss with honorable members points which may not be clear to them in these pamphlets. </para>
                    <para>The two immediately urgent problems which have to be overcome, and in the overcoming of which all honorable members of this House may be able to help by explaining the true position as widely as possible, are the need for young men with some mechanical experience to come forward and be trained as fitters, and to persuade men who. wish to .serve as air crew, members to possess themselves in patience until such time as it is -possible to call them up for training. The fitter position is particularly urgent, as there are 'not sufficient trained fitters available in the Commonwealth to fill the requirements of the air. training scheme. If sufficient men with some mechanical knowledge are not forthcoming rapidly to be trained, it will not be possible to carry through the- programme. Possibly many suitable young men  are holding back because they do not feel that serving as ground personnel is a sufficiently combatant occupation- to justify their giving up their civil employment. To them it should be explained that no war service can be more valuable than service as a fitter, because, if the- fitters are not forthcoming, it will not be possible for the air crew personnel ' to be trained. Here is a- wonderful opportunity for young men to perform- valuable war service for their country and at the same time receive training which will be invaluable for them in the post-war years. Already more than 2,000 men are in training as fitters in engineering and technical schools at Canberra, Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide. Other schools are shortly to be opened in other State capitals. Men of a splendid type are at present in training in the schools, but I cannot exaggerate the importance and urgency of obtaining many more of this type promptly to fill the schools to capacity. </para>
                    <para>With regard to air crews, the problem is rather the reverse to the fitter problem, but it is equally important. Here the problem is to persuade nien who have the qualifications and the inclination to serve as air crews to be patient until such time as it is possible for them to be taken in for training. If we could take all who wished to serve into training, immediately, I have no doubt that we could get the 30,000 men who will be required during the first three years of the scheme to come forward within a few weeks ; but. owing to the fact that there is already a waiting list of more than 2,500 who have been selected, and another list of some thousands awaiting selection, many are apt to become so impatient and disheartened by the delay that they enlist to serve in some other capacity. If some thousands should do this the result will be disastrous, as the 30,000 men needed <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> undergo training within three years must approach the Commonwealth's capacity of young men who have both the qualifications and the inclination to serve as air crew, and there may well be difficulty later in getting a sufficient number of men of the type required. </para>

                            <para>- I realize that to a certain degree that may be so. Although a waiting list of 2,500 seems formidable at present when only 380 are to commence training during May, the intake will increase every two months as new schools are established, according to programme until the full capacity of the organization is developed. The intake will then be 1,148 every four weeks. It will be realized how necessary a big waiting list will be later on to provide for such colossal requirements. </para>

                    <para>I am not so much worried about those who have already been selected and are on the waiting list, because waiting is never so bad when one knows that one is definitely to be called up and knows the date, as I am about those who are waiting to be interviewed and examined. Everything possible is being done to expedite the interviewing and medical examining of candidates, but it is a most complicated business. Interviewing candidates, deciding on their general suitability and their particular suitability to serve as pilots, observers or air gunners, and the complicated medical, dental, and optical examination take more than an hour. I am particularly sympathetic with those who have to undergo this ordeal of waiting and. uncertainty, well remembering my own concern and impatience when I had to wait only a few weeksto be called up for training in the flying corps during the last war. </para>

                        <para>Germany lied and failed us so often that she only succeeded in deceiving Herself. As in 1914 she could not conceive that two things might happen - first, that England would fight her, and, second, that the British Empire was a united Empire. She did not realize that when the lion roars the cubs will answer the call. The cubs are there now in their battle kit, waiting to fight any foe to freedom; to play their part and give their lives, if necessary, to the sacred cause of Empire. We come from a proud race. We are the descendants of generations who have waged war through the centuries for our ideals of liberty, and let no one think that we have forgotten the lessons this record has taught us. Many months, perhapsmany years-long and anxious times lie before us ; but we face the future with a spirit of serious resolve.This Empire has weathered many terrible storms, and by God's grace it will weather this one, too. </para>

                        <para>- As the Minister for Air apparently failed to appreciate the point of the question that I addressed to him earlier this morning, I mention for his information that I have received a letter from a garage proprietor in Lismore, New South Wales, who  employs seventeen  men, of whom ten have enlisted for service in the Royal Australian Air Force and seven are being called' Tip for compulsory service with the Militia, and will join infantry battalions. My informant states that the latter men are taking courses in engineering subjects at a technical college. In view of the statement by the Minister regarding the shortage of fitters and others with engineering knowledge, is it not incumbent on the Government to see that the technical training of these young men is not interrupted? Will -he make representations to the Minister for the Army to secure the exemption from training for all such men as these throughout Australia, who may be called upon later to fill vacancies in the Air Force. </para>

                        <para>- I shall discuss the proposal submitted by the honorable member with the Minister for the Army. I fully realize how employers, particularly those owning garages and engineering workshops, are being embarrassed by the large number of apprentices and men who are joining the Air Force. It is fairly obvious that we cannot grant exemptions from service to individuals unless they have signified their intention to enter another branch of the Defence Forces at a later period. It may be possible for them to enrol for service after they have completed their training. </para>

                            <para>- The intention is to provide technical training facilities in every State where technical schools have the necessary capacity for the particular type of training to be given. For obvious economic reasons it has been decided to start training in Melbourne, Sydney, Canberra, and Adelaide, as those are the centres from which the largest number of applications have been received, and not in other States until the schools mentioned are filled to capacity. The reasons are obvious and logical. It is desired to spread the benefit of the schools as far as possible. I have, however, given instructions that technical schools shall be established as early as possible in other capitals where existing schools have the necessary facilities, even before the schools in the more highly industrialized States are filled. </para>

In view of the fact that the troops merely march through portions of the electorates of Werriwa, West Sydney, Dalley and Parkes, does the Minister suggest that this is due to the enthusiasm of the honorable members representing those electorates regarding the enlistment of men in the Australian Imperial Force? </para>

                        <para>- An opportunity has been given to the public of Sydney to see the troops marching prior to embarkation, although no march, as such, has been staged on the day of embarkation. No doubt the representations made by the honorable members mentioned have had a good deal to do with the selection of the route of these marches.  </para>

                            <para>- The position of the Sydney Water and Sewerage ; Board is the same as that of other local governing bodies.The loan programme for this year was laid down by the Loan Council, and the Government has not in any way sought to limit the amount to be raised. Notwithstanding the increasing war commitments, the board went on the market early this year, and a loan of £1,000,000 was subscribed in a very short period. Immediately, pressure was brought to bear to seek permission to go on the market again. I pointed out that local governing authorities in the other States had a right to consideration of their claims. I recently indicated to the board that, inview of the fact that the Commonwealth Government is going on the loan market at the end of this month or the beginning of next month, I was not prepared to allow the board to seek a further public loan at the present time. I am not prepared to reconsider t hat decision. I have made it clear, however, to the Premier of New South Wales that permission will he granted to the board to approach the loan market again before the closeof the present financial year. </para>

                        <para>- For some years a small sum- I think about £600 - was set aside annually to subsidize gliding clubs, for which they could qualify by fulfilling certain conditions. I do not think that in any financial year such clubs qualified for anything approaching the amount appropriated. When unduly heavy war expenditure was forced upon the Government it was thought that that was one of the directions in which economy could be effected. Gliding is a fascinating sport which has a definite value in promoting air-mindedness, and it also enables interested persons to gain some experience in the air with little expense. As it is now possible for young men to gain flying experience at the expense of the Government, it has been consideredunnecessary to continue the subsidy. None of the major air forces of the world considers that the preliminary training obtained in gliding clubs in any way reduces the training necessary for service pilots. Gliding was promoted in Germany to increase airmindedness; but I road an article some time ago by an American who has studied the system of training in that country and he said that the Germans did not consider that gliding reduced the time in which a pilot can be trained. </para>

                        <para>- All such bodies with the necessary training capacitywill be given an opportunity to quote for conducting elementary flying training schools for the Air Force. Such bodies will necessarily need to have considerable capacity, because a standard school under the air training scheme must have the capacity for 96 pupils at a time, with, I think, 56 aircraft. The aircraft would be provided by the Air Force; but, nevertheless, considerable organization will be required to conduct a schoolon even half a school, the minimum unit to be set up. The desirableness of maintaining any civil flying organization, apart from those connected with the Empire air training scheme, is very doubtful, because it has been found that a few hours' experience gained in civil schools does not reduce to any appreciable degree the instruction needed when air pilots commence training under the Air Force curriculum. </para>

                        <para>- Will the Minister for Commerce state whether the recent conference .of Commonwealth and State Ministers held in Canberra to consider the allocation of the Commonwealth grant in respect of marginal lands gave any consideration to affording relief this year to distressed farmers in States other than Victoria? If so, will he say that the decision not to grant relief to farmers in those States was induced by his attitude or by that of the Ministers of Agriculture in the other wheat-growing States? I understand that certain farmers in my electorate last year received relief under that grant, and that when they applied this year they were informed by the Minister for Agriculture of New South Wales that no relief could be afforded. unless the Commonwealth authorities so decided, the inference being that if they did not obtain any relief it would be. due to the action of the Commonwealth ? </para>

                        <para>- I have already informed the House on two occasions that this matter was threshed out thoroughly at the meeting of the Agricultural Council held in Hobart, when it was unanimously agreed by the Ministers for Agriculture that the money should be used only in respect of marginal areas. Last harvest produced a record wheat crop. The  subject  of relief was thoroughly considered by the Commonwealth Government, and there is no form of relief which is beyond the capacity of any of the States. The Australian Wheat Board has been informed that whenever a State government considers that a farmer should have seed or superphosphates, the board is to record the lien given to the supplier so that it can he paid for out of the next harvest. </para>

                        <para>- There has been a considerable aerial survey in Papua by a company, known as Australasian Petroleum Company Limited - a combination of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, Standard Vacuum of America, and Oil Search of Australia - which has expended from £400,000 to £500,000" on ground and photographic surveys in an endeavour to obtain suitable sites. The company, which is operating over, an area of 20,000 square miles, has imported <inline font-style="italic">£200,000</inline> worth of drilling machinery, which has now reached Port Moresby. Although the site selected is only one mile from the river, a road' 4J miles in length in which it will be necessary to construct 33 bridges and 70 culverts has to be traversed in order to get the machinery to the site. That work has now been commenced. The survey work, has been expensive, because cameras can be used for an average of only eighteen minutes daily owing to the dense cloud formation. Another company utilizing a drilling plant hired from the Commonwealth, which is operating over an area of 75 square miles, has sunk a bore to a depth of from 1,000 to 1,500 feet. Oil has not yet been encountered ; but in view of the activities displayed and the expenditure being incurred, it would appear that the companies have some faith in their projects. </para>

                            <para>. - Yesterday, 1 asked the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender)</inline> whether the increased income tas rates would apply to income from those government bonds which were converted in 1931 to lower rate of interest, and I was informed that they would not. It seems to me that the Government is sheltering one section of the community, which should be called upon, at this time, to bear its proper share of the burden of increased taxation. According to section 3 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, the interest received on bonds converted in 1931 may not be taxed at rates higher than those prevailing in 1930. Since thai time, income tax rates have been increased, particularly during the years 1938-39,' when an increase of 15 per cent, was made. These increases, however, do -not .apply .to.the incomes to which I have referred. Interest received on bonds issued in respect of the recent loan has to pay tax at the full rate, but that does not apply to the income derived from the converted bonds. When we remember that, the holders of converted bonds are also exempt from State income tax, it will be seen that they enjoy a distinct advantage over other sections of the community, and even over the wage earners, who must pay wages tax on all income over £3 a week. The Treasurer said yesterday that the amount involved was about £500,000,000 of public debt, the income from which was hot subject to any taxation increases. The excuse offered by the Government is that the bonds were issued on a certain 'prospectus, and that it would' be tantamount to repudiation to vary the terms. Seeing that the Government if making such heavy demands upon the public1 - the Assistant Treasurer referred to " searching the pockets of the public ': - it is very difficult to sustain the argument that the income from £500,000,000 of Government bonds should be exempt from- all tax increases.' When it was decided in 1931 to convert Government loans at a lower rate of interest, the belief waa held, and rightly so I believe, that this action should be taken because the Government was not in a position to pay the higher rates of interest, and this notwithstanding the terms upon which the loans had been issued in the first place. The position is worse now than it was then. At that time our difficulties were economic only; now the country is fighting for its life. Therefore, I cannot accept the statement of the Treasurer that it would amount to repudiation to depart from the terms of the prospectus issued at the time of the loan conversion. These bondholders should be required to pay tax at the same rate as every ' body else. In any case it will not be long before the ' Government is forced into this position by the demands of other classes of taxpayers who are taxed at the full rate. Those who draw income from Government bonds do not run the same risks as those whose money is invested in business and commercial undertakings. Bonds are giltedged securities, and those who hold them run no risk so long as the system ' of government remains unaltered.. Those who invest their money in ordinary commercial undertakings, however, may have the value of their investment depreciated, or even wiped out altogether, by changes of public taste, business competition or international disturbances. Section 45 of the Income Tax Assessment Act states that, where a company has paid a proportion of its dividend out of bond interest, this proportion shall be taxed at no more than the 1930 rate. This seems to me to be an extraordinary concession, and I ask the Treasurer whether it is proposed to allow it to continue. Banks and insurance companies are large investors in government loans, and a considerable proportion of their dividends, are, therefore, paid out of bond interest, so that those dividends will be taxed at a lower rate than income derived from other sources. I can see no reason why interest derived from these Government bonds should be treated differently from that derived from mortgages, loans and other investments. Even if the argument of contract is advanced in respect of interest on bonds, it could equally be advanced in respect of mortgages contracted at the time. In both instances the transaction represents a contract, although in one instance the contract may be with the Government, and in the other instance it may be with private citizens. </para>

                                <para>- That is true, but' is the Government- prepared to. bring down legislation to provide for a voluntary method whereby those who derive interest from bonds, may make the same contribution to our war effort through income taxation as is made by people drawing interest from other, sources ? The Government has taken no steps to see that that is done. It apparently intends to leave interest payable on £500,000,000 of investments entirely apart from interest derived from other sources. In these circumstances the Treasurer will have the greatest difficulty in justifying the increases provided for- in various taxation measures which will be discussed at a later stage, and in convincing the wage-earners, who will be called upon to pay  a  large proportion of the increased taxation through indirect channels, that the Government's proposals are equitable. How can the Government reconcile its  taxation proposals with its avowed intention to secure equality of sacrifice ? How can it justify to members of the fighting forces who may be called upon to make the grea test sacrifice of all this exemption of bondholders who should be called upon to carry their share of the burden of our war effort? These people are to be exempt, not only from the increases of Commonwealth income taxation, but also from State taxes. That is a double-barrelled advantage. </para>

                                <para>- If banks and insurance companies receive from the States protection in the building up of their reserves, surely it is a logical argument that these companies should make some contribution to the States for the assistance which they are given. That protection is afforded in ways too many to enumerate. But I contend that all who carry on business with an equal chance of making profits and accumulating wealth, should be on the one level of taxation and that special consideration should not be given to any one section such as bondholders over others. If it is notgoodenough for these people to make a contribution for their own protection, either by the State or the Commonwealth, then the whole system is ill-balanced. No class should be specially favoured and enabled, without payment, to secure all the benefits which a State can provide for them in the continuity and maintenance of their business, while the rest of the community has to carry the whole burden of the cost of administration. It might be just as logically argued that income from such aninvestment as that to which I am referring should be exempt from all forms of taxation payable by citizens. </para>

                                <para>- It is quite obvious that there is one concept for the rich, and an entirely different one for the poor. That is- the logical interpretation to be placed upon the Treasurer's statement. It is quite evident that those people who derive income from interest on bonds are to be regarded as a separate class altogether and are to receive special protection. Agreements entered into by them are always to be regarded as most sacred, but no consideration is to be given to the poorer people who have entered into contracts of another kind. I repeat that there is one concept for the bondholder, and another entirely different concept for the wage-earner. </para>

                                <para>- The Commonwealth is continually altering the terms of its contracts with its own employees. I contend that my argument is sustained because it is just a matter of the groups with whom you are dealing. If it is a question of a financial arrangement, then it is repudiation, but if it is a question of the economic welfare of people, such as its own servants, then it is an entirely different matter. </para>

                                <para>- Those who hold securities and bonds should be called upon to pay the same increases of taxation as all other taxpayers have to pay. That is my simple suggestion. When the country has literally got its back to the wall bondholders should not be a privileged class, as they are to-day. Surely that is not too great a sacrifice for them to make in view of the fact that the men of our fighting forces may be called upon to sacrifice their lives. Yet the Government is seeking to permit interest on bonds worth £500,000,000 to be exempt from the ordinary rates of income. That is most unjust ! </para>

                                <para>- It would all be helpful. It might obviate the necessity for increasing the sales tax, or it might enable the Government to avoid making further inroads on middle-class incomes, such as those now proposed. At least it would divert this taxation to a point whereI believe these people are competent to carry it. It may be that some of the bondholders have invested only small amounts, but it is undeniable that the insurance companies and banks hold by far the larger proportion of these bonds. I am astounded at the Government's endeavour to exempt this class of individual. Its attitude is even less understandable after the remarks of the Assistant Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> last night, when he appealed for equality of sacrifice in facing the difficulty now encountered by our country, which is directing every nerve to a development of its war strength. When appeals are being made for sacrifices by the people in order to impress upon them the seriousness of the present position, bow can the Treasurer justify the exemption of this class of investor ? The honorable gentleman cannot do that no matter how persuasively he may argue on points of law. </para>

                                <para>- Principles depend upon the direction from which support may be expected. In any case, the Treasurer's argument about the principle involved in this issue cannot be sustained  to the point at which the safety of the country may depend on an absolute final act on the part of the Government in order to regiment the necessary resources for the successful defence of Australia. If we had our backs to the wall would the Treasurer still argue the soundness of the Government's proposal, and would he still stand by the principle ? </para>

                                <para>- I am not overstating the position and I am not attributing to the Treasurer opinions which he has not expressed. He has said that if in the circumstances indicated he approached the market for another loan, it might not be subscribed ; meaning, presumably, that the so-called patriots of this country would not make available to the Government their influence, resources and the profits which they have accumulated over long periods, in spite of the fact that this country had done so much for them. That is, in effect, the essence of the argument againstmy proposition. I ask the Treasurer what would happen if he put that argument to men who had volunteered to give their lives for their country, or to men who were making sacrifices in commerce and industry and living from day to day on a mere pittance in order to strengthen the nation's war effort. </para>

                                <para>-  The honorable member is arguing, apparently, that money invested in Commonwealth loans comes from a small handful of people. I point out that money which comes from insurance companies or banks represents the investments of a very large body of people, many of whom are on a low level of income. </para>

                                <para>- If my argument if followed to its logical conclusion, it will be found that those incomes are derived from a particular class of investor. If ] were employed in industry my investment would be my labour, and I should have to subject it to all the conditions which war imposes on the country. The Treasurer suggests that the moneyed investor is not to be put in the same category as other sections of the community.I contend that every section of the community, no matter how large or how small its investments may be, should bear the burden of taxation in direct proportion to the size of its income. However hard the honorable gentleman may try to make investment in bonds and giltedged securities a preserve which may not be violated by tax increases, the Treasurer cannot deny the soundness of my argument. </para>

                                <para>- I have no intention of canvassing the views of the right honorable member for Yarra on that point. My reply to the honorable member tor Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson)</inline> is that in 1931 the right honorable member for Yarra was not in a position to foresee that in 1940-41 this country would be making a supreme effort to ensure its safety. </para>

Then the masses of the people were engaged in an economic struggle to provide themselves with the wherewithal to live.

Bondholders whose- interest" rate1 was reduced : in 1931 from 5 -per- cent, to 3 per cent, did not lose anything, because the purchasing power of the reduced' income was unimpaired. Lower commodity prices made a reduction of 3 per cent, as valuable as the 5 per cent, formerly received. At that time <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Hal</inline> Colebatch, in articles to the newspapers, pointed out that investors had, in fact, made no real sacrifices, because of the lower prices charged for goods and services. The other sections of the community to which the honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway)</inline> referred - the working classes - suffered heavily. When they lost their employment they lost not a mere 5 per cent, or 3 per cent, of interest on investments, but everything they had. All that they could get was a dole docketor a meal ticket.  </para>

                                <para>- I am opposing discrimination. The Government's decision to exempt certain classes of the . community will have a very bad psycho-; logical effect on the rank and file.. It would be useless' to place before men and women lacking many of the comforts of life the arguments which have been advanced by the Treasurer to-day. This is a question almost of life and death to them, because of its effect on standards of living. The longer the Government continues to maintain a privileged classin the community - the more rapidly will it be moving towards the destruction of the existing social system. Protectionof a special class is the first and most definite ' step towards that  end. No doubt the Treasurer has opportunities to meet the poorer classes of the community and I do not claim to understand their position better than he does; but my constituents include many of the poorer people. Hundreds of them visit me almost weekly in order to secure assistance. It would be impossible for me to convince them that there is justice in the arguments of the Treasurer. It would be equivalent to telling them that I would rise in my place in this House and give the investors an open order for all sorts of privileges, such as the tax exemption which the Government now proposes to grant. Even if the Treasurer cannot understand my line of argument and can see legal objections to the terms which I have used, it must be obvious to him that psychologically it would be a bad move to grant tax exemptions to a particular section of the investing public. The Government would never be able to justify its action to the people who have to struggle to secure the bare necessaries of life. </para>

                                <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">in reply</inline> - In concluding the debate my first observation is that the comments which have come from the Opposition benches have, with few exceptions, revealed an extraordinary diversity of views and complete barrenness of ideas regarding the financial problems confronting Australia. I should like to know - although I doubt that I shall be told - what is the official view of Labour ? I invite the members of the Labour Opposition who have spoken on the financial statement, to compare their remarks, and to attempt, by some process of mental legerdemain, to reconcile them. The paucity of the criticism which has come from the Opposition benches is a clear indication that the financial policy of the Government cannot be severely criticized. </para>

                                <para>-Criticism may be of varying degrees; some of it is not worth anything, whereas criticism like portions of that of the right honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin),</inline> are valuable. I suggest that most of the criticism of the Government's policy by honorable members opposite comes within the first categorv. Both the right honorable member for Yarra and the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> recognize, however, that the problem to be solved is how to raise £70,000,000. It was conceded by the Opposition Leader that that sum had to be raised by loans and taxes, but there was not one word from him or the right honorable member for Yarra to suggest that, at this stage, further credit should be injected into the community. The obvious reason for that is that both men have a sense of their responsibility. But other Opposition members spoke differently. The honorable member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini)</inline> said that a limit could not be placed on the expansion of credit. If I were to attempt to express my conception of the honorable gentleman's ideas I should say that, in his view, the limit is the sky. The gentleman with the prophetic political name, who represents the district of Corio, also spoke. As I see it, his way to solve the financial problem is to expand until we burst, tax until we burst, and after that, the deluge. That seems to be not an unfair commentary on the views expressed by the honorable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman).</inline> I sincerely hope that he did not present the official view of Labour, because I fear for the future of this country if, by mischance, the Labour Opposition were to occupy the treasury bench in a time of crisis and gave effect to the views expounded by him. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable gentleman from Corio has imbibed at the wrong well.  His  views were hopelessly inconsistent with what I assume were the official views of the party as expressed by the right honorable member for Yarra, and also by the Leader of the Opposition insofar as the latter expressed any positive views at all apart from captious criticism. I would have thought that it is of first-class importance that the public should know precisely what is the official policy of Labour on finance. </para>

                        <para>It may be assumed that the right honorable member for Yarra was chosen to lead the Opposition's attack on the proposals of the Government; because of his considern bie experience in financial matters; and it may also be assumed, I suggest, that the financial statement was subjected to the most minute scrutiny before he spoke on behalf of his party. What has emerged from the discussion ? No honorable member opposite has denied the need to impose further taxes. Neither the right honorable member for Yarra nor the Leader of the Opposition denied the need to impose indirect, as well as direct, taxes, except insofar as the latter was sufficiently definite in his financial ideas as to suggest that all income above £5,000 should be taken by the Government. It is generally agreed that a sound principle of taxation is that there shall be no discrimination between classes, and that the burden shall be in proportion to the ability to bear it. Yet the Leader of the Opposition said that all income in excess of £5,000 per annum should be taken by the Government as one means of dealing with the financial problems of this country. </para>

                                <para>- Honorable members opposite, who continually profess to be desirous of maintaining employment in this country, should realize that that result cannot be achieved if the financial system be broken. Notwithstanding that the Government is faced with a task of tremendous magnitude in financing both the claims of peace and the needs of war, it has succeeded in not only maintaining, but also increasing, employment. Since August last 80,000 additional workers have found employment in Australia. Moreover, despite rising expenditure, it has maintained the full programme of works, both governmental and semi governmental, for this year in all of the States, and has reduced substantially the burden on the community by reducing interest rates. These matters are not referred to because for them at least the Government is entitled to credit. </para>

                        <para>Before I dissect the views expressed by the right honorable member for Yarra I shall deal with those of the leader of the other Labour party in this House. The honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> devoted well over 40 minutes to one theme. I assume it to be the only theme upon which he considered that the Government could reasonably be criticized. He said that there is £500,000,000 of loans which is free from taxation over and above the 1930 level. My first comment in respect of that is that the position arose out of the conversion operation effected by the Scullin Administration, for which I give all credit to the right honorable member for Yarra. It has been of tremendous value to this country, having resulted in the saving of millions of pounds to the national exchequer. Bondholders were asked to convert holdings carrying a certain rate of interest, into new bonds carrying a lower rate of interest, a <inline font-style="italic">quid pro quo</inline> being protection from increase of taxation beyond the 1930 level. </para>

                                <para>- I shall come to that in good time. The honorable member for West Sydney did not see, refused to see, or pretended not to see, that there is a vital distinction between contracts made between individuals and a contract made between a government and an individual. Contracts between individuals are always subject to the condition that the dominant domain of Parliament may interfere with them. Wages and salaries are paid on the condition that the Government may take a portion of them for the purpose of financing its operations. But an obligation solemnly entered into by a government is controlled by an entirely different set of circumstances. The Government of the day gave to the investors a solemn undertaking that, in consideration of their investing their money at the rate then offered, certain protection would be afforded to them for the future. It is said that because that was done some years ago, and times have since changed, the obligation should be repudiated. Of course the use of the word " repudiate " is very carefully avoided; but what is it if not repudiation, when a government is under a solemn obligation to its bondholders to pay them in accordance with certain conditions and refuses to observe those conditions? It is said that the bondholders must be told that those conditions are to be broken. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member for West Sydney has argued that there is no distinction between a private contract and a governmental contract. I venture to suggest that it is not necessary to do more than point to the simple fact to which I have referred, to show the vital distinction that exists between the two. I repeat that there has been a careful avoidance of the use of the word "repudiation". The honorable member says that times have changed. I say that repudiation of a government's obligations, except in a last extremity, would indicate an unpardonable lack of national and commercial morality. </para>

                                <para>- Unquestionably there is. The argument of the honorable member for West Sydney furnishes a good party political catch-cry. Thosewho examine the matter realize how empty and fallacious it is; but it iseasy to convince the average person in the street, who knows nothing of thehistory of the conversion operation and the conditions under which it was effected,, that there is justification for compellingtotal payment of tax in respect of bondsthat are now free from tax above a certain limit. </para>

                                <para>- In substance, there is hone whatever. Either the Government or an individual may ask the otherparty to a contract to agree to alter it.. That is what was done. Let me make it perfectly plain that this Government will not stand for the repudiation of obligations. I suggest to the honorable members for West Sydney and Dalley that what he urges would be justified only in the last emergency. It is argued that if" the suggestion of this section of theLabour party we're adopted, the Government would still get from future loans all of the money that it needed. Both the honorable member for Dalley, and his leader, the honorable member for West Sydney know perfectly well that a government which repudiated its obligations could not expect bondholders to accept any promise made thereafter, and that, would lead to financial disaster as well as to a vast volume of unemployment, throughout the country. </para>

                        <para>Let me turn now to the views expressedby the honorable member for Corio. It will be noticed by honorable members that, as I have already pointed out, they are hopelessly inconsistent with those of the right honorable member for Yarra. The honorable member argued that thereshould first be credit expansion to somehopelessly indefinite limit, and then taxation. He contended that it mattersnot whether the money is raised by way-  of loans or taxes, because it comes from precisely the same source. I cannot conceive of a responsible man in this assembly, who claims any knowledge of finance, committing such an egregious blunder. It is perfectly obvious that the amount invested in government loans comes substantially, not from income but from past savings. Apparently the idea is that there is no distinction between the one and the other: The honorable member should have said that whether the money was raised by taxes or by loans it still is taken from the community. </para>

                        <para>I come now to the very critical examination of the financial statement by the right honorable member for Yarra, who made two points, the first being the nature of the taxation, and the second and major one, the state of our London funds, and the manner in which the Government is shaping up to its overseas obligations. As I understood the right honorable gentleman, what he suggested was, not that we should not further expand credit, but that the way in which it is being expanded is enabling the trading banks to make huge profits and at the same time is permitting them to control the financial policy of the Commonwealth. Let us examine the position. The right honorable gentleman dealt first with the profits of the trading banks. There is a marked tendency on the part of some honorable members opposite to refer, on every conceivable occasion, to the report of the Royal Commission on Banking and Monetary Reform, and, in particular, to paragraph 504, which seems to be the only one that some of them have read. </para>

                                <para>- I shall reply to the right honorable gentleman in my own way. There was an inference in his speech that by reason of the fact that the Commonwealth Bank had expanded credit the trading banks were also expanding credit of their own volition, because of the initial expansion by the Commonwealth Bank, and were thereby making undue profits. Let me refer honorable gentlemen to the report of the Royal Commission on Banking and Monetary Reform in respect of the. profits of the trading banks up to the year 1936. </para>

                                <para>- My reply to the right honorable member is that the adoption of that course might be perfectly good under certain circumstances, but if applied at a time when an endeavour is being made to obtain the full benefit of our credit expansion it would neutralize such effort. The object of the Commonwealth Bank at present is to expand credit, through the trading banks, to the trading community, but if, at the same time, the trading banks were compelled to deposit a certain proportion of their assets with the Commonwealth Bank the attempt to expand credit would be neutralized to that extent. It may be taken for granted that this Government is as much concerned about our financial structure as the honorable members of the Opposition pretend to be. The Government is watching the whole situation' very carefully, and if it thought that an undue use was being made of the credit being made available to the trading banks, it would not hesitate to interfere. Until that time arrives, it will seek to obtain the maximum benefit from the expanded credit. That it is doing so is undoubtedly reflected in the employment figures of this country. </para>

                                <para>- The inference from t he right honorable member's remarks was that the Government was not facing the position. A reference to the financial statement will reveal that it was pointed out that since the outbreak of the war there had been a substantial increase of imports, and that there had also been a measure of control of those from non-sterling countries. It was made perfectly clear, too, that the volume of those imports was such as to indicate theneed for further restrictions. </para>

                                <para>- During the last four years the average annual value of the imports to this country has been £96,000,000. In the depression period, to which the right honorable member for Yarra referred, our imports reached a value of £140,000,000 in one year. The increased value of the imports into this country during the last six months has been due in the main to fortuitous circumstances. It is true that prior to that time our trade balance was being adversely affected, but surely no responsible person would suggest that because of an adverse balance over a period of two or three years due to seasonal or temporary factors the Government should adopt an increasingly drastic policy of restriction. If that course were adopted serious difficulties would fall upon certain classes of the community, particularly employees. What is necessary, of course, to enable moneys to be paid from any London funds to meet overseas commitments is not only the building up of such overseas funds, involving any necessary restriction of imports, but also resort to taxation or borrowing within this country. The Government is watching the whole situation very carefully, and will take such action as it deems necessary to preserve our stability. No one can deny that our present financial position is substantially stable. No drastic action is advisable at the moment in respect of imports. If any such drastic action were taken many people would be plunged into unemployment. It is becoming increasingly difficult to correct an adverse balance of trade by even drastic restriction of consumable goods. Further, it is commonly recognized that a considerable volume of our goods imported is required for the development of our industries. Nevertheless, the Government is doing its utmost, bearing all the facts in mind, to restrict imports from non-sterling countries. That must surely be apparent to all honorable members. But even the steps now being taken are causing complaints about the possibility of increased unemployment. </para>

                                <para>-  Then I take it that the right honorable gentleman was referring to two years ago. Let 'me point out to him the exact position. There was a fall -of our London funds from £89,000,000 in June, 1937, to £55,000,000 in June, 1939. That fall was due to the fact that our London funds were being used for the purpose for which such reserves are intended, owing to temporary circumstances, mainly a reduction of the export value of our wool and primary production generally and a fall in wool production in the season 1938-39. If it is urged that every time the prices or volume of wool and wheat fall the Government should proceed to restrict imports correspondingly [ say frankly that I am not prepared to adopt such a policy. The results of the operations of the last two years have, as I have pointed out, been due to temporary factors. It would be a hopeless procedure to restrict imports whenever a temporary fall of the price of our export commodities occurred. It is perfectly clear, also, that the extraordinary increase of the value of imports since the outbreak of the war is due substantially to' the action of people who are endeavouring to stock up for the years ahead, so that they may. he able to maintain their industries if it becomes more difficult to secure supplies. </para>

                                <para>- It is easy to use the word " speculators ". There is no evidence of speculation. All of the evidence points rather to prudent business management. The control of prices ' is, moreover, adequately provided for. Because imports have increased substantially since the outbreak of war - a fact which the Government has admitted - the right honorable member blames the policy of two years ago. What matters now is the policy of to-day. The Government is fully seised of the problem before it, and the country may rest assured that it will deal with that problem as urgently as circumstances demand. I indicated in the financial statement that it would become :more and more urgent to restrict the goods coming from sterling countries, but that raises a problem which is not capable of easy solution. </para>

                                <para>- Of course it will not. 1 shall come later to the question of our immediate overseas requirements. It is the ultimate satisfaction of these requirements which has relation to the state of the London funds. No one would suggest that by any form of restriction of imports we could meet our needs from London funds at present. The right honorable member for Yarra invited me to say what we are doing in the meantime. I direct his attention to the various controls which I mentioned in the financial statement - control of the overseas position and the prevention of capital from fleeing the country. We have kept capital locked in Australia. We are restricting, .imports from non-sterling countries, not in any drastic way which would unnecessarily reflect itself in employment, but, as any sensible government, would do, by adjusting the restrictions to meet the circumstances of the country. One can readily understand the difficulties that will be heaped on Great Britain by having its export trade cut down, but we may be forced shortly to restrict substantially imports from sterling countries. In the meantime we are arranging to borrow overseas. How otherwise can we finance our overseas obligations except at the expense of employment in this country ? </para>

Drastic restriction of imports at this stage would have the direct result of throwing people in this country out of employment. Overseas commitments must be paid for out of London funds or credit established overseas.  They  cannot be met out of credits established in Australia; therefore, we must first have sufficient London funds, and then either tax or borrow. </para>

When you reach the stage at which you have to restrict imports drastically you must' cause unemployment in this country.

                        <para>I point to the liquidity of the trading banks as reflecting the benefit of this Government's financial policy. [ <inline font-style="italic">Leave to continue given.]</inline> The liquidity of trading banks and the resultant increase of employment,, are to the credit of this Government. When the war broke out, the Government was faced with a recession of employment, and diminishing liquidity of the banks. The policy that the Government lias applied since the war has resulted in the liquidity of the banks being higher than at any other time for many years. If one looks at the ratio of advances to deposits and at the composition of the deposits, it will -be found that this country is, by virtue of the Government's policy, in the best possible position to develop industry during the war, and at the same time to expand our war effort. </para>

                                <para>- Yes. As the honorable member for Corio has just entered the chamber it is fair that I should repeat in his presence my summary of his financial policy. I summed up 'his policy as " expand till you burst, tax till you burst, and after that the deluge ". I assume that that honorable gentleman's policy can be reconciled by him with the policy of the party to which he belongs. I impress upon the party opposite that, if any regard is to' be had for the working man, his employment and conditions, the worst possible thing to do would be to inflate. We cannot be charged with not applying a liberal policy, and the crux of the matter is that because we have a policy which has the approval of the people, there is little left to criticize. </para>

They know that if they themselves had to go into the minutiae of raising more revenue they could not avoid imposing indirect taxes.

                                <para>- Yes. I say in all sincerity that the Government's financial programme is directed to protect the working man, to assist him, and to re-  lieve  him of any direct burden unless and until it becomes unavoidable. Despite the heavy war commitments 80 per cent, of Australian families will not be affected to the amount of even one penny by the new direct taxation proposals. In attacking the indirect taxation proposals, the party opposite has, however, interpreted them as meaning that every penny of the taxes will come from the workers^ Customs and excise have not been attacked except in a general way. The petrol tax has not been mentioned. The only impost at which it finger was pointed with any directness was the sales tax. </para>

                        <para>What is the position with regard to sales tax? The Government could have widened the scope of that impost, but it did .not do so, particularly because of the effect it would have had on the working man and on the export industries. An additional £5,000,000 is intended to be raised by reason of the tax levied in that particular  field;  but I ask honorable members to examine the field in order to see to what extent an extra burden has been imposed on the working man. To some extent, it is true, an extra burden has been imposed, but it is distributed throughout the community. We all share the burden, no matter what our income or our standing in the community may be. The chief objection to an indirect tax is that the burden cannot be spread equitably as the income tax spreads it. </para>
                        <para>When regard is had to the fact to which I have drawn attention, namely, that the field left open to us to raise £20,000,000 is such that the whole of the money could not be raised by direct taxation without a catastrophic effect on the community, the. argument that we should not increase indirect taxation shows a hopeless, bankruptcy of ideas, and is used only for political purposes. Let us now consider certain aspects of the income tax proposals. The question is asked why we should not increase the tax of the man whose income is obtained from property to the same extent as in the case of the taxpayer whose income is derived from personal exertion. In my speech on the Income Tax Bill I drew attention to the reasons why the Government has approached the problem in the manner it has, and I dealt with the historical development of the two rates. If taxation is to be based upon ability to pay, why should property incomes between .£1,500 and £5,000 sometimes bear twice the amount of tax of those derived from personal exertion ? Is there any justification why a man receiving £2,500. a year from property should pay twice the amount of tax contributed in respect of a similar income derived from personal exertion? There cannot be. By reason of the fact that this disparity existed before the Government was faced with its present problem, we could not merely by a percentage increase throughout the scale raise the money required, because it would have forced property income taxpayers in the upper grades to pay more than 20s. in the £1. Therefore the Government has not lacked the necessary courage to face up to this matter. </para>
                        <para>As to the personal exertion income rates, the increases generally have been subjected to a meticulous examination of the percentages of increases involved. Our critics say that the man with an income of £350 a year has had his tax increased by 100 per cent., but how much a year does that represent? Probably only two or three pounds. We must have regard to the burden already carried and its proportion to the extra burden being imposed. Nobody with a sense of fairness, who was not seeking merely to make political capital out of this financial statement, could say less than that it is designed to protect industry and employment, to relieve the family man, and to throw the burden on the shoulders of those best able to bear it. I submit that the Government has done that with great courage. </para>

                        <para>Avar broke out, employment was diminishing. We were then faced with tremendously increased expenditure and added problems. I suggest that two factors have directly contributed to our success in dealing with the heavy problem of financing our war expenditure whilst at the same time assisting industry and providing employment. One is that the Government has adopted a liberal financial policy by using central bank credit to the extent advisable, and the other is that it has deliberately set out on a policy of reducing interest rates. The result of this policy is that employment is now greater than it had been since last August. The net increase of the number of men employed throughout the Commonwealth is, as I have already remarked, 80,000, or about 4 per cent. of our working population. When we are asked where this improvement is to be seen, I point out that it is to be found in the official statistical records. Whilst avoiding inflation on the one hand and on the other using central bank action within safe limits, the Government has shown a determination to pursue a policy directed to assist the working man and the family man, and to impose the burden of taxation on those shoulders which are broad enough to bear it. </para>

                                <para>- If I had time to elaborate my argument in respect of the subject-matter of the interjectionI would willingly do so. Time after time the suggestion is made that only theLabour party thinks of the welfare of the working man. The cold fact is that, if we adopted the policy of credit expansion advocated by the honorable member for Corio, the savings of the workers would not be worth anything. ' Their wages would lag behind costs, and would have a diminished purchasing power; unless, of course, we accepted the policy of the right honorable member for Yarra and providedfor some kind of price control, which would be no different from that of Germany, involving iron regimentation of the whole of the community. </para>

                        <para>I shall deal finally with a so-called anomaly in the allowance of rebate oh income derived from dividends of2s. in the £1 this year where thecompanies had paid tax at the rate of1s. 1.8d. Much was made of this matter, the suggestion being that there is something unjust about it, and that protection is given to the rich man. I suppose that it may be said that' the members of the Royal Commission on Taxation, which recommended this system of taxation rebates, at least were notpolitically minded, but were only concerned with making suggestions for the improvement of our taxation measures as fiscal instruments. The recommendation of that commission wasthat the rebate  should be allowed at the amount payable in the year of assessment. One very good reason was that, in respect of profits accumulated over a number of years, when different rateswereapplicable, it is impossible to determine theyears in which the profits so accumulated had been earned. A further reason was because an individual shareholder pays at the rate applicable to the year in which he is assessed on his dividends. To rebate dividends at the rate applicable to the current year in one instance, and at the rate applicable to the previous year in another instance, would be without justification. In addition, it must be remembered that if in another year the company rate is reduced, the shareholder's rebate should, if the criticismis valid, be limited to the lowest company rate of the current year and not as calculated at the higher rate of the previous year. For those reasons the taxation commission recommended the policy which has been followed by the Government. So the criticism of the Opposition borne in a mist of words disa ppears. </para>

The next point was in respect of preference shares. Ho also evaded that point. <inline font-style="italic">[Further leave in continue given.]</inline></para>

                            <para>- The right honorable member's point is that at the time when the profits were made the company rate of tax was, say,1s. By the time the rebate was made the rate was 2s., and 2s. was rebated. My answer is that the taxation commission, which dealt with the subject, recommended that that policy should be adopted. </para>

                                <para>- It can be done, but with great difficulty, and with injustice. The opinion of the right honorable gentleman differs from that of the taxation commission, whose recommendations should be regarded as impartial. A most important reason given by the commission, as I have indicated, was that when a person is seeking a rebate, and his rate is less than 2s., he can receive only a rebate based on the rate of tax he pays for the assessment year. We cannot provide one rebate for him and a different rebate for taxpayers whose rate is over 2s. They were two vital reasons given by the commission. </para>

The Government does not make a gift from the Treasury; it is recognizing a condition upon which persons in the preference shareholding class invest their money in a company. They insist that they should get for their money say7 per cent. net, and if, in point of fact, we provided that the rebate should not be paid to them they would require <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> additional amount of interest. </para>

                                <para>- In that case why not reduce the maximum to much less than £5,000? In the ardour of debate, sometimes the truth leaks out, and we are able to see what is actually behind a speaker's mind. It is perfectly clear that the leader of one Labour party said that there is no reason why the State should not takes - I should use the word "confiscate" - all income over £5,000! The leader of the other Labour party says that there is no reason why interest on bonds, which are tax free, should not be taxed. That, of course, would mean repudiation. So on the one hand we have confiscation, and on the other, repudiation. </para>

                        <para>. -  This is one of the usual appropriation bills which have to be passed each year to make provision for the payment of pensions. The amount involved in this instance is £10,000,000. We have already expended £155,000,000 on war pensions in respect of the war of 1914-18, andwe know that the rate of expenditure will not taper off very much during the next twenty years. As a matter of fact, for the next few years it will probably increase. Let us try to imagine, therefore, what a tremendous pensions burden will be imposed on the community should the present war be anything like as long or as deadly as was the last. The Opposition approves of this measure. </para>

                        <para>. - This is another routine appropriation bill, the purpose of which is to appropriate £17,000,000 from Consolidated Revenue, and place it in a special fund from which pensions payments will be made. I suggest to the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender)</inline> that he should encourage the payment of old-age and invalid pensions by cheque to those who desire it. I know that the system has been introduced, but it should be extended as far as possible. A great many people whom I know do not like going along to the post office to collect their pensions, and it should be brought to their knowledge that they may, if they choose, have them paid by cheque. In time practically all pensions might be paid in this way, with a probable saving of administrative expenses. I also suggest that something should be done to simplify the payment of pensions to inmates of hospitals, and other institutions of the kind. Trouble frequently occurs - not that any one tries to make trouble - because confusion arises over such matters as how much the institution is to retain, how much the patient is to receive, and when he is to receive it. There is nothing contentious about this measure, and we do not intend to delay its passage. </para>

                        <para>.- I ask the Government to give further consideration, in the light of amendments already made to regulations made in Great Britain, which were the same as the regulations which have been made under the National Security Act. When the regulations under the act were adopted in this House we were told that, harshas many of them might appear to be, they were part of a uniform scheme operating throughout all the dominions and in Great Britain. Then, about that very time, or perhaps a little later, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dingle</inline> Foot, a Liberal member of the House of Commons, moved that an Address-in-Reply be presented asking for the disallowance of the whole of the regulations; He took that action because it was not permissible to move for the disallowance of part only of the regulations. He initiated a very long and fruitful discussion, at the end of which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Hoare indicated that, if the motion were withdrawn, the Government would consider the amendment of the regulations which had been the subject of attack. Considerable changes were made by the regulations which came into force on the 23rd November last. I draw particular attention to the Australian defence regulations 41 and 42 which were criticized in this House. As it stands our regulation 41 imposes a penalty on any person convicted of endeavouring to cause disaffection among persons engaged in the service of the King or the Commonwealth, or in the performance of essential services. That, of course, meant that a person might be guilty of causing disaffection amongst employees of a private employer. Objection was taken in the House of Commons - very reasonably, I submit - to the use of the word "disaffection ", and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Stafford</inline> Cripps said - </para>

                    <para class="block">That distinction was not drawn by regulation 39 (B) as originally adopted in England, and it is not drawn in our regulation 42 as it stands to-day. As the result of the discussion in the House of Commons, regulation 39 <inline font-style="italic">(B)</inline> was amended and, in its new form, it provides for the punishment of those making false statements, uttering false documents or false reports. It further provides, however, that the person who is prosecuted may defend himself by claiming that, although what he said was false, he reasonably believed it to be true. That regulation does not provide for the punishment of a person making a statement of opinion, whereas in Australia a statement of opinion is punishable. In England, the clause which provided that an editor who was convicted under that section could be forbidden to publish a newspaper, has been deleted. As we originally endeavoured to make our regulations uniform with those in England, I submit that we should also make them uniform with amendments of the English regulations. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Stafford</inline> Cripps has said - </para>

                            <para>- My submission is that, as the Government followed the original British regulations, it should be consistent and follow the amendment of those regulations made in November last. I point out that any problems and difficulties, due to Nazi propaganda, pacifist propaganda or Communist .propaganda that arise in this country, are much less acute here than in Great Britain because that country is so much closer to the main theatre of war. Organizations of pacifists, Nazi sympathizers and Communists wield much more influence in Great Britain than they do in Australia. Therefore, if the British. Government- was willing to make liberal amendments to the regulations  in  November, 1939, surely the Commonwealth Government should be ready to follow its example now. </para>

                        <para>.- On Friday last I again brought to the notice of the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Street)</inline> complaints of wasteful expenditure in connexion with contracts for the supply of foodstuffs to the Elphin showgrounds military camp at Launceston. The Minister has since replied to my representations which were extended over a period of some months. I am indebted to the honorable gentleman for the information given ; but I am bound to say that there appears to be no good reason for the delay, and I consider that the reply does not furnish a satisfactory explanation of the high prices charged for curtain commodities supplied to that camp. As I explained previously, the camp is only a small one, and if the wasteful expenditure there  is  typical of the state of affairs in the larger camps all over Australia, there  is  definite need for a comprehensive inquiry. In his reply  to  my letter, the Minister stated  i - </para>

                    <para>That is a speculation rather than a statement of fact. If it is true that the method of procedure was altered after the contract was let, there still remains some ground for inquiry and explanation to : his House. I shall not labour this question. I merely draw attention to it in order to secure some assurance that there will be an effective tightening of control in these matters. After all, what has happened in the past cannot he remedied now. If there has been some duplication of control, resulting in loss, it is now too  late  to hold a post-mortem examination. I nin concerned not so much with what has happened in the past as with preventing similar happenings in the future. I should like the Minister, in his usual frank way, to give an explanation to the House, and also to make a statement on the  general position in relation to the letting of contracts and the method of control to be adopted in future by the Contracts Board. I realize that this is a big and growing department and that it is not easy to keep a check on all of the expenditure; but care should be taken that there are no undue leakages, or " rake-offs " by popple who are always keen to exploit the community, whether in peace or war.

                            <para>- It was opened in New Guinea, but mine was opened in Sydney. In this connexion, I desire to state that the secretary of the Labour party in New Guinea has suggested that if letters from New Guinea to addresses in Australia are to be opened at all, they should be opened in Australia rather than in New Guinea. The residents of the territory fear that some partisanship may be displayed locally. I believe that until now the Minister has been convinced that, there has been no discrimination in these matters, and I hope that he will now take steps to ensure that, if letters are to he picked up at random for opening by the censors, all parties shall be treated fairly. </para>

                    </quote>
                    <para>I am now in a position to inform the honorable member that the cradles referred to were special welded angle iron trestles made to support each individual aircraft and to suit the particular position whereeachaircraft was stowed on the ship. As faras can be ascertained, no piping was used for this purpose. Whether these trestles were the property of the Commonwealth, the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation (which supplied and packed the aircraft), or the shipping company was not definitely established, but the Air Force would have claimed them had they been of any use. Consequently, the first set received was taken to the Royal Australian Air Force station at Richmond, where it was ascertained that they were of no use as trestles and, moreover, their value for any Air Force purpose did no* justify the cost of handling and transportation charges. The local Lockheed agents believed the trestles were not the property of the Commonwealth. The-, therefore, cabled their principals in America, the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation, asking if they desired the trestles returned, and a reply was received to the effect that their return was not desired. The agents then inquired regarding the scrap metal value of the trestles and found that it was below the customs duty payable to land them. While the Department of Air has no knowledge that the trestles were dumped overboard, it is probable that this action was taken by arrangement between the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation's agents and the shipping company. It is realized that the destruction of any metal, even if only scrap, is wrong in principle, particularly under present conditions,and action is being taken by the Department of Air to prevent recurrences of this sort of thing in future. </para>
