            <para>That the House,  at  its rising, adjourn until Wednesday, the 1st May, at 3 p.m. </para>
            <para>I do this because it has been suggested that it would be a convenience to honorable members who desire to attend Anzac Day services in their electorates if they could get away from Canberra to-night. The proposal is convenient to the Government, which has a great massof Cabinet work, includingWar Cabinet business, under consideration, as the adjournment would enable the Cabinet to devote tonight and to-morrow to that work. The proposal of the Government is that we should adjourn this evening, about dinner-time, in order to enable members to catch trains, and that we meet onWednesday, Thursday and Friday of next week, reverting to Tuesday,Wednesday and Thursday sittingson the following week. </para>

I suggest to him that, before the motion is put, he should indicate to the House the truth or otherwise of reports which have appeared in certain sections of the press that the Government intends to introduce some licensing system in connexion with mine-workers - a proposal which, I submit, would be most contentious.I couldnot agree to an adjournment of the House if that course were being contemplated. </para>

The Government has, however, given further consideration to the problems which arise from the coal dispute, and it believes that an announcement, in precise terms, of its policy should be made at this stage. Accordingly, I now announce that, unless the mine-workers decide this week to resume work and pursue constitutional methods, the Government will, at the beginning of next week, take steps to reopen the mines. The Governmentis determined that war industries and essential services shall be maintained. </para>

                            <para>- Last night, the Prime Minister quoted from the publication <inline font-style="italic">Common Cause,</inline> to show that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Orr</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nelson,</inline> officials of the Miners Federation, had said that the coalminers&#39; award was one of the best awards that had been issued. Does not the Prime Minister agree that that was tantamount to indicating to the rank and file that they favoured the award, as I know they did? How can he, then, come to the conclusion that this strike is the result of Communist leadership, when the Communists, in the first place, said that it was a good award? Does the right honorable gentleman know that this is not the miners&#39; fight, but is due to the dissatisfaction of the craft unions, and that the miners are in it because they have been brought up with strict sense of union solidarity, believing in the principle that an injury to one is an injury to all? </para>

                            <para>- Dealing with the interrogative portion of the honorable member&#39;s remarks, it is true that the Communist leaders started off by applauding the award. It is equally true that they later on. condemned it. It is equally true that they have since fomented the strike. It is also true that one of the two gentlemen referred to announced recently that he, and those connected with him, would carry on this fight till they had tied&#39; up every industry in Australia. The whole story furnishes an example of how men can follow a course of conduct which begins with the approval of an award, and ends with what can only be described as revolutionary action. </para>

                <para>The wharf at Port Augusta was erected approximately 50 years ago. Since then heavy maintenance work has been carried out. A recent examination above and below water has disclosed that serious deterioration has taken place and that it ha3 reached the stage at which practically the reconstruction of the wharf is necessary. The wharf is an integral part of the Commonwealth railways. Under the provisions of the Commonwealth Railways Act 1917-1936, the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner is required to maintain it in a state of efficiency. The wharf is now in such a condition that, in the interests of safety and efficient working, it must be attended to. Various schemes, estimated to cost from &#163;14,000 to &#163;70,000, have been considered. In view of the apparently heavy expenditure involved, the Commissioner arranged for an expert engineer for wharf construction maintenance from the Melbourne Harbour Trust to examine the wharf and submit a report. As the result of such examination, and following upon collaboration between the engineer and the </para>
                <para class="block">Commissioner, a scheme of repairs and improvements has now been recommended. The scheme provides for the renewal of approximately 310 piles, the renewal of timber above and below water, the widening of the wharfby about 4 feet to protect the toe of the stone-pitched bank, and the strengthening of the design of the wharf. The estimated cost is &#163;34,700. </para>

                        <para>- I have no knowledge whatever of such statements in the press, but it is ridiculous to suggest that there would be any deliberate attempt by the department to delay correspondence going to the coal-fields for the purpose of preventing the miners from obtaining relief. </para>

                        <para>- I should not rise to ask this question were it not for the fact  that the Acting Minister for Information has not yet answered a letter which I wrote to him from Newcastle on Sunday. Is the Minister aware that there is a good deal of discontent amongst members of the Australian Imperial Force owing to the fact that the censor here is opening their letters? The complaint that I made to the honorable gentleman was that one officer from my district took strong exception to the fact that the censor had opened a letter written to him by his wife. &#34;Will this practice of the censor prying into letters addressed by a woman to her husband on the other side of the world be discontinued? </para>

I have not seen the letter to which the honorable gentleman refers, but, as it was addressed to my colleague on Sunday, it has not yet reached me. I can give no assurance that letters addressed to anybody will not be censored, because it is obvious that the censor has not the slightest idea of whom the writer may be. </para>

                    <para>With a view to encouraging the development of the producer gas unit industry the Government has made an arrangement with a number of manufacturers in the different States under which some 425 units are being or have been manufactured in order to encourage and stimulate the use of those units amongst transport organizations. In the last two days a conference on this matter has been held and I have no doubt that the development of producer gas units and other substitutes for liquid fuels will constitute part of the investigation which is proceeding.

                    <para>- I am not aware of those precise figures, but I point out to the honorable member that even if J. and A. Brown and Abermain did make a profit of more than &#163;90,000, the capital of that firm is &#163;1,900,000. To say what the profit is without reference to what the actual capital may be is to say very little. The fact is that the shares of each of the companies referred to, as I pointed out last night, stand at a substantial discount in the market. </para>

                            <para>.- I con.gratulate those honorable gentlemen who moved and seconded the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply to the Speech of  His Excellency  the Governor-General on the high note on which they initiated this debate. I do not propose to say very much about the war. So much has already been said here and elsewhere that it is difficult to say anything new which would be helpful. The position is so grave that it calls for less talk and more action if we arc <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> combat successfully an enemy which acts first and talks afterwards. In the interests of civilization every effort should be made to win this war as soon as possible. It is not only killing the flower of our manhood but also destroying the soul of humanity and lowering the moral and spiritual, standards of the world. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    <para>Recent developments have brought the war nearer to our home, and it is now clear that the first responsibility of <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> Government is to be prepared to defend Australia&#39;s shores. I believe that the Commonwealth Government has been in close consultation with the Government of the United Kingdom in order to ascertain how far Australia can go in assisting the Empire without endangering its own safety. To a great degree, however, Empire defence is home defence, for without the Empire we would soon have no homo to defend. Since the beginning of this war we have been given a very vivid reminder of the degree to which our economic security depends upon the supremacy of the British Empire. What would have been the value to us of the &#163;100,000,000 worth of primary produce which we have shipped to the other side of the world if our trade routes had not been kept open? The transport of these commodities was only possible because of the protection afforded by the British navy. Our destiny as a free and intelligent people is bound up with that of the British Empire because, if the Empire should go down, Australia would become a big prize for one of the large powers which would then dominate the- world. Apart from these consideration?, common gratitude demands that Australia should be prepared to go to the assistance of the Mother Country in a time of trial. </para>
                    <para>A very urgent and important problem confronts the Commonwealth at the present time. It is the necessity for the provision of further shipping facilities. </para>
                    <para class="block">I  trust that at an early date the Government will proceed with a vigorous programme of shipbuilding. The commandeering of many of our merchant vessels for war purposes, and losses due to the war, have created a very serious shortage of shipping space for the transport of our primary products overseas. That position is already acute, and it is becoming more acute as the war proceeds and will remain so for some time after the war has ended. An effective shipbuilding programme is vital in the interests of Aus-, tralian economy and in order to keep the Empire supplied with foodstuffs. The building of ships, therefore, should be the first consideration of the Government ; because that work is certainly more important at the present time than the manufacture of motor cars. In view of the limited equipment and number of skilled men available, it is clear that it will be impossible to proceed with vigorous programmes for both shipbuilding and motor car manufacturing. Therefore, the Government must concentrate for the present upon shipbuilding. Finance for both projects will have to come from Consolidated Revenue. The Government has raised a special levy of approximately &#163;1,350,000 for the manufacture of motor cars, but this sum has gone into Consolidated Revenue, not to the credit of a special fund, as apparently some honorable members and others outside Parliament believe. </para>
                    <para>I was pleased to note that the Governor-General referred in his Speech to provision for an amendment of the electoral law, and I trust that the Government will proceed this session with some reform of the present system of Senate elections under which the position of a man&#39;s name on the ballot-paper, rather than his personal qualifications, determines his election. An examination of the present personnel of the Senate discloses that of 36 senators, 33 have names beginning with letters in the first half of the alphabet - the A-to-M group. The desire of all parties to nominate candidates whose names begin with the letter &#34; A &#34; or closely succeeding letters is becoming more intense. At the last Senate elections- when nineteen senators were elected because an extra senator had to be returned in New South Wales-only one candidate whose name began with a letter in the latter half of the alphabet was successful. The names of most of the senators elected began with one of the first few letters of the alphabet. Lf the present system .is allowed to continue we shall soon reach the absurd stage when only men whose names begin with the letter &#34;A&#34; need apply as candidates for election to the Senate. I emphasize that this method would reduce the selection of members of the Senate to about 5 per cent, of the electors, and that, if continued, it would ultimately undermine the foundations of our democratic institutions. I trust that during this session the Government will introduce a pleasure to amend the electoral law relating to the election of senators, and so end a state of affairs which is a reflection on the intelligence of the people. </para>
                    <para>The Government is to be complimented on the able manner in which the country has been transferred from peace to war&#39; time conditions. The task has been tremendous; only those who have been closely associated with it have any conception of its magnitude. The drastic action that lias been found necessary in certain directions has naturally caused inconvenience, and, in some instances, heavy losses. It would appear-- and I emphasise this point- that at times members of the public have been unnecessarily irritated. One of the most serious complaints is in connexion with the delay in obtaining decisions as to what should be done. 1 realize that, as we become more accustomed to the new order, many of these irritations will disappear; but I suggest that more latitude be given to officers in the various States, so that decisions may be made more speedily. As to the rationing of imports and price-fixing, I submit that, in all fairness, the business community should be told as soon as possible what decisions have been made, and what action they may take. At present, business is being hampered because of these delays. I know of many business people who hesitate to develop their businesses because they do not know how the restriction of imports will affect them. </para>
                    <para>I trust that in preparing its taxation proposals for the coming year, the Go-  vernment  will pay  due  regard to the requirements of State Governments, in order that the taxation measures of the Commonwealth and the States will be more equably distributed among all sections of the community. There is danger of overlapping, resulting in one section of the community having to bear more than its fair share of the heavy taxation which will have to be borne. I also suggest that arrangements bc made between the Commonwealth and State Governments to spread the income tax assessments over the year. I would point out. that in Queensland the State income tax and the State development tax become due about a month before the assessments for federal income tax are payable. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender)</inline> would do well to confer with the State Governments in this connexion. A more even spreading of the payments would be a convenience to taxpayers, and would cause less disturbance of industry. In Queensland, for instance, com moree and industry are disturbed unduly during the months of March and April, when those heavy assessments hu vo to be met. I trust that the Minister will do .something to stagger future assessments. At present, the assessments stagger the taxpayers. I hope flint \re shall have an early opportunity to discuss the income-tax proposals of the Government. I repeat what I said when discussing the last budget that, if the Government lias any proposals to deal with war-time profits, it, will riot repeat the procedure followed during the last war, when it was possible for n company making 60 per cent, net profit to escape the war-time profits&#39; tax, whilst other companies with a net profit of, say <inline font-style="italic">12</inline> per cent., had to pay it. Whatever is done in this connexion, I hope there will bo a less complicated system than on the former occasion, and that the tax will be in proportion to the profits. </para>
                    <para>I arn pleased that the Minister for the  aRmy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Street)</inline> has decided that, as far as possible, members of the Australian Imperial Force will receive training in their own States. Some month 3 ago, when it was announced that all of the training would take place in Victoria and Now South Wales, I urged that the mcn should be trained in their own States, mid T am glad that that is to be done in the future. Such training will be in the interest of, not only the men themselves, and their relatives who wish to visit them in the camp, but also the States from which they enlist. </para>

                            <para>.- In speaking to the Address-in-Reply to the Speech of  His Excellency  the Governor-General, which was prepared by the Government of the nation during a time of war, it is outstandingly important thai we, as public men, should state clearly our views on various matters of national interest. It is with feelings of regret and sadness that I see another war in my time. Men who saw active service on the other side of the world during the last war, cannot but be saddened by the knowledge that another crisis has come upon the world. During the last twelve months, I have attended 22 gatherings of returned soldiers, and I have noticed a distinct change of outlook on the part of the &#34; diggers &#34;. That is not to be wondered at when we reflect that many of these men now see their own sons, or nephews, or the sons of their friends, in uniform. They are facing again their own experiences in the last war. The Labour party, of which I have the honour to be a member, has a definite defence policy, but it is not a &#34; brass hat &#34; policy. We have before us constantly a vision of the time when men will see clearly that this human madness must cease, and the slaughter of other nationals relegated to the days that have been. We visualize the clay when international disputes will be settled by reason. </para>

                                <para>- Irrespective of that philosophy, or any other philosophy,I urge the honorable member to try to see past the jungle to a world in which Christian principles will prevail. Honorable members opposite who would have the people believe that the great party to which I belong is allied with communism should remember that the Labour party is the only political movement in Australia that has retained its original name, whereas the parties in opposition to Labour have at various times been known as Conservative, Liberal, National Defence League, Nationalist Country party, Farmers and Settlers Association, Liberal and Country League, and now the United Australia party. I joined the Labour movement when I was seventeen years of age in the days when Tom Price, the father of the present honorable member for Booth by <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Price),</inline> was Premier of South Australia. Tom Price was one of the cleanest, truest Christian Socialists who have ever been associated with the Labour movement. It is extraordinary that whenever an election approaches some means is invented by the opponents of Labour to heap abuse and misrepresentation upon this party. If it is not communism, it is the Sinn Fein, the Independent Workers of the World, or Bolshevik organizations that we are accused of supporting. Always the views of the very extreme left wing of the Labour movement are alleged to be the views of the movement as a whole. Honorable members opposite know very well that the Labour party definitely excludes Communists. Moreover, it is the only political party in Australia, including the United Australia party, the United Country party, the Nationalists, or any other anti-Labour party by whatever name it may be known, which does exclude them. It is well-known, however, that Nazi and Fascist sympathizers are to be found in the United Australia party. The honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> is admittedly an advocate of the regimentation system of government. IfCommunists are criminals in the eyes of the law, if the preaching of the doctrines of communism are against the law, I challenge the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> to take appropriate action in such cases as are brought under his notice. He is the Prime Minister and he has the power to act. </para>

                        <para>We have heard a good deal about the coal strike in the course of this debate. I do not propose to say very much about it, for I wish to discuss certain rural problems that need attention. I assert, however, that if the Prime Minister had permitted the Attorney-General and Minister for Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> to deal with the coal strike it would undoubtedly have been settled before now, for that right honorable gentleman knows a good deal about the circumstances of working people. I accuse the Prime Minister of endeavouring to &#34;beat up&#34; a Communist scare, and of Jinking the coaminers with it, in order to help certain electioneering moves that are on foot. I challenge him to make it clear that he did not take the negotiations for a settlement of the coal strike out of the hands of the Attorney-General for this very reason. Last night the Prime Minister revealed very clearly, by his attitude to an interjection that I made, that he intends to do nothing to settle the coal strike unless the miners go back to work, and, of course, if they do that, they will settle the strike themselves. Is it too&#39; much to ask of the Prime Minister of this democracy, in a time of national crisis when the whole transportation system of the nation is in difficulty, and when enormous problems must be faced, to use the power he has to settle the strike? The right honorable gentleman could settle it to-morrow morning if he wished to do so, and certainly he should so wish, in the interests of the nation at large. </para>

                        <para>I wish to deal briefly with the crippling effect that this war is likely to have upon the finances of Australia if orthodox methods of finance are applied. I urge the Government not to wait until the war ends before it attempts to cope with a financial situation that will overtake us if there is a strict adherence to orthodox methods. If that course is followed this country will encounter the greatest economic blizzard, and the worst depression, that has ever been known. Our national debt to-day totals &#163;1,300,000,000. The last war cost Australia &#163;900,000,000, but we have only been able to find an aggregate of &#163;542,000,000 for public works. In the course of the years we have paid &#163;1,200,000,000 in interest on our public debt, but we still owe &#163;1,300,000,000. Those figures are sufficiently alarming in themselves ; but is any honorable member able to contemplate them, together with the probable costs of the present war, if the ordinary methods of finance are adopted ? In my opinion we shall be forced to make some change in our financial policy. I appeal to the Government not to cripple our people by imposing upon them a crushing load of extra taxation. Rather should the Government do its utmost to expand the credit resources of the nation in the interests of the people at large. We are already one of the most heavily taxed peoples in the world, and it would be a disaster if the Government should insist upon keeping to the old tracks in finance. </para>
                        <para>It is quite safe to say that with the mechanization of industry it is possible to provide an abundance of food and services for all of the people. Two hundred years ago the people of the world had only what they could contrive to obtain with their own banda, and want and misery were frequently the lot of the workers. To-day our mechanized methods of production have developed the equivalent of 15,000,000,000 horse-power throughout the world, and this could, and should, be harnessed for the benefit of the race. To put it in another way, the horse-power which is available for the service of every man, woman and  child of the 2,000,000,000 who inhabit the earth, is sufficient to produce an abundance of food and services for the benefit of mankind, and there should be no need for any widespread unemployment. Want and misery, wherever it is found, breed communism. It is the difficulties of our economic system which cause strikes. If the various governments would use the resources of the nations for the welfare of their people a very different outlook on life in general would soon be apparent. There would be an abundance of the good things in life, and people would be happy. It is necessary, of course, that a decent standard wage should be provided so that the workers may have enough money to buy the goods that are being manufactured at an increasing rate by the machinery that has been invented. Unless the Government is prepared to use, to a greater degree than ever before, for the good of the nation, the credit resources which the people themselves create, trouble is inevitable. Adherence to present financial policies will undoubtedly mean that we shall go to the wall. </para>
                        <para>A great deal more consideration should bc given by the Government to the hand, ling of our primary produce. We have been told that contracts have been made for the sale to Great Britain of Australian primary products to the value of &#163;100,000,000. The sale of our wool accounts for between &#163;50,000,000 and &#163;60,000,000 of that vast total. I do not propose to discuss to-day the details of the sale of our commodities, for I dealt fully with that subject during last session ; but I shall devote some attention to the appraisement of our wool. </para>
                        <para>I say quite definitely that the basis of appraisement has been altered since the first appraisements were made some months ago. At that time the appraisements were on a lower ratio than at present. I have been furnished with many accounts of sales by people in my electorate, which indicate clearly the truth of my contention. I have no wish to minimize the difficulty of appraising our very fine Australian wools. I realize the hundreds of different classes of wool involved and the consequent difficulties of appraisement, but even that does not excuse some of the extraordinary anomalies that have occurred. I shall cite the experience of two residents of my electorate, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. S.</inline> H. Giersch and his son, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. P.</inline> B. Giersch. Their flocks had exactly the same breeding, and they grazed in adjoining paddocks, so that conditions were in all respects identical, yet the son received Hd. for his ewes&#39; fleeces, while the father received 12&#163;d. For the backs the son received 6$d., and the father 7fd. I could cite dozens of other similar cases, but that is as good an illustration as any. f am convinced that the basis of appraisement was altered during the season, with the result that some growers lost thousands of pounds. Anomalies of the kind I have mentioned have occurred in the appraising of big clips where expert classers have been employed, and where there has been no guessing in regard to classes. I hope that some adjustment may be made to recompense those growers who lost financially because of the alteration of the basis of appraisement. I also hope that, during the coming season, the one basis will be maintained throughout. </para>
                        <para>The wheat industry has been frequently referred to in this chamber. It is the most important industry in Australia, and employs more labour than does any other. I strongly recommend that a further advance of ls. a bushel bc made to the growers, seeing that they have so far received only 2s. 6d. That advance has already been spent in settlement of storekeepers&#39; accounts, and in paying costs of harvesting. The second crop must be sown now, and the growers are in need of a further advance. Although more information than ever before has been given to the Government on this subject within the last twelve months by speakers in this chamber, the Menzies Government has done absolutely nothing for the wheat industry. The only good that has come to the industry has arisen out of the calamity of the war, which has raised the price of wheat, in common with that of other commodities. I would say only this for the Government, that it has applied the policy of the Labour party by arranging for the Commonwealth Bank to make available &#163;20,000,000 from which the advance to the farmers of 2s. 6d. a bushel has been paid. The wheat industry is in a worse position to-day than it has ever been. Recently, the Premier of South </para>
                        <para class="block">Australia gave evidence before the Commonwealth Grants Commission, in&#39; the course of which he discussed the position of the wheat-farmers on marginal lands. A member of the commission asked how the State Government was getting along with this problem, and the Premier replied that it was getting on well; that it was handling it. He said that, on a certain date, there were 2,000 farmers on relief from the State bank, but that, at the time of speaking, the number had been reduced to 700. That meant, of course, that during that period, 1,300 farmers had gone off their farms to swell the army of the unemployed. The number of wheat-farmers is steadily declining. Never before have so many wheat-farmers been &#34; going down the road &#34; as now. It is necessary, therefore, that the Government should arrange for a further advance of ls. a bushel to the growers. </para>
                        <para>The Minister for &#39;Commerce has had many interesting meetings all over Australia with apple and peargrowers who subjected him to such a barrage of disapproval that I have felt sorry for him. However, after consulting with those engaged in the industry, I am of the opinion that it would have been much better for the industry had  no  system  of  control been instituted at all. I am informed that all apples and pears grown in Australia this season could have been consumed here if proper arrangements had been made. Under the controlled scheme, one-quarter of this season&#39;s crop had to be, destroyed. We are not so prosperous that we can afford deliberately to destroy one-quarter of any crop we raise. There are hundreds of thousands of persons in Australia below the breadline, and they could very well do with some of the fruit that was wasted under this acquisition scheme. W,e have no reason to be proud of the fact that we have made apples and pears so dear that a large section of the population cannot afford to buy them. Then the question arises: Are the growers going to benefit? All of this waste might have been avoided by a little organization. I suggest that if arrangements had been made for the carriage of apples and pears over the railways to any part of Australia at a. uniform freight of Od. a case, whether to private persons or to storekeepers and fruiterers, the whole qf the crop could easily have been absorbed. <inline font-style="italic">&#91;Leave to continue given.&#93;</inline></para>
                        <para>One of the most important matters bearing on the defence of this country and the conduct of the war is the, supply of foodstuffs by Australia to Great Britain and its Allies in Europe. The principal requirement of primary producers to-day is ships, ships, and more ships. One of the best wheat crops that this country has ever produced now lies waiting for transport overseas, In South Australia, no less than &#163;6,000,000 worth of wheat is held up at railway sidings. In Australia &#163;20,000,000 has been invested in the wine industry, which is South Australia&#39;s third most important industry. A vast supply of dried fruits and dairy produce is also held up, because there are not sufficient vessels to take that produce to the other side of the world. Yet in England certain kinds of produce are being rationed. We in Australia seem to suffer from an inferiority complex. We should not depend upon Great Britain for everything. We speak of the British navy as a thing that will always be available for our protection. Why do we not build up our own navy, and provide mercantile marine that would enable us to market our produce overseas? When the Labour party was in power, many ships were built in government dockyards. This policy was adopted during the last war. In the early stages of the war the people generally, and particularly the primary producers, suffered severely at the hands of the shipping combines, whose profits were enormous. Australia being far removed from the markets of the world, the plight of the producers was most serious, because there was insufficient shipping to convey their goods overseas. In view of our experience during the last war, one would have expected that a vigorous programme of shipbuilding would have been put in hand by the Commonwealth authorities on this occasion. </para>
                        <para>The Australian Commonwealth Line saved the primary producers &#163;2,000,000 in one year, and during &#39;the period over which it operated, it saved them many millions of pounds. If the 20 or 30 ships of that line had been available to-day, they would have proved  a god-send to .us. Snips are needed now almost more than soldiers, as far as an effective contribution by Australia to the cause of the Empire is concerned. The private shipping combines steadily, but surely, applied pressure on the Government formed during the last war by .the United Australia party and the Country party, .and brought about the sale of those vessels. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce,</inline> who was then Prime Minister, eventually decided to give in to the pressure, and seven ships, which cost &#163;7,500,000 to build, were sold for &#163;1,900,000. I understand that of that amount &#163;500,000 is still outstanding. The vessels were practically given away, because the big shipping companies had told <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> that the formation of a government line of steamers was contrary to their policy. In this case the Country &#62; party fell down badly on its job. In dis-  cussing the proposed sale of the ships in 1927, its leader, the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page),</inline> said - </para>

                        <para>Other members of that party stated definitely that the line was of such great raine in times of peace and war, and so vital to the interests of the primary industries, that they were absolutely opposed to its sale, yet that party was associated with a Government that practically gave the fleet away. If it were in existence today, we should not have the spectacle of &#163;6,000,000 worth of wheat lying at railway sidings in South Australia for weevils and mice to eat, when children in Great Britain have to go short of many articles of food. The Government should use some of the credit of the nation to build more ships. It should adopt a bold policy, because, unfortunately, this war may not be brought to an end for a considerable period. Despite the fact that the policy of the present Government is opposed to State enterprise, the nation demands that in this crisis ship construction should be undertaken. But care should bc taken, in implementing such a policy, to see that increased prices are not given to the great Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited and associated companies, which are steadily but surely cornering the mineral resources of the na tion. </para>

That party, to which I am proud to belong, has the highest Christian ethics of any movement I know of in the world, and can stand ap to all the gibes about communism and I.W.W.-ism. It has done so for 40 years. It has governed in every State of the Commonwealth. It is governing in three States to-day, and it is keeping another government in power in. Victoria. Some of the best acts on the statute-books have been placed there by Labour governments. Labour has furnished some of the best statesmen that Australia has produced. It can look back on its history with pride, because it has sprung from the noor class, starting in the industrial areas and gradually extending its influence into the rural areas, until it has now assumed a national character. It has been assailed by the present Government because of a desire to win the next elections. It is still true to the high Christian principles that it has always espoused, and it will continue to fight for them. If necessary, it will be crucified, as was the greatest Christian socialist the world has ever known, by the same money power that would crucify it to-morrow. </para>

                            <para>.- I should not have spoken to-day except for the ominous statement made by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> with regard to the coal strike. He has said that next week he proposes to open the mines and attempt to work them by free labour. Appended to the award of Judge Drake-Brockman is a history in serial form of the disputes in the coal industry. The first dispute, and one over hours, occurred in 1S73, and not far down  thi3  long roll occurs the mournful and laconic entry: &#34; 188S  -  Strike- free labourtroops &#34;. As long ago as that an attempt to work the mines by free labour loosed upon the people the military forces of the colony of New South &#34;Wales 1 The project, which the right honorable the Prime Minister and his colleagues have adopted, is a project which exposes this country to the great danger of disorder and to an enormous breach of national unity. During the Corio by-election campaign the Prime Minister told us that the eyes of Hitler were on Corio. I should like to know upon whom the eyes of Hitler will be very soon if there is a breach of the national unity of Australia. The responsibility for that breach will rest upon the Government, which instead of acting as mediator takes the side, as governments of this sort always have done, of the owners and masters. It appears to me from a careful study of the award that the facts of this dispute . have been forgotten or overlooked. They are encrusted with a mass of prejudices, and I propose to deal with the prejudices with which this dispute has been clouded by none other than the Prime Minister himself. In the first place, he tells us that, the miners are unsportsmanlike, because they dispute the umpire&#39;s decision. What was the umpire&#39;s decision ? The honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James)</inline> has told us that he considers that the umpire&#39;s decision was the decision of  His  Honour Judge Drake-Brockman. The miners think so and, if one reads the records, one would think that there is a good deal in that. What happened? There was a stoppage of work in the New South Wales coalfields for six weeks in 1938. The cause of that stoppage was that the owners had refused to confer upon demands made by the unions in the mining industry. One demand was for a reduction of hours. That stoppage ended upon a basis suggested by the Government of New South Wales. The suggestion made by that Government was that the part of the claims which could be dealt with by the Arbitration Court should be dealt with by the court and the part which could not be should be examined by a royal commission, and that upon the report of that commission social legislation might be passed. In his judgment  His  Honour Judge Drake-Brockman says this at page 5 - </para>

                        <para>The matter came speedily before the court. On the Srd November  His  Honour Judge Drake Brockman began consideration of the case. He sat almost without a break until it finished. He sat on the 22nd December and he resumed his sitting on the 4th January. As the result of his hearing, which closed on the 20th April, he delivered a judgment on the 29th June: The judgment has been so often discussed that  it  is hardly necessary to say more than this: That inasmuch as there had for a. long time been the same hours &#34;for surface workers as for workers underground,  His  Honour, when reducing hours for workers below ground, thought it was desirable also to reduce hours for the surface workers.  His  Honour pointed out that some of the employers themselves thought that that course was desirable. He said - </para>

                            <para>I would have hesitated to grant any portion of this claim if the employers had vigorously opposed it - several of the principal witnesses for the employers regard uniformity of hours so desirable and stated that any reduction granted to underground workers should be granted to all workers. </para>

                        <para class="block">If honorable members would direct their attention to the valuable  summary  of  the history of the industry which is Appendix &#34; A &#34; to the judgment they would see that that is so. For a <inline font-style="italic">very long</inline> time hours have been eight a day for five days and about four for the sixth day for all workers in the mines, not distinguishing, on that basis, between the underground workers and the surface workers, the only distinction being that the crib time was taken as part of the 44 hours in the case of the underground workers, but not in the case of the surface workers. What happened? After that award was made the owners applied for a variation of hours so as to restore the hours to what they had been previously. When the variation came before the Full Court, it did not hear additional evidence. In  His  Honour Judge DrakeBrockrnan&#39;s second judgment he mentions the fact that no additional evidence was heard. What did the Full Court say? It simply said this : &#34; This court does not propose to consider individual claims for a reduction of hours below 44 &#39;&#39;. </para>
                        <para>That was the position taken by the court. That is to say, notwithstanding the court&#39;s intimation made in the first instance that so much of the claim of the men as were industrial matters would be forthwith heard and determined by the court, the court said: &#34;We will not deal with this claim of the surface workers for reduced hours &#34;. At page 11 the majority judges said this - </para>

                        </quote>
                        <para class="block">That is to say, the court said : &#34; We do not consider your claim at all. We do not want to hear evidence upon it. We do not want even to read the evidence that has been given upon it. We simply say that we are not going to consider any claim for a reduction of hours below 44, except in certain instances on health grounds, unless as part of a general ininquiry.&#34; The men who say that they accepteda promise that all their industrial claims would be forthwith dealt with by the Arbitration Court can justly say that they had the umpire&#39;s decision in their favour and that that decision was taken from them upon a technicality. I do not think that the sportsmanlike people of Australia would attach much weight to the argument of the Prime Minister, if it were put as it should be put, that, on substantial grounds, the court, which the men had accepted as umpire, gave the workers this concession and that upon a technical ground it was taken away from them. </para>

                                <para>- Yes. At any rate it is the owners&#39; refusal of the men&#39;s terms as much as the men&#39;s insistence upon their terms that brings about this dislocation of industry in wartime. It is true that the employers brought their application for a variation before the court before the war began, but it had hardly been heard before the war started and they still persisted. A fair thing to say is that, at any rate, part of the responsibility for the continuance of the dispute and the dislocation of industry rests upon the employers just as part rests upon the employees. </para>

                        <para>We are told - apparently it is the worst offence that these men committed - that  the miners have Communist leaders ; that the general secretary is a man who admits that he is a Communist. From that it is inferred that the men are Communists. Mien engaged in the same class of occupation in Western Australia were foolish and unfair enough to say that 75 per cent, of the coal-miners in New South Wales are Communists. What is the position? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. William</inline> Orr was chosen by the vote of the miners, I suppose, because of his efficiency, and because of the men&#39;s confidence in him, although they had no confidence in his politics. Men of the same class as those who elect a Communist as their general secretary reject the Communists with such wholehearted enthusiasm at general elections that the Communists lose their deposits. That is true not only in New South Wales but also at Wonthaggi, in Victoria. But even suppose it is reasonable to assume that the coal-miners themselves have been infected by this Communist virus by one of their officials, what are the facts of the dispute? Who are the main claimants? A great deal of what the miners ask for, apart from hours, has been conceded to them, and to the miners working underground, 85 per cent, of the members of the Miners Federation, a great deal has been conceded. They have a 40-hour week, inclusive of crib time. That is to say, they have a working week of 3-7-i hours. The men who have not the benefit of a 40-hour week are, in very few cases, members of the Miners Federation. There are other unions involved in this dispute. To name some of them, there are the Amalgamated Engineering Union, the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemens Association of Australasia, the Blacksmiths Society of Australasia and the Federated Mining Mechanics Association of Australasia. </para>
                        <para>The Prime Minister has had very considerable experience of industry. He has appeared in the Arbitration Court and other courts as advocate not only for the owners but also for the unions. No one knows better than he the class of men in the Amalgamated Engineering Union, highly skilled conservative trade unionists. The same applies to the engine drivers. They are the aristrocrats of labour, highly skilled workers. The members of the Miners Federation who work on the surface are surface labourers, but the other surface workers are highly skilled men. and they are men who are hardly ever Communists. They are the conservatives of labour. The Miners Federation is fighting not so much its own fight as for about 15 per cent, of its own members ; even now it is fighting for the skilled mechanic who works in the &#187; mining industry, just as the skilled mechanic has had to support the miners when the latter have gone out  on  strike. </para>
                        <para>You will find more Communists among the middle classes than among the working class. I repeat that the  fact that  two, or three, or four Communists may be among the leaders of the Miners Federation does not affect the attitude  of  the other unions who are fighting in  support  of the miners&#39; demands in this struggle. Men are called Communists who, in fact, are not Communists.  The  northern president  of  the Miners Federation, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bondy</inline> Hoare, has long been a member of a body known as the Australian Socialist Labour party. He is not a Communist. It is quite true that in this dispute he agrees with leaders who are Communists. But many other men  who  are not Communists also agree with those leaders and are fighting  side by side with  them in this struggle - men who, in some cases because of their religious convictions, opposed communism, whilst others on the political platforms and at the ballot-box reject Communist candidates with contumely. You will find such men working shoulder by shoulder with so-called Communists in vindication of the miners&#39; demands. It is quite within the power  of  the Government to settle this strike fairly.  No  persons are more willing than the miners to listen to the Prime Minister  if  he approaches  them  in a spirit of equity, fairness  and  humanity. I believe that if the Prime Minister had given the miners an opportunity to state their position equal  to  that which he took himself, he would have been received with open arms on the coalfields. If the miners had been allowed  to  broadcast their case just as he broadcast his own and the mine-owners&#39; case to the country, there would be no trouble on the coal-fields now. I can sympathize with the spirit of men who refuse  to  allow their institutions to be used as a megaphone by the Prime Minister in order  to  broadcast their opponents&#39; side of the case to the country. I appeal to the right honorable gentleman to listen to my representations in this matter. The history of the mining industry is studded with bitter struggles. As I have already pointed out, 50 years ago we had strikes followed by the calling in of free labour under the protection of troops. Unlike wharf labourers and seamen, the coalminers are a solid and permanent community of workers who live as well as work side by side, and they have been drilled and trained in the principles of class solidarity and loyalty. How can the Prime Minister expect to deal with men of that kind easily? Does he believe that by putting free labour into the mines he will do anything but divide the community in a desire to bring about an early election, just as he tried to fight the Corio by-election on the war issue and talk of national unity. Just as Joseph Chamberlain exploited the Boer War for election purposes in 1900 and Woodrow Wilson in the last war appealed <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the American people to give his party a majority in Congress, so this trouble with all its attendant misery to the miners and the workers generally will be used as a means to enable the United Australia party to secure a new lease of political life. </para>

                                <para>-  The honorable member knows that no party to an industrial dispute observes the law. As the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James)</inline> pointed out, the former Nationalist member for Fawkner demanded in 1929 that the Government should prosecute the mineowners, and the Government, after considering the matter, refused to prosecute them. It is merely academical to ask why parties to an industrial dispute do not obey the law. You cannot settle disputes or bring about industrial peace in that way. I am not sure that the political advantage which the Prime Minister and his colleagues expect will accrue to them. In 1909, the Premier of  New  South Wales. Charles Gregory Wade, was faced with a coal strike. He passed special legislation for the purpose of dealing with that strike, but when the people of New South Wales realized that the strikers&#39; leaders, including Peter Bowling, were brought down from the coal-fields to Sydney with irons on their limbs, they rejected Charles Gregory Wade at the next election with such determination that he never again obtained office in New South Wales; and at the following federal election in 1910 they voted overwhelmingly in favour of Labour because of this experience of a coal-owners&#39; government which pursued the owners&#39; ends. </para>

                        <para>I appeal to the Prime Minister to preserve national unity in this country. I ask him to do all he can to preserve that unity. We were told that the eyes of Hitler were upon Corio. Eyes more searching, more watchful and more unforgetting than Hitler&#39;s are upon the Government of Australia in this crisis. They are the eyes of the Australian people, not merely of those now living, hut also of posterity. If the Government abuses its powers in an attempt to drive these men back to work, the name of Robert Gordon Menzies will go down to posterity, not as the man who, in a time of war, rose to the heights of national statesmanship and made national unity his first consideration, but as one who, in a great war, divided the people, and took the side of the strong and the rich against the poor and the weak.  His  name will go down to  our  children and grandchildren as that of the man who broke this strike or, at any rate, tried to break it. I appeal to him not to do that. I believe that it is his desire to build out of the country&#39;s present trials a great reputation, a monument more enduring than bronze, in order that future generations of Australians will honour his name as that of a great man who, in a time of crisis, did generous and magnanimous deeds the memory of which will live in this country for ever. I hope that he will do that. I hope that the Government will not adhere to its present policy. </para>

                            <para>.- I should not have participated in this debate but for the attempts of honorable members opposite, including the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blackburn),</inline> to justify the actions of the strikers. They are doing a disservice to the people of this country by encouraging a continuance of the strike. The remarks of the honorable member for Bourke always carry much weight in this House. He laboured the contention that in this instance the strikers should be entitled to take advantage of the decision of the single judge, that is, the decision of the lower court, or the decision of the Full Court, whichever they preferred. He pointed out that in the lower court Judge Drake-Brockman decided in favour of the principle of uniformity of hours, whereas the Full Court altered that decision. The honorable member contended that the men should have the right to maintain the decision of Judge Drake-Brockman, and to reject those parts of the decision of the Full Court which do not suit them. As a lawyer, the honorable member knows very well that the decision of the court implies that of the higher court. The Arbitration Court has one principle in common with our civil and criminal tribunals in that proceedings within its jurisdiction are initiated before a magistrate or a single judge. That decision is final unless it be appealed against. Certain limitations as to time and conditions are prescribed for the lodging of appeals of this kind. Either party to a plaint, if it be dissatisfied with a decision, has the right of appeal against the judgment of the lower court. But when the full bench upsets a decision of the lower court it is quite wrong to say that the decision of the court is the decision of the lower court. It is the decision of the higher court that counts, because that decision really abrogates the decision of the lower court. In this instance the miners refused to accept the decision of the Arbitration Court. That court was constituted for the purpose of ensuring that justice would be done to employees. It was established for the advantage rather of employees than employers. The miners now refuse to abide by the decision of the court. The honorable member for Bourke advanced the extraordinary proposition that no party will observe the law in industrial disputes. He referred to the decision of the court as an academic matter. That proposition cannot be tolerated for one moment. Too often in the past sections of employees have been dissatisfied with the decisions of the Arbitration Court and have repudiated them, and too much encouragement is given to such opposition by nien like the honorable member for Bourke and other honorable members opposite. These honorable gentlemen must feel in their hearts that the strikers are doing wrong. At the present time, when this country is at war and, when by their action, they are throwing other people out of employment, thus retarding our war effort, honorable gentlemen who talk in this vein are committing a disloyal and immoral act. They must know that they are doing wrong in speaking in this chamber in order to encourage the miners to continue on strike. I deplore the element of party politics which has been introduced into this debate. I confess that honorable members on this side have been as much&#39; to blame in that respect as honorable members opposite. However, it is most deplorable when any honorable member should speak in this House in order to encourage the miners to continue their resistance. They must know that, by striking, the miners are acting illegally and disloyally, and that such action cannot be justified. Consequently, honorable members opposite would1 do a great service to this country if they would either refrain from giving encouragement to the strikers or take their courage in their own hands and tell the strikers quite plainly the truth of their position. Members of the Opposition, or of any other political body, who by such actions encourage men to prolong the strike, put themselves in a position akin to that of the Communist leaders who are misleading the miners-. </para>

The honorable member has failed lamentably to sustain any argument in rebuttal of  the  statements made by the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blackburn)</inline> in his admirable speech. It is all very well for members on the Government side to make inflammatory speeches, in an attempt to  condemn the attitude of the men engaged in this or any other struggle because, after all, both sides in an industrial dispute break the law. A few years ago, when there was a lock-out in the coal industry, the Government of the day refused to listen to an appeal by one of its supporters, who was an eminent barrister, that action should be taken, against the coal-owners. That fact is overlooked by Government supporters to-day. They are always on the side of money power and against those in the community who are less fortunate. I listened last night to the inflammatory address delivered in this House by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> when he condemned the miners. </para>

                                <para>- That is true. I can imagine the Prime Minister going to Kurri Kurri and in his usual schoolmasterly fashion addressing the  miners  and telling them what they ought to do. Every honorable member knows the overbearing attitude of the right honorable gentleman when he wishes to emphasize a point. Whatever his intentions were in going to Kurri Kurri, I am convinced that his visit only inflamed the minds of the men because of the arrogant attitude that he adopts on such occasions. However, as I do not know a great deal about coal-mining in New South Wales, apart from what I have read on the subject, I shall pass on to deal with matters of more particular interest to my own electorate. </para>

                        <para>A few days ago, the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin)</inline> delivered a fine address, in which he made some telling points against Government members who have been making election speeches recently. Last night we were treated to a typical speech by the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Henry Gullett).</inline> He spoke in the style to which those of us who have been here for some years have become accustomed. We have also become accustomed to seeing the honorable gentleman crash his way into governments and criticize governments when not a member of the Cabinet. The Minister does not greatly impress us. I am afraid that he was not par ticularly truthful last night when expressing his bitter antagonism against the Labour party. It is true that that party has not been in power in the Commonwealth for 25 years, although in 1929 the people of Australia became so tired of anti-Labour governments that when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> appealed to them on the issue of the continuance of the Arbitration Court, they expressed definitely their preference for a Labour government. Unfortunately, there was not a double dissolution, and because of a hostile majority in the Senate the Labour Government was unable to clean up the mess which it had inherited. The Minister was at considerable pains to tell the people of the failings of that Labour Government, but he did not say, for instance, that the Bruce-Pago Government had borrowed money overseas in order to pay interest on money borrowed previously. Nor did he tell the people of the treasury-bills falling due within three months of the Labour party coming into office. That was a part of the legacy which the Scullin Government inherited in 1929. </para>

                        <para class="block">That sort of thing is being said by members on the Government side of the House. The idea is to get the people to believe that only the parties which form the Government are interested in the welfare of Australia and in preserving the bond that exists between it and other members of the British Commonwealth of Nations. Honorable members know that if a statement is repeated often enough with sufficient emphasis, some persons in the community will believe it. That is the basis upon which business people conduct their advertising. They advertise their products until people are persuaded that they are what they are represented to be. For instance, a person who wishes to buy a tin of boot polish generally asks. not for boot polish, but for a tin of &#34;Kiwi&#34; or &#34;Nugget&#34;. That is the explanation of the speech of the honorable member for Fawkner in Tasmania recently. I am sorry that the honorable gentleman is not now in the chamber, but as he was aware that I proposed to refer to the article in the <inline font-style="italic">Mercury,</inline> he cannot blame me for doing so in his absence. I challenge him to cite one occasion when Tasmanian members in this House have voted against measures designed to increase the protection of Australia. I challenge him to produce one piece of evidence to show that the Australian Labour party has voted against such measures. It is true that we on this side have differed from the Government in certain aspects of Australian defence, but it cannot be said truthfully that we have opposed the granting of money for the defence of Australia.

However, four of the five Federal seats in Tasmania aro held by Labour members, who, no matter&#39; how moderate they may be, are still under the rules of their organization, and are bound by the majority. This means that Tasmania, which could play a big part, is proving a political weakness. The significance of our efforts is heightened by the events of the past few hours. </para>

That of course is permissible; but I object strongly to the insinuation which the article contains, particularly as the statement was made by a man of military age against men who, together with their families, are playing an important part in connexion with the defence of this country. I challenge the honorable member for Fawkner to indicate one instance in which the Tasmanian members of the Australian Labour party in this Parliament have done anything to hamper in the slightest degree the appropriation of the money required for the defence of Australia. </para>

His  warning was timely, and I recall that on previous occasions when he has made similar utterances he has always received the support of honorable members on this side of the chamber. The justification for his pronouncement is borne out by recent events, and there. is every reason why the Government should heed the warning given by the Leader of the Opposition. </para>

                                <para>- The sending of troops overseas may be of some value ; but our first consideration should be the defence of our own shores. The Government should realize that, since the outbreak of war, conditions have altered considerably, and that the danger to Australia appears to be developing. On one occasion the honorable member for Fawkner, whose statement I have just cited, instead of endeavouring to strengthen the bond of friendship with other nations in the Pacific, made some unfriendly references to our neighbours. One must speak on such subjects with some restraint, but honorable members should not say anything likely to endanger the friendly relations which exist between Australia and its neighbours. Unfortunately some honorable members opposite do not exercise sufficient restraint. On 23rd September the following paragraph appeared in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald : -</inline></para>

            <para class="block">Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blain)</inline> a few moments ago. It would appear that the British Government requires aeroplane engines, pilots and foodstuffs. In connexion with the last mentioned it is reasonable to ask whether the Government proposes to pay any regard to the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition made some months ago that a large quantity of foodstuffs should be sent to Great Britain as a gift from the Australian nation. I suppose that Government supporters have forgotten that the Australian Labour party made such an offer. </para>

                <para>For many years the defence policy of the Australian Labour party has been criticized severely by honorable members opposite; but that is not surprising because when general elections are approaching the Government&#39;s supporters try to woo the electors by raising bogys or by drawing a red herring across the trail in an endeavour to mislead the electors. Governments such as this Government have never won an election on a definite policy. In 1913 when the Labour party was in control in both branches of this legislature it tackled the problem of defence in statesmanlike manner. When that Government suggested the establishment of an Australian navy its political opponents said there was no need for such a navy, and that we were not prepared to accept the protection afforded by the British navy. Despite criticism, the Labour party formed the first unit of the Royal Australian Navy, and that navy is playing an important part to-day in assisting to convoy our produce overseas to Great Britain. The establishment of the Royal Australian Navy was ridiculed by the anti -Labour parties of that day, but it is significant that none of them has ever taken any steps to abolish that navy. </para>
                <para>The Labour party also established the Small Arms Factory at Lithgow and the Munitions Factory at Maribyrnong; these activities were also the subject of strong criticism by anti-Labour forces. </para>
                <para class="block">We know, however, that both of these factories rendered great service to the nation during the last war, and have been of immense use in connexion with the defence measures now being taken. I believe the Minister for the Army said a day or two ago that Australia was now sending ammunition abroad for the use of Great Britain and the Allied forces. During the last war many Australians went abroad as munition workers to the great advantage of this country and of the Empire. </para>
                <para>The Commonwealth Woollen Mills, the Commonwealth Clothing Factory and the Commonwealth Harness Factory were also established by the Labour party and, in their day, rendered outstanding service to the community at large. We all know to our deep regret that the Bruce-Page Government sold the woollen mills, but who was it that got in on the ground floor in connexion with that sale? I do not accuse the Prime Minister or his colleagues of doing so, but an honorable gentleman of another place undoubtedly did very well by his activities in connexion with that sale. It was said that the woollen mills were being operated at a loss. I suggest that the loss was not unlike the &#34; loss &#34; that the coalowners, to whom the Prime Minister referred last night, are suffering. At any rate the honorable senator to whom I have referred and also his wife were the buyers of large parcels of shares in the company which took control of the Commonwealth Woollen Mills. They were not deterred by any allegations that the woollen mills were unprofitable. </para>
                <para>The Labour party also established the Commonwealth Bank and the Commonwealth note issue which, together, have been perhaps the greatest financial bulwarks that the nation has known. I have no need to discuss the usefulness of the Commonwealth Bank at any great length, for the newly-elected honorable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> delivered an able address on that subject a few days ago. It was his maiden speech in this House and I congratulate him upon it. The Commonwealth Bank and the Commonwealth note issue have been of vast value to the nation. In 1924 the Bruce Page Government &#34;had a shot&#34; at the Commonwealth Bank, and altered its constitution, taking control of it from the Governor of the bank and placing it in the hands of a board of directors. The result has been that the operations of the bank have ever since been restricted in certain directions. The bank has not been able to conduct its affairs with the maximum of value to the people. Unfortunately, persons interested in the operations of the private trading banks have been able unduly to influence the situation. The Commonwealth Bank rendered outstanding service to the nation during the last war, and the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> Miller, the first Governor of the bank, made it clear that it could have rendered just as signal service to the nation in peacetime as it did in wartime had it been allowed to do so. Anti-Labour governments have prevented it from doing so. Although the bank has been handicapped in that it has not been able to develop its business on a competitive basis, its operations have shown a profit of many millions of pounds to the Commonwealth. </para>
                <para>All of these activities were set in motion in the three or four epoch-making years preceding the 25 years to which the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Henry Gullett)</inline> referred last night. No other period in the history of this nation has been productive of such notable legislative achievements. </para>
                <para>It will be remembered, also, that it was a Labour government which established the Australian Commonwealth Shipping Line. The purchase of the Bay liners and of the other vessels in the Government&#39;s fleet was a great development, and it was tragic that the ships should subsequently have been sold by the Bruce Page Government. Had the fleet remained in the possession of the Government, we should not now be facing such difficulties as the Prime Minister has referred to in the last day or so in the transport of our products overseas. The right honorable gentleman did not, it is true, state that the difficulties we are now facing would have been minimized had those ships not been sold, but it is nevertheless a fact that had that sale not been made the position would have been very much easier now than it is. The ships were practically given away. When the five Bay liners and two Dale steamers were sold to the White Star Line, controlled by the Kylsant interests, in 1928 they represented a total outlay of &#163;7,225,000, comprising capital cost of &#163;4,725,000, and running losses of &#163;2,500,000, or so it was claimed. The vessels were sacrificed for &#163;1,900,000, the conditions of the sale providing that &#163;250,000 should be paid in cash and the remainder in ten annual instalments of &#163;165,000 <inline font-style="italic">&#91;Leave to continue given.&#93;</inline> Thus an asset worth approximately &#163;7,000,000 was sold for less than &#163;2,000,000; but the Commonwealth has not even been paid that price. I understand that &#163;600,000 is still owing on the line, because the firm which purchased the steamers had as its head a man who, to say the least of him, was not quite honest, and, because of his dealings, is now in gaol. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. But whatever the sale price, the loss to the nation of the service of these ships was tremendous. Not only did the transaction involve the Commonwealth in a loss of many millions of pounds, but also, because the vessels were sold at a sacrificial price under powerful political pressure, the primary producers of this country have been compelled to pay dearly in increased shipping freights, by reason of the removal of the competition factor which the seven steamers constituted during the time they were operating in the national interests. The estimated saving to the primary producers of &#163;500,000 a year, in respect of f reight charges, proves the correctness of this contention, if any proof be needed. Despite the fact that these ships were being run at  a  loss, the Government would have been wise to keep them in service, because of the effect they had on overseas freight rates. In any case, much of the loss was due to mismanagement. Immediately the vessels were disposed of, freights rose and the result has been a loss to the primary producers of this country of about &#163;500,000 a year. That was in normal times. The value of the ships in this time of war would be inestimable. Had the Bay lines been retained, they could have been operated as they were during the last war. Not only would they have been able to supply Great Britain with the foodstuffs which it so urgently  requires,  but they would also have enabled Australia to preserve its economic stability by continuing its export trade. It must be remembered that Australia has to meet vast interest commitments overseas. It is necessary to preserve the dollar exchange, and the goods which we could have sent out of this country would have gone a long way towards doing that. As it is, primary products are going to waste. Only a fortnight ago I saw apples which had been dumped on a river bank because space could not be found to ship them overseas. In Canberra good apples cannot be obtained, and the ones for which Hd. is paid are of very poor quality. There is not an apple on the tables of the hotels run by the Department of the Interior. Fruit and other primary products cannot be obtained overseas. I repeat that the Bay liners were not sold but were given away, and actions such as that are in marked contrast to the accomplishments of the Labour Government during i the short time it was in power. I challenge the present Government to produce any evidence, after three years of office, that it has to its credit legislative achievements in any way comparable with those of the Labour Government. </para>

                <para>I should like to refer now to the treatment of wives and children of soldiers now serving in the defence forces. 1 realize that this subject is a controversial one. It relates to husbands who have been living apart from their wives and families. These separations may have been due to any of a variety of reasons, but it is usually the wife and children who suffer most if the husband either will not work, or, when he does work, spends his money in such a way that his domestic responsibilities are neglected. Some of these men have volunteered for service abroad, and have either left Australia, or will do so in the near future and, because in some cases the wife has been successful in getting from the court  a maintenance order for only &#163;1 a week - &#163;1 a week would be the maximum if the husband were not in regular employment - the Government has decided that it can pay no more than that. In other words,, the Government is sheltering behind the fact that the man who has enlisted in its military forces has, in the past, so neglected his responsibilities that his wife isin receipt of only &#163;1 by means of a court separation order. I have received communications from the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Street)</inline> in regard to this matter, and he informs me that war financial regulations clearly state that a separation allowance can be approved only when theallotment made by the soldier is not sufficient to cover the amount of the court order. I say to the Minister now that if that provision is contained in the war financial regulations, there is somethingwrong with those regulations. It is timethat the Government realized its responsibility, and ceased to shelter behind suchtechnicalities. It is a gross injustice that: the wives and children should be so neglected. The. whole principle is wrong; and I appeal to the Minister to examine these regulations, and see whether they cannot be amended. Surely rectification of this anomaly would not involve heavycost, or upset any vital principle. </para>

                <para>I express the hope that the dayis not far distant when the peoples of the world will recognize the Christian principles upon which democracy exists, and&#39; that war will bo banished from the earth : that we shall have peace and goodwill among all men, not only those in theBritish Commonwealth  of Nations and in the countries of its allies, but alsoamong those who are to-day our enemies. There are plenty of the good1 things of&#34; life for every.body, and if mankind is prepared to recognize the principles of&#34; social justice, there should be no need for conflict between man and man. I think that there is something in what the-  honorable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jolly)</inline> said this afternoon regarding, the importance of Christian principles. The same, point was made only a day or. two ago. by the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan).</inline> I associate myself with those remarks. I believe that if we were to apply the good old. golden rule of doing unto others as we would that they should do unto us, the principles of social justice would be more generally recognized. There would be no more conflict between man and man, and there would be peace between all the peoples of the earth. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to draw the attention of the Minister for Aviation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fairbairn)</inline> to the position of a group of about 150 young men, recruited as wireless operators, and for other skilled positions, who are at present supposed to be undergoing training at Point Cook and Laverton. Some of these men. have been there for three months - none has been there for less than two months - and  they  are becoming dissatisfied because they have not yet started their classes for training. They are working for  5s.  a day,, which is much- less: than many of them were receiving, before they enlisted,, and they are engaged upon labouring work, such as  digging  postholes and shovelling mullock. They do not  mind  hard work, but they are anxious to begin their training. They have been told that the first class will begin on the13th May. Only half  the  number there will be enrolled in- that class, and the other half will be enrolled three months later. Thus, some of the men, will have been in  camp  for six months before beginning  their  training, and the training period will last for eight months. They will receive no increase on the  5s.  a day until they get through their course. They do not want to do labouring work, which they think ought to be given to older men who are in need of a job. Some of these young trainees are married, and they would, not have gone into camp so soon if they had known that they would have to wait so long before beginning their training... I doubt whether the. Minister would have wanted them to go into camp so soon had he known the circumstances. I should like the Minister to look into this matter, and to get. the classes into operation as soon as possible. Some time ago I raised the issue of  providing  work for men at Point Cook and Laverton on the enlargement of the aerodrome, the alteration of the water supply, and the building of roads so that the aerodrome weald lie entirely inside the main road to Geelong. I know that between  &#163;30,000and &#163;40,000  was set aside for this work. I notified the Williamstown Council, which had been promised &#163;  15,000  to doup the rifle range at Williamstown, that a larger scheme was to be put into&#39; operation, and that many more men would beemployed. In thisI went perhaps beyond what the Minister would have authorized me to say, but I was anxious to assure the council that provision was being made for the unemployed in its district, provided the men were suitable for the work. I am wondering whether these trainees, who ought to be studying for their various courses are being employed on this work, instead of the men from the district who ought to be engaged upon it. These trainees are becoming dissatisfied. They entered camp full of enthusiasm to get on with their job, and that enthusiasm is evaporating. Some of them, I understand have not even been taught Morsecode, though many, of course, had some training before they entered. I should like the Minister to inquire whether the money which was passed for this work is to be expended upon it, and whether the trainees are being engaged upon work which should be done by outside labourers. </para>

In elaboration of my previous reply I desire to state that the control of prices of sugar and other declared commodities is administered by the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner under the National Security (Prices) Regulations and that I have no power to deal with the subject. Orders made by the Commissioner may, however,be suspended by the Minister for Trade and Customs inaccordance with regulation18. </para>

                        <para>-  On Friday, the  19th  April, 1940, the honorable member for Gwydir <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scully)</inline> asked the Minister for Commerce a question concerning prices charged for second-hand bags. In elaboration of the reply then given, I wish to state that if the honorable member will bring to my notice any specific cases a full investigation will be made by the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner and any necessary action will be taken by him in cases where overcharges are proved. Regulation 20 of the National Security (Prices) Regulations provides that, in addition to any other penalty that may be imposed, the court may order the defendant to refund to the purchaser the difference between the maximum price fixed under the regulations and the price at which the goods were sold. </para>

                        <para>. -  On Friday, the 19th April, 1940, the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory),</inline> when speaking during the debate on the motion for the adjournment of the House, referred to the increase by 10s. a ton of the price of superphosphate and questioned the authority of the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner to take evidence on oath. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>On the 22nd April, 1940, the honorable member asked whether the increase by 10s. a ton of the price of superphosphate could be referred to the Tariff Board or some other body authorized to make a public inquiry to ascertain whether the increase of price is justified. I bring to the honorable member&#39;s notice the fact that, although public inquiries are not held by the Commissioner in the same manner as Tariff Board inquiries, the Commissioner has full power under the National Security (Prices) Regulations to summon witnesses and take evidence on oath. In practice he frequently requires data concerning applications for increased prices to be supported by statutory declarations. As regards the specific increase of 10s. a ton permitted by the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner on the 2nd January last, the Minister for Trade and Customs has informed me that this increase was permitted after an exhaustive inquiry had been made by the Commissioner into increased costs since the outbreak of war. The increases were due mainly toincreased freight on rock phosphate and increased costs of sulphur and sacks and were in all cases on account of additional costs on imported goods or freights over which the Government had no control. </para>
                    <para>Owing to the operation of the averaging principle and to the policy of the companies in purchasing early supplies of imported goods, the increase of 10s. a ton was, in the circumstances, moderate. </para>

In reply to the honorable member, I wish to state that following his representations on the matter to a previous Minister, the matter was given consideration, and steps are being taken to amend the regulations in the manner suggested by the honorable member. It will be realized that in some States local authorities are acting under the powers conferred by the National Security (Fair Rents) Regulations and the proposed amendments are still under discussion with these authorities. </para>
