This matter has again been brought before that tribunal by the Government of New South Wales and, as the men are assured of a fair and impartial hearing of. their grievance, no useful purpose would be served by imposing another governmental tribunal on them. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Dalley (Mr. Rosevar) on Friday last asked a question as to whether retailers, in addition to passing on the increased sales tax, would be entitled to charge profit thereon. In reply to the honorable member, I point out that when the sales tax was first introduced in 1930 the Government of the clay did not see fit to impose any such restrictions on retailers. The practice then adopted of regarding sales tax as portion of the cost lias persisted through all the variations of sales tax rates that have been made during the last ten years. The freedom of retailers lias now been limited by a recent determination of the Prices Commissioner which provides that, for the time being, the normal gross profit margin may not be obtained on sales tax in excess of 10 per cent. Consideration will be given to special cases where this ruling may involve hardship. </para>

I remind the honorable member that the powers of investigation granted to the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner under the National Security (Prices) Regulations are subject to an oath of secrecy, and that detailed information as to the trading operations of individuals and companies, obtained under the exerc' 1 se  of these powers, cannot bo divulged. In this care, however, I am able to inform the honorable member that the company named has no record of any sale of blankets to the Commonwealth Government nor has the Contracts Board any record of the purchase of blankets from the company. </para>

The Government does not refrain "from disclosing any facts connected with the war provided those facts are within its knowledge, except in circumstances in which disclosure of those facts may be of assistance to the enemy. A good deal of complaint from time to time about the shortage of news is against not the censorship here, but the volume of news from the other side of the world over which, of course, we have no censorship control. </para>

Is he aware that repeated representations have been made by members of Parliament, and particularly by myself, in an endeavour to obtain an increased supply of patrol for miners who use motor vehicles to travel to and from their work? In some cases miners are allowed nineteen gallons of petrol a month, which is sufficient to supply their needs for only half that period. </para>

Is it also a fact that the unemployed comprise men who are either below or above the military age ? In view of the fact that the then Prime Minister promised two years ago that something would be done in an effort to absorb the unemployed there, will the right honorable gentleman make a statement now as to whether the Government, in applying the policy of establishing munitions factories in country districts, will immediately set up such a factory in the coal-fields district? </para>

I understand that an officer of the AuditorGeneral's Department has also made a report on the same subject. Will the Minister for the Army make this report available or, if he cannot do that, will he inform the House how that report compares with the findings of the tribunal ? </para>

                        <para>- Arrangements have been made by which the Australian Wheat Board will make a further payment of 3d. a bushel on all wheat included in No. 2 pool, viz., wheat of the 1939-40 harvest. This additional payment will make the total advances in respect of wheat in this pool 3s. 5Â½d. a bushel, less rail freight on bagged wheat, and 3s. 3Â½d. a bushel, less rail freight on bulk wheat. The payment will involve the distribution of a further amount of Â£2,450,000. Of the total wheat acquired by the board of the 1939-40 harvest, namely, 195,500,000 bushels, sales have been made of 154,000,000 bushels, leaving an estimated carry-over" as at the end of November of approximately 42,000,000 bushels. Thirty-six million bushels have been sold, but have not been shipped. Advances by the Commonwealth Bank to the wheat pool were Â£34,500,000 to cover payments to the growers for freight, storage and incidental expenses, including the administrative expenses of the board. The overdraft at present is approximately Â£13,000,000, which, of course, will be further increased by the additional payments which will now be made by the board to growers. The initial advance for wheat acquired for the present harvest, 1940-41, which will be known as No. 3 pool, will be at the rate of 3s. a bushel, less freight, on bagged wheat, with an appropriate adjustment for bulk wheat. At present, this is approximately lÂ½d., so that the advance in the case of hulk wheat will be 2s. 10Â½d. a bushel, less freight. These advances compare with the initial advance of 2s. 10Â½d. a bushel, less freight, for bagged wheat, and 2s.8Â½d. a bushel, less freight, for bulk wheat of No. 2 pool, i.e. the 1939-40 harvest. These advances will entail the payment of more than Â£10,000,000. In addition, of course, further advances will he required by the board in order to meet freight, storage and other incidental expenditure. </para>

                        <para>- The report was not substantially correct. What I said was that there was no truth in the statement appearing in the press indicating .that a substantial Australian force had landed in Greece. I said it was however, possible that, without my knowledge, a few details may have landed in Greece for liaison work. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to ask a question of the Minister for the Army on a matter which has been the subject of corre- spondence between the honorable gentleman and myself. Is it true that the Gillette Razor Company gave to the defence authorities, for use at Sydney Showgrounds Military Camp, a safety razor with a couple of spare blades, that this equipment is the only shaving material provided for the troops and that, if they desire to obtain new blades, they are obliged to purchase them from the Gillette Razor Company, which is the only manufacturer of that type of blade? Does the Minister for the Army not think that, in view of the 'advantage thus accorded to the Gillette Razor Company, the troops should be supplied with open razors ? </para>

                </quote>
                <para>The principal amendments to be effected to the Income Tax Assessment Act by the passage of this bill may be divided into two sections, the first relating to amendments implementing the Government's proposals for additional revenue from individuals and companies, as outlined in my budget speech, and the second relating to the new methods to be employed in collecting the income . tax payable by salary and wage earners, by deduction from their salaries or wages. </para>
                <para>The most important of the amendments relating to the increased: liabilities to be imposed on the taxpaying community is the reduction of the statutory exemption from Â£250 to Â£150. A statutory exemption is designed to afford freedom from income tax to those members of the community whose incomes are not sufficiently large to warrant their being called upon to make a contribution to revenue by direct taxation. The ideal of preceding governments has been to maintain the statutory exemption at as high a level as is possible, having regard to the needs of revenue. </para>
                <para>The statutory exemption of Â£250, which has applied for many years, has had the effect, in conjunction with the liberal concessional deductions allowed, of keeping a very considerable section of the income-earning people of Australia outside the field of Commonwealth direct taxation. The allowance of a statutory exemption of Â£250 was part of a plan of preceding governments to place . the burden of taxation upon the shoulders of those best able to bear it. As a consequence of this and. other concessional allowances, approximately 70 per cent, of the total personal incomes, and over 80 per. cent, of the families of Australia, have, for many years, been practically freed of the obligation to make any contribution to Commonwealth revenue in the form of income tax. This was a splendid ideal in normal times, and it  was  only after very long and serious consideration of the subject that the Government reluctantly found itself compelled to modify the concession. </para>
                <para>In reaching its decision, the Government has sought to avoid, as far as possible, any serious encroachment upon living standards, particularly in respect of the family unit. Even thought it is proposed that the statutory exemption shall be reduced from Â£250 to Â£150, a married man with two dependent children will not be called upon to pay Commonwealth income tax, unless his net income exceeds Â£300  -  approximately Â£6 a week - which is far in excess of the basic wage standard. </para>
                <para>The means of financing the tremendous obligations which the war lias imposed on the people of Australia have been explored in my budget speech, and, as honorable members understand, the Government proposes that Â£33,000,000 for a full year shall be raised by means of income tax from individuals. </para>
                <para>In determining the incidence of this increased taxation, the Government naturally looked to the higher incomes, that is, to incomes over Â£1,000. It found that the. full amount of additional revenue to be raised could not be obtained from those incomes. At this stage, the Government is satisfied that the higher ranges of income cannot contribute more than an additional Â£10,000,000, making a total contribution to revenue of Â£20,000,000 by taxpayers in this group. Similarly, in the range of middle incomes between Â£400 and Â£1,000, the additional Â£6,000,000 which the taxpayers of this class are being called upon to contribute will bring the taxation of middle incomes practically to its maximum, that is, a total income tax contribution of Â£8,000,000. </para>
                <para>The Government was accordingly forced to seek a contribution to its revenue from incomes in the lower ranges, which, as I have mentioned previously, represent approximately 70 per cent, of the total personal incomes. </para>
                <para>In order to get the share of additional revenue required from incomes of the lower group, it has proved to be necessary to extend the field. of the tax by lowering the statutory exemption. This the Government has- done, but I assure honorable members that only in the face of stern necessity has this course been taken, a course which the Government considers to be inescapable. This matter is quite outside party political considerations ; it raises no question of thrusting unfairly a burden of tax upon any section- of the community, or of discriminating against one section in favour of another. If revenue is to be obtained in amounts essential for the successful prosecution of the war, it is plainly unavoidable that some greater measure of tax shall be borne by taxpayers in the lower income group. </para>
                <para>To facilitate the collection of the tax from salary and wage-earners and, at the same time, to ease the burden of meeting the payment of the tax in a lump sum, the Government proposes to introduce a scheme for the deduction of the tax from salaries and wages, and earnings of that character, by instalments spread throughout the year. I shall explain the operation of this scheme in a few moments. </para>
                <para>Another important amendment is the withdrawal of the tax rebate hitherto allowed to individual shareholders in respect of dividends distributed to them by companies. Briefly stated, the rebate of tax which the law at present allows to shareholders is made at the shareholders' rate of tax on property income, or at the company rate, whichever is the less. The allowance of a tax rebate is based on the conception that the assessment of the profits of a company, and the assessment of a shareholder on dividends paid out of those taxed profits, involve double taxation: in other words, the company is merely the machine by which the shareholders combine to earn profits, and the assessment of the profits of a company is really the assessment, of the income of the shareholders. Whatever merit be attached to the principle of the allowance of a tax 3'eba.te on dividends, the Government . considers that the concession which might be granted in normal times should be withdrawn as part of a plan to provide the funds so necessary for war purposes. </para>
                <para>It is appropriate to mention that the allowance of. the rebate has operated in such a way as to confer unequal advantages upon shareholders in companies generally. Thus, whilst a company's profits have been taxed at a fiat rate of 2s. in Â£1, a shareholder whose rate of tax was 2s. or more in Â£1- has received the full benefit in rebate of the tax paid by the company. But a shareholder receiving the same amount' of dividend whose rate was less than 2s.- did not enjoy thefull benefit of the tax paid .by the company but only a rebate based on his lower rate of tax. The discrimination as between shareholders is more clearly revealed when one considers that one class of shareholder received a rebate of 2s. in the Â£1, whilst a shareholder whose income fell below the statutory exemption received no rebate at -all. The Government has given earnest consideration to views expressed in support of the retention of the rebate as well as to those advanced for its abolition, and has decided that the revenue demands of the moment- justify a discontinuance of the concession. The gain in revenue which will be derived from the abolition of the rebate in the case of individuals is estimated at Â£1,700,000 for this financial year. </para>
                <para>The allowance of the rebate is being retained in the case of dividends received by resident companies from other companies in which they hold shares, as it is considered that the holding company is merely .the channel through, which profits eventually flow to the individual shareholders.  To  levy a tax upon the dividends received by the holding company without a corresponding rebate would have the effect of throwing an inequitable burden upon investors iu companies. </para>
                <para>General consideration of the question of the allowance of the tax rebate has attracted attention to the anomalous situation that has arisen in regard to dividends paid, out of Commonwealth loan interest. " The effect of section 4.5 of the Income Tax Assessment Act is that the part of a dividend paid out of Commonwealth loan interest carries a rate of tax of 16d. in the Â£1 as compared with the rate of 2s. in the Â£1 on the  balance of the taxable income of a company. Previously the tax rebate has been allowed to companies at the rate of 2s. in the Â£1 on the whole of the dividend received by the company, resulting in a loss to revenue of 8d. in the Â£1 on the part of the dividend paid out of Commonwealth loan interest. Now that section 40 of the act is to be amended the opportunity is being taken to correct this anomaly by limiting the rate of rebate in the part of the dividend paid out of Commonwealth loan interest to ls. 4d. </para>
                <para>The amending bill also provides for an alteration of the basis on which the further tax on the undistributed profits of public companies is to be levied. When this further tax was imposed in May last, provision was made for a deduction of an amount equal to 25 per cent, of the company's profit after certain deductions had been made therefrom. This allowance was granted because the reservation of profits was considered necessary to meet expansion and contingencies and to cover expenditure not deductible for taxation purposes. In its search for additional sources of revenue the Government has given further consideration to the question of this allowance and has decided that it should be withdrawn. The view taken is that the allowance of 25 per cent, of adjusted profits is more than adequate for the purpose for which it was designed and the withdrawal of- the deduction still leaves a substantial pool of reserved profits after payment of the undistributed profits tax at the comparatively low rate of 2s. in the Â£1. The undistributed profits tax is levied after the allowance of a deduction for dividends paid within six months after the close of the year of income. </para>
                <para>The Government has reconsidered the position of non-resident companies, particularly those in the United Kingdom which, owing to the present disturbed conditions, find themselves unable within the statutory period of six months to comply with the formalities necessary to the distribution of company profits. The Government has, accordingly, decided to extend the period to nine months in the case of non-resident companies. </para>
                <para>A further proposed amendment relates to the special deduction provided by section 122 of the act for capital expended- by mining companies in plant and development of the mining property. The object of that provision is .to permit of the recoupment of capital expenditure out of profits during the estimated life of the mine. The practical application of the -provision, however, has disclosed that it is defective in that a.&lt;full recoupment is not provided for in the section. The amendment is being proposed to cure the defect. ; </para>
                <para>The act is also being amended to place a time limitation upon the operation of section 159 and the " corresponding sections of the law which provide for the allowance of a rebate in the case of income doubly or trebly taxed in the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth and the States. Those provisions apply to assessments- back to the financial year 1921-22 and, at the present  time,  an application for a rebate may extend retrospectively for nearly 20 years. It is proposed that an application for a rebate in respect of any assessment must be made within six years from the date when the tax on that assessment became due and payable. The period of six years is considered to give a reasonable opportunity for the lodgment of the application and the submission of the particulars required for the calculation of the rebate. It is most unreasonable that the Taxation Department should be required to attempt to calculate rebates after the expiration of more than six years from the time the assessments were made. In reaching this decision the Government has been influenced by provisions in the law of the United Kingdom which places a similar limit on application for relief granted in that country in respect of dominion .income taxes. </para>
                <para>I shall now proceed to explain the scheme which the Government proposes to introduce for the collection of tax payable on salaries and wages and earnings of that character. The comprehensive legislative machinery necessary to give effect to the scheme will be found in clause 13 of the bill which consists of 23 proposed new sections. With the lowering of the statutory exemption a considerable number of taxpayers from the salary and wage-earning class will be brought into the taxable field ; and to ease the burden which would be imposed on them if they were obliged to meet the payment of' their assessments in a lump sum, the Government has -decided to introduce a. scheme whereby the tax will be  paid  by instalments throughout the  greater  (part of the year. </para>
                <para>The scheme has already been adopted for State taxation purposes in Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania. Stated generally, the scheme for which the bill makes provision is an arrangement whereby the payment of income tax is effected by instalment deductions from the salary or wages of the employee, either by the purchase of taxinstalment stamps by the employer, or by means of cash-instalment deductions made under approved group schemes... </para>
                <para>The deductions to- be made will commence on the 1st January, 1941, and will be on account of tax payable in respect of assessments for the current financial year based on income derived during the year ended the 30th June,. 1940. The deductions will be fixed amounts of instalments based upon salary or wages being received at the time the instalments are deducted. The basic deduction which it is intended shall apply is that relating to a person without dependants, and in the case of a married man with a dependent wife and children this basic rate is reduced by 4s. a week, in respect of each dependant. As the deductions are being made as from the 1st January next, it is necessary that the weekly instalment be based on an. amount that- will secure the payment of the tax in full before the 30th June next. Thus the deductions for this year will be spread over a period of only 25 weeks. For subsequent years it is proposed, that the deductions commence on the 1st August and continue over a period of 40 weeks. The statement " A " which has been circulated for the information of honorable members shows the weekly deductions which will be made on varying incomes ranging from Â£4 a week to Â£19 a week in the case of a taxpayer without dependants and taxpayers with one, two, three and four dependants. </para>
                <para>It will be seen in the case of. a single man earning Â£6 a week that the weekly deduction is 12s. and in the case of a married man with a wife and one child 4s. A single man earning Â£10 a. week will have 30s. a week deducted, whilst the married man with dependent wife and child earning the same salary or wages will have 22s. a week- deducted from his salary or wages,, and so on. The maximum rate of deduction which is to be applied is 5s. in the pound a week. </para>
                <para>To authorize the employer to make weekly deductions lower than the basic rate prescribed in the case of a person without dependants, the employee will be' required to furnish a declaration in duplicate to his employer setting out therein particulars regarding his dependants. . On the information shown in this declaration the employer will reduce the basic deduction by 4s. a week for each dependant. The employer will retain one copy of the declaration and forward the duplicate to the Taxation Department: </para>
                <para>Tax instalment stamps will be made available for sale at all post offices and other approved places as may he found necessary. Employers will be required to make the prescribed deductions from each payment of wage3, and to hand to the employee concerned a tax-instalment stamp or stamps equal in denomination to the deductions made.  The employee will be required to affix the stamp to a page in his stamp book and to cancel, it by writing thereon his name or initials and the date. Approved stamp books published by a number of printing firms will be on sale at stationers' shops and other distributing points at a nominal charge. Books for instalment stamps cost lid. or 2d. each and last for at least a year. The employee will he responsible for the safe custody of his stamps until such time as he presents them at the Taxation Office in payment of his tax. </para>
                <para>When the taxpayer receives his notice of assessment he will forward the book of stamps , and the notice of assessment to the Taxation Department where the face value of the stamps will be applied in payment of his tax. If the value of the stamps is insufficient to pay the whole of the tax, any balance must be paid by the employee in cash, and where the value of the stamps exceeds the amount of the tax payable the excess will be refunded in cash immediately to the employee. </para>
                <para>Employers of large numbers of employees who do not desire to use taxinstalment stamps may, with the concurrence of their employees, obtain the Commissioner's approval for the formation of a group. Under this arrangement, the employer will make prescribed deductions on pay days and will pay the aggregate amountsdeducted to the Taxation Department at pre-arranged times. When the employee receives his notice of assessment he may either hand it to his employer who will vary the amount of the deduction to meet the tax by the due date, or the employee desirous of maintaining the confidential character of his notice of assessment may obtain from the employer a certificate of the deductions made. The certificate will then be presented by the employee to the Taxation Department and the necessary credit will be given to him for the amount of the deduction paid through the group. Adjustments for under-payments and over-payments will be made as in the case where tax-instalment stamps are used. </para>
                <para>Provision has also been made for the Commissioner to require employers to make deductions under group schemes in lieu of delivering tax instalment stamps to employees if, owing to special circumstances connected with the character of their employment, such an arrangement is considered to be desirable. </para>
                <para>The Government considers that the benefits of the scheme should be afforded to taxpayers other than employees, and the bill contains a provision enabling such persons, if they so desire, to purchase tax instalment stamps from the authorized source. As regards these persons, however, the purchase of the stamps will not be compulsory, but the provision is made to assist those taxpayers who desire to set aside a certain amount of tax, from time to time, in anticipation of the receipt of a notice of assessment. </para>
                <para>Taxpayers may at any time make application to the Taxation Department for a certificate exempting them from suffering further instalment deductions from their wages. These certificates will be issued in those cases where - (a)the assessed tax has been fully paid; </para>

This certificate will also entitle the taxpayers to a cash refund from the department of the face value of any stamps he may have in his possession. </para>

Consequently the income tax revenue will receive amounts to which it is entitled whether the taxpayer makes his returns or fails to do so. </para>

                <para class="block">The system of payment of tax by tax instalment stamps and group schemes, which has been in operation for State taxation purposes in South Australia and Victoria for several years, has been a marked success. After investigation of the results achieved in those States, Western Australia and Tasmania introduced similar schemes as from the 1st July, 1940: The fact that the .scheme is already in operation in four States will enable the Commonwealth to superimpose the scheme for federal purposes with a minimum of inconvenience to employers, employees and the department concerned. . In New South Wales and Queensland the federal provisions will, operate independently of" the  State systems although administered' by. the one amalgamated Taxation Department. </para>
                <para>To facilitate the operation of the scheme, it is proposed to amend section 204 of the. act to provide that income tax shall be due and payable on a date not less than 30 days after the serviceof the notice of assessment in lion of the specific period of 60 days at present allowed. </para>
                <para>The operation of the scheme in those States where a. similar scheme is already functioning for State- purposes makes it very desirable that the Commonwealth and State tax should be made due and payable on the same day. The proposed amendment will enable this course to be followed: </para>
                <para>I wish, however,- to make it clear that taxpayers outside these particular States as well as all taxpayers who do not come within the provisions of the scheme, will, as heretofore, continue to be allowed 60 days for payment of their assessments. The additional tax payable by private companies and the further tax on the undistributed income of public companies will, however, be payable .30 days after the receipt of the assessment. </para>
                <para>There will be' no disturbance of the existing methods of  administration  by the adoption of the proposed: scheme. It will be necessary, however;, to 'provide for the Governor-General in: Council, to arrange with the Governors in Council of the States for agreements to' be entered- into for the carrying out of the- necessary functions arising from, the new provisions. The preparation of these agreements will follow the passing of the necessary legislation. </para>
                <para>At present in the States of Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania, State tax instalment- stamps are in use. The agreements with those </para>
                <para>States will provide for the withdrawal of the State stamps on the 31st December, 1940, and .^commencing on the 1st January, 1941, the new stamp will come into circulation and will be used as a  joint stamp for Commonwealth, and State  purposes. The stamp will be accepted by the Commonwealth and State Governments in the four States mentioned as payment, in due proportions, of the taxassessed for Commonwealth and State purposes respectively. In the States of New South. Wales and Queensland, the stamp will be used- for Commonwealth purposes only during the period' in which those two State- Governments retain their, existing systems of State taxation. </para>
                <para>The principle followed in these two States is that of tax assessment and tax collection at the source in respect of the current year's, income. The tax on income from employment is levied on weekly earnings and irregular wage-  earners pay tax at the same rate as  those  in regular, employment. Tax contributions are, therefore, not equal: There is no complete recognition of the varying domestic 'responsibilities of the taxpayers ; and the differentiation is made in the case of taxpayers in receipt of busi=ness or property,income where the assessment is based upon the' income of. the immediately preceding financial year. </para>
                <para>For the reasons mentioned, the Govern,ment. has decided to adopt the scheme in operation in the four States other than New South Wales and Queensland. The scheme adopted also has the recommendation of the conference of expert- taxation officers, held in Sydney in January this year. </para>
                <para>Both the 1921 and the 1934 Royal Commissions on Taxation supported, the principle that in any system of payment of income tax by instalments collected at the source,- an adjustment of over and under payments in. relation to the- total income of the year should be made. </para>
                <para>The comment of' the- 19:21 Royal Commission on Taxation reads- as- follows : - </para>
                <para>We have no hesitation in saying that the "proposal to tax wages at the. source cannot fairly be considered except in conjunction with the system of adjustments which will have the effect of finally imposing tax only to the extent justified by the total taxable income for the year. </para>
                <para>The remarks of the 1934 Royal Commission on Taxation are - </para>

                <para class="block">It is my grave duty to introduce a resolution for the imposition of rates of income tax which will place . on the Australian taxpayer a very heavy burden indeed. Ido so with regret, but without apology.. Taxation is not popular even in the most enlightened communities, and no Government courts unpopularity by imposing unnecessary burdens upon the people. But this is no time to count the cost of unpopular measures. The Government would fail in its duty to the people if it did not face the bitter facts of these times. We live in the midst of uncertainties, but one thing at least is sure - that there is no cheap road to success in war. </para>
                <para>On the other side of the world men and women are at this moment buying' liberty with. their blood. Their cause and ours are one, and for us in Australia the issue is simple. It is this: Must this war be won ? Everything that is good in our eyes is at stake. There can be no two answers. I repeat that there is no cheap road to victory. The way lies, in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Churchill's</inline> phrase, through "blood and tears and sacrifice ". We as a nation have taken upon ourselves the payment of a share of that price for liberty. We have assumed the duty of sacrifice. Having said that, I feel that no word of mine is needed to justify even an uncomfortable weight of taxation. </para>
                <para>The income tax, as a means of raising money, has the great merits of equity and directness. Rates and incidence can be adjusted on the principle of ability to pay. Family obligations and other special calls on the individual can be sympathetically and justly treated ;. there are, in fact, special deductions provided for dependants, medical expenses, life insurance premiums, friendly society dues and so on. </para>
                <para>It is natural, therefore, for the Government to resort to the income tax as one  means of financing the war effort. As honorable members are aware, and as a glance at the tables which have been circulated will show, the same expedient has been adopted elsewhere. In both Great Britain and New Zealand the rates of taxation on incomes have been heavily increased. In Great Britain the standard rate of tax has been raised to 8s. 6d. in theÂ£1, the scope of the surtax widened and personal allowance reduced. I need quote only a few examples taken at random of the results of these increased burdens on the British taxpayer. . Taxpayers on incomes as low as Â£125 are now taxable. The present effective rates on incomes of Â£200 from personal exertion and property respectively are1s.8d. and 2s. 6d. as compared with 6d. and10d. before the war. On Â£10,000 the increases are from. 8s. 5Â½d. to 12s. 2d. and from 8s. 7Â½d. to 12s 4Â½d. In New Zealand severe basic rates of income tax have been adopted and have been supplemented not only by a surtax of 15 per cent., but by a Hat levy of ls. in the Â£1 on the gross amount of all incomes. There are no exemptions. All over the Empire the story is the same; those peoples have taken up their burden. We will not wish to do less. </para>
                <para>It is no part -of the present proposals to deprive the taxpayer of any of the concessional deductions which he has enjoyed in the past. So far as he can be protected from the effects of war-time taxation he will be protected. For reasons I have given at length in connexion with the Income Tax Assessment Bill, however, the Government has been forced, I need not say unwillingly, to lower the statutory exemption. The vast fields of income hitherto left untouched by the Commonwealth must be tapped if we are to finance and win this war. Commonwealth income tax has hitherto fallen very lightly on low incomes. I remind, honorable members that our collections from incomes below- Â£400 have yielded only about Â£100,000 a year. Yet it is the aggregate of the lower income groups which constitutes the great bulk of the nation's income. The total personal incomes amount to about Â£745,000,000. Incomes of over Â£1,000 account for only about Â£S5,0000,000, or 11 per cent, of that total. At the other end of the scale the income groups under Â£400 receive no less than Â£517,000,000, or 70 per cent, of the total. The middle incomes account for Â£143,000,000, or 19 per cent, of the total. </para>
                <para>When increased income tax becomes unavoidable, the accepted principle of "ability to pay" immediately suggests that the bulk of the increased burden should be thrown upon the higher incomes. But the capacity of income to carry increased Commonwealth taxation cannot be judged separately from the incidence of State taxation in the highest taxed State, which virtually sets the limit beyond which the Commonwealth cannot go. When the factor of State taxation is considered, it becomes obvious, upon examination, that the full weight of the increased Commonwealth taxation cannot reasonably be placed upon the higher incomes. While the greatest portion of the burden of this increased taxation will fall upon the wealthy sections of the community, it is unavoidable that the middle and lower incomes must be called upon to make further contributions and, under the present proposals, they will do so. </para>
                <para>I again remind honorable members of facts- and figures that I have given elsewhere. The new rates are designed to produce Â£33,000,000 in a i( full year. Incomes over Â£1,000 will contribute Â£20,000,000, as compared with Â£9,800,000 under the present scale, and 1 Â£6,200,000 under the 1939-40 scale. Middle incomes - Â£400 to Â£1,000 - -will contribute Â£8,000,000, as against Â£2,000,000 under the present scale and Â£1,300,000 under the 1939-40 scale. The lowest group - under Â£400 - will be called upon to provide Â£5,000,000 as compared with Â£200,000 under the present scale and Â£100,000 under the 1938-40 scale. </para>
                <para>There is, as I have said, no escaping the costs of the war that has been forced upon us. Nevertheless, the Government proposes, as a measure of relief to the community, to institute a scheme of payment at the source, the benefits of which will be felt by the lower income earners mo3t of all. </para>
                <para>I turn now to the proposed scale of rates. The scale of personal exertion rates enacted in May last begins at 5d. in the Â£1 ; the proposed scale begins at ls. in the Â£1. This is a large increase, but it must be borne in mind that the various deductions so protect the taxpayer that the married man with one child, for instance, would not pay tax at the rate of ls. in the Â£1 on his actual income until that income is at least Â£400 a year. A single man without dependants will not reach the ls. rate of tax on his actual income until the income is rather more than Â£300. </para>
                <para>The scale now proposed rises rapidly from ls. in the Â£1 on a taxable amount of Â£300 to 5s. in the Â£1 at Â£1,500. The excess over Â£1,500 taxable income is taxed at a flat rate of 10s. in the Â£1. The rate of increase has to be gradually slackened as incomes rise, or it would lead to aggregate Commonwealth and State rates of over 20s. in the Â£1. This is achieved by the limitation imposed by the flat rate of 10s. </para>
                <para>The amounts of tax payable .to the Commonwealth at the new rates will be roughly comparable to the amounts of </para>
                <para class="block">State tax payable in  the highest taxed States and will be, especially, in the higher ranges, much greater than the amounts of State tax payable in the lowest taxed States. The relation between State and Commonwealth totals varies, of course, at different levels. It will be seen from the tables that the State "taxes on a single man in the highest taxed State exceed the Commonwealth up to the Â£S00 mark. On the Â£900 to Â£5,000 incomes the Commonwealth taxes ave the heavier of the two. In the highest ranges, however, the State taxes weigh so heavily on the taxpayer as to preclude the Commonwealth from imposing on that .field taxes of even equal severity. Honorable members are aware to what degree the imposition of Commonwealth taxation can be impeded by the States. </para>
                <para>The property scale has been determined on the same principles as were observed when the- original rates for 1940-41 were adopted. The more important personal exertion scale has been arrived- at with strict reference to the relative ability of different incomes to bear the taxation which the circumstances dictate; and the property scale has been derived from it by increasing the -rates- up to Â£1,200 by 2-5 per cent. </para>
                <para>The minimum property rate is thus ls. 3d. in the Â£1; and applies to taxable incomes up to Â£300. The rate rises steeply thereafter, and reaches 5s-. at Â£1,200. A flat rate of 10s-. in the Â£1 is imposed on the excess of the taxable income over Â£1,200. </para>
                <para>From that point the difference between the personal exertion and the property rates tapers steadily off as the income increases, but until the high levels of income are reached the property scale- remains substantially heavier than the personal exertion. The tapering of the scales, I may remind honorable members, is simply a recognition of the increasing, element of property in personal exertion in the higher ranges, and an attempt to put the relative weights- of taxation- on the two classes of income on the equitable footing that their similarity warrants. </para>
                <para>As I have said, the proposed rates are severe, but if they are weighed against our danger and- our purpose; they will be seen in their true light as an honest attempt to face reality with clear eyes.. </para>
                <para class="block">Some comfort of the negative kind may be drawn from the realization that we are not alone in our labours and sacrifices for the common good. The comparison of the income taxes levied in this country and in- New Zealand is illuminating. It will be seen from the tables that on the specified incomes the weight of income taxation is, except in a very few cases, heavier in New Zealand than it will be. in Australia even at the new rates. At the lowest levels there are very notabledisparities. Consider the taxpayer with; a dependent wife and one dependent child" on an income of Â£250. In New Zealand,, he must pay Â£25 in taxation; in the highest taxed State of the Commonwealth, at that level, he pays Â£7, and that all in State taxation. At Â£300, the same taxpayer in Australia will be required to pay in State and Commonwealth taxes about Â£15, which is exactly half of what hewould pay in New Zealand. I need not labour the point. </para>
                <para>No section of the community can escape the effects of the Avar and under the present proposals the income of companies will, also be called upon to bear an increased contribution to the revenue. The resolution provides for an increase of ls. in the flat rate of tax to be levied on the undistributed profits of public companies. The undistributed profits' tax was introduced in May of this year and. has not yet been- applied. The tax, as -honorable members will recall, corresponds generally with the tax on undistributed, profits of private companies which has been in operation for many years. Under the law as it stands at present, a. flat rate of Ls. in the Â£1 is prescribed as the tax on undistributed profits as determined under the act, but a revision of that rate has become necessary to conform with the upward trend of the rates of tax on the incomes of. individual taxpayers. High individual rates and a comparatively low rate of tax on undistributed profits- would induce shareholders to leave their profits in the company, and so avoid the heavy rates at which they would have to- pay as individuals. I propose to the- committee, therefore, that the rate of tax on the undistributed profits of public companies be raised to 2s. in the Â£1. </para>
                <para>The total income of companies which, is available for taxation is about Â£93,000,000, and it has been estimated that taxation, including State and overseas taxes, will appropriate some Â£32,000,000 out of that income. I need not enlarge -upon the important part which companies play in the industrial economy of the community, especially in war time. Obviously, they must not be subjected to a burden which will cripple them and hamner the conduct of the war. In the light of that consideration, I think honorable members will agree that at about fis. <inline font-style="italic">Sd. in the Â£1 the</inline> taxation of companies approaches what may be regarded as the limit under present conditions. </para>
                <para>I have dealt with first things first. My remarks so far have related to divisions A, B, and H of the resolution, which are the divisions which, will most nearly interest the community in general. I must now offer honorable members a word or two in explanation of the other divisions. These, however, represent no departure from provisions contained in similar resolutions of 'previous years. </para>
                <para>Division O provides the rates to he applied when taxpayers derive taxable income from personal exertion and from property. -In these cases the rate of taxon the separate amounts of each class of taxable income is ascertained as if the total income were derived wholly from personal exertion and wholly from property respectively. The effect of the application of division C is that the taxpayer pays tax on his taxable income from personal exertion and property at the rate attributable to his total taxable income. In other words, to illustrate with an example, if the total composite income were Â£5,000, made up of Â£3,000 personal exertion income and Â£2,000 property income, the rate a'pplied to both the Â£3,000' and the Â£2,000 is the rate applicable to the Â£5,000. </para>
                <para>Division' D will operate when the averaging provisions of the- assessment act are applied! Those provisions are limited to the assessments of primary producers. To describe the working of the averaging system briefly I may point out that the rate of tax on the taxpayer's taxable income is ascertained by averaging his taxable income over the year of income, and the four preceding years. The rate that is attributable to the amount of the taxpayer's average income over the five-year period is the rate of tax prescribed by division D to be paid by a. taxpayer on his taxable income of the year of income. </para>
                <para>In division E, an equitable basis is provided for the calculation of the taxpayable by a taxpayer who receives  at  premium upon the grant or assignment of a lease. These lease premiums as income are of the nature of commuted rent,, and, for this reason, the premiums are included in the taxable field by specialprovisions of the assessment act. The full amount of the premium is, however,, taxed, as income of the year in which it: is received, and it will be readily appreciated by honorable members that the graduated rate of tax would cause a taxpayer to pay a greater, amount of tax than he would be called upon to 'pay if he received the amount of the lease premiumin the form of rent spread over the term, of the lease. This inequity is removed as; far as possible by the assessment act which provides for the premium to be taxed at the rate that would be payable on a notional income ascertained by dividing the lease premium by one-half of the number of years in the term of the lease. Any taxable income which may be derived by the taxpayer in addition to the lease premiums is aggregated with the lease notional income to determine the rate of tax payable on his total taxable income. </para>
                <para>Division F provides for a minimum tax of 10s., which has been the minimum tax for many years. </para>
                <para>Division Q prescribes the rate of tax payable by trustees in those cases where, under the provisions of the assessment act, the trustee is assessed on the whole or portion of the income of a trust estate. A provision of this kind is necessary to meet the ease where a trustee of a trustestate is a company, otherwise the rate of tax applied to the taxable  income  derived by the trust estate would be the company rate instead of the graduated rate -payable by an individual. </para>
                <para>The third paragraph of the resolution.empowers' the Commissioner to apply the rates of tax as set out in the resolution in those cases where it becomes necessary,. viz., in the case of persons departing overseas, to make assessments for the succeeding financialyear before the rates bill for the financial year 1941-42 is passed by Parliament. </para>
                <para>It is expected that new rates' of tax upon individuals will yield a total of Â£33,000,000 revenue for. the full year, of which Â£26,000,000 should be collected during the current financial year. To this is to be added Â£1,700,000 to be obtained by the abolition of the company rebate. </para>
                <para>The revenue from companies to be derived at the 2s. flat rate is estimated at Â£8,800,000 for the full year, of which Â£7,800,0000 should be collected during the current financial year. The additional tax to be imposed on undistributed profits will yield Â£2,400,000 revenue in a full year, of which Â£2,000,000 should be collected in 1940-41: </para>
                <para>Believing as I do that the nation is willing to take up the inescapableburden of the war, I commend the resolution to the committee. </para>

                    <para>.- The Speech delivered by the Governor-General the other day was remarkable, not so much for the things that it said as for the things that it omitted to say. There was some mention of the war, a considerable amount of inspired propaganda, and a reference to industrial disputes in this country; but there was no reference to any ameliorative social legislation that would give to the great mass of people in this country - the real Australians - any reason to hope for an alleviation of their conditions. I shall not be able fro deal, in the time allotted to me, with all the sins of omission or commission of this Government; in fact, there is scarcely time for me even to adumbrate the subject. Unfortunately this Government won the last elections. It is a bad thing for Australia that a Labour government is not now administering the affairs of the nation. I make bold to suggest that, had the budget been presented a week or so before the election, and had the electors been supplied with the illuminating figures which were disclosed to us this afternoon, the members of the Government would have been in opposition to-day and the Leader of the Labour party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin),</inline> as Prime Minister, would have been putting into effect this party's policy for the proper conduct of the war and for the enactment of all that legislation which this country needs if it is to be governed in the best interests of true Australians. For many years the United Australia party and its variable companion, the United Country party, have governed or misgoverned the country, according to the point of view of the observer. Many of the things that should have been done in the nation's prosperous years were not attempted, so that to-day we find that, in contrast to many other countries, Australia has no record of progress in recent years, and no social achievement of which it can boast. It is a nation where great wealth accumulates at one end of the social scale and undeserved destitution at the other. Naturally, being a member of the Australian Labour party and holding its political philosophy, I dissent from the ideologies of the United Australia party; but at least I can give it credit for having some opinions and some philosophy. To the members of the United Australia party the capitalist system seems to be the best of all possible systems; in fact they regard it as the only practical system - one in. which the Government must allow certain people to keep money which they allegedly earn, but which in fact they make by exploiting: the people they employ or the consumers to whom they sell their goods. That is an understandable view and, although we oppose it entirely, we recognize that the United Australia party can support its case with at least some show of reason. But nothing can be said in praise of the political outlook of the so-called " United " Country party on social and political problems. As has been amply demonstrated already in this Parliament, the policy of that party is one of " catch a3 catch can ". It does not agree with anything in the political philosophy of the United Australia party and it certainly does not agree with the Labour party's views that the surplus value created by the wealth producers of the country belongs to those' producers and not to those who happen to own the machines of production. It continues to exist as a party only by the exercise of a system of political blackmail. As the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rosevear)</inline> has suggested, members of the Country party always have a nuisance value and, in addition,  they have almost a preternatural ability to capitalize that nuisance value and obtain whatever positions are available without giving good service in return. That is a fact, and now that you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> have shed all your political prejudices and party predilections upon your elevation to the position of  Speaker  of this House and have begun to preside over our deliberations with charming impartiality, you will no doubt agree with some of the strictures that I pass upon your quondam friends': No member of the Country party, in all the time that that organization has been in existence, lias done anything to win the respect or admiration of succeeding generations. It has left no legislative monument to its ability and no administrative record' of which it might be proud. This country has reason to remember its </para>

                <para>I said that it was a misfortune for this country that the Labour party did not win the election. The United Australia party, or its organization outside this Parliament, won this election - or rather stole it - by a series of activities of which it has no reason to be proud and which will poison the political atmosphere of this country if they be perpetrated at succeeding- elections.' There were faked official statements- during the election campaign. There were statements about Australian forces going into action in Egypt,, and,, in addition, there was loaded propaganda'' against the Labour party, designed to exacerbate the feelings of people whose loved ones were overseas. Then there were faked German broadcasts that were paid for by big  busi-ness  interests and broadcast almost continuously from the B-class stations, in Victoria at any rate, from morning to night in an endeavour to poison the minds of ' the people against the Labour party, which I remind honorable members is the only really Australian party - a party which has- never been under the painful necessity of changing its name-at election times in order to - escape the wrath of the people. Then there were those newspaper advertisements, those vile tilings stating that Labour fiddled while London burned. As a matter of fact, London was not burning at the time when the advertisements were published. Everything that could possibly have been done to snatch an electoral victory was done. The Prime Minister appealed for a great victory or a great defeat. Unfortunately he did not suffer a great defeat, but fortunately he did hot achieve a great victory. Thus we find this House in an unusual state with Government and Opposition equally represented. </para>

What we heard in the budget speech the other day had no doubt been decided after consultation as an expression of the wishes of the wealthy interests of this country. The budget discloses that the wealthy interests are being well protected. I had hoped for the introduction of legislation in respect of child endowment, family allowances and marriage loans. In time of war, this Government has tremendous power to do much for either' good or evil ; it could almost completely mould the future of this country. But obviously my hope for the introduction of social legislation along the lines followed in many other countries is a vain one. Apparently the Government does not intend to endeavour to ease the lot of the family man and the poorer section of the community. It is said that a new social order will follow the conclusion of the war. I do not believe that we shall have social justice from those who now sit in power, or from the financial interests which dictate their policy,either while the war is in progress or at its termination. It was said that those who fought in the last war did so in order to makethe world safe for democracy and a worldfit for heroes to live in; yet that conflict was succeeded by the worstdepression in history. We had the sad spectacle of many ex-soldiers, -who were no longer physically fit for . employment, having tolive on sustenance.In Melbourne, some of -them were even engaged upon the task of "decorating their own war memorials at sustenance rates of pay.

The conditions of the people are becoming, not better but relatively worse. A statement that I prepared some time ago for a select committee of the Legislative Assembly of Victoria gives a summary of the output of factories and their value. It is an illuminating document, which shows that the workers are not receiving from industry to-day the percentage that they received a few years ago. For example, in 1924-25, the total value of raw materials, power, fuel, etc., in this country, was Â£233,000,000. Salaries and wages accounted for Â£S1, 000,000, whilst interest, profit, etc., totalled' Â£65,000,000. The proportion of added value which wages bore to that total was 55.3 per cent:, whereas the figure in. respect of interest and profit was only 44.7 per cent. In the succeeding years the per1centage taken out by wages and salaries grew progressively less, whilst the percentage in respect of interest, profit, &amp;c, inevitably grew progressively larger. In 1928-29, the respective figures were 54.3 per cent, and 45.7 per cent. In 1929-30 they were 52.8- per cent, and 47.2 per cent. In the depression year, 1932-33", the withdrawal by wages and salaries was less than that of interest and profit, the respective figures being 49.8 per cent', and 50.2 per cent. Only after the .basic wage was increased- a couple of years ago did salaries and wages begin to show a greater percentage than profit and interest. In 1937-38 the figures- were 52- per cent., and 4S-. per cent., and in 1933-^9 they were 52.4 per cent and 47.6 per cent. We who speak for the workers of this country can prove that in 1938-39 they received' 3 per cent. less of the total value of production than they, received in 1924-25, and that interest and profit -accounted for 3 per cent, more, with the result that there lias been an accumulation of big incomes on one- side of the river and' slums and poverty on the other side. This Government will do nothing to secure a more equitable distribution of the wealth of the community, without which there cannot be a healthy social life. </para>

I remind the -House that the ill effects of deflation,, as of inflation; are cumulative ; both deflation, and inflation can be equally disastrous to the community. </para>

                <para>I have said that this Government has done nothing to. implement a scheme of family allowances, child endowment, and marriage loans. I have . instanced the conditions' under which the great mass .of the people are sinking, because they do not receive their rightful share from the general well of production, and are therefore not able to provide for those who are dependent on them. There is in New South Wales a system of child endowment which was introduced by a Labour government and has been in operation since 1927. There is another scheme of child endowment or family allowance in the federal public service. One scheme has definite geographical limits, but embraces the whole of the community, whilst the other is- limited to one section of the community but extends throughout the length and breadth of Australia. There is no reason for failure to put into operation- a scheme embracing  the whole- community. A perusal of the figures of the- Commonwealth Statistician; based on' the 1933 "census, has shown me that, as the result of the' operation of child endowment,' New South Wales is in a better position to- meet the future heeds of the nation than is the State from which I come, which has no such scheme and is not so progressively minded as New South Wales, Queensland, and some of the other States, and has yet a good deal . tÃ© learn* in that connexion. According. to the- figures, of the Commonwealth Statistician, New South Wales compares' very faVorably with Victoria hi respect, of' the .'percentage of young people, .' ranging" between "the ages of i week and "14" years, to the total population," -the. respective figures being 29.1 per "cent'.! and ' 23.'.9' per cent. Therefore','." the", birth rate has been assisted in New South' Wales by child endowment, because it has enabled parents to make provision for; their children and has encouraged married couples to follow the divine ' and natural laws and do their duty to their country by having healthy. - families .who -will be the future defenders df 'this country ' against any act of - foreign aggression. Child endowment can be 'defended on many grounds." It is - a" means of assisting parents to rear families, and it makes provision for: the defence of the nation against "future " attack.' The Right Honorable- R.  G. Casey, introducing, into this : Parliament ' a bill" to establish  national insurance, recited -a dismal tale in respect of the future of this country. He .'said that, .according to figures that had been .supplied to him by the . Commonwealth. Statistician : and by actuaries, who had .worked, upon them, -. the. population of . Australia would become .stationary by 1955, and. by 1970- would .have begun to decline. . That ki'nd-of dirge was preached in anticipation pf the- death of the white race in the. Pacific area. Although we ;are but 150 years old as a nation, (apparently we. are slowly- bleeding to death, and' within -a 200-year period, this outpost of -white civilization in the' Pacific will- have -almost entirely disappeared. Yet this Government',' which is -acquainted - with the facts, neither does nor suggests anything, but resists every attempt that we make on humanitarian and national grounds to establish a scheme of child endowment or family allowance, because under such a scheme those of their friends who benefited from the work of the community would have to pay. The Government is neither courageous nor wise enough to 'take time by the forelock and do what should be done. It would appear that only one honorable gentleman opposite has' interested himself in this problem; he is the septuagenarian Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes).</inline> He is the only one who has told this country that it must either populate or perish. We may learn something from our enemies in this connexion. In fact, we shall be foolish if we do not learn from them- anything worth while that they can teach us. A good deal of attention has been given in .Europe to, the encouragement of family life and the increase of the birth-rate. Family allowances were introduced by private enterprise in certain .European countries in the nineties of the last century. Strangely enough, the practice was adopted almost simultaneously in countries with such divergent policies as Germany and France, and it proved to be successful in serving the ends for which it was designed. It was only a very few years ago, however, that the Governments of" Germany, Italy, France and Russia tackled the problem in a 'statesmanlike way, and commenced to do what was required to be done in the interests of their women and- children. </para>
                <para>It was my fortune three years ago to he associated with a select committee of the Legislative Assembly of Victoria on child endowment. A questionnaire submitted in 1938 to the Consuls of various nations during the investigation that was made by that committee resulted in the gathering of some most interesting information. Professor A. Lodewyckz, of the University of Melbourne, also furnished information to the committee through an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Economic Record</inline> which indicated some important trends. He pointed out that one of the chief preoccupations of National-Socialist Germany  wa3  population. The decline of the German birth-ra-te-from- the beginning of  this century until 1933 had been catastrophic. Professor Lodewyckz made the following observations on the subject:- </para>

                <para>It will be seen that about 300,000 more children arc born in Germany to-day than during the last few years before the National Socialist party took over the reins of government. So that, assuming that the figures for 1 938 are about the same as those for1936 and 1937, during the five years 1934-38 German mothers have given the Fatherland 1,500,000 more children than would have been the case if conditions as prevailed before 1933 had continued. </para>
                <para>The record of Australia in relation to the birth-rate is such as to demand serious consideration. Our birth-rate fell from 4.3 per 1,000 of the population in 1862 to 1.7 per 1,000 in 1937. The effect can be expressed in another way: In 1911, when Australia had a population of roughly 4,500,000, more children were born than in 1938, when our population was approaching 7,000,000. This problem cannot be ignored, and we cannot procrastinate in. dealing with it: if.' we wish to continue to progress as a white nation. Several State governments and. I am glad to say, also- some municipalities, have done something to cope with the position. As the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Coles)</inline> well knows, the Melbourne City Council has done a great deal of good work in this connexion, although only 10 of its 33 members belong to the Labour party. The council has improved the conditions of mothers and children by establishing a number of public health centres and kindergartens throughout the areas under its control.I am sure that what has already been accomplished in this regard will be an inspiration to the council to do more in the future. With the help of the Commonwealth Government, the council has established a. child welfare centre in my constituency of Melbourne, and good results have been achieved by it. It is also subsidizing many denominational kindergartens. But a great deal more must bo done in this way if the nation is to prosper. Surely it is not too much to ask that steps should be taken to do for Australian women and children at least as much as was being done before the war for the German women and children-. [ <inline font-style="italic">Leave to continue given.]</inline> I thank honorable members for their courtesy. </para>
                <para>Family endowment allowances need to be supplemented'. I favour, as a complementary measure, the granting of marriage loans. The young people of this country cannot marry at as early an age as is desirable from a national point of view unless they be granted some financial assistance. In 1939 action was taken in France to give financial aid to young married people, but, unfortunately for that country, it was too late to be of much value. Long before the outbreak of war schemes had been put into operation in Germany and Italy to assist newly married couples. Arrangements were made in . those countries for interest-free loans of from Â£100 to Â£200 to be made to young married couples. It was provided that 25 per cent, of the. loan should be cancelled if, in the first year of its currency, a child was born. The remainder of the loan was canelled progressively as additional children were born, and it was completely liquidated by the time the fourth child was born. No such government scheme is in. operation in Great Britain, but. the employers of that country have done a little better in this regard than the employers of Australia have done, for in certain areas around London, and in other parts of England, private schemes provide for the payment of allowances varying from 5s. to1s. a week in respect of dependent children. In one case Â£10 per annum is paid as a child allowance. Apparently the employers of Australia have not been sufficiently educated on this subject to  take any such 'action: At any rate they have not' been sufficiently patriotic to realize that their ' failure to disburse- a certain amount! of money in child allowances must, in the long run, act adversely in respect of both themselves and their "children. </para>
                <para>I consider.it proper to chide the Government on its failure to. allow the maternity allowance, colloquially known as the " baby bonus '', to be paid in all cases. The allowance is payable to-day only in respect of .births in families where the income does not exceed Â£4 a week, That limitation is a negation of the intention that led to the introduction of this legislation. The Fisher Labour Government, which introduced .the maternity allowance, intended that it should have general application, .but owing to the crass stupidity of certain persons in influential circles at that time the scheme was attacked as " a sop to profligacy ". It was also condemned by other unfortunate epithets, and denounced as a measure which would result in the breaking of the marriage tie. As a matter of historical fact, the maternity allowance is known to have been of very great assistance to the mothers of this community from the very inception of the scheme, and it is regrettable that a government which saw fit to make substantial remissions of land tax should have revised the conditions applicable to the maternity allowance in such a way as to make it appear to be a charity and not a right. The mothers of this country are entitled to the maternity allowance, even more than the judges on our High Court bench are entitled to their pensions. A judge should be able to accumulate during a long life at least enough wealth to enable him to spend his declining years in case. It cannot be suggested that he would need a retiring pension as much as a mother may need an allowance at the time her children are born. </para>

I do not see. any indication in the budget, nor was any statement made in the Prime Minister's policy speech, that the Government intended to call upon large land-holders to bear their fair share of the burden of financing the war, I remind honorable members that under the system of graduated land tax formerly in operation, two-thirds of the impost fell upon the owners of. big city properties, for the tax was levied only, on holdings of an unimproved capital value in excess of Â£5,000. The farming community contributed only a small proportion of the tax, for only farmers with properties of an unimproved capital value in excess of Â£5,000, and on which improvements to the value of from Â£2,000 to Â£3,000 had been made were liable! <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Winston</inline> Churchill has very definite views on the subject of land monopoly, and he is reported to have said - </para>

            <quote>Land monopoly is not the only monopoly which exists, but it is by far the greatest of monopolies - it is a perpetual monopoly, and is the mother of all other forms of monopoly. Land, which is a necessity of human existence, which is the original source of all wealth, which is strictly limited in extent, which is fixed in geographical position - land, I say, differs from all other forms of property in these primary and fundamental "conditions.  The landlord watches the busy population making the city larger, richer, more convenient, more famous every day, and all the while sits still and does nothing. Roads are made, streets are made, railway services are improved, electric light turns night into day, electric trams glide swiftly to and fro, water is brought from reservoirs a hundred miles off in the mountains - and all the while the landlord sits still. Every one of these improvements iseffected by thelabour and cost of other people. Many of the most important are effected at the cost of the municipality and of the ratepayers. To not one of those improvements docs the land monopolist, as a land monopolist, contribute, and yet by every one of them the value of his land issensibly enhanced. </quote>
            <para>But the Commonwealth Government does not appear to consider it necessary to call upon the owners of valuable city properties to contribute towards the cost of conducting the war. It chooses rather to increase the rate of sales tax and also the rate of income tax on people with small incomes, and in this way to impose a very much heavier burden upon those in the community who are rearing families. If the bombs of the enemy ever fall on this country, the fifth columnists will not be found in the ranks of the Labour party.

We are all agreed on that, but we on this side join issue with the Government on the method of financing the war. The Government still holds to the old orthodox methods, to the antiquated, outmoded and ineffective financial system, whereas we believe that the costs of the war should be funded on credit monetized through the Commonwealth Bank when that bank is restored to what it was when first' brought into being at the instance of the great O'Malley. It may be said that this cannot be done, but I say that it can be done and that eventually it shall be done.In the prospectus of the newly formed Bank of England in 1694 this statement was made - </para></talk.start><quote><para>This bank shall have profit or interest on moneys which it shall invent out of nothing. </para></quote><para class="block">The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> a few days ago said, " You cannot get rabbits out of a hat", but whether you can or not the fact remains that financiers to-day get " dragon's teeth " out of ledgers.

I venture to say that had it been possible to take a referendum eighteen months ago not more than 1.5 per cent, of the people of Europe would have voted for this cursed thing called war; 98.5 per cent, would have turned it down. But, because 1.5 per cent, wanted war, we </para><para class="block">Lave war. Why? Because they wanted to profiteer on the lives of the people.

I commend to the attention of honorable members clause 504 of the . report of the Monetary and Banking Commission, which says that the  Commonwealth  Bank can supply credit without, interns*. We must fight this war with  Hitler's  own methods. He does not go cap in hand to borrow Â£2S,000,000 - or even Â£38,000,000 or Â£4S,000,000. He takes what he needs, and we shall have to do the same, through the Commonwealth Bank. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> Miller who financed the last war - the war to make the world safe for democracy - provided Â£320,000.000 through the Commonwealth Bank and after the war said that he could find another Â£320,000,000 for the arts of peace if it were necessary. </para><para>I do not subscribe to the proposal for the formation of a national government. It sounds well to say, " Form a national government to win the war ", and it looks all right, but let us examine it analytically. In my opinion the proposal for the formation of a national government would be nothing more than a trick whereby the Government parties would implement their policy and have the Labour party take the responsibility. The Labour party cannot join with the Government parties. Our party and theirs are as opposite as the poles. The Labour party is intensely constructive; the Government parties are not. The Labour party is dynamic and the Government static. Labour is progressive and the Government stagnant. The Labour party sets out to give a fair deal and equal opportunity to all, but the Government parties stand for the privileged class. The two cannot join. The Labour party believes that there is no wealth but human life, and the Government that a certain privileged class has the right to profiteer. That class is still profiteering and, in case I should be charged with exaggeration, I point out that on the 31st January this year, less than five months after the declaration of war, there were 107 additional millionaires in England. No wonder the people there changed their Prime Minister. Now, I do not want to say any- 1/;-. <inline font-style="italic">Baker.</inline> thing about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain.</inline> It would be out of place to do so. <inline font-style="italic">De</inline><inline font-style="italic">mortuis</inline><inline font-style="italic">nil nisi</inline><inline font-style="italic">bonum.</inline> Say nothing but good of the dead. He did his best, but he was a victim of circumstance. Well, . they changed their Prime Minister to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Churchill</inline> and members of the. Labour party were brought into the cabinet and given carte blanche. They are doing remarkably well in winning the war, but we of the Australian Labour party cannot form a union -with the parties opposite. You cannot amalgamate two incompatibles,  or reconcile two elements which are irreconcilable, and the Labour party cannot join with the Government parties to form a national government. </para><para>The Government is a conglomerate consisting of the United Australia party and the United Country party. I suggest that they be called the benighted party - a doubly benighted party. I shall give to the House something appropriate to the occasion. The honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> in his letter of resignation from the Country party, said that there were within that party everlasting- intrigue and manoeuvring for party advantage. If that be so, hew could we of the Labour party go in with a lot like that? It would be like trying to mix oil and water. </para><para>We are strongly opposed to petrol rationing, because, to' save  the  small amount of Â£4,000,000, we Jose something like Â£40,000,000.

I am fully in accord with the sentiment expressed by the mover of the Address-in-Reply, the honorable., member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beck)</inline> that we are here to get on with the joh, and the budget is, I should say, the -job that we have to do. <inline font-style="italic">For some</inline> reason, of which we on this side have a fair idea, the Government doe3 not now seem to be so anxious to go ahead with the budget as it wa3 before.- As we are not getting on with the job, it is an appropriate time for the House to consider something in the way of constitutional reform, particularly reform of the procedure of this House in order to  make it more workable. The best way to do that is to ensure that members on the Government side have a job to do. Judging by the debates and question time, all the activity seems' to be on this "side and all the apathy on the other.' Perhaps that is right, because the Government parties represent people of wealth whereas werepresent those people who have wrongs to be righted. Perhaps we might take advantage of the array of legal talent now in the House to achieve something in the way of constitutional reform. I remind honorable members that we have with us the honorable member for Barton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Evatt),</inline> who made a notable sacrifice by stepping down from a lucrative position on the High Court Bench in order to serve his country in this House. I hope that an early opportunity will be taken to utilize his services. One way in which that could be done would be by setting up a committee to deal with constitutional reform, with the idea of making Parliament more workable. Let us follow the example of legislatures in other parts of the world, particularly in the United States of America and New Zealand, where every member of the rank and file participates in the administrative, as well as the legislative, work of parliament. In the,e countries, private members assist the Ministers in their administrative duties. We should adopt more extensively the committee system, particularly for the handling of regulations issued under the National Security Act. At the present time, these regulations are turned out like sausages from a machine, and by the time they come under the notice of honorable members it is too late to do anything about them. They should go before a committee for consideration before they become law. </para></talk.start><para>I also maintain that the plank of the Labour party's platform, which provides for the recall should be adopted, so that every member of the House would be at all times subject to the will of the people.  Then,  if. a member were not doing his job, he could be immediately recalled. Those members who did their job properly could be given a longer term of office, and in this way we might avoid recurring and expensive general elections. </para><para>I hope that the Minister for' the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Foll)</inline> will honour his undertaking to amend the Electoral Act in respect of election expenses. The Minister stated that the act, as at present framed, is farcical and hypocritical, in that it requires members of Parliament to make a palpably false declaration regarding their election expenses. This applies particularly to some honorable members on the other side of the House, who incur tremendous expense in paying for huge advertisements, and the erection of great electioneering hoardings. Obviously, their expenses run into thousands of pounds, instead of the amount of Â£100 which is the statutory limit. In these matters we should seek to set a higher standard. We should, in fact, set an example to the rest of the community. </para><para>The budget which has just been introduced is the most calamitous, deflationary and destructive budget ever brought before Parliament. The Speech of the Governor-General, and now the budget, indicate clearly the Government's state of mind, which is purely negative. There is nothing constructive or creative about the Government's programme; it is entirely lacking in vision and inspiration. It is the expression of capitalistic economy and orthodox finance. The taxation proposals are directed against the low wage-earner and the small proprietary companies, but monopolistic concerns, the holders of unearned increment in land, the owners of watered stocks, and those in receipt of inheritances, are left practically untouched. That shows just where the Government stands. The scheme will break down under its own weight, and under the huge weight of debt. The purchasing power of the people will vanish. The national debt is at present Â£1,300,000.000; before the war is finished, if the Government continues its present loan policy, the national debt will be Â£3,000,000,000'. Half the national income is absorbed in defraying, the cost of the present Avar, and of the last Avar; if we continue on the present lines', soon the whole of our national income will be absorbed for Avar purposes..  Then  the people -will bo aroused,  and  some better financial system  will  take the place of that now in operation. Sooner or later ,the Government will be forced to use the credit resources of the nation, both in war-time and in peace. The old order of capitalist economy is doomed. Even now its supporters are like the Christmas poultry, which, know subconsciously that their fate is sealed, and live in dread of the fatal day. The attitude of the proponents of orthodox finance reminds me of the attitude of the orthodox members of tin, medical profession who, more than 200 years ago,, denounced <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Harvey</inline> for asserting that the blood circulated throughout the body. He was universally condemned, and died in poverty, yat within  twenty years of his death his discovery wa.s accepted by every one. I believe that what is now propounded by some of our more advanced economists, and by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Darcey</inline> will,  before long, he the generally accepted economic system in all enlightened countries. The honorable member for Denison said that the people of New South Wales must have taken leave of their senses to vote as they did in the recent election. He reminds me of the man m the lunatic asylum who thought that every one else  was  as crazy as himself, and invited them all to come inside. When the honorable member has been here a little longer, and has thought a little move on this subject, he W111 realize that true sanity is to be found on this side of the House. </para><para>The Government's attitude towards the </para><para class="block">Avar is also negative. All the time Ave seem to be waiting for some one else to move. We are  waiting  to see what Germany Will do,  what  Italy will do, and what Japan will do- I maintain that it is for us to take the initiative, and to plan a campaign that  Will  bring victory to us. The Government seems to expect that the war will be over in- a year or two&gt; <inline font-style="italic">Tout</inline> how can it be sure of that? The <inline font-style="italic">Go-</inline> vernment  does not appear to visualize the possibility that the Avar may go on for a much longer period. We know that fifteen years was occupied in ridding Europe of Napoleon, and we should recognize that it may take as long to clean up the mess that Hitler has made. And Ave have to deal, not only with Hitler, hut also with the whole philosophy for which he stands, and the system  which  supports him. wl th its tentacles spread throughout the world. </para><para>We should, even at this stage, define our peace aims. Mention has been made of the fact that in Great Britain member.? of the Labour party participate in the Government. That fact was considered by the Labour party here when proposals were put forward for a national government. I point out, however that a divergence of opinion has arisen in Great Britain recently. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ernest</inline> Bevin, Minister for Labour in the British Government, has emphasized the need to plan for peace. He said that our purpose should be to achieve social security, but immediately he made that statement others, who are politically opposed to him, took him to task. They made it clear that his opinion was  not to be taken as the opinion of the War Cabinet, and that it was not desirable to talk about peace, and the conditions that would! follow the attainment of peace, until Britain looked like  winning  the Avar. I disagree entirely with that. Now is the time to define our Avar aims, to give the people a lead, to give them inspiration, and to give them something to fight for. Let me quote the advice given by the Government's own guest, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Noel</inline></para><para>Coward, who, I understand, has come here at the Commonwealth's expense to teach us about winning the war. In a recent broadcast, he said - </para><para>The hour has struck for a co-operative human civilization.

Mr; Coward went on - </para><para>We have two aims - to win the Avar, and to win the after-war. I am certain that" this war is not to be won by force alone. It is to be won by belief in a Christian and- democratic way of life, and by courage - not ordinary courage, but moral courage, am i personal initiative to use it. </para><para class="block">Perhaps it would have been better if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coward,</inline> instead of lecturing the people of Australia, had lectured the Government of Australia on its duties. We should not leave this problem to others to solve. Only recently, the secretary of the Local Government Association of New South Wales said- </para><quote><para>Wc are visualizing Australia as a great nation after the war, and we believe that to prepare for it now is as essential as the immediate task of winning the war. </para></quote><para class="block">We should not leave matters of this kind to the local bodies; they should be taken up by the Government itself. The Prime Minister has pointed out that there are. some difficulties in the way of Australia's acceptance of representation on an Imperial War Cabinet, but I see no obstacle in the way of the Commonwealth's participation in an Imperial War Conference representative of all sections of the 'British Commonwealth of Nations convened to lay down definite plans for the conduct of the war and the terms and ideals of the peace. Such a conference might properly be held in Canada which may be regarded for the time being as the centre of the Empire. India, which is playing its part so well in the Empire war effort and, for obvious reasons, Eire, should be invited to send representatives to such a conference. I go further and suggest that the United States of America should be invited to send a representative in the capacity of an observer. To such a conference it may be possible for each of the Dominions to send representatives, not only of the Government, but also of the Opposition. </para><para>Australia might very well follow the lead given by Canada in regard to aviation.

Tho first line of defence in any country is a virile and healthy population. The Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> has often said that the best immigrant to this country is a young Australian. What has the Government done to provide subsidies for mothers as an encouragement to parenthood? The totalitarian countries, realizing the need for encouraging the natural growth of the population, have subsidized motherhood. No matter how much we may disagree with them in most things, we have to admire their attempts to provide for mothers and young children. Only a few days ago I read in the press that of 112,000 children still in London, 92,000 are without any form of education. It was said that more than 100 schools have been bombed, and that many of these children .have been described, as London's " dead end kids ". They are being bred into strange and dangerous ways of life in the new underworld beneath London's streets. They do not go to school, but during the day they watch like gangsters over their families' shelter pitches. Their only playgrounds are the escalators and platforms of tube stations and the clingy corners and holes of ordinary shelters below the streets. Surely provision should have been made in the budget to 'bring as many as possible of these children, to this country. We know of the dangers o  of steamer travel during these anxious. days, but the alternative to offering them shelter in the Dominions is to allow them to continue a perilous existence which will inevitably result in their ruin. These children might very well become the young Australians of the future. The United States of America might be asked to assist in their transport to this country. Even Hitler himself, bloodthirsty though he i3, might be willing to allow the children to come here unmolested. We should also offer shelter to the unfortunate children in occupied Prance, Belgium and the Netherlands, who are still subjected to the horrors and dangers of war. The unfortunate children of these countries look to- Australia as a haven of refuge. Under the benign influence of our glorious sunshine they would quickly be restored to health and happiness. </para><para>No reference was made in the Governor-General's Speech to a national health and pensions scheme. I had a great deal of admiration for the attitude taken by the present Prime Minister when, as a. member of the Lyons Ministry, he resigned his Cabinet post because of the failure- of the Lyons Government to give effect to its promise to introduce a national insurance scheme. The right honorable gentleman is now at the helm of the ship of State and is in a position to give effect to his pledge to bring about such a scheme-. But what do we find? In spite of the- fact t-hast the machinery for the carrying out, of a health Baja pensions scheme is already in existence,, not one word is said about it by the present Government. When the experts advising the Lyons Government pointed out that to give effect to the scheme it proposed would require an expenditure of Â£2,000,000, they were told that" the Government had not the money to go ahead with- it. Although that Government could not find Â£2;000,000 for the health of the people, in a year or two- its successor in office committed this country to an expenditure of Â£400,000,000 for war purposes. The standard of health of the people of any country is the measure of its real wealth. In planning for the future we have to bear in mind what happened after the last war. The loss of life in that great conflict was greatly exceeded by the loss of life as the result of the epidemics of pneumonic influenza, which raged in -many countries soon after the war was over. The Government should subsidize the medical profession, to instruct the people in better ways of living and in improving their diet. The Estimates this year provide Â£20-,000 for a physical fitness campaign. Thai is a mere bagatelle. According to experts, Australia requires an expenditure of Â£20,000,000 a year for the provision of homes for the people and for slum clearance. The whole of that money could be provided by the Commonwealth Bank at a very low rate of interest. According to the London <inline font-style="italic">Economist,</inline> it "costs only one-half of 1 per cent, for the book-keeping and clerical work associated with the provision of credits, and if the Commonwealth Bank charged* 1 per cent, on advances for housing it  could  make 100 per cent, profit on- the deal. But people who want; homes are prepared to pay a much, higher rate of interest for home building. In New South Wales to-day people pay as much as o or 6 per cent, on advances for home building. The profit of from 4' to 4^ per cent, which the Commonwealth Bank . could make on advances for home building could be utilized for the development of tourist resorts, of which there is such a diversity in this country and these could be thrown open to the people to enable a healthy, sturdy race to be built up in Australia. </para><para>In merely proposing to set- up costly industrial tribunals the Government shows- no initiative in its industrial policy.

There appears to be a failure to understand that the munition workers .of Australia in a total war arc just as important as the soldiers.  They  are the "civilian fighters" in our war effort. Not for one instant would the public have tolerated the housing of our soldiers in the various camps under such appalling conditions as  you  disclose. Yet these mcn and women of Lithgow are performing a function not one whit less important than the soldiers. Just as wars are won on the battlefront, so they are lost on the home front by the failure to produce adequate munitions, the discontent of the people, and the loss of morale in the nation. lt would be interesting to know whether- any recommendations have been made to the 'Commonwealth Government in the past, few months to meet this' situation, and if such recommendations have- been made why they have not been implemented.

That is due, no doubt, to the fact that anti-Labour governments have been in office for most of the last quarter of a century.  When a Labour government held office for a short time the country made great strides under the stimulus of good industrial legislation. To-day, legislation in Venezuela provides that all persons in public and private employment, with the exception of a few categories, shall be granted one day's holiday pay for every month of employment. In Chile, most manual workers enjoy up to sixteen days annual leave on full pay according to the time they have worked during the year. Similar privileges exist in Finland, Latvia and Peru. But in New .South Wales, only 239 of approximately 500 awards include holiday provisions. The Government shouldgo right to the cause of these industrial troubles in order to find a solution of the problem. On the one hand, hig profits are being made; on the other, an exhausted working class is suffering because of the absence of proper industrial legislation. Those elements are likely to cause trouble at any time, but they are much more menacing in time of war. There is only one effective way to overcome the difficulties I have outlined. That is to give to the workers a voice in the control of industry and a share in its profits. When big munitions contracts are banded over to private enterprise, the workers who are carrying on in those industries should share in their profits. The Government has the power under the National Security Regulations to provide that workers' in each industry engaged in munitions production shall have the right to elect their own representatives to the boards of directors of the companies concerned. Co-operation in industry and other avenues of life is essential in a soundlybased democracy. Co-operative farming is a subject I commend to the earnest consideration of members of the Country party. Instead of asking for subsidies for primary industries those honorable gentlemen should investigate the cooperative farming schemes that are being conducted successfully in other parts of the world, particularly in the Scandinavian countries. A solution for the problems of primary production can be found in those schemes. </para><para>I urge the Government to take immediate action to improve housing conditions, because the need for reform is pressing. I direct attention to the first report of the Housing Investigation and Slum Abolition Board of Victoria on the conditions that exist in certain Victorian cities. That report was on similar lines to the report made by the Housing Board of New South Wales, which stated that in the metropolitan area of Sydney alone there were 30,000 sub-standard houses not even fit for animals to live in, much less human beings.

Land has been so avariciously used in some instances that two or three houses have been erected on an area which was originally intended to be the back yard of a house facing a major street .... In addition, the rents of these so-called houses are being progressively increased to such an extent that many families, in order to pay the rents demanded, have been reduced to a state of semi-starvation. In some slum areas children are fed by church organizations while charitable institutions are called upon to supply family necessities where the income of the family is insufficient to procure them. Failure to pay the rent inevitably ends in eviction of the family and the consequent heartbreaking struggle to find another shelter .... Hidden behind wide spacious streets there are slum pockets which are hot-beds of depravity and disease. In many houses, dilapidation of structure is such that bugs and other vermin cannot be eradicated. These houses are infected to such an extent as to be unfit forhuman habitation. The ravages of vermin on the occupants cause indescribable physical discomfort and distress, particularly to infants and little children. Many prefer to sleep out of doors, on verandah floors, and in backyards rather than endure the distressing torment of vermin in the house. The rat menace is also prevalent in all of the congested areas, particularly where factories and' stables have been established in the vicinity of houses. Residents complain that they are unable to combat this nuisance, which is being aggravated by insanitary conditions in the vicinity. Lack of facilities for food storage in these low-grade houses exposes food to constant contamination by rats. Housewives are driven to storing  food-stuffs  in well-secured bags suspended from ceilings in kitchens and wash-houses. Many men, a largo number of whom arc returned soldiers, have expressed very forcibly the resentment and indignation they feel at being housed in such, miserable  hovels.  The burden falls most heavily on those least able to bear it. The women, who are unable to escape from their sordid surroundings despite their intense and heroic struggle to maintain a state of cleanliness, and the children, suffer most. These unwholesome conditions sap the physical fitness of the children and develop their .mental processes along lines of abnormal  quickwittedness  in the lowest ideals. In these areas there are thousands of children who are condemned by the circumstances of their environment to worse than physical death - to slowwarping influences of poverty, to filthy conditions, and to other evils and dangers which it is easier to imagine than enumerate . . . </para></quote><para class="block">The board very appropriately concluded its report with this comment - </para><quote><para class="block">A Christian system cannot be reconciled  with  a society that continues to tolerate these appalling conditions. </para></quote></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>217</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KSD</name.id><electorate>Wannon</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">MCLEOD, Donald</name><name role="display">Mr McLEOD</name></talker><para>.- My presence in this chamber is an indication of the awakening of wheat-growers to the fact that the Labour party's policy is designed to help them. I trust that I shall be able to do something to alleviate their condition. I know all about the business of wheat-farming, for in my earlier days I was a farm labourer, and since then I have had a good deal of practical experience as the holder of .a closer settlement block. There was a time when I thought that the " boss " was a capitalist. Unfortunately, he thought so too ; but now I know that he was working for the international financiers. </para></talk.start><para>I desire to bring under the notice of the House the appalling conditions which exist in the wheat belt of Victoria, particularly in the northern part of my electorate. A recent issue of the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Ago</inline> contained the following : - </para><quote><para>Farmers have become so involved financially that many are unable to pay their municipal rates. The shire council, however, was obliged to send out final notices threatening legal proceedings. At the meeting of the council yesterday sixty letters were received from farmers stating that they could not meet the rates. Of these the following was a typical example: - "Every previous year I have paid my rates when due, but this year I am not in a position to pay them; in other words, I am 'broke'. Would you be considerate enough to hold them over until next year, or at least until after next harvest - that is if there is any - when I will do my best to meet them. I would appreciate this ' consideration, but if  you  cannot meet me with this request, all I  can  say is go ahead and take whatever legal pro.ceedings which may lie in your power, because all the legal proceedings in the world cannot make nic pay if I have not got it. If gaol is the only option, I am afraid that is what it will  have  to be ". </para></quote><para class="block">That indeed expresses the general conditions of these men.. The farmer and the business man are beginning to realize that they are dependent, on each other. These workers are coming closer together, and the recent election results show that, they look to Labour for an alleviation of their circumstances. They know now that the Labour party has a policy which will help them. In lie past the policy has been misrepresented, with the result that the farmers have been misled into placing their trust in governments which  have  not kept, their promises. In this connexion, supporters of the Country party are most blameworthy, because representatives of that party have made promises on the hustings, only to abandon the farmers later.  In 1934 the farmers were told that a Labour government would rob them of their savings, lt. is true that their savings had been taken from them, not by the Labour party, but by financiers who have charged them high rates of interest. High interest rates are the biggest burden that the farmer has to bear. No bells will ring throughout the Wimmera when the farmers there learn that an advance of 3d. a bushel is to be made on the wheat grown last year. Wheat is an asset to any country which possesses it. Australia should be glad that it has stocks of wheat on hand; many other countries would like to have them. Honorable members may think that it is an exaggeration to say that Australia may suffer from a shortage of wheat, but I remind them that during the last war wheat was imported into this country. Any government consisting of practical men would have regard to the country's food reserves in a time -of- crisis, and keep two years' supply of wheat "on hand. It is possible for Australia to be blockaded and for aeroplanes to set fire to standing wheat crops. Although production has already been restricted by drought, the Government advises farmers" to restrict their output still further. That may be sound advice, but if the Government were to carry its logic further, it would advocate a reduction of interest rates. Why is interest regarded as sacred ? Tho granting of a moratorium has been, suggested, but that would  be merely a palliative  and not. a solution .of. this problem. A reduction of interest charges would. be equivalent to an increased price . for wheat. The Labour party's policy includes the establishment of a mortgage, branch of the Commonwealth Bank which would take over the mortgage of a farmer who was paying a high rate. of interest. To-day, .a farmer who goes to a private bank for an advance of only Â£20 or Â£50 does not get even a kind look.. The private banks should be told that as they have refused to make advances on wheat, which is a national asset, the nation will take over the . wheat of .the farmers and hold their land, as security. If that were done, the farmer need pay only 3 per cent, instead of 6 per. cent, interest. That would  be equivalent, to an additional 6d.. a .bushel to the farmer for his wheat. This, is no "wild cat" proposal. Adverse seasons have .forced many farmers to leave their holdings in the Horsham district. Business people can no longer give credit to the farmers, with the result that many of them are leaving for the cities. The concentration of war industries in the cities is not only dangerous because of the  possibility  of attack by an enemy; it is also having a serious effect on the development of country districts. The following letter from the Horsham Town Council emphasizes this point: - </para><quote><para>I am directed to inform von that at the last meeting of the council a resolution was passed  deploring  the fact that all the important war industries are being centralized in the capital cities. Apart from the fact that this action will spell disaster to country towns, we feel that it is not in the best interests of the national  effort.  One has only to consider what is happening in 'Europe to  realize  that it would be a comparatively easy matter for an enemy to bomb our principal war industries out of existence situated as they arc in a few towns only, all located on the coastline. </para><para>The drift of country people to the metropolis is alarming, and is so serious that unless checked it must ultimately end in a major disaster. </para><para>The council trusts that you will urge upon the Government the wisdom' of altering this state of affairs. </para></quote><para class="block">It should not be necessary for mc to direct the attention of the Government to this matter. The drift of large numbers of people from country districts to the cities is an economic loss to Australia as a whole. These men, who are as much skilled workers as are skilled tradesmen in our cities, are out of their proper element as residents of cities. Their skill is in agricultural pursuits. I fear that if considerable numbers of farmers be driven off their holdings there will be an aggregation of land in big estates. After the war, land values may rise because of a demand for land for the repatriation of soldiers. That may be the motive underlying the policy that is in operation to-day. Should this drift to the cities continue, it will constitute a major disaster. Far better to tackle this problem now than wait until too late! The only logical thing to do is to give assistance to the farmers now, through the Commonwealth Bank, in order that they may carry on. I sincerely trust that the mistakes in connexion with the repatriation of soldiers which were made after the last war will not be repeated when this war is over. It was the squatter who was repatriated. The  only  man who received a rough deal was the digger, and that experience is likely to be repeated unless, as I hope, a Labour administration be in office at the conclusion of the present war. Many persons have the idea that land settlement is a failure. I should like to disabuse their minds of that notion. Despite the losses on soldier settlement, to which attention has been directed in reports of the Auditor-General, many sons of farmers, as well as returned soldiers, will have to be settled on the land; but a balance will have to be struck between secondary and primary settlement, and a different basis will have to be adopted from that which now prevails. Up to a few years ago, nien were sent out into the Mallee, where they never had a chance, and the hearts of the young wives who accompanied them were broken;, there was no rainfall, roads had not been made, and the railway was miles distant from, their holdings. Yet, about 50 miles away, where I live,, some of the finest country in Victoria is carrying only a few bullocks, and it is well served by railways and bitumen roads, and., best of all, it has an assured rainfall. The gallant men and women who went into the Mallee country received no reward, but were starved out. The values of the good land are too high. That is the curse on Australia. Land values in this 'Country are higher than in any other country in the world. I am not advocating confiscation. I believe that every man should receive justice. Never in my life have I received anything for which I did not work, and I have been robbed of most of what I have earned. I maintain that what I create should be mine. The man who neither tills the soil nor shears, a sheep, who could not tell the difference between a comeback ewe and a shorthorn bull, reaps the bulk of the harvest, because hie holds the mortgages. Two years ago, I had to shear 900 of a total of 1,100 sheep before I shore one for myself, and the price of wool was 2d. per lb. below the cost of production. The farmer will never secure stability except through the medium of the Commonwealth Bank, and from a Labour government. Mortgages on land are a fruitful field of investment. On our wheat lands alone, they represent a. total of Â£150,000,000. That is why the cost of production is so high, and a loaf of bread is so dear. The mortgages on our wool lands total Â£170,000,000. I do not want stability at boom prices, -nor does any other farmer. Four years ago, I received for wool 26d. per lb. Two years later, I received only 15d. per "lb. for a better class of wool. We have to go out into the world and fight for a market for every commodity grown in Australia with the exception of wool, and even then sell at a loss. The growers have to he paid a bounty in order that the banks may receive their interest, and the revenue from which the bounty is paid is provided by the worker. Buyers from every nation are supposed to bid against each other for our wool, but they have a "ring" and will not do so. Sometimes we receive the cost of production, and at other times there is a very steep rise. With a stabilized price, I would be in a position to discharge my mortgage liability within 10 year3, and my neighbours would be in a similar position. The mortgage-owning industry is the greatest in the world. No man could dispute the moderateness of a stabilized price of 18d. per lb. The discharge of my mortgage would be as great a calamity to the money-lending industry as the death of the whole of my flock would be to me. Control is exercised through the medium of prices. The question may be asked: "Why is the price of wool allowed to rise; why not keep it at a low figure"? At an average price of 12Â£d. per lb., the return is <inline font-style="italic">l&amp;.</inline> per lb. over the cost of production. According to my understanding of the position, if the price of wool remained at too low a figure for too long a period, even this Government, which is the friend of the money lenders, who own not only the mortgages on our land., but also the bonds of Australia, would have to default or face collapse. Not many persons know that wool has the greatest effect on our internal economy, and that a rise of Id. per lb. represents in the aggregate between Â£3,000,000 and Â£4,000,000. An advance of from Gd. to 8d. per lb. would bring into this country' an additional Â£20,000,000, and when "that result had been achieved the price would begin to recede. When wool was at a high price, I made it my business to ascertain the statistical position. I thought that it was very scarce, but I found that that was not the case. When the price wa.3 very low I thought that there must be a surplus, but I found that, there was a shortage. Let us reverse the position. If Australia had to purchase wool from Italy or any other country, would our buyers be permitted to obtain supplies at a low price? They would not. But the Australian Government has allowed foreign representatives' to buy our wool at a low price. We are exporting wool in the grease to-day, even though shipping space is scarce. Wool will be the foundation of Australia's future prosperity. When I was overseas, I saw thousands of foreign nationals who obtained a  livelihood from Australian wool. -In many factories in manufacturing cities such as Lille, Roubaix, and Tourcoing, in northern France, thousands of persons are engaged in spinning Australian wool.. Foreign buyers are compelled to come, to Australia for this important commodity, which is one of our. greatest national assets. Unfortunately, we have not made enough of it . in. the past. We have even allowed ourselves to be robbed in respect of the prices paid for it. </para><para>At the conclusion of the war, we must be prepared ..to divert to peace-time occupations large numbers of men who are now employed in munitions factories or who have been fighting oversea, and land settlement will be one of the principal means of absorbing this manpower. In planning ahead in respect of land settlement, the Government must avoid the unfortunate mistakes that hav-j been made in the past. The greatest mistake was that State governments were intended to carry the financial burden, but the money lender was far too shrewd to advance capital to them. As the States did not possess rich sources of revenue such as customs and excise, the Commonwealth was obliged to guarantee bonds issued in respect of the purchase of land. In addition, intending settlers competed one against the other for the purchase of blocks at inflated values. That error also must be avoided. I suggest that the Commonwealth Bank should purchase the estates at a fair .valuation. From the amount paid in land .tax, a just value of the land may be ascertained. A block should then be allotted to a settler on a leasehold, basis, the title  remaining with the nation. By that means, the Government would stabilize land values and blocks would not be disposed of at exorbitant prices. Although some persons may complain that, even under such a scheme settlers will be competing with each other for the acquisition of blocks, such a view is erroneous, because no money lender will make advances on the security of a leasehold property. My plan will give to a genuine settler an excellent opportunity to become independent. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>220</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>BV8</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">CALWELL, Arthur</name><name role="display">Mr CALWELL</name></talker><para>-  The squatters .in Queensland do not like such a plan. </para></talk.start><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>220</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KSD</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">MCLEOD, Donald</name><name role="display">Mr McLEOD</name></talker><para>- The* squatters should not growl, because they made their money from leasehold property in Queensland.

They made it their life's ambition to own a little patch of land. To-day we know that it is not the ownership but the use of the land which is so important, because we are on earth for only a relatively short span. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Perhaps honorable members will be interested to hear me recount my experiences as a settler. They afford an excellent illustration of how futile is the expectation of the average settler some day to own his block. I had confidence in myself, in the land which I had selected, and in the scheme of settlement. It was the system that was wrong. When I pastured 420 sheep on an area embracing 1.200 acres, 100 of them died, and I nearly died with them. For fifteen years I was battered and bumped by misfortune. The honorable member for Ballarat (Air. Pollard), when he sat in the Parliament of Victoria, undoubtedly saved a num.l-.cr of us. Others became dispirited and broken-hearted, and drifted away from the land. For myself, I never like to give up once I have begun a job and f :&gt;r fifteen years I fought to live. Although I was earning money, and was improving the place, I never, because of the mortgage, saw a penny that I earned. The money  was always paid from the wool firm to the Closer Settlement Board. I had virtually to beg for food, as I had no money with which to purchase it. In truth, I had to fight for everything. </para><para>A rural rehabilitation plan was inaugurated in 1937, and I had an enlightening conversation with a valuer upon my financial position. He informed me that I had paid off the sum of Â£2,000. I retorted ; " I did not pay the money ; you took it." I had to laugh, when he told me that the principal had been reduced by Â£32. I cried, " Hurrah ! The property will be mine in 1,500 years ". The original value of the block was Â£3,300. When I returned from the war, I was practically penniless, but I liked the appearance of the land.  Although it was a wilderness, I was confident that  I  could convert it into a profitable farm. Only 100 years before <inline font-weight="bold">Major Mitchell</inline> had passed by the site and the land had belonged to nobody. Subsequently a generation of squatters possessed  it  and paid, probably, 10s. an acre for  it.  In those days,  it  carried bullocks and a few sheep, but the rabbitsmultiplied so rapidly that the land was fast deteriorating. As the next generation attained manhood, room had to be found for us, and the price of the land became Â£3 2s. 6d. an acre. Interest upon the capital outlay amounted to Â£180 a. year, although the land, as I stated, was a wilderness. It was utterly impossible for me to make a success of the venture. With those experiences so vivid in my mind, I emphasize that the Government must avoid a repetition of similar mistakes. . </para><para>Australians abhor dictatorships. Respect for our parliamentary institutions is inherent in us, because they protect our liberties. Even I, a settler, am entitled to seek election to this chamber, and I shall always boldly support that principle of freedom. Whilst  Australians have  no sympathy with dictatorships, there is, unfortunately, in the Commonwealth the dictatorship of finance. That must be abolished without delay. In the past, although we produced a surplus of wool, wheat, butter, and fruit, we could not feed our people and they went hungry because they had no money with which to purchase the necessaries of life. To-day, the Commonwealth is appealing for the services of young skilled men to manufacture munitions. Out  in  the bush, I have seen many fine types of lads who, because they were unable to find employment, have been forced to beg. for bread. They learned the rudiments of various trades from the technical schools. They are an asset to the country; they, not the money lender who denies them the right to live, to marry, and to raise a family, represent the real Australia. It is tragic to think that our social conditions are retrogressing, as young men dare not marry because they lack security of employment. For that reason, a Labour government is essential to the welfare and progress of the Commonwealth. </para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dedman)</inline> adjourned. </para></speech></para>

                        <para>.- I have on many occasions in this House pointed out that certain powers now possessed by the Government as the result of legislative action by this Parliament are being exercised for what I regard as political purposes. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>This morning I brought under notice again certain utterances of delegates to the Federal Conference of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia at Canberra last week, and  the  replies given by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> to my questions were quiteunsatisfactory.  The  right honorable gentleman endeavoured to dispose of the matter by some casual observations, but he was eventually obliged to agree that an inquiry should be made.  It  seems rather remarkable that whilst action has been taken against workers who quite legitimately criticize the Government, apparently no action is to be taken against individuals who expressed views that are evidently acceptable to the Government concerning the establishment of a dictatorship in this country. Why should the workers be gaoled for their justifiable remarks while these other persons are allowed to retain their liberty, although their remarks as reported are undoubtedly subversive? The reported remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. L.</inline> A. Robb, in particular, and also those of Messrs. Marshall and Sharland, were of such a nature as to be described by the Leader of the Opposition in the Parliament of New South Wales as " closely approaching treason ". Men who make observations of that kind should promptly be dealt with under the power which the Government undoubtedly possesses. </para>
                    <para>There  is  ample cause for complaint, also, concerning the manner in which the Government is administering the </para>
                    <para class="block">National Security Regulations in regard to internments. On a previous occasion, I asked whether certain persons who had been interned had  subsequently been released and later, following action by the officers of the Commonwealth Investigation Branch, had been returned to the internment camp because incriminating evidence had been found upon them. I requested that the papers "in relation to these cases should be made available for the perusal of honorable members. I wish to know the names of the persons who made representations to the Government for the release of these individuals. I have been informed that representations in respect of a certain case were "made by a one-time member of the Cabinet. Surely it is not unreasonable to ask that members of the Parliament should be afforded facilities to examine the papers in such cases as these. It could hardly be suggested that, by examining the papers, we would be doing something that might assist the enemy. I take it that the only reason for exercising of powers of censorship is to prevent the dissemination of information that might be helpful to the enemy. </para>
                    <para>The members of the Labour party believe that the censorship power is being used for political purposes. In support of this contention, I bring to the notice of honorable members the fact that although the Honorable Herman Homburg, member of the Legislative Council of South Australia, has been interned, all information on the matter has been censored. This person is not a member of the Labour party. He belongs to the Liberal-Country party, which is the South Australian equivalent of the United Australia party, He was at one time Attorney-General of South Australia.  His  half-brother, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fritz</inline> Homburg, was interned and released on appeal. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fritz</inline> Homburg'3 son-in-law, whose name is Klawinkle,  was also interned. He appealed, but although his appeal was dismissed, I am given to understand that he has been released. I wish to know who made representations on behalf of these people? This information is necessary in order to assist us to determine the degree to which political considerations are entering into the administration of certain important powers granted to the Government under national security legislation. </para>
                    <para>Why does the Government permit the censorship power to be exercised in such a way as to prevent the publication in the daily press of information on -these important public matters? It was never intended that the power should be exercised in this way. The individuals to whom I have specifically referred have no associations whatever with the Labour party. We are entitled to know whether " Fifth Columnists " are at work and so imperilling the safety of the country. There can be no justification for the use of the censorship power to prevent the  publication  in the press or by wireless of information on these subjects. Although Great Britain is so much closer to the scene of the conflict in Europe and is, in fact, embroiled in it in almost every imaginable way, information about the internment of prominent persons is not withheld from the press. Not long ago, Captain Ramsay, a member of the British House of Commons, was interned, but the information was not suppressed. It was, in fact, broadcast to the world. I can see no reason why the censorship power should be exercised in Australia to prevent the general public from learning what is happening. Why, for instance, should the public be denied the knowledge that a member of the South Australian Parliament had been interned? </para>
                    <para>The specific questions I am asking require clear answers. We wish to know who is responsible for the censorship of this information, and also what persons in the community have been endeavouring to secure the release of these internees. It may be assumed that persons are not interned unless there is some evidence against them. I believe that the Commonwealth Investigation Branch has, on many occasions, been  prevented,  by the political influences exerted by government supporters, from taking action which it desired to take. There is more than a suggestion of political colour attaching to the administration of a good many of our national security regulations. What has the Government to say on these various matters? I submit that there is no need  for the censorship of information concerning the internment of prominent persons or for declining to1 give the names of individuals who are apparently making representations, with some degree of success, for the release of certain internees. The Government cannot throw aside its responsibility in these matters. The Labour party, and also the people at large, wish to know who are the guilty parties in respect of these various matters. </para>

                        <para>.- I make a strong protest against the action of the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt)</inline> in resolutely refusing to invoke Commonwealth powers to intervene in the unfortunate industrial dispute at Port Kembla. I regret that the Minister has attempted to shelter behind the plea that the Commonwealth Government should- not interfere with the finding of a State court or with the actions of a State tribunal. In so serious a matter the Government must not stand on courtesy to any court. We have been told that the resources of Australia must be mobilized 100 per cent, in order to enable us to face dangers in the near future. It. has been said that, an enemy is practically at our door. Yet, at a time when prices are rising a State industrial court has reduced the wages of workers at Port Kembla by approximately 10s. a week. [Because of such hoplessly incompetent administration trouble is threatening throughout industry. Nevertheless, this Government sits by, refusing to take any action whatever to bring about a settlement of the dispute at Port Kembla, because it knows that when the matter is dealt with fairly the workers will be found to be right and the employers wrong. I protest most strongly against that attitude, particularly at .a time when the Government has just announced proposals for the prevention of industrial disputes, through the establishment of conciliation machinery which will enable justice to be done between the worker and his employer. I am sick and tired, of reading reminders in the press to the workers that there is a war on: The boss also must be reminded of that fact. To-day, however, the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited and other big concerns absolutely refuse to make public details of profits obtained through the watering of stock. The dispute at Port Kembla has arisen solely because the State Industrial Court has taken up the attitude that it will reduce wages in spite of the fact that prices of commodities are rising; and this Government refuses to do anything in the matter. It is about time that this Government declared emphatically that it will ensure that justice shall be meted out to the employee as well as to the employer, and that when the employer comes into court he shall be reminded as well as the worker that there is a war on. The Government should make it clear that when it asks the workers to give of their maximum effort in industry, it will demand an equal measure of service from the employers. I have read a report in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> that men in many industries are working 50 and 60 hours a week, and are doing so willingly in the national interest. In spite of those facts, this Government is not prepared to allow the men involved in the dispute at Port Kembla to invoke the machinery which it is setting up for the prevention of industrial disputes, simply on the plea that it would be discourteous on its part to go over the head of a State tribunal. </para>

                            <para>- The grievance of the men is' based on the fact that despite the issue of an award prescribing increased rates of pay, thereby postulating the necessity for such increases in a time of rising prices of commodities, the rates of pay of certain workers at Port Kembla have been reduced. How can any industrial tribunal, in a time of rising prices, increase the rates of pay of certain classes of workers and, at the same time, decrease the rates for other classes? Such inconsistency cannot be justified on any moral or economic grounds. The Minister for Labour and National Service said that the Government would not intervene in this dispute because it was not prepared to interfere with an award of a State court. All I can say is that if decisions of State courts threaten widespread disputes in  industry, this Government will be obliged to interfere with them. It has a responsibility in this matter. I say here, and  with the greatest regret, that this trouble threatens to extend very widely on the south coast. If the metal manufacturers or electrolytic companies should attempt to carry on with scab or free labour in the mines which are electrically equipped, it must obtain its current from the government power house at Port Kembla. If that be done the men will declare the latter works black, and thus the trouble will spread. Whilst this Government loudly proclaims that the resources of the country must be organized 100 per cent, in the prosecution of our war effort, it is prepared to allow to continue the present situation which has been created by a judge who does not really know anything about the industry. In these circumstances the men are being constantly harassed. If the Government sincerely wishes to maintain industrial peace in this country, it must make up its mind immediately that even-handed justice will be meted out as between employer and employee. By regulation, power has been given to the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited to prevent any of its employees from leaving their present positions in order to accept jobs elsewhere. I know of 20 or 30 men who are obliged for this reason to remain at Port Kembla, although they are given only three or four days' work a week. The company " compels them to stand by, although they  -could immediately secure full-time jobs, with overtime in many cases, in Sydney, if the company would give them a permit to leave Port Kembla. In war-time it may be necessary for the company to have these men standing by at Port Kembla, but if that he the case, the Government must face the . situation squarely and do the just thing by these men by seeing that they are paid a full week's wages. The men would then have no cause for complaint. However, under present conditions, the workers, not only at Port Kembla but also throughout the Commonwealth, are becoming restive; if justice ha not done by them a national industrial upheaval will take place. The Government proposes to appoint special tribunals which will be enabled to anticipate disputes, and thus prevent trouble from actually occurring. If the men know that the conciliation com- missioners to be appointed will be prepared to approach their grievances with an open mind, and have sufficient experience to appreciate the justice of their claims, they will co-operate fully in the maintenance of peace in industry. This Government will be guilty of a national crime if it continues to sit by twiddling its thumbs and refusing to do anything to prevent this trouble from extending in industry. It is time that the Commonwealth swept aside the old tribunals, and implemented machinery whereby disputes in industry could be dealt with expeditiously. The men must be assured that so soon as trouble threatens they can immediately place their claims before a tribunal. They are dissatisfied with the present hoary system of Commonwealth and State Arbitration Courts which take months to consider disputes. I know of no worker who is not prepared to give of his best in the national interest in order to prepare the defences of this country. This Government should emulate that spirit which has been exhibited by the workers throughout industry as a whole. Unless it does so industrial trouble will constantly recur. I appeal to it to send an official immediately to Port Kembla in order to investigate the grievances of the men. I guarantee that if the official be fair-minded, the trouble will be settled within 24 hours. As the representative of the men involved in the dispute, I give that guarantee unhesitatingly to the Government. On the other hand, I warn it that, if such a course be not followed, the trouble will spread. Greatly as I deplore the dispute, I must insist that the men are not responsible for it. The men feel that they have nobody to hear and settle their case on its merits. Because of that, this trouble exists to-day. </para>

                        <para>.- On the waterfront an injustice is being done to many men who have served shipowners for a great number of years. At Townsville, for example, there are men who, having worked on the wharves for 30 years, were refused the renewal of their licence when they applied in June. No reason whatever was given. Two of the men are over 50 years of age and are not capable of getting other employment. The Government cannot show that they are other than good Australians,  although they were not born here. As a matter of fact, they were born in Germany, and in the last war they experienced the same trouble through jocularly exclaiming "Hoch, the Kaiser". Now, they have said, just as you and I or any other person might say, in a joking way, " Heil Hitler". I have heard returned soldiers say that. There is nothing more against them than that, or, if there is, the department should say so. When I applied to the department for a further investigation of their case I got the stereotyped reply " The matter has received the fullest consideration, but it is regretted that no alteration can be made to the previous decision ". The same miserable excuse is always made about other things, naturalization for instance. The number of men among the working class engaged in subversive activities is small, but there are many men among the friends of the Government who should be in internment camps. There  is  not one black mark against, the character of these men who have been excluded from the wharves, and, therefore, from their means of livelihood. They have no police record and they have been good citizens for 30 years in one city. What has occurred in Townsville has also occurred in other ports. The treatment of these men is inhuman. </para>

                    <para>The honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> mentioned a case of a man in South Australia who was interned. I know men in Sydney who were interned allegedly because they were supporters of the Fascist regime in Italy and because they had incriminating documents in their possession when they were questioned. To-day those men are enjoying freedom. When those men were interned they did not know why and, having been interned, they do not know why they are now outside. If their internment was a mistake they should have been told so. One man whom I have known for five or six years was interned. Yet to-day he is at home with his family at Bondi. I do not object to that, but his people want to know why he was interned. It is not fair that they should be kept in the dark. If this Government wants peace and the workers to do the right thing, as they desire, it will treat them as men. </para>

There is no record of the quantities used respectively for the manufacture of fertilizers and for other purposes. It has been estimated recently, however, that a very large proportion of Australia's consumption of sulphur is used in the production of sulphuric acid, of which upwards of 90per cent, goes into the manufacture of fertilizers. prosecutions for profiteering. </para>

Tlie order to Japan represents 8 per cent, of orders placed with Australian manufacturers and are for moulded buttons for which Australian capacity is limited. The casein hutton is not suitable for all purposes and metal shortages create difficulties. It was necessary to get some Japanese buttons to keep clothing manufacturers supplied and produce finished goods in time. Button manufacturers are booked with orders for some months ahead. All known potential commercial button manufacturing capacity is used, but information on any other resources of any substance would be welcomed. </para>

The oil 'yield is only 27 gallons to the ton of shale with a high sulphur content, as compared with Newnes and Glen Davis shale,' which yields over 100 gallons of oil to the .ton, almost entirely free from sulphur content. </para>

Their work consists of setting down flares, and policing the water area prior to departure of the trans-Tasman flying boat at 4 a.m. Owing to transport difficulties, staff arrive at the Rose Bay Airport by the last tram and wait about until required for duty. The matter of providing a resting room for the staff is now under consideration and estimates are now being prepared. </para>

                        <para>n. - The honorable member for Griffith <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Conelan)</inline> asked me last Friday what steps could be taken to ensure that retailers would observe the price adjustments necessary on account of the budget. I may point out for the information of honorable members that price investigations are conducted as an ordinary routine matter by staffs of the  Deputy  Prices Commissioners in the States and Territories. Many complaints are received from the public, and these are thoroughly investigated, but apart from these, test checks initiated by the Commissioner and his deputies are made from time to time on selected commodities and the investigations cover all classes of traders from manufacturers to retailers. The investigation officers are clothed with powers to demand the production of all documents relating to the goods under investigation and to inspect records of costs and selling prices of old and new stock, which, under the National Security (Prices) Regulations traders are obliged to preserve. As an example of this procedure I may add that within eighteen hours of the announcement of the budget increases the  deputy  commissioners in all States, acting on instructions from the Commissioner, had in hand a comprehensive investigation of stocks of certain commodities on which substantial increases in taxation were provided in the budget' proposals, and had made arrangements for a test check on prices. </para>
