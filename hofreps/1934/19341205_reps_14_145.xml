It is, however, receiving consideration.

            <para>- The first amount of  ?10,000  made available by the Commonwealth was a straight-out grant for the personal relief of individuals who have suffered as the result of the floods. Tha Premier of Victoria has asked that an amount of approximately  ?200,000  shall be made available for carrying out works of reclamation, and  the  repair of damage which has been done, the advance to form part of the final general scheme between the State and the Commonwealth. I can only say that the urgent need is to get to work, and not to argue about the conditions. On the general plan for the future, the desire of the Commonwealth is that, to the extent that it gives assistance, award rates shall be observed. At the same time, however, it does not want to harass the various State organizations in the discharge of their functions. In this particular case, I think, the honorable member will agree that the first essential is to hasten the provision of employment. The conditions to be attached to the general measure of asistance may be discussed later. </para>

          <para>The committee is also of the opinion that even in dual control aircraft a pilot not licensed for the .particular aircraft should not be left in sole charge at any time whilst the aircraft is in flight, but that the licensed pilot should be in his seat and able to take over control at any time.

Further, if the concession is intended to be of any value to those making up cotton piece goods, is there any reason why the time should not be extended up to say the 31st December, or until such period, as the Australian manufacturers are in a position to supply the material required by those engaged in making up cotton piece goods ? </para>

            <para>- Yes; entries will be permitted up to 1st April, 1935. The reason for this further extension is that, although it takes in ordinary circumstances only from two to three months &#39;to deliver orders placed in Britain, small orders can be delivered quickly, whereas the department has information that large orders have not <inline font-style="italic">been</inline> delivered. The new duties were brought down on 1st August, 1934 and the reason why no further extension can be granted is that to allow orders placed after that date to be admitted at the old rate would be to take away from the Australian cottongrowers and manufacturers the benefit of the new duty. </para>

            <para>- Towards the end of June last, when the Assistant Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> held a similar position in a former administration, I asked him whether it was possible for the Commonwealth Bank to establish at Singapore or some such strategic point iu the East a clearing house where the bank, having financial relations with other banking institutions in the East, could deal directly with those institutions and so avoid the delay of having to send everything through London. The honorable gentleman then promised to look into the matter. As five months have elapsed since that promise was made I desire to know whether the Minister has yet received any information from the Commonwealth Bank Board and what has been the extent of his investigations? </para>

            <para>- The question raises a number of technical points which, I regret, in the stress of recent months, have not had the investigation that the honorable member would wish. But now that he has reminded me of the matter, as a member of the present Government, I will see that it is gone into and whether it is possible to take any action on the lines suggested. </para>

            <para>- I think the honorable member will agree that nothing that this Government has done has been in the opposite direction to that which he would desire. The goodwill mission to the East was sent, not to Japan only, but to all Eastern nations trading on a friendly basis with Australia, and much time was devoted to China itself. This Government has always endeavoured to increase friendly relations between that country and Australia. </para>

        <para>That the House do now adjourn. </para>
        <para class="block">I desire to draw attention to the threatened danger of Australia being involved in a foreign war, and the necessity for immediately declaring Australia&#39;s support to the covenant of the League of Nations, which seeks to prohibit the manufacture of armaments and munitions by vested interests, and re-affirming this country&#39;s renunciation of war, except in self-defence. The object of this motion is to ask the House to endorse the view expressed in the Covenant of the League of Nations that the manufacture of munitions by private enterprise is open to grave objection, and to indicate that it is of the opinion that the Government should set an example by refusing to place any further contracts with private manufacturers of arms and munitions, and should make provision for the production by the Commonwealth of such armaments and munitions of war as are considered necessary. The members of my party urge the House to re-affirm its solemn undertakings under the Kellogg Pact for the renunciation of war, and to express the opinion that the Government should confine its defence programme to providing the necessary safeguards against armed invasion, at the same time affirming that Australian troops will not be despatched overseas to participate in war. </para>
        <para>The necessity for the motion must be apparent to all who have watched the intense military and naval activity now being displayed in every country and viewed it in the light the possibility of Australia being drawn into external entanglements owing to the activities of people whose very prosperity depends on the promotion of war. When the present Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan)</inline> signed the Kellogg Pact in 1928 on behalf of Australia, surely it was no mere gesture, but was really intended as the formal renunciation by Australia of all resort to armed force, and as the expression of its determination to eradicate the sabre-rattlers  and munitions lobbyists who have done so much in the past to promote war. But instead of a progressive move towards peace, we find ourselves being rapidly drawn into another &#34; preparedness&#34; campaign, involving Australia, not only in the expenditure of millions of pounds, but also in the grave danger of having its activities misrepresented abroad. Under the Kellogg Pact, Australia formally renounced war, save in self-defence against a foreign aggressor. As most countries subscribed to that pact, it would appear that the attention of the statesmen of the world would be better engaged by the furtherance of that object, rather than in creating the atmosphere for another competitive armaments race, which is now now in progress. </para>
        <para>The campaign of the war-mongers was launched in Australia about twelve months ago, when mushroom organizations were suddenly set in motion, and newspapers began to stir up a national demand for increased defence expenditure. Certain members of the present Ministry allowed themselves to be associated with that campaign, which, even went so far as to offer provocation to nations in the Far East, with whom our relations have been friendly. Books and pamphlets were published on the &#34;Pacific peril&#34;, and statistics relating to comparative military, naval, and aerial defence strengths were broadcast in an effort to foment a national demand for increased expenditure. Special publicity officers appeared, and halls were engaged for public meetings. It was a costly campaign, and it obviously had a purpose. From what source did the funds come ? The experience of other countries, where similar campaigns have benn conducted, would indicate that large overseas munitions and armaments manufacturers regard such campaigns as an excellent investment. With the assistance of newspapers, governments oan quite easily be stampeded into letting large contracts for increased naval, military, and aerial equipment. In fact, our Government has already increased its defence estimates, and has placed orders overseas for a cruiser, squadrons of aerial bombers, and munitions. A similar state of affairs in the United States of America resulted in the Senate arms inquiry, which brought to light considerable correspondence involving the very firms which are now angling for contracts in Australia. It was revealed at that inquiry that Vickers Limited, Imperial Chemical Industries Limited, and du  Ponts  had divided the world into three parts, and had made international agreements that enabled them to operate, through their affiliated companies, in all countries. </para>
        <para>Before and during the war, Vickers Limited had an agreement with the Electric Boat Company to divide the trade in submarines with it. The American company allowed its patents to pass through its Austrian subsidiary so that Germany was able to build 300 U-boats, the royalties on which were later paid to the American company, although the torpedoing of the <inline font-style="italic">Lusitania</inline> was the acknowledged reason for the participation of ti&#34;  United States of America in the wai. </para>
        <para>Vickers&#39; principal salesman, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Basil</inline> Zarahoff, was paid commissions by the Electric Boat Company amounting to 2,000,000 dollars for sales which _ he effected through Vickers Limited. Finding that the leading powers were incredulous regarding the advantage of the submarine as a weapon of naval warfare, that gentleman induced his compatriots in Greece to accept a submarine at a discount. Immediately, Turkey found that it required two submarines to counter the Greek move, and another nation required three to offset Turkey. By the time Britain and Germany were drawn into the net, Vickers Limited and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Basil</inline> Zarahoff were drawing huge profits. - The present campaign is on all fours with that Zarahoff move. If Australia increases its defence vote, it provides an incentive to its neighbours to increase their vote. It is in this way that the whole system of profits for the private manufacturers is built up. </para>
        <para>Evidence submitted to the Senate Arms Inquiry Committee of the United States of America regarding the methods employed by armament manufacturers should serve as a timely warning to Australia. It must not be forgotten that the  chairman  of directors of Vickers Limited, General <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Herbert</inline> Lawrence, is intimately associated with Australian affairs, not only through his banking firm of Glynn Mills Limited, but also as a director of  Dalgety and Company Limited. Two other members of Glynn Mills Limited are directors of the Union Bank of Australia. </para>
        <para>The case against the private armaments manufacturer is too well known to require * recapitulation; but the fact remains that no steps have been taken to correct the grave abuses of that traffic. No Australian Government since federation has been free from the activities of the munitions lobbyists. Early in the present century there was the campaign against, the so-called &#34; Yellow peril &#34; when the Deakin Government sent three representatives to the Imperial Defence Conference in London in 1909. It might interest honorable members to learn that the activities of the present Minister for Health, the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> earned the appreciation of Lord Roberts as early as 1903. The war fever was brought successfully to a head hy the visit of Lord Kitchener to advise on our military defence.  His  estimate of the cost of the scheme for universal military service proved to be only a fraction of its actual cost. </para>
        <para>It has been emphasized on many occasions that Australia could be made independent of overseas arms manufacturers. It was for that purpose that Cockatoo Island Dockyard and the Lithgow Small Arms Factory were established. Yet the outstanding feature of the present war campaign has been that it has followed closely on the leasing of Cockatoo Island Dockyard and the refusal of the Government to utilize Australian workmen to build a new cruiser there. The nationalization of the munitions industry would remove the principal incentive to promote war. Deprived of the prospects of huge dividends, international manufacturers would no longer have any desire to pit one country against another or to conduct campaigns through the newspapers. </para>
        <para>The quickest way to deal with the evil is to eradicate armament capitalism. The United States of America is already moving in that direction. The staggering nature of the revelations at the munitions inquiry has set up a nation-wide demand for immediate action. The. churches of the United States of America have played an important part in crystallizing public opinion on this subject, and the- utterances of leading Australian churchmen make it certain that my motion will receive the endorsement of the churches of Australia. </para>
        <para>In February, 1933, the Lyons Government leased Cockatoo Island for 21 years. If the present Ministry is sincere in its defence policy its first action will be to regain control of that establishment. Not a penny should be spent outside Australia on naval construction. It has been proved that Cockatoo Island Dockyard has the equipment, and that Australian artisans have the capacity to undertake the work. The first duty of the Government should be to provide work for its unemployed shipbuilders. </para>
        <para>Labour stands for disarmament and urges the Government to use its utmost influence to ensure that the naval treaty to be considered next year will be designed, not merely to maintain the <inline font-style="italic">status quo,</inline> but also to provide an effective contribution to naval disarmament. The suspicion and haggling which mark the negotiations at this juncture are not in harmony with the best interests of world peace. It would be disastrous if the outcome of next year&#39;s conference were a naval race with Pacific supremacy as the prize. Australia could and should make a substantial contribution towards effecting a real measure of naval disarmament. </para>
        <para>Another decision which should be made immediately by the Government is that Australia&#39;s military aviation requirements should be provided within Australia. We have thoroughly skilled aircraftsmen in our. midst, hut they have not been afforded any encouragement by the Government. Australia is capable of building both its civil and its military aeroplanes. It remains only for the Government to install the necessary equipment. </para>
        <para>Unfortunately, various Commonwealth governments have consistently failed to utilize the services of Australia&#39;s most distinguished aviators. Hawker was regarded as an outstanding aircraft designer; yet Australia has to let contracts overseas to obtain Hawker bombing planes. Hinkler was another eminent designer who could not be provided with employment in his own country. He was allowed to go to his death in the Italian Alps. Now it is reported that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Charles</inline> Ulm is missing near Honolulu during a flight across the Pacific to Australia. Quite recently the designs of Captain Percival have been adopted by leading British aircraft manufacturers. The Percival Gull is regarded as one of the key British machines. More regrettable still has been the utter failure of the Government to take advantage of the incomparable organizing ability of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Kingsford Smith. He has been forced to undertake hazardous flights when he could have been performing a great national service by developing an Australian aviation industry. Unfortunately, this Government could not appreciate the advantages of offering him a salary commensurate with the magnitude of such an undertaking. </para>
        <para>The development of a national fuel industry and the complete nationalization of all munitions supplies are also essential step3 towards eliminating the profit motive. The only objection raised to nationalization has been that advanced by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Simon and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. I.</inline> du Pont, the American arms manufacturer. They contend that under nationalization it would take a nation twelve months to prepare for war. If all we read in the press regarding the military strength of the Soviet Union of Russia is true there does not appear to be any substance in such an objection. Rather should it be the most potent argument of all in favour of nationalization. </para>
        <para>Parliament has not been taken into the confidence of the Government regarding the real purpose of the visit to Australia of Lord Milne and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Maurice</inline> Hankey. A &#34;hush-hush&#34; atmosphere has surrounded this subject. Yet the Imperialist-minded newspapers have commenced a campaign designed to stir up another war fever. The <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> has been particularly active in this regard. After publishing a series of articles on the Japanese situation, capable of grave misconstruction, and belittling the work of the League of Nations, it has now embarked upon a &#34; preparedness &#34; campaign. In all these circumstances the announcement of the Government&#39;s decision to despatch the Minister for External Affairs, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir George</inline> Pearce, to New Zealand, was singularly unfortunate. We had been informed, time after time, that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Maurice</inline> Hankey&#39;s  visit was purely informal and nothing more than a holiday to attend, the Melbourne centenary; but the political correspondent of the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline> who was formerly the Prime Minister&#39;s private secretary, was able to disclose plans for the Wellington conference, adding that they had been made some time ago. The- Government owed it to this House to make its first announcement in Parliament, rather than through the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald.</inline> We remember, incidentally, that a previous statement of its defence policy was made at the Millions Club in Sydney. </para>
        <para>It was further intimated that, last year, the Government submitted plans to the New Zealand Government for a liaison in all matters affecting the Navy, Army, and Air Force. Apart altogether from the fact that the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill)</inline> was ignored - although, the matters discussed concern his department entirely - the details given in the report must cause grave concern. The Prime Minister should explain how the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Motiving Herald</inline> was able to publish what it termed an authoritative statement of the policy of the Federal and New Zealand Governments, together with what amounted to an agenda of the conference. I do not propose to traverse the principles enunciated there, as certain of them conflict with Australia&#39;s obligations under the Kellogg Pact, and sufficient damage has already been caused by their publication, as they are certain to be featured in overseas commentaries and scanned by the foreign offices of other nations. But if they represented the subjects discussed at the Wellington conference, and the Government was prepared to give them publicity, then they should have been conveyed to this House first. If the information disclosed came from Defence Department authorities, without the sanction of the Government, then the Minister for Defence should take appropriate action. Australia cannot afford to allow itself to be dragged into foreign entanglements to satisfy the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline> even though the arms salesmen would be deeply gratified. Let us, therefore, re-affirm the basic principles of our foreign policy - adherence to the Covenant of  the  League of Nations by eliminating private enterprise in the supply of armaments and munitions - and, by renewing our pledge under the Kellog Pact, renounce all war save in self-defence. </para>

          <para>. - The motion moved by the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> deals with a subject with which every Australian is concerned. Practically every one in this country is unanimously desirous of being spared a recurrence of what transpired during the Great War, but it is the view of practically every honorable member of this chamber that it is the duty and responsibility of this Government and of Parliament to defend this country adequately. Those two great principles animate members of this House and the people of Australia in considering the questions of defence and war. Personally, I cannot see much advantage in passing this motion, so far as it seeks to remedy anything or suggests that Australia is doing anything which it should not do in this matter. It affords us, however, an opportunity to reaffirm to the world the magnificent record that Australia, as part of the British Empire, has achieved in disarmament and the prevention of war and all the horrors concomitant with war. Further, it affords  u3  an opportunity to proclaim the glorious, magnificent, and noble record of Great Britain in the interests of disarmament and the preservation of peace throughout the world. </para>

          <para>-PARKHILL.- The honorable member for Fawkner-* <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell)</inline> points out an aspect of the question which I am sure will be noted by honorable members. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>What has Australia done in the cause of disarmament and the preservation of peace? This country has consistently  supported the League of Nations in its endeavours towards the reduction of armaments and the adoption of means for the pacific settlement of international disputes. It has proclaimed its adherence to the Permanent Court of International Justice, and also to the optional clause in the statute of that court which provides for the compulsory jurisdiction of the court in relation to certain classes of disputes. It is a party to the treaty for the renunciation of war, and the General Act for the pacific settlement of international disputes which was drawn up under the auspices of the League of Nations. Australia has ratified the convention for the regulation of international traffic in arms and implements of war, but such ratification, like the ratifications of most of the other thirteen countries which have so far adhered to the convention, is conditional upon ratification by certain other countries. This convention, however, is not yet in operation. As- for the League of Nations, it is really being maintained by the British Empire. Great Britain makes by far the largest contribution to its budget, and the payments from Australia are considerable, amounting to no less than &#163;60,000 this year, although this amount includes our proportion of the expenditure on the International Labour Office, which is an important feature of the League&#39;s activities. These facts, I think, establish conclusively the adherence of the Commonwealth to the cause of peace and the principles of disarmament. </para>
        <para>Having reminded the House of the part which Great Britain has taken in the cause of disarmament, I quote now the following statement made recently by the First Lord of the Admiralty, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Bolton</inline> Eyres-Mansell  : - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>During the last eight years, Great Britain was the only one of the Powers to show a decrease in expenditure on armaments - a decrease of 16 per cent. - whereas increases by other Powers during the same period were : Italy, 9i per cent; the United States of America, 10 per cent; Germany, 12 per cent.; Japan 80 per cent.; France, 100 per cent,; Russia, 197 per cent. Obviously Great Britain cannot pursue her present policy indefinitely. Of all the great Powers she hasthe most widely scattered possessions. She has a  tromendous  amount of what might  be  called armed police work to do in various parts of the world. Farther, her weakness may constitute a temptation to a breach of the peace, while experience seems to show that it contributes nothing towards bringing about all-round reductions of armaments. Consequently the question now being discussed is the form British re-armament must take. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">It is significant that while millions of people in Russia are on the verge of starvation the Soviet Government has increased expenditure on its army and navy from &#163;150,000,000 in 1929 to &#163;300,000,000 in the current financial year. </para>

            <para>- That is so. We have reason to believe that the published figures do not reveal the true position. I say this because from other official sources we learn that the Russian Government is now in the possession of approximately 2,500 tanks, that the number of its military aeroplanes is legion and that there has been an enormous increase in other forms of expenditure for war purposes. The same may be said of Germany. One of the reasons for the withdrawal of that country from the League of Nations was that it demanded equality in arms, and doubtless desired complete freedom to develop its military activities in the way that it deemed best suited to it3 future needs. Official figures relating to Germany show that the strength of its air force has increased by 700 per cent., that of its army by <inline font-style="italic">90</inline> per cent, and that of its navy by 33 per cent. Expressed in sterling, expenditure for war purposes in Germany has increased from &#163;51,000,000 in 1933, to &#163;77,000,000 in 1934. We learn further that orders have been placed in the United States of America for 2,500 aeroplane engines, that there has been a rapid expansion in munition works and that plans for industrial mobilization for war purposes have been perfected. All the powers have been cognizant of Germany&#39;s violation of its disarmament obligations, but action to restrain that country from continuing with its present policy can be taken only by common consent of the nations represented on the League of Nations, and coercion, which really means war, is something that no power is prepared to employ. </para>

        <para>I invite honora&#39;ble members to compare the steps which Great Britain has taken towards disarmament, with the immense increase of expenditure for war purposes in Russia and Germany, quite apart from what the governments of other countries have been doing in recent years, and to form their own judgment as to the propriety of the motion now before the House. The issues raised by the honorablemember for West Sydney have been discussed by parliamentary Labour parties in all countries. This subject was raised in the British House of Commons not so long ago by <inline font-weight="bold">Major Atlee,</inline> the  Deputy  Leader of the Labour party, and it was discussed more recently in the New Zealand House of Representatives, also at the instance of the dominion Labour party. Evidently the honorable member for West Sydney, in submitting the motion this afternoon, has sought to usurp the functions of the leadership of the Labour party in this House, deciding to have a little &#34; flutter &#34; on his own account instead of awaiting an opportunity to discuss the matter following the submission of a motion by the more experienced Leader of the Opposition in this Parliament. </para>
        <para>It is significant that wherever parliamentary Labour parties are in existence they take advantage of every opportunity to advertise their views on the subject of disarmament and cognate issues, without indicating with any definiteness their policy for the defence of a country. I listened with patience and interest to the honorable member for West Sydney this afternoon, and I noted that he omitted to mention what he would do to ensure the defence of Australia. The public generally would, I am sure, be glad to hear his views on this important question. It is as well to bear in mind that all war material used in Australia is manufactured in the Commonwealth, and that, under a special provision in the Customs Act, such material may not be exported to countries other than New Zealand, except in special circumstances. Thus the attitude of Australia to war does not need re-affirmation by this House. I shall not quote from &#39;the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Simon in the House of Commons other than to remark that he pointed out that Great </para>

          <para>.- I had hoped that a question of such magnitude, involving the lives of millions of people in the years to come, could be discussed in this Parliament without rancour and without inciting party against party or nation against nation. I disagree with the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill)</inline> that there is no justification for this motion. Allowing, for the . moment, all that the Minister has said regarding Australia&#39;s defence policy - and I am glad that most of it is true - surely Australia, as a member of the </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">League of Nations, has a right to make its contribution to the world-wide discussion on the subject of removing from private control the making of the instruments of war. That is the issue which has been raised here to-day. It is not strictly correct to say that in this matter Australia is entirely guiltless. I believe thai all the requirements for the defence of this country should be manufactured by the Commonwealth Government itself. I concede that Australia is unique among the nations of the world in that the Government manufactures all the munitions  which this country is at present capable of making. It is true that big guns, made by private firms overseas, are still imported for the defence of our shores. </para>
        <para>Australia has a contribution to make to this discussion; I wish that we could make it unanimously and without any party being accused of raising the question merely to .air its views. Surely the Labour party is not without sincerity. Has it not a right in every country to express its views on this subject, particularly as it speaks for the millions of the working class who have to carry on a war when war has been declared? A political party has a right to speak, without being charged with merely desiring to air its views. Any private member, or the leader of any group in this Parliament, has as much right as another to raise this issue. The controversy which is taking place throughout the world today proves in a striking manner that the manufacture of munitions and armaments must not be left to private enterprise which always has before it the incentive of profit-making. Honorable members are aware of the shocking revelations resulting from an inquiry into armaments which has recently taken place in the United States of America. They know of the influences brought to bear by private makers <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> armaments, of the propaganda indulged in by them, of the way in which they raise fears, in order to sell more and more of their death-dealing weapons, and of their endeavours to get those weapons used so that they may sell still more of them. Honorable members, surely, are not unaware of the ghoulish operations of private armament makers, who traffic in the lives of men and women, and, indeed, of little children, because, in the event of another war, helpless and innocent children will practically be under fire from the air. Any one who contemplates the price of the last war, and endeavours to visualize the horrors of another one, is justified in advocating the elimination of profit-making from the manufacture of war weapons and munitions. </para>
        <para>Like every other honorable member, I have been disappointed with the results of the Disarmament Conference which has been sitting for two arid a half years. When I was Prime Minister, I stood on the public platform in the biggest halls in Australia, in company with representatives of the then Opposition, and voiced Australia&#39;s views on the subject of disarmament. The Disarmament Confer ence at Geneva was held back for years rather than that a false step should be made, and although it has not yet concluded its deliberations, the results, so far, have been most disappointing. Nevertheless, all hope need not be abandoned, for the conference is still sitting, and something may yet be done to reduce armaments. It is the duty of this Parliament to make a gesture by sounding a warning note, and telling the conference, at which Australia is represented, that this country demands that the profiteering gangs shall cease their machinations, and their propaganda of fear, and that an end must be put to the race for armaments which can only lead to further wars. </para>
        <para>I agree with the Minister for Defence that, during recent years, Great Britain has set an example which other nations may well follow; and if I were inclined, I could make party political capital out of the fact that that example was first set by a Labour Government in Great Britain. Yet the Labour party is sneered&#39; at because it advocates peace. I agree that one nation cannot disarm in a world that is armed, and on behalf of the Labour party 1 have affirmed that Australia will defend itself. But the party which I have the honour to lead holds that Australia&#39;s defence policy must be definitely and deliberately designed for pure defence, without aggression. That is where we on this side stand. I do not know whether honorable members have ever contemplated what another war would mean, or what has caused the failure of the Disarmament Conference; but a person must indeed be blind not to see that that conference has failed because of the influence of armament firms, with their subsidies to alleged patriotic societies which, in turn, stir up a false patriotism among the people. Among the many books which have been written on the methods adopted by armament firms is one by George  Seldes  entitled <inline font-style="italic">Iron, Blood and Profits,</inline> a striking paragraph in which reads - </para>

          <para>The only big business in the world which bases its existence on patriotism is the one big business which lives by bloodshed. Although they raise the national flags over their endeavours, the armament makers have never hesitated, for a commensurate profit, to sell their country to the enemy. They have betrayed the secrets of military inventions,  given  information on strength in munitions,  and not only sold the cannon, the submarines, the warships, the powder, and the rifles to the nations with whom they expected their governments to be at war, but they have established armament works in enemy countries. </para>

        <para>We know of the influence of such organizations upon the people. We know the power of money and the incentive to manufacture for profit. That opportunity should be removed entirely so that nations may not be responsible for involving the lives of millions of human beings. Australia as a member of the League of Nations has a right to raise its voice in its national Parliament. We recall too vividly the horrors of the last war, and can visualize the terrors and horrors of another war. This is too big a question to be considered a party political one or as one in which nation is pitted against nation. But unfortunately that is the spirit in which disarmament discussions are taking place at Geneva. We should raise it above that level. Instead of saying that one nation has done more than any other in the cause of peace we should discuss the whole subject on a higher plane in the interests of the lives and health of the nations as a whole. </para>

I find it extremely difficult to reconcile the statements of some honorable members supporting the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> with the attitude that that honorable member has taken up to-day. Yesterday the honorable member for East  Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> denounced war, even the right of a country to defend itself if attacked. We heard from him a diatribe upon the conditions of mankind that are almost as old as man and which the efforts of each succeeding generation only seem to accentuate. </para>

            <para>- Surely the honorable member is aware that the greatest armed force in the world is ranged behind Russia where production is not for private profit. The causes of war are to be found in the very nature of man and the conflict of interests that set man against man. No complete adjustment of international differences is possible except by war or by rule of law. Civilization itself is a deliberate rejection of the appeal to force and the acceptance of the rule of law. But upon what does the law rest? It rests upon force. Upon what else could it rest? In every act passed by this Parliament penalties are provided for breaches of the law, and such penalties are enforced through the agencies of the magistracy and the police. The League of Nations of which we are a member, and I trust that we shall always remain a member, was established for the purpose of maintaining the peace of the world. By deliberately renouncing the right to settle international differences by resort to arms, and declaring that the nations would appeal to an international tribunal and abide by its decision, civilization took a deliberate step forward. But upon -what rock does the League of Nations, established to maintain the peace of the world, rest? Addressing the Peace Conference in 1919, the late  President  Wilson said - </para>

            <para>- The decision of the league was written in water. But the responsibility for its failure rests not upon the league but upon the nations members of the league who failed to make available armed forces to enforce its decision. The league did not fail to appeal to every country in the world to come to its assistance to enforce its decision, but they would not come. We have to face facts. The rule of law rests on force; the peace of the world can only be maintained if the peace-loving nations maintain such armed forces as will guarantee the security of nations and punish those nations that dare to disturb world peace. This country has shown its sincerity in the cause of peace, and has no need to be ashamed of its record. With Great Britain, it has been in the vanguard in the cause of peace. The British have led the world, but other nations have not followed. There is an inherent right in every nation, as there is in every individual, to defend itself, and that defence must be effective. If we remove from this Eden the serpent of private manufacture of armaments, there still remains the nature of man. Ultimately there can be no peace in the world unless, arrayed on the side of peace and justice, are the organized forces of the peaceful nations. </para>

        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">I consider it is incumbent upon me, among others, to explain how the matter appeals to us. It is an outstanding fact that Russia is increasing her armaments. The Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> who has just resumed his seat, said that that fact proves that production for profit has nothing to do with the causes of war. Let me say, first, that I regard the Russian revolution as by far the greatest achievement of centuries.  It  set out to alter the economic system of Russia, and to place it upon the basis of production for the use of the people and not for the profit of an owning class - which is the case in, for example, Australia. It soon became obvious that the Russian people would not be allowed to pursue that end peacefully. Almost from the beginning, Russia was - and  it  still is - menaced by other nations which are organized upon the basis of private property in the means of production. Had it not been for the working classes of England and France, the Russian experiment would quite early have been stamped out in blood. The British and French workers made it perfectly clear that their respective governments would receive no support in any attempt to suppress Russia. The French revolution, which would have done so much for the world, was diverted from its natural humanitarian course by the combination of England, Prussia and Austria against it, and became an autocracy under the Man on Horseback. The working people of Europe were determined that the same thing should not happen to Russia. Nevertheless, the Russian people realize that this is a very unstable foundation for peace. The Russian movement has divided into two streams. The break which occurred between Trotsky and Stalin was due to a difference in conception as to the attitude which Russia should adopt towards the world. Trotsky has always held that Russia should be the leader of a world-wide revolution, and that the Communists of that country should apply themselves to the task of fomenting revolution in every country. Stalin, on the other hand, and  the  majority who follow&#39; him, hold that Russia can best serve Socialism in the world by making Russia itself safe for Socialism. Everybody realizes that the </para>
        <para>Russian experiment is succeeding. There is no doubt that the Russian people are ever so much better oil now than they were before the war, whereas the people of every other country are ever so much worse off. That is to say, the Russian people are going forward, while the people of other countries are going backward. </para>

The time is not far distant when the success of the Russian experiment will make unstable every government that is based Upon the capitalistic system. Russia has offered to the world to accept a policy of universal disarmament, but that offer has been rejected. The Russian people believe that the time will come when the armies of capitalist countries may be used against Russia. They are so intent upon the success of their experiment that they are not prepared to see it wiped out in blood, as it might be were they not to exercise the greatest vigilance. </para>

            <para>- That has a great deal to do with it. I believe in that policy. In my opinion, the Australian working people should follow the example set by the workers of England and France when they declined to allow their  governments  to attack Russia; they should not participate in a war against Russia. I believe it is quite possible that they will be called upon to take part in some international war in which they will be on the one side and the Russians on the other. I should like to see universal disarmament brought about. That policy having been rejected, the only alternative is to adopt some policy which, in the words of Kant, may be a general rule. Honorable members doubtless know that Kant&#39;s Categorical Imperative is : &#34; Act so that your act may be a rule of conduct&#34;. The Australian Labour movement says that all defence preparations should universally be confined to home defence. If Australia were to adopt the policy : &#34; We will confine ourselves to the defence of our shores against aggression; on no account, under no pretext, because of no claim of defence will we take part in an aggressive war, or prepare to make war overseas &#34; ; we should do well. </para>

        <para>I was very interested in what was related some time ago by a woman who had returned from an international women&#39;s conference held at Honolulu. She said that she had been sought out by a Japanese woman delegate, a school teacher, who, after thanking her as an Australian on behalf- of her country, in formed her that when after the great earthquake a ship arrived from Australia carrying foodstuffs to relieve the necessities of the Japanese people, the Japanese children believed that Australia was taking advantage of their trouble to send a warship against them. The same &#34;fear of our neighbour&#34; which is inculcated in the minds of the people of Australia, is inculcated also in the minds of the people of Japan. Just as we believe that Japan is a potential enemy of ours, and that the Japanese people hate us and are prepared to make war upon us, so the Japanese people believe that Australia is a potential enemy of theirs. They have no sense of proportion. When the ship arrived with food to relieve the necessities of the Japanese people, the children, who witnessed its arrival, viewed it, not with rejoicing, but with alarm, because they thought it was carrying, not life-giving food, but deathdealing men and implements of war. </para>
        <para>I hope that we shall not be content with mere lip service in the cause of peace and disarmament, but that this Parliament and the people of Australia generally will struggle to promote the peace of the world. I admire the Russian revolution. I regard it as one of the cherished memories and heritages of the whole working-class movement throughout the world. But I do not agree with those who try to introduce into this country the tactics that were necessary in Russia, because I do not believe that they are necessary here. I consider that we could  make a big move forward by the general goodwill of the people. Unless we do that, I see no hope for Australia, because I am satisfied that the tactics which made the Russian revolution successful could not be reproduced here. </para>

          <para>. -  I believe that every member of this Parliament, and every citizen of Australia, agrees that a world war is too awful to contemplate, and that, therefore, we should use every endeavour to maintain the peace that is desired by all civilized people. But while holding that sentiment, we should not disregard the realities that face us. </para>

        <para>The motion moved by the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> largely lunges upon the assumption that if private contracts for armaments were abolished, one of the greatest causes- of war would be removed. There may be a good deal of merit in the honorable member&#39;s contention; but it applies with very little force within the British Empire. Great Britain subsidizes no armament firms whatever; all her armaments are supplied as the result of public tender. In Australia, all armaments are made in government factories. Would the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Drakeford),</inline> who supports the motion of the honorable member for West Sydney, oppose an extension of work in the ammunition factory in his electorate? I know that the honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway)</inline> would not adopt that attitude, because in the past he has advocated the provision of a greater amount of work for the cordite makers. The honorable member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini)</inline> has a big steel works in his electorate. Would ho oppose the making of steel because it is potentially an armament? Would the honorable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watkins)</inline> do so? Take ordinary commodities, such as wool, cotton and coal. They are as much the requirements of war, as are armaments which may cause the destruction of human life. We must keep the right perspective, and not run&#39; off the rails because of criticism such as that voiced at an inquiry in the United States of America regarding dishonesty in an armaments contract. That sort of thing goes on in trade, whether it be the making of armaments or any other commodity. But we can agree, I think, that if private dishonesty in connexion with an armament contract could be eliminated, that would be all to the good. </para>

            <para>- Perhaps not until we can eradicate dishonesty, selfishness, and the other failings of mankind, which cause wars between the nations of the world. Legislation gives rise to differences between nations that may in time provoke war. Our White Australia policy may at some time become a cause of war. It is not sufficient merely to make provision for that policy in a statute; behind the law we must have the manhood of the nation, who will fight for their principles, if assailed, just as they would repel a burglar from their homes. Honorable members who stress the iniquities and the wrongs caused by armament makers are rather out of perspective if they think that those constitute one of the big issues. The Government has certain obligations. It has established factories in which rifles, machine guns and ammunition are made. We hope that we may never have to use them, even in our own defence, but let not honorable members run away with the idea that offence can be separated from defence. They overlook the fact that if one is going to have a row, it is better to have it in the other man&#39;s backyard, and break up his furniture. If Australia should be called upon to engage in a war - and with the existing state of turmoil in Europe, no one can say what the future has in store - it might be necessary to send troops abroad. The honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blackburn)</inline> lost his perspective when he described the benefits that may be derived, &#39;by any nation that will emulate the example set by Russia. He declared that the Red revolution in Russia was one of his most cherished memories, and that it was the greatest achievement of the centuries. It is all very well for the honorable member to gather his information from books, but let him seek first-hand information. I was in Russia shortly after the revolution, and so was the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Garden),</inline> but at a later period, when he saw different phases of it. I know what happened then, and I sincerely hope that the terror that overtook Russia at the beginning of the revolution, and the civil war that followed, will never be experienced by a British community. Let the honorable member, who has grown up under the shelter of the British Empire, look to the Empire itself for inspiration, and rejoice in the knowledge that the justice and goodness of that Empire have been a shining example to the world. Russia is busily engaged in making munitions in its own government factories, and, within the last few years,  ha3  increased its armaments by 190 per cent. The honora&#39;ble member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward),</inline> who has had much to say about Russia, from which country, no doubt, he draws a good deal of inspiration, should have regard for the ideals of his own country, and for what has been done by his own people. Our young men took up arms in defence of their own country and the Empire as a whole. They went out to do battle, not because of any spirit of aggrandizement, but because they believed in the ideals of their country; and in fighting for them they set an example to the world. Only last week a former Prime Minister of Canada reminded us that, with few exceptions, it is only in English-speaking countries that parliamentary institutions survive. The government of almost every country in Europe is maintained only by armed force. In this country, however, men are free to denounce their own land, and to resort almost to treachery by advocating disarmament so that Australia might be an easy victim to any power whose cupidity is aroused by our wealth and potentialities. Those who talk in that way do so either because of lack of personal experience, or because they have never given serious thought to this question or read literature bearing upon it. If they had, they would not indulge in bed-time stories such as those told this afternoon by the honorable member for Bourke when he said that he would like to see in Australia something on the lines of the system that prevails in Russia to-day. Has he ever read of the terrors of the civil war in Russia? There are terrors of peace even greater than those of war, and some of the terrors of peace, as &#34; peace &#34; existed for a time in Russia, were infinitely greater than any that happened during the Great War itself. We can all agree with the honorable member for West Sydney when he says that the iniquities of the armament trade should, if possible, he wiped out. But let us remember that we are living in a country which, after lying neglected through the ages, was obtained for us without fighting, but which we may have to defend. Let us realize that we can secure the greatest inspiration for world good from the ideals of justice in the British Empire, and not from alien principles that are fostered by communists and pacifists who try to mislead the people and the unions, which are &#34; white-anted &#34; or rather &#34; red-anted &#34; by emissaries from Russia, By means of anti-war books and in other ways, these foreign emissaries, as well as freethinkers and others, are trying to undermine the patriotism of the people of the Empire to which we belong. </para>

          <para>.- It seems to me that some honorable members opposite have &#34; tuned-in &#34; wrongly. During this debate, we have not said one word against Britain or any other nation; it has been left to honorable members sitting behind the Government to introduce individual nations into this controversy. All that we say is that we are opposed to the private manufacture of armaments. While the League of Nations Disarmament Conference was sitting under the chairmanship of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Arthur</inline> Henderson, Britain, France, and Czechoslovakia, through private munition factories, were busily engaged in the manufacture of armaments for other countries. Throughout the discussion of the SinoJapanese situation by the League of Nations in an endeavour to solve a serious problem that faced the world, factories in Britain, Czechoslovakia and France were supplying munitions to both countries. France and the Skoda factories in Czechoslovakia were supplying arms to China; Britain, through Vickers, was supplying arms to Japan. And yet, while representatives from these countries are meeting in an endeavour to avoid war, we are told it is not necessary to raise our voice in protest against the liberty given private armament works to do these things. At the recent Disarmament Conference, the </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">Russian Government, through M. Litvinoff, said, &#34; We as a nation are prepared to-morrow to disarm, and we ask every nation to disarm with in? &#34;. What was the response? Did Britain, France, or Germany reply in the affirmative? No, in every case a negative answer was received. What then is to he said of the sophistry in which the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> indulged? Lord Cecil said - . </para>
        <para>There is a very sinister feature to all the disarmament discussions. I refer to the tremendous power wielded against all the proposals by armament firms ... It is m&#187; longer safe to keep in private hands the construction of these terrible instruments of death. We must aim at getting rid of this immense instrument in the maintenance of suspicion </para>
        <para class="block">There is no greater advocate of peace in the world than is Lord Cecil, yet he asserts that it is useless to advocate disarmament and peace as long as private munition makers are allowed to follow their own devices to the detriment of all nations. Let . us glance for a moment, not at statements made by pacifists, but at a report published by a Commission of the League of Nations in 1921 on the private manufacture of munitions. The Commission, which had been appointed to inquire into the problem of the private manufacture of arms, came to the following conclusions : - </para>
        <list type="decimal-dotted">
          <item label="1.">
            <para>That armament firms have been active in fomenting war scares and in persuading their own countries to adopt warlike policies and to increase their armaments. </para>
          </item>
          <item label="2.">
            <para>That armament firms have attempted to bribe government officials both at home and abroad. </para>
          </item>
        </list>
        <para class="block">The Senate inquiry in the United States of America showed that Ministers of the Crown had been bribed by the munition factories of America, and in the case of the Skoda inquiry it was shown that in Roumania and Czechoslovakia five Ministers had been bribed by the Skoda factory. Such was the outcry that all five were dismissed. The Commission found further - </para>
        <list type="decimal-dotted">
          <item label="3.">
            <para>That armament firms have disseminated false reports concerning the military and naval programmes of various countries in order to stimulate armament expenditure. </para>
          </item>
          <item label="4.">
            <para>That armament firms have sought to influence public opinion through the control of newspapers in their own and foreign countries. </para>
          </item>

        <para class="block">That is true of the position to-day. The majority of the newspaper trusts in this and every other country are subsidized by the armament firms - </para>

            <para>That armament firms have organized international armament rings through which the armament race has been accentuated by playing one country against another. </para>

        <para class="block">The Minister for Customs says that he believes in fighting in the other fellow&#39;s back-yard instead of his own. Why should we go into the other fellow&#39;s&#39; backyard ? The &#34; other fellow &#34; has an equal right to protect his own yard, and our rule should be, &#34;We will not go into any one else&#39;s back-yard to fight, but if any other country attempts to come into ours, we shall have something to give it&#34;. That is our position. We do not believe in aggression, but we do believe that we should defend ourselves at all costs. The Commission reported further - </para>
        <list type="decimal-dotted">
          <item label="6.">
            <para>That armament firms have organized international armament trusts which have increased the price of armaments to governments. </para>
          </item>
        </list>
        <para class="block">These are definite charges, and no attempt has been made to rebut them. Manufacturers of munitions have neither soul nor heart. Their only concern is to amass profits. British, munitionmakers supplied Turkey with the shells that mowed clown our own men when they were storming the heights of Gallipoli. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hugh</inline> Dalton, speaking on the Naval Estimates in the House of Commons on the 11th March, 1926, said-. </para>
        <para>Vickers had been supplying the Turkish artillery with shells which were fired into the Australian, New Zealand, and British troops as they were scrambling up Anzac Cove and Cape Helios. Bid it matter to those armament firms so long as they did business and expanded the defence expenditure of Turkey that they mashed up into bloody pulp all the morning glory that was the flower of Anzac : the youth of Austrafia and New Zealand? . . . </para>
        <para>These men, these directors of armament firms, are the highest and completest embodiment of capitalist morality. </para>
        <para class="block">It is our existing system that is responsible for war. As long as that system lasts we shall have wars and rumours of wars and the pitting of one nation against another. Apart altogether from the recent defence conference in New Zealand, the Minister for Defence has made provision for the expenditure of  &#163;1,000,000 by his* department.  His  estimates are bound to be still further increased when the report of the representative of the Commonwealth at that conference is received. I am not condemning the Minister, but I would point out that every munition factory in the world to-day is working overtime. Vickers is working three shifts a day. The Hotchkiss factory, in France, is pouring out machine guns for the Far East and South America. The Skoda arms factory is working night and day to execute orders. There is a boom in the Dutch munition factories. American war factories arc busy executing orders for the Far East and South America. America is starting on the greatest shipbuilding programme ever launched in its history. It is building 32 warships at a cost of &#163;51,000,000. Twenty-two of these ships are being built by private firms. This means that other countries will emulate America&#39;s example. The Senate inquiry has demonstrated the fact that America&#39;s expensive programme was &#34; worked out &#34; among members of the House of Representatives and the Senate, who came down to Ministers with the declaration that &#34; We must protect ourselves by doing what other countries are doing &#34;. If governments fail to abolish the private manufacture of arms, the only result will be another war keener and greater than the last. We see people here waving flags made in Japan and crying, &#34; Our country right or wrong &#34;. In Germany the cry of &#34; the Fatherland &#34; is raised. In yet another country we have the cry of &#34; Liberty &#34;. These and other dishonest slogans are employed, and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Johnson&#39;s</inline> declaration that &#34; Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundel&#34; &#34; is as true to-day as it was when he uttered it. </para>

I am quite safe in saying that the lunatic asylums of this country are large enough to contain all those people who desire to see the world faced with another war; but I am quite sure that they are not big enough to contain all the people who are not prepared to do something in the way of preparation for such an even tuality. A motion of this description might very well have been debated in Paris, Berlin, Moscow or Tokyo, but I cannot see any reason for the time of an Australian Parliament being taken up in the discussion of a subject that has no bearing whatever on conditions as they exist in Australia to-day. </para>

I would have been quite content to listen to honorable members on other subjects. The question of the manufacture of ammunitions is certainly an interesting one, but it is admitted that it has no bearing on the Commonwealth. We have no foreign frontiers, the whole continent is ours. Furthermore, we are in no shape to act as an aggressor nation. We have no naval forces, no ships to enable us to transport our forces to other parts of the world, no trained men to send on active service, even if we had the means to transport them. </para>

What of the serious import of the implications in the motion moved by the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> ?  His  party, he said, would object to any man being sent overseas to take part in any active war-like operations against another power. The reply of the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill)</inline> was most effective. For my own part I would very much prefer our men to be engaged in active service outside of this country than within it. But if necessity should arise for defensive operations within our borders, I would far sooner see them carried on a few thousand miles north of this city than in the suburbs of Sydney, where they are most likely to take place. Sydney will surely be the first point of attack by any power attempting warlike operations against this country. </para>

        <para>Listening to some honorable members one would think that we were living in a world in which mankind has shed every aggressive tendency for war, imbued in human beings since the creation. But we have only to realize that common piracy is an everyday occurrence in huge areas of the Pacific Ocean. As a matter of fact, but for the protection afforded by the navies of Great Britain and other countries, it would not be possible to carry on maritime trade in the Pacific to-day. Passengers by mail steamers in the Bed Sea pass within sight of Arabian cities where slave traffic is still carried on. I have no desire to traverse European history, but I should like to refer to one or two very interesting points raised by the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blackburn)</inline> in regard to the position of Russia to-day. Of all the countries in the world, Russia needs the least defence. There is no major power adjoining its borders from Sweden in the west to Manchuria in the east capable of assailing it. It is a land of immense plains, the very nature of which has compelled great leaders of men time after time to admit - and the latest of them was Napoleon himself - tha1 Russia cannot be effectively conquered. The statements of honorable members opposite that Russia has had to build up a great military organization as a defensive instrument is absolute &#34; tosh &#34;, and they are not believed by any one who has learned the ABC of what the world&#39;s history teaches. But since the question of Russia has been raised, we must recognize that that country has been engaged in another activity, and the debate to-day arises from an instruction given at the Third Socialist Internationale at Moscow last year that an intensive campaign against war was to be advocated in every country in the world. The chief aim of that </para>
        <para class="block">Third Socialist Internationale was to increase the dissemination of anti-war propaganda. </para>

If a man is so devoid of humanity as to desire a war against hi* fellow men he is of such a type that an attempt to describe him would bring one* in conflict with our Standing Orders. Great as the necessity for peace may be to-day, I have not, yet been able to discern any desire on the part of other powers in Pacific countries to bring about the peace which is so necessary. </para>

        <para class="block">Estimates, been, quite inadequately discussed, I would like to think that there was some fundamental advantage to be gained from a vital change of policy with regard to the manufacture and sale of armaments, but I cannot believe that there is. I think, to some extent, that the desire for private profit in the manufacture of armaments  is  an additional incentive to war. But I do not believe that in the difference between public manufacture and private manufacture of armaments is to be found the secret of peace. The difference  is  not altogether a question only of manufacture of armaments. In my view, the whole social system is wrong. I believe that our present social system  Tests  upon greed and fear and force, and that it is out of these qualities that war springs, and is destined to spring  in  the future. It is a matter, not only of private manufacture of arms, but of private manufacture of other things  as  well. In a word, I believe that the peace of the world can&#39; only be secured through a fundamental change  in  our social relationships, and that fundamental change is to be found in the objective of the Labour party of which I have the honour to be a member. The Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> made the damaging admission from his point of view that in matters of defence it is difficult to discriminate between what is defence and what is offence. 1 agree that it is difficult. After all, defence suggests what we are implementing in this Parliament and proposing to extend by the machinery of this Parliament to the amount of many additional millions of pounds. Defence means that we are to build up armaments and munitions, construct battleships, and manufacture poison gases and other instruments of human destruction, sufficiently to overpower the strength of our neighbour in the last resort. And, naturally, our neighbour concludes that his duty is precisely the same as ours. Hence commences and continues this world race of armaments, this hectic promotion of the making of the means to kill, promoted by avarice, hatred and suspicion. The degree of our success in regard to peace depends upon the degree to which we can influence public opinion along the lines of peaceful relations with neighbouring and other peoples. </para>

He can sleep on verandahs, with windows thrown open, and doors ajar. We hardly take the trouble to lock our doors. Is is because there is a file of policemen outside, or is it because order, in any community such as that in which we live, rests infinitely more securely upon the understanding and goodwill of the people than upon any exercise of force by the police? A throat might be cut every night in the suburb in which I live, so far as police protection goes; but that does not happen, because there is forebearance and a recognition of mutual rights and obligations. If this spirit obtains in a country where the poor, impoverished, and embittered, live under a system of society which deprives them of the rights which properly belong to them, grinds them down, and keeps them ground down, a system the supporters of which have no conception of popular justice, bow much more should that spirit exist between nations separated by leagues of ocean, who have no daily communication with, and no responsibility to, one another? </para>

          <para>. -  The sentiment behind the motion is clearly one to which all persons of intelligence may subscribe, for the principle of peace is advocated. Any departure from that sentiment by honorable members on this side is due to a difference of opinion as to methods. I believe also that there is some misapprehension in the mind of the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> who submitted the motion. Australia regards itself as an important unit in the world, but by reason of our limited population we cannot cause our influence to be felt very much in the councils of the nations. We are a relatively small nation ; nevertheless Ave have exercised some influence in the direction of peace by support on all possible occasions of the activities of the League of Nations, and Great Britain has invariably used its power and influence, both in the Council of the League of Nations and outside it, to bring about world peace. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>One of the principal points taken by the honorable member for West Sydney in his motion is that it is necessary &#34; immediately to declare Australia&#39;s support of the Covenant of the League of Nations, which seeks to prohibit the manufacture of arms and munitions by vested interests &#34;. I suggest that the very form of the motion shows that a misapprehension exists in the honorable member&#39;s mind. He is clearly unaware of the efforts made by the League, and in which Australia has joined,, to control the private manufacture of armaments. A convention was subscribed to by the members of the league in 1925, and it had for its principal object the control and regulation of the trade in armaments. Great Britain and Australia, together with twelve other members of the league, have ratified that convention, and, if a sufficient number of other nations had also supported it, the international traffic in armaments and the private manufacture of them would not be the potential menace which it is alleged they are to-day. For many years Britain has been actively striving to induce a sufficient number of other countries to subscribe to that convention in order to have it brought into operation. By the use of arguments in favour of the adoption of this course, and by the employment of its diplomatic machinery, Great Britain has taken most active steps, both in the deliberations of the Assembly of the League of Nations, and in other directions, to bring about this result. </para>
        <para>Only last month, this matter was debated in the British House of Commons, and it was mentioned that no more than the fourteen countries which now subscribe to the convention are prepared to support it. Efforts were made at the last general assembly to draft a new convention on different lines, in the hope that sufficient countries would support it to enable it to be brought into force. This proposal is under the active consideration of the league at the present time. I understand that a draft convention, in the new form is being drawn up by the disarmament bureau of the league. The Secretary of State in the United States of America has prepared a draft convention on similar lines, and this has been submitted to the disarmament bureau of the league as possible of acceptance for submission to the members of the league. </para>

Such a system was in operation in Great Britain. There was complete and stringent control of all exports of munitions. Arms could only be exported with a licence, and the exporter had to establish the destination of his goods. It was Britain which had taken the initiative in placing the embargo on the export of arms to Bolivia and  Paraguay,  which 28 exporting countries had now undertaken to observe. </para>

He regretted that the arms convention of 1925, which had been signed and ratified by Britain, had not been ratified by any considerable number of nations. Nevertheless, the British Government was determined to take up the subject again at Geneva in order to get an effective convention. </para>

        <para>A substantial point has been raised as to the difference between defence and offence. The House has had an almost perfect example, in the speech of the honorable member&#34; for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan),</inline> of an apologia for the inflated armaments in Europe, on the ground that they are purely defensive. Now that we know where the honorable member stands in relation to communism, we can accept what he said as a fairly good apologia for the enormous armaments that have been built, up in Russia in the last ten years. Two or three times more than the published amount has been spent there in the last eight years. I suppose that in no parliament in Europe, where fear, envy and malice are rampant, would we hear speeches, such as that of the honorable member, in defence of the inflated expenditure on armaments on the ground that it is purely a defensive measure. Whom has Russia to fear? Is there a country in the world that, by the grace of nature, is more self-defensive, with its millions of square miles of territory? Yet that country has its poison gas factories, its aircraft and its tanks. It is building up the greatest military machine in history, and this, save the mark, is defensive ! Unfortunately, a poverty-stricken Europe, lying at one gate of Russia, is apparently about to pounce upon this Colossus, and tear it to pieces ! Are we to presume that Japan and unfortunate China at the other gate are likely to attack Russia? I suggest rather that Russia is building up its armaments for other than entirely defensive purposes. The honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blackburn)</inline> made his apologia for the flood of Russian armaments in the approved European fashion. I do not wish to obtrude myself into this debate at any greater length. I emphasize that Great Britain is making every effort to suppress the international trade in armaments. The abolition, or limitation of the private manufacture of armaments is now under consideration by the Disarmament Conference. </para>

          <para>.- The honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> is to be complimented upon having moved this motion. In view of the great deal of talk about the possibility of war, it is necessary that some one should expose the machinations of those who are making profits out of the sale of armaments. Some honorable members during this debate have spoken about the cost of the last war, but they have dealt, with it from a purely financial aspect. I wonder if they have ever considered its cost in terms of suffering and misery. Every human life that was destroyed during the war cost approximately &#163;5,000. I take into account, of course, the lives of men in both the allied and enemy armies. The great bulk of that money went into the pockets of people interested in the manufacture of armaments. In these circumstances, it is not surprising that every move to prevent the manufacture of armaments by private companies is rigorously opposed. By every means in their power, those who are interested in the manufacture of armaments have sought to serve their own private interests. They maintain their nefarious work by the payment of bribes to all kinds of interests, including government officials. They recognize  that only <inline font-style="italic">by</inline> setting one country against another can they hope to maintain the output from their factories. The greater the armaments competition between the various countries of the world the greater the profit of those interested in the industry! In order to understand the ramifications of these international organizations it is necessary to know something of the activities of the persons directly interested. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Herbert</inline> Lawrence, who is a director of Vickers, Armstrong Limited, the Bank of Roumania, and the Sun Insurance Office, is also a director of Dalgety&#39;s Limited. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Otto</inline> Niemeyer, another director of Vickers, Armstrong Limited, is an officer of the Bank of England, and a director of the AngloInternational Bank, the Bank of International Settlements- </para>

            <para>.- I have already called the attention of the Government to what I consider to be an unjust increase of rental in respect of telephones connected to public schools, particularly in the metropolitan area, and I again ask that action be taken to reduce the charge to the former rate. Telephone services are generally made possible in schools by the subscriptions of members of a parents and citizens association, and I cannot understand why an increase of 10s. a year should have been made in the rental charge for such equipment. A letter which I have received from the Marrickville Parents and Citizens Association points out that as schools are not profit-making establishments it is unjust that they should have to pay increased telephone charges. They should not be placed in the same classification as business premises. The telephones are installed in schools solely to assist in making the education system work as smoothly as possible. </para>

          <para>Another matter which has occasioned a good deal of dissatisfaction in my electorate is the failure of the Government  to install an automatic telephone exchange at Petersham.

If an automatic exchange were installed, the revenue of the department would undoubtedly be increased. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dein,</inline> the former member for Lang, and also the municipalities of Leichhardt and Petersham have, I understand, made representations to the Government on this subject. There has been a considerable agitation among subscribers in the district for the provision of an automatic exchange.

            <para>.- Could the Minister inform the House whether the automatic exchanges which are being installed in many country towns are successful, and whether, if the results to date have been favorable, the cost and extra work involved would not deter the department from extending these facilities, I urge the department to extend greater postal facilities to educational institutions in regard to education by post. This would not entail very great expense, whilst the children in the outlying districts who are compelled to use the correspondence system would benefit considerably. A request that this should be done was made to the Minister some time ago, and he declined to accede to it. I hope that it will now be more favorably considered. </para>

          <para>I direct the attention of the Minister to the high charges which are sometimes made upon people who are compelled to put up their own telephone lines when they happen to be situated some distance from the Government&#39;s lines. These charges at present are unduly high. No greater facility can be given residents in isolated country districts than the telephone, so I hope the Government will reduce these charges. </para>

            <para>.- I direct the attention of the Minister to the lack of telephonic facilities at the Newnham Post Office, near Launceston. Although the main telephone line runs adjacent to this post office, there is no trunk-line connexion inside the post office. There is no regular telephone within half &#39;a mile of this spot, and thus local residents&#39; find it very inconvenient to get into communication with people either in Launceston or in other centres. If telephonic facilities were provided in this unofficial post office, no additional expense in regard to maintenance or for the operation of the line itself inside the office would be incurred. Local residents have drawn up a petition, which bears the signatures of about 200 people, for these telephonic facilities, the provision of which would be very much appreciated. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>At the opposite end of the City of Launceston, near the Launceston Public Hospital, there is a lack of telephonic facilities, the South Launceston post office, which is the nearest post office, being a considerable distance away. I understand that a storekeeper whose shop is situated near the hospital would be prepared to handle telephonic communication on a basis of payment by results if the telephone were installed in his store. I do not know whether this is feasible, but it is obvious that there is an urgent need for a telephone near this hospital, particularly should people, in case of sickness, desire to communicate urgently with relatives and friends. At present they are obliged to walk for about twenty minutes to reach the Central Launceston Post Office or the South Launceston office. I suggest that in selecting works under its re-employment scheme the Government should consider erecting a new building at Invermay, a suburb of Launceston. The existing structure is not in keeping with the importance of this suburb. </para>

            <para>. -  I draw the attention of the Minister to one phase of telephonic service in country districts in which I believe the department could effect a very big im.provement without incurring any cost. In many country districts in Victoria, and I suppose throughout Australia, there is no co-ordination between neighbouring telephone exchanges in fixing the time for the luncheon closing with the result that for all practical purposes adjoining centres are without means of telephonic communication with one another  for two hours during the day. The luncheon hour at these exchanges is dictated by the business men of the respective towns. </para>

            <para>- The Postal Department could reasonably approach these shopkeepers with a view to having the lunch hour in adjoining districts synchronized. For instance, the Bet Bet shire councillors were anxious to enable working farmers to telephone to neighbouring towns for urgent supplies, such as spare machinery parts, during the lunch hour, and with this end in view, interviewed the leading business people in each town of the shire. The result, I am glad to say, is that at present the whole of the telephone exchanges in that particular shire have abandoned the practice of which I have complained, and all of them now close for lunch at the same hour. The department has been notified of this change and has replied that it is prepared to accept the new arrangement for the midday break and to make arrangements accordingly. That concession was really obtained through the action taken by the shire council, but I am sure the Postal Department could go further - and make similar arrangements in many other country districts. I am not asking that the hours for business shall be increased, but rather that the spread of hours should be varied. I believe that better results are possible, and that the convenience of the public will be served by the arrangement which I have suggested. Under existing conditions many country telephone exchanges open at 8 a.m., and close at 6 p.m. This arrangement is not convenient for country subscribers, especially during the harvest and shearing seasons, because farmers then are at work long before 8 o&#39;clock in the morning, and do not cease work until after 6 o&#39;clock in the evening. If they &#39;wish to use the exchange after the hour of closing, they have to pay an opening fee of ls. 6d., and even then have to rely on the operator being willing to return to duty after the closing hour. The alteration which I have suggested would, I am sure, be much appreciated by residents in country districts. The alternative is to establish more automatic telephone exchanges in country districts, but as the cost for a 20 or 30-line exchange is in the vicinity of &#163;600, that expenditure spread all over Australia would be very great. Nevertheless, I commend for the consideration of the Postmaster-General the extension of that system as far as may be possible. I am making this plea on behalf of country people in preference to the claims of those living in the capital cities, where distances are short and facilities are numerous. In country districts distances are great, and because of the restricted hours for the operation of exchanges, great inconvenience is very often caused to subscribers. If, for example, an accident happens in an isolated locality, persons skilled in first-aid measures are not readily available, and if the mishap occurs outside the hours during which the local exchange is in operation, human life may be endangered by the delay. The establishment of more automatic exchanges or some extension of the hours of manually-operated exchanges would be much appreciated by people living in the country districts. </para>

            <para>- Order ! As the honorable member for Cook has not been long a member of this Parliament, he may be unaware of the procedure followed by the Chair in giving the call to honorable members. For his information, and also for the information of other new members who may, in similar circumstances, feel that the Chair is showing partiality, it is desirable that I should  again  state that if on one side of the committee there are 40 members, and on the other side 20 members, the Chair feels it is only right that members belonging to the larger party should be called more frequently than members of the smaller party. If members of both parties were called alternately, and if the debate ended when all the members of the smaller party had spoken, the 20 members belonging to the larger party, not having been heard, might feel that they had reason to complain. I hope that the honorable member will be satisfied with this explanation. </para>

              <para>- It has always been my practice to deal directly with the PostmasterGeneral&#39;s Department in respect of minor matters of administration, and to discuss, on the floor of the House, matters of policy. I have found this rule to work very well, so to-day I intend to deal with postal policy. The Postal Department is one of the most important of the business activities of the Government. Last year its operations showed h profit of &#163;1,000,000, so it cannot be said that the department is in financial difficulties. For this reason, I feel that we can reasonably expect a little more consideration for requests dealing with certain aspects of policy than was the case a year or two ago when we were feeling the depression so severely. My first request has to do with the installation of country telephones. A couple of years ago the maximum allowance toward the cost of erection of a country telephone service was &#163;20; last year it was raised to &#163;25. This meant that if a person living in. the country desired a connexion with the nearest exchange, he would have to pay the difference between the allowance of &#163;25 and the total cost, in addition to the annual ground rent. After a lapse of a certain period, the practice is to allow a rebate of rental charges, but only as a part payment toward the contribution to the cost of constructing the line. It would be more equitable if, instead of insisting on ground rent after a service has been installed, the department allowed subscribers a rebate on their contributions until they were recouped for their outlay. I should also like the department to reconsider its attitude towards a flat rate. In South Africa, the maximum charge for all country subscribers is &#163;7 a year. I hope that the Postmaster-General will have inquiries made and see if it is not possible to establish more uniformity in the rates, thus relieving some country subscribers from the excessive charges now being levied on them for their telephone services. </para>

              <para>- No, but I think there should be a more equitable distribution of the cost. The suggestion I have just made has been adopted in other activities of the Postal Department. There is a flat rate of 2d. for letters addressed to any part of the Commonwealth, regardless of distance, and more of the same principle should be observed, as far as possible, in connexion with telephone services. In England, there is a fixed charge of ls. for night calls. I admit that, because of its size, construction costs are heavier in Australia in proportion to the use of our telephones than they are in Great Britain, but even here it should be possible to liberalize the charges for night telephone calls. </para>

          <para>With regard to border telegrams, it is high time a reduction was made. After 34 years of federation, there is still an absence of the federal spirit, the minimum cost for telegrams interstate being ls. 4d., even if a message is despatched only a few miles across the border of a State. I have been informed that in one border town, local business men desiring to communicate by telegram with clients or customers in the adjoining State, send a boy across the border on a bicycle to despatch the messages from the- post office  there and save the additional 4d. The position would be met by the establishment of the zoning system, under which a person could send a sixteen-word telegram within a 50-mile radius of any post office at the present State rate of ls. The adoption of this suggestion would not involve the Postal Department <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> any serious loss of revenue, but would remove much irritation and dissatisfaction. I hope that the Postmaster-General will consider carefully the several matters which I have mentioned, and institute the reforms indicated. </para>

            <para>.- The Postmaster-General of the Lyons Ministry before the last Cabinet reshuffle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill)</inline> -was, in my opinion, the  be3t  Postmaster-General that Australia has known, irrespective of party, particularly in his treatment of commercial broadcasting stations. When he disagreed with a request he was always willing to give his reasons; and if he favoured a proposal put to him, he said so without delay. I am closely identified with one commercial broadcasting station, and I think that I speak on behalf of all similar stations, when I pay that tribute to the honorable gentleman. Unfortunately, since the administration of the department has been undertaken by another Minister, those satisfactory conditions have ceased. I speak particularly of the new rule regarding broadcasting advertisements on Sundays. At first, stations were permitted to broadcast advertisements on Sundays; later, direct advertisements were not permitted, and now the department threatens to disallow altogether advertisements <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> Sundays. This changed attitude on the part of the department has destroyed the harmony which existed during the administration, of the former Postmaster-General, and I hope that that honorable gentleman, who is at present in charge of the business before the committee, will take this matter up with his successor. </para>

          <para>I desire to bring before the Minister the unjustified charges made by the Australasian Performing Right Association. This body, which is one of the biggest combines in Australia, will not. allow an artist to appear in a public hall, even on behalf of charity, unless he first pays to it a licence-fee. Similarly, no commercial broadcasting station may broadcast a gramophone record unless it pays to. this association 4d. every time the record is played. That charge is in addition to any royalty paid to the maker of the record for the right to use it, and to the cost of the record itself. I would not object to n fair payment for the use of ft record if the artist whose performance it records received the fee; that would be some payment for his talent, and for the pleasure that he gives to the community. But I do not think that the artist receives any of these fees. Although some of the records in respect of which this association claims fees are twenty years old, 4d. has to be paid every time they are played. Other countries, notably New Zealand and Ireland, have dealt with this matter effectively. </para>

That these rates are for the purpose of granting concessions in respect of long distance is clear from the fact that they do not operate in the case of conversations between places less than 30 miles apart. As many country subscribers are connected with exchanges which give only a limited service, these concession rates are of no practical value to them. For instance, the ordinary day rate operates from 9 a.m. until 6 p.m. with a reduced rate between that hour and 9 o&#39;clock, and between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., and a still further reduction from 9 p.m. till 7 a.m. Subscribers to those exchanges which are open only till 8 p.m., have the benefit of the intermediate rate for a couple of hours; but those who are connected with exchanges which operate  only between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m., derive no benefit whatever from these concessions. I suggest that those exchanges to which, under present conditions, the preferential rates do not apply, should be given some other period during which concession rates will be charged. </para>

          <para>It has been the practice of the department to allow a number of subscribers to use what is known as a party line, on condition that they contract with the department to remain subscribers for a definite period - I think seven years. On account of economic conditions, many subscribers to party lines have had their service disconnected, and, in consequence, the remaining subscribers have been called upon to pay the total charges imposed by the department. That places on them an unfair burden. In most cases the services have been disconnected, not because of any lack of desire to retain them, but merely because of economic necessity. The department has already incurred the expenses connected with the installation of the telephones, and as the increased rental charged to the remaining subscribers is likely to lead to other disconnexions, there is danger of further losses of business, and, consequently, of revenue also. Obviously, it is in the interests of the department to maintain the number of subscribers at the highest figure possible, and, therefore, I ask the Minister to take these representations into consideration, with a view not only to country subscribers getting the benefit of the telephone service, but also maintaining the revenue of the department. </para>

            <para>.- During recent years considerable settlement has taken place on the Atherton Tableland, and some of the settlers there have sought connexion with the telephonic service, only to be informed that the financial position of the Commonwealth will not permit of the <inline font-style="italic">work</inline> being carried out. The department suggested that if those interested would ascertain the number of likely subscribers, the matter would be further considered. When a list was supplied, the department said that if the prospective subscribers erected their own lines it would install the telephones. By adopting this attitude the department is not assisting in the settlement of that area. Recently, at Topaz, in the Malanda district, there was an outbreak of diphtheria, but there was no telephone within twelve miles of the stricken children. The installation of a telephonic service would assist in the settlement of this and similar areas. </para>

          <para>At one time Dajarra, in western Queensland, was a thriving mining centre, but on account of the low price of copper the population has fallen off in recent years. The old telephone line, which belonged to the Railway Department, is used for communications, but the line is in need of repair, and no one seems willing to accept the responsibility of attending to it. The result is that sometimes the residents of that centre have no service at all. The town communicates with the outside world by telephone to Duchess, and from there through Cloncurry, with other places along the Mount Isa line. Some of the people whose address is given as Dajarra, are from 20 to 80 miles from the post office, and it is most annoying to them to find, after a ride of perhaps 50 miles, that the line is not in working order. This necessitates travelling to Duchess to transact business by telegraph and sometimes results in the loss of a week. The responsibility of maintaining the line iu good order rests with the department which expects payment for the service, but when the service is inefficient loss is caused to the people in that locality. If it is not the responsibility of the Railway Department the postal authorities should act in the matter. </para>
          <para>The present post office at Cairns, which was in existence when I was attending school, has not been improved to any extent during the last 30 years. There has been extensive development in Cairns and the surrounding district during recent years, and the present building is quite unsuitable to handle the volume of business transacted there. As the department has promised to re-model the structure -I trust that that will be one of the works undertaken in order to afford relief to the unemployed before Christmas. </para>
          <para>A large portion of the Kennedy elector^ ate is served by party telephone lines which cost from &#163;10 to &#163;30 annually, exclusive of the cost for calls; this is altogether too high a charge for the service rendered. Telephones are essential to the man on the land, but the rates and other imposts which country people have to meet are altogether too high. Country residents are as much entitled &#39;to an efficient telephone service at a reasonable rate as are city residents who obtain a telephonic service at a much lower cost. The honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> suggested the imposition of a flat rate. I do not know how such a system would operate, but it is time that the representatives of country districts made a determined effort to ensure that the rates charged to country subscribers more nearly approximate those in force in the metropolitan area, particularly as they have to pay higher prices for practically every commodity they require. For instance, in the Cloncurry district, the price of flour is about &#163;10 per ton higher than it is in the more closely settled districts on the eastern seaboard. People are not likely to engage in rural occupations, and in that way assist the development of this country, unless they receive more encouragement than .at present. Governmental and semi -governmental authorities impose so many charges upon them that it is surprising that there are so many people living in country districts. When the country interests are concerned, the department should disregard the revenue received and afford reasonable facilities to those carrying on important developmental work. </para>
          <para>The Public Service Regulations provide that the Postal Department may employ boys from fourteen to fifteen years of age, but when these boys reach their sixteenth year and are entitled to a little more money, they may be discharged. The services of youths engaged at eighteen or nineteen years are also dispensed with when they reach the age of 21, and become entitled to the adult wage. During recent years there have been no examinations for juniors desiring employment in the Postal Department, and under the present system youths are employed for a couple of years and then turned adrift to find employment elsewhere. In some instances boys would have benefited had they not accepted employment in the Public Service, but most of them realized tib.at it was better to work for twelve months than not to have any work at all. Many who devoted all their spare time&#34; to improving their general knowledge and qualifying for positions in the Service, have found after a couple of years that their work has been only temporary. Postmasters should indicate clearly to applicants that the work upon which they are to be employed will last for only a specified period. In some instances girls are engaged at fourteen to operate a telephone switchboard; they may have rendered efficient service to the department for a number of years, but if no permanent position is available when they reach eighteen they are informed that their services will be no longer required. Country postmasters should be instructed to notify persons seeking such employment that the work will last for only a limited period. My only regret is that the ex-Postmaster-General has relinquished that portfolio. He was regarded by the members of all parties as the best mau who has ever occupied that position. He was always willing to do more than his successor is prepared to do. </para>

            <para>. - I direct the attention of the Minister representing the Postmaster-General to the important trunk telephone line connecting the South Coast with Sydney. As that line is constructed through country which is not served by a railway the telephone service is more extensively utilized than it is in districts where there are better transport facilities. For some time governments have been expending money in maintaining the existing line, and the present Government is also expending a considerable amount which, it is contended, will be  practically  wasted, because it is believed that within a year or  two  the Government will be compelled to construct a nev/ line. I have brought this matter under the notice of the department by  correspondence  because a large number of persons in the district continue to complain of the inefficiency of the service. </para>

          <para>There is little room for complaint as to the general progress made in connexion with our telephone services. Those who have been members of this House for some years, as I have been, realize that the complaints are not nearly so numerous as they were some years ago; but, as stated by the honorable member  for Kennedy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riordan),</inline> the department should make a determined effort to reduce the cost of telephone services. There are tens of thousands of homes and business places in cities and country districts in which telephones would be installed if the rates were reduced. If our telephone system were conducted by private enterprise I believe the service would be much cheaper than it is to-day. As it has always been the policy of governments to construct roads &#39;and bridges, sometimes at great cost, to serve only a few residents, it is only reasonable to provide effective telephonic communication even when the number of settlers who will benefit is limited. If the rates were reduced the increase in the number of subscribers would more than compensate the department for any anticipated loss of revenue. </para>
          <para>I trust that the Minister will also bring under the notice of the PostmasterGeneral the necessity to improve the wireless reception in the Federal &#39;Capital Territory. In Canberra, where there is a population of between  8,000  and  9,000  persons and in Goulburn  14,000  or  15,000,  the wireless reception is most unsatisfactory. Many listeners get better reception from the B class stations than from those under the control of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. The exPostnnisterGeneral was particularly alive to the necessity for improving this service by establishing relay stations, and there  is  nowhere in Australia where such a station is needed more than in the CanberraGoulburn district, which serves a large area. Many complaints are received from country districts concerning the reception ; often the interference by electrical equipment becomes so acute that listeningin is practically impossible. It is within the power of the Government to insist that those using such appliances should install a small attachment which has been found to be quite serviceable, and thus dispense with the interference which now prevails. The department directs its representatives in particular towns to instruct, say, a butcher operating an electrical sausage machine, or the proprietor of a laundry using electrical equipment, to install this attachment, and when the request is complied with the reception im proves immediately, but there is no law to compel its use. If the Government endeavoured to improve the service the revenue from licences would improve immediately. In many countrytowns persons who purchase wireless sets decide when their licence expires to dispose of them owing to the unsatisfactory service. Honorable members have received scores of complaints, and if the department wishes to improve the service it should insist that persons whose plant is responsible for interference shall attach the equipment I have mentioned. I trust that the Minister for Defence, who when PostmasterGeneral rendered such excellent service, will bring these matters under the notice of his colleague who at present controls the department. <inline font-style="italic">&#91;Quorum formed.&#93;</inline></para>

            <para>.- I  take it that the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill)</inline> is to-night representing the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson).</inline> I ask him whether he can make on behalf of the Government a statement as to what has been done in regard to the unification of railway gauges since the Governor-General&#39;s Speech at the opening of the present Parliament announced that consideration was to be directed to three principal matters, including the undertaking of certain works, and then went on to say - </para>

            <para>The selection of these works will be a matter for consultation with the States, which will be invited to consider such undertakings as the unification of the railway gauges between capital cities . . . </para>

          <para class="block">Although two months have since elapsed, we have had no further pronouncement from the Government. As Acting Minister for Markets and Transport, I introduced in  1930  a bill for the construction of the Port Augusta to Red Hill railway. Does the Government propose to revive that proposal? The railway to Red Hill on the standard gauge was opened in  1925. <inline font-style="italic">&#91;Quorum formed.&#93;</inline> There is urgent need for the construction of this additional link between Port Augusta and Red Hill, so as to shorten by twelve hours the time occupied in travelling between Western Australia and the Eastern States. The work would give immediate relief to the unemployed in South Australia, a State that has suffered severely  from the depression. Employment would be provided directly for approximately 1,000 persons and indirectly for an additional 3,000. The line would be a further link in the unification of railway gauges, and would ensure unhampered transport between Adelaide and Kalgoorlie, a feature which I believe would popularize land travel in preference to either sea or air transport. It would also be a great boon to livestock owners in the vicinity of Alice Springs, in Central Australia, by bringing the Adelaide stock market closer to them. At present stock have to be spelled for from &#34;24 to 36 hours on the journey. The estimated cost of the work when I brought forward the proposal was &#163;1,200,000. The Government should have very little difficulty in raising the necessary money. </para>
          <para>I should like to be informed of the present position in connexion with the contract entered into some years ago between the Commonwealth Government and Westralian Airways Limited. The Bruce-Page Government agreed to the payment of a subsidy for a period of five years at the rate of &#163;40,000 a year. This air service is in direct competition with the East-West railway, a public utility that cost &#163;7,000,000, and is losing approximately &#163;30,000 per annum. The company was so encouraged by the subsidy that it purchased a number of more commodious and up-to-date aeroplanes, hoping that it would withdraw further traffic from the railway. </para>
          <para>All agree that the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department is a most efficient public utility. It is an illustration of the fact that, under proper management, a big State enterprise can prove a wonderful success. Were it in the hands of private enterprise, the people of Australia would not be so well treated as they are to-day. We are told that all Commonwealthowned enterprises must inevitably be run at a loss. This is a shining example to the contrary. Last year it made a net profit of &#163;868,000, after paying &#163;1,702,000 on account of interest, and &#163;859,000 into a. sinking fund. </para>
          <para>The Minister for Defence was formerly a very good Postmaster-General. Is he in a position to make a statement of the Government&#39;s future policy in regard to wireless broadcasting? We have been advised from time to time that a number of additional broadcasting stations are to be established. I speak in advocacy of the claims of those who are residing in what are known as fading zones in different parts of Australia. The people of Bundaberg, in my electorate, complain bitterly of the very bad reception in that area, and ask that relief bc afforded by the erection of a relay station. </para>
          <para>I should like to know how many officers over 21 years of age are at present employed in the Postal Department at less than the basic wage for an adult employee. At one time the number was over 900. </para>
          <para>In view of the buoyancy of the finances, I stress the importance of reconsidering the allowance of unofficial postmasters and postmistresses, who are overworked and underpaid. They do not enjoy the benefits and privileges of permanent government servants, and are debarred from superannuation when they reach the age of retirement. Many thousands of them in remote country districts are rendering valuable services to the community. </para>
          <para>The honorable member for Kennedy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riordan)</inline> put the case of those who are engaged in dead-end occupations in country post offices, such as telegraph messengers who are expected to sleep on the job, and telephonists, who are dismissed after two or three years&#39; service. A system should be evolved for the absorption in the department of these employees, who are receiving useful training, upon their passing the necessary entrance examination. </para>
          <para>I invite the Minister to state whether the concessions in connexion with telephone rentals, which were withdrawn from hospitals when the finances were in a less buoyant state, have been restored. These deserving institutions are doing splendid work under extreme difficulties. </para>
          <para>For some time Rockhampton has suffered the disabilities of an out-of-date manual telephone system and has clamoured for an automatic exchange. I urge the Minister to indicate when that work will be put in hand. </para>
          <para>A large number of painters, carpenters and other tradesmen are out of employment. Now that the post office is making a substantial profit and the revenues  are buoyant, the Government should absorb many of them in the renovation and painting of Commonwealth buildings. </para>
          <para>In reply to a question asked on the 4th December of last year, the PostmasterGeneral said that it was intended to place 30 automatic telephone exchanges in centres where the subscribers numbered 40 or 50. Can the Minister for Defence mention the centres in which such exchanges are being installed? There is a clamant demand for them in a number of country centres in Queensland. Inasmuch as they provide a continuous service, they are a great, boon to those who are prepared to suffer the disabilities of country life. </para>
          <para>It would be interesting to learn the extent to which the manufacture of telephone equipment is now being carried out in Australia. The assurance should be given that as much as possible of this work will be given to Australian factories. There are companies which have the necessary plant and equipment, and are prepared to supply the requirements of the department. </para>
          <para>I stress the complaint of people who live in small country districts regarding the early closing of post offices. This applies particularly to allowance post offices. The hour of closing has in many cases been brought forward from 8 p.m. to 6 p.m., with the result that considerable inconvenience is caused to those who are working pastoral properties in outback areas in Central Queensland, because when they return to the homesteads at sundown they are unable to get into telephonic communication with their auctioneer and other business people. </para>
          <para>I urge greater generosity in the provision of mail facilities in country districts. Honorable members who represent large closer settlement areas are fully aware of the inconvenience suffered by those who have only a weekly mail service. Numerous instances have come to my notice within the last couple of years of the refusal of the department to provide muchneeded facilities. The customary reply is that the exigencies of the financial position will not permit of their being granted, or that the number of letters carried or the probable revenue does not justify the expenditure involved. Such requests should not be determined on the basis of pounds shillings and pence. The more thickly populated parts of Australia should bear any loss occasioned by the provision of adequate facilities for those who live in the far-flung country districts. I think the Postmaster-General is quite sympathetic, and I ask him to see that the department considers more generously the applications made to it from time to time. </para>

            <para>.- I have no local suggestions to offer or criticism of the department to make. I have always found the Deputy-Director of Post and Telegraphs in Victoria most prompt and helpful in his consideration of all proposals put up to him; but I do feel that I might make some useful suggestions to the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department as to ways in which it can render assistance to aviators in Australia. I know it is the policy of the department to render to aviators all facilities in the way of weather reports, and, having regard to the practical help it gives already, I feel confident that my suggestions will receive every consideration. One of the directions in which we can do most to make aviation safe is by providing prompt and accurate weather reports. At present it is the policy of the department to give to any aviator who telephones or telegraphs to any post office, a weather report from that office. I have found these weather reports are for the most part most accurate, considering how difficult it must be for postal officials, with little knowledge of flying conditions, to judge weather conditions. But the value of these weather reports is entirely dependent upon the promptness with which they can be received by the person requiring them. For instance, to ensure the greatest safety, it should be possible for a pilot about to set out on a flight to get a weather report within a few minutes before he leaves the ground. Let me illustrate my point : To get into either of the great capital cities of Sydney or Melbourne a cross-country aviator has to fly over mountain barriers within 30 or 40 miles of both capitals, and the crossing of them very often is most dangerous owing to the clouds being right down on the mountain tops. If an aviator knows what the weather conditions are at his destination, whether it be Sydney or Melbourne, it is quite possible for him to fly above the clouds and come down through them. A weather report received several hours beforehand is useless because both these cities are on the sca coast and fogs come up very rapidly. Only a few days ago I rang from Bendigo a post office in the ranges to the north of Melbourne, and was assured that the weather there was quite fine. That was so at the time. But I had to drive nine or ten miles to the aerodrome, and by the time I had started my engine and had flown to this locality, a fog had come up and I had to take a certain amount of risk in flying over the fog and coming down through it into Melbourne. If I had been able a minute or two before starting to receive a weather report from that office the postmaster would have said that a fog had come up. I suggest that one way in which the department can help is to give to calls for weather reports the same preference that is given to calls made for medical assistance. I do not know whether or not there is a regulation, but it is understood that if one rings for a doctor urgently one is immediately connected. The postal officials are always very willing to help, but it is not possible for them, without authority, to pass over other trunk calls that have been booked. By giving authority to put weather calls through promptly the department would make a great stride towards safer flying facilities. The day when a small aeroplane ca.n carry wireless is far distant. Another great help would be the installation of telephone boxes at all aerodromes, where it can be done without unreasonable expense, so that a pilot could ring up a post office after he had started his engine and immediately before taking off. These boxes should be enter able with a master key. The aerodrome at Duntroon, for instance, has a telephone box which, for obvious reasons, cannot be left open. A limited number of people have keys to it, but the average pilot arriving here, and the pilot who wants to get through most promptly seldom has a key to that box. If all such boxes could be fitted with a master key, which could be supplied to cross-country pilots for a fee - and I think all cross-country pilots would be glad to pay even a considerable fee - it would be a very great help. I have something now to say which concerns the Commonwealth Railways and applies equally to all railways in Australia. Every railway station should have the name of the town or village painted in large letters on the top of the station building. There have been in the history of flying in Australia at least two or three accidents, which people are convinced occurred through the pilot going down to try to read the name of a railway station on the board on the platform. Every one who has flown across country has had on occasions to risk coming down to about 100 feet over a railway station for that purpose. Without any great expense it should be possible to paint the name on the top of every railway station throughout Australia. This move would cost little and only requires to be suggested for all the railway commissioners to act upon it. Railway stations are particularly useful in this regard because of the fact that they are the most reliable landmarks. One can look down, see the name on railway stations and so locate oneself. Every village and town throughout Australia also should endeavour to have its name painted on the top of some local building. I do not wish to delay the committee, as I know that the Minister is anxious to reply to the debate. I raise this matter with some diffidence because it affects me personally, but since I am one of the few members of this Parliament who have experience of the difficulties of a cross-country pilot, I do not think that an apology is necessary. </para>

            <para>. - In the brief time at my disposal I shall not be able to deal with all the matters to which reference has been made during this debate. But I am sure that the practice which has prevailed on other occasions will be followed on this - that  a  copy of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> containing the report of the debate will be perused by the PostmasterGeneral, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan,</inline> and a communication will be forwarded to honorable members concerning any matters they have raised, if I am unable to deal with them at the present time. The  remarks made by the honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fairbairn)</inline> who spoke last, will be duly taken into consideration, because their importance will be realized by the department just as they have been realized by all who have heard them. May I say to the honorable member for Kennedy <inline font-weight="bold">(&#39;Mr. Riordan),</inline> who spoke of the Cairns post office, that he will find on the works estimates an item of &#163;5,000 to provide an entirely new post and telegraph office in that town. That should minimize, in some measure, his complaint in that respect. Similarly with regard to Rockhampton post office and the introduction of an automatic telephone service there, I would point out that &#163;9,000 for that particular purpose appears on the Estimates. Reference has been made to the desirableness of installing automatic telephones in several suburbs. The Petersham case is well known to me, as three or four deputations waited on me while I was Postmaster-General, and I have no doubt that other deputations with the same object in view will wait on my successor. The installation of an automatic exchange at Mascot and in other suburbs has also been mentioned. </para>

              <para>- And also at Kogarah. Every one prefers the automatic to the manually operated telephone system. But the department has felt that, as a business proposition, where there is any life left in a manual system it should be exhausted before an amount approximating, in many instances, in the case of the suburbs, &#163;30,000 or &#163;40,000, is expended in substituting for it a new automatic exchange. It would cost such a sum to install a new system in Petersham, North Sydney, Kogarah and probably in Mascot. It will be seen, therefore, that as a business concern the department, like any other commercial venture, must necessarily exhaust the usefulness of the service it has in existence before incurring the very considerable expenditure I have just mentioned in putting in an automatic exchange. So far as rural automatics are concerned I am informed by the department that because of financial reasons delay has taken place in their introduction, hut with the return of better conditions the work has been revived and 20 installations are being provided for on the Estimates for the current year. I regret that I am unable to give the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> a statement of the exact location of these exchanges, but an endeavour will be made to supply him with that information. The honorable member mentioned quite a number of other matters, and perhaps I can deal with some of them as they relate to subjects that were brought up by other honorable members. The concession to hospitals and ambulances has not been actually withdrawn. It was intended at one stage to withdraw the concession which these institutions enjoy and which is really in the nature of a contribution to their upkeep. They are after all State institutions and their upkeep is entirely a State responsibility. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. ARCHDALE</inline>PARKHILL.Yes; but the same remark applies to the public generally. They are State instrumentalities and it is the responsibility of the States to maintain them, so that what has been done by the post office is, in effect, a contribution to their upkeep by way of a reduction of their expenditure. I think that if the Federal Government, as a matter of policy, desires to make a contribution of this kind it should be made, and that as a business proposition the amount should be refunded to the Postal Department. In regard to Westralian Airways Limited, to which the honorable member for Capricornia referred, the contract that previously existed has been superseded by later aerial contracts connected with the overseas air mail service. The contract with the Defence  Department has expired, and from the 31st April, 1934, payment is made by the Postal Department on a non-contract basis. </para>

All these stations will embody every new feature which had been introduced in wireless broadcasting up to the time contracts were let. I am quite sure that when the new stations are in operation great benefit will accrue to the general public. </para>
          <para>Several honorable members urged a reduction of the charges for country telephone services. It is purely a matter of business; the telephones in the metropolitan areas are profitable because* of the larger number of subscribers. The loss on the telephone system in Australia is due to the carrying of the lines, quite justifiably, to remote country districts and the heavy cost of their maintenance. The loss on country services during the last three financial years has amounted to &#163;1,000,000, so that it can be said that the country subscribers have been granted a concession of that amount over and above the actual cost of installation. </para>

Apart from long distance lines for which special rates are charged, the average rental fee for country subscribers is &#163;3 5s. As a matter of fact a further concession was only lately given by the subdivision of the mileage groups up to 40 miles, which is estimated to involve the department in a loss of &#163;50,000 per annum. As to whether the department should incur further losses by giving additional concessions to country districts, that is a matter of policy which the department and the Government will take into consideration in the light of the views expressed by honorable members. </para>

I cannot understand why he sidestepped the question by asking me to place it on the notice-paper. He could have answered the question, which was of urgent importance, in view of the near approach of the Christmas holidays. The ordinance governing employment in the Capital Territory lays down that workmen shall be paid for all holidays, including Christmas Day, Boxing Day, Good Friday and Easter Monday. If these men are to be paid off before the Christmas holidays they are to be very -unfairly treated. The Minister must take responsibility for the memorandum which has been issued, and I ask him to say definitely now if it is the intention of the Government to put these men off to avoid payment for holidays? </para>

The position is this: Relief workers who have been receiving a few weeks continuous work close up to Christmas will be paid up to and including Friday, the 21st December, and will, in addition, receive, -as an act of grace, holiday-pay for one day. I am not in a position to say whether it will be possible to provide work for them after Christmas, but should circumstances permit the resumption of work by these men on the 2nd January, they will become entitled to the maximum holiday-pay of three days. </para>

            <para>.- Some time ago I moved the adjournment of the House to discuss a matter connected with Norfolk Island, and the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons),</inline> in his reply, read a statement by the Administrator of the island, which did not exactly fit in with statements made at a public meeting at which about twothirds of the adult population of the island were present. This matter concerned the deportation from Norfolk Island of an Australian-born citizen on the technicality that he could not pass a test in the German language. In view of statements made at that public meeting. I suggest that the matter be further investigated in order to determine what actually occurred. </para>

          <para>There is at present i: very serious dispute between the Administrator of Norfolk Island and a boating company which has been carrying on business there for a number of years. The Minister under  whose charge Norfolk Island is placed is forced .to accept the opinions and views expressed by officials, and has himself no personal knowledge that would enable him to use his own discretion. It is a significant fact that no Minister having control of the island has ever visited it. For a considerable time the boating company had carried on, but following on representations made by the Administrator a limited company was formed and the boating has since been carried on under a different system. Due to the actions of the Administrator some considerable time elapsed before this company was registered, and from that period a good deal of the trouble which exists on the island dates. A public meeting was held and quite a lot of correspondence passed between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Long,</inline> the secretary to the old boating company, and the Prime Minister&#39;s Department. Tip to the present no finality has been reached by the Prime Minister&#39;s Department on the matters raised. I ask the Minister to give very serious consideration to this matter and to be guided more by the views of the residents of the island than by the official reports which come from the Administrator. Reports presented to Parliament are often misleading. On one occasion the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons),</inline> through mis-reading a report, made a grave misstatement in this chamber. This would not have occurred if the Government had had an accurate knowledge of the position of affairs on the island. The dispute between the Administrator and the boating company should be considered seriously, because the inhabitants are not by any means contented. They are white folk like ourselves, and even the descendants of the mutineers of the <inline font-style="italic">Bounty</inline> have certain rights. </para>

He declared that the people on the island had real grievances, which arise from misunderstandings, and he condemned the Administrator in round terms. I gather that the trouble arose over a dispute in connexion with the celebration of Anzac Day. The Administrator, though invited to attend the gathering, refused to do so, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Onslow</inline> strongly criticized his action. It seems to me that the island authorities endeavoured to treat <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Onslow</inline> as the Commonwealth Government tried to deal with Walsh and Johnson. Desiring to deport him, they gave him a test in German; but, although well educated, he was unfamiliar with the language, and failed to pass the test. He and his wife were placed on a vessel and sent from the island as undesirable citizens. One of the charges made against him was that he had illicitly manufactured whisky. He is wealthy enough to be able to purchase all the whisky he can drink, and he declares that he can. prove his innocence. He stated that the trouble had occurred because he stirred up a hornet&#39;s nest by taking the side of the residents in the dispute with the Administrator. Speaking more on behalf of the islanders than in relation to the Onslow case, I claim that they are entitled to reasonable treatment, irrespective of their numbers.

          <para>In regard to the boating company, I understand that there is no wharf or quay on the island, and the Administrator found it necessary some time ago to promulgate an ordinance whereby the boats carrying goods between ocean-going vessels and the shore would be licensed and allowed to ply only on such conditions as were stipulated. I understand that the company which formerly supplied this service refused to comply with the new ordinance, the object of which was merely to ensure effective control. The Administrator called for a service, and other persons were found who were willing to abide by the ordinance. I understand that they obtained boating licences. Subsequently the original company retracted from its attitude and desired to obtain licences; but by that time the boats necessary to do the work had been registered, and there was no need for a further registration. This company has been making representations to the Government directly, and through other parties, to have what it regards as its grievances redressed. The matter has been investigated, and the Minister is satisfied that substantial justice has already been done. </para>

            <para>.- I again direct the attention of the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson)</inline> to the additional expenditure caused in the management of the government hotels in Canberra through the continuation of the commissariat branch. I was told on Friday that this subject could be discussed more fully when the Estimates for the Federal Capital Territory were under consideration. Since that time I have been asked by the permanent head of the Department of the Interior, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brown,</inline> whether I really desire a reply to my questions. I should not have asked them if I did not desire the information. It has been suggested to me that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Evans,</inline> the former manager of Hotel Canberra, has asked me to make a complaint regarding the management of government hotels in Canberra. Let me disabuse the minds of honorable members on that point. I have not seen <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Evans</inline> since early in last August. So far as I know, that gentleman did  his  work efficiently. Had that not been so, he would not have been retained in his job for seven years. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Evans</inline> did not. ask me to make any complaint. It has also been suggested that, a pressman asked me to make a complaint; but that also is incorrect. I want the information for myself. I cannot understand why it is necessary to maintain the commissariat section in connexion with the management of Hotel Canberra, for it must cause additional expenditure. </para>

I am told that although <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kay</inline> is manager of Hotel Canberra at present, he has nothing to do with the actual management.

          <para>I am pleased that I made this inquiry last, week, for the permanent head of the department told me that the Government had been robbed of thousands of pounds in the last few years. That statement is surely a justification for my statement that the commissariat section has not justified itself. I wish to make it quite clear that I have no feeling against either <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garrett</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bushby.</inline> I do not know either of them. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brown</inline> seemed to think that I had some axe to grind, and that I was antagonistic to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garrett</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bushby</inline> ; but that is not the case. I have no grievance against anybody, and I resent being asked whether I really wanted a reply to my questions. </para>

              <para>- The suggestion has been made. I do not know where <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Evans</inline> is at present; though I am told that he is managing a hotel in Sydney. If statements made to me about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Evans</inline> are correct, he should not have been employed as manager of the  hotel; he should have been somewhere else; but he should not be subjected to slander. Similarly, if what I have heard about a certain pressman is true, he should be compelled, by a court of law if necessary, to settle his dues, as he would have to do in respect of any privately conducted business. </para>

          <para>There are one or two other matters that I wish to mention in connexion with these hotels. I am told that the employees of the government establishments in Canberra are seething with discontent. This is not as it should be. One of their grounds of cam-plaint is that when they are absent for any reason or when business is slack at a particular establishment, and they are employed only part time, those of them who have not homes in Canberra have to pay for their meals in the ordinary way. I do not know the details of the award which governs cafe and hotel employees in the Federal Capital Territory, but it seems to me that the Government, which should be setting an example to private employers in the treatment of its employees, is actually exploiting those who work for it. </para>
          <para>The service at Hotel Canberra is, in my opinion, not as good as it should be at a hotel with a high tariff. That also suggests insufficient staff. Guests at Hotel Canberra are frequently obliged to ring for considerable periods to obtain the service of an attendant. I have been informed that when the Prime  Minister  was taken ill recently, one of his officers telephoned Hotel Canberra for <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Earle</inline> Page, but without success. Subsequently, the Prime Minister was taken to the hotel by car because it was thought that that would be a faster way to communicate  with the doctor than by telephone. That should not be so. </para>
          <para>I wish now to bring under the notice of the Minister a complaint that has been made to me regarding the tendering for supplies of dairy produce for government cafes, and hotels within the Territory. From 1930 to 1933 tenders for those supplies were called in the month of February. The successful tenderer for that period was Messrs. Foley Brothers, and I have been informed that in the first year of their service a saving of &#163;300 was made. At the beginning of February in each subsequent year, up to 1933, Messrs. Foley Brothers wrote to the commissariat department for a tender form, which they obtained, and on which they submitted their tender. But this year for some reason tenders were sought earlier than usual and Messrs. Foley Brothers were not asked to tender^ nor were they advised of the alteration in the time for tendering. Early in February they wrote as usual for a tender form, but were notified that tenders had closed. They then submitted a tender by telegram but were advised by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garrett</inline> that they had little chance of success. From that time until September they endeavoured to obtain certain information in regard to the tenders, but did not get it until a question on the subject was addressed to the then Minister for the Interior during an election - meeting in Goulburn. Had the commissariat department been conducting its affairs on business lines it would undoubtedly have obtained as many tenders as possible for its supplies of dairy produce and it certainly would not have overlooked the firm with which it had been dealing for several years. </para>
          <para>I hope that the Minister will give me the information that I desire on these points. </para>

            <para>. - The honorable member for Kennedy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riordan)</inline> has directed attention to what he considers to be unnecessary expenditure in the management of the government hotels and cafes in the Federal Capital Territory, and has referred particularly to the commissariat section. He has, however, overlooked the important fact that the Department of the Interior conducts not merely Hotel Canberra, but two hotels, six boarding establishments and two liquor cafes. The honorable gentleman must surely realize that a commissariat section Which buys wholesale for all those establishments is able to make a much better deal than a hotel manager buying for only one unit. </para>

              <para>- That might be done later; but we are not discussing that point at the moment. In the interests of efficiency and economy it is essential that the activities of these several establishments should be closely co-ordinated for both staffing and supply purposes. It is a decided advantage to be able to transfer staff temporarily from an establishment where business is quiet to another which is experiencing a rush. It is certainly possible to obtain supplies much more cheaply by purchasing wholesale for several establishments through a commissariat section than by purchasing for separate units through a manager. Obviously, also, transport and other charges can be reduced greatly under the present system of management.&#39; By calling for tenders and arranging contracts for the supply of goods for all establishments, considerable savings have been effected. The honorable  member  referred to certain losses which had been o sustained.- I assure him that those losses were certainly not incurred as a result of the practice of conducting this business through a commissariat branch. </para>

          <para>The honorable member for Kennedy also stated that during the time when honorable members were accommodated at the Hotel Kurrajong that establishment was efficiently managed without assistance from commissariat officers. The latter part of this statement is incorrect. The Hotel Kurrajong has been efficiently conducted by the manageress, and I give her full credit for her work, but at all times this establishment has formed part of the organization of .the commissariat section, and has been subject to the same conditions as the Hotel Canberra, or any other establishment. I am satisfied that the commissariat section is conducted efficiently and economically, and in the best interests of the taxpayers. It has been stated that during the recent royal visit two guests at the Hotel Kurrajong sharing the same room and dining at the same table may have been charged &#163;5 5s. and &#163;4 4s. per week respectively. That could easily have occurred. </para>

              <para>- That is so; I have been reliably informed that the Sydney police will not employ Lynch or give him the opportunity to engage in his nefarious practice of &#34;framing&#34; innocent people. When Lynch came to Canberra he told certain residents in this city that his name was Doone, and that he was a cousin of Alan Doone, the well-known lyric tenor. By these representations, Lynch got into the good graces of the residents. He spent money lavishly, inviting different citizens to cocktail parties, and then casually inquired as to where he could make a bet for the Saturday race meetings. As a result, several people resident in this Territory were framed &#34; by this man on perjured evidence. In reply to a question asked by me, the Government admitted that it had paid Lynch &#163;200 for his nefarious work in Canberra, and now it is increasing the vote for the local police force by &#163;1,200, part of which may be paid to the same man. I am prepared to divide the committee on this question to see how many of the Government supporters favour the employment of pimps in the Federal Capital Territory. Are the police of this Territory so incompetent that they cannot detect a technical breach of some ordinance and have to employ a rejected pimp to help them in that work? I assure the Minister that the Sydney police will not employ this man. I understand that Detective-sergeant James, of the Sydney Police Force, held an inquiry into Lynch&#39;s conduct, and subsequently advised that he should not be further employed. In view of these facts, it is surprising that the Federal Capital Territory police should send to Sydney to secure the services of this man. I admit that the present Minister was not in charge of the Federal Capital Territory when this action was taken, but I warn him to see that this scandal does not happen again. </para>

The proposed vote for salaries and payments in the nature of salaries for this year amounts to &#163;5,002, as compared with &#163;4,685 provided last year. The increase is accounted for by the restoration of salaries that were reduced under the Financial Emergency Act, and statutory increments. </para>

              <para>- The Minister has not dealt with this matter since consideration of the Estimates was commenced. For the &#34; Transfer of staffs and office equipment to the Federal Capital Territory &#34; the provision this year is &#163;4,000, as compared with &#163;6,000 voted under the same  heading last year. Because of the decrease I ask the Minister whether he intends to push ahead with the transfer of departments not yet located in Canberra. Either ail departments should be established here or consideration should be given to the desirability of abandoning the whole scheme. No one would seriously suggest that the latter course should be adopted. If it is right to have a majority of the departments here, surely the whole of them should be transferred to the Seat of Government. Last year the vote for the Forestry Branch was &#163;3,150, and the actual expenditure amounted to &#163;3,662. The amount provided for this year is &#163;3,000. What is the reason for the reduction ? Those who were present at the distribution of prizes at the Forestry School this morning were greatly impressed by the remarks of the Inspector-General of Forestry in presenting the annual report which showed that wonderfully good work had been done by the school last year. We were informed that one State is not co-operating with the Commonwealth in carrying on the Forestry School at Canberra, but were not told which State is standing out, nor have we been informed of the reason for the curtailment of expenditure on this branch of the Government&#39;s activities. If developed on sound lines Government forests should prove a good investment and give work to a large number of persons throughout the Commonwealth who are at present unemployed. Has the Government a national forestry scheme in view? I notice also an item of &#163;4,000 for the vocational training of youths in the Federal Capital Territory. This is a new proposal of which we should have some explanation. Can the Minister say what chances there are of placing in employment youths who pass through the vocational school; what educational standard is necessary for youths entering the school; and whether it is to be carried on in conjunction . with the school at Telopea Park, Canberra? Within the last few weeks there has been a renewal of the agitation for the representation in this Parliament of the residents in the Federal Capital Territory. Public meetings have been held and deputations have waited upon the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline><inline font-style="italic">Forde.</inline> in connexion with the matter. Can he state whether the Government has given consideration to the proposal, and if so, what decision has been reached? </para>

            <para>. - I direct attention to newspaper reports published recently to  the  effect that it is the intention  of  the Government either to ask  for  the resignation of the Administrator of Papua <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Hubert Murray)</inline> or failing his resignation, to retire him from his  present  position in order to appoint in  his  stead the honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marr)</inline> who, it is understood, will resign his position as Assistant Minister at the conclusion of the visit of  His  Royal Highness the Duke of Gloucester.  This  is a live issue in political circles, and I think I am expressing the opinion generally held, not only in the Commonwealth, but in the territory concerned, that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Hubert</inline> Murray is the most capable Administrator who has served  the  Commonwealth in any of its territories. Residents of Papua are, I believe, deeply perturbed by the rumour. I understand that they are perfectly satisfied with the present Administrator whose fairness and ability are not questioned. They feel that nothing should be done to disturb his tenure of the office. </para>

          <para>. - I  direct  the  attention of the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson)</inline> to the fact that, while permanent and temporary poll clerks engaged at election booths receive overtime rates, the divisional returning officers, who, in all cases, render excellent and impartial service to candidates, do not receive such consideration, notwithstanding the long hours they work and the frequent elections they have had to contend with in recent years. As this matter has been brought under the notice of various governments from time to time, and nothing has been done, I promised to ask that the anomaly be removed. Divisional returning officers, who do everything possible to ensure that elections are conducted in a fair manner, should be remunerated more in keeping with the responsible work which they perform. Is the Minister agreeable to such officers receiving a higher salary or payment for overtime? </para>

          <para>. -  I support the request of the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James)</inline> with respect  to  divisional returning officers. Owing to the cheeseparing attitude of the department, the voting facilities provided in the Lang electorate are totally inadequate. The congestion which occurred at the polling booth in the Arncliffe subdivision at the last election was  a  disgrace to the Electoral Branch. For that the divisional returning officer was not responsible. As every facility should be afforded to electors to record their votes, the saving of  a  few pounds by neglecting to provide additional accommodation cannot be justified. Some electors can provide their own transport, but there are others who are compelled  to  travel long distances to record their votes. Moreover, I contend that the present system of asking candidates to make a declaration with respect to their electioneering expenses should be dispensed with. I trust that the Minister will instruct the Electoral Branch to provide additional polling booths in New SouthWales where there has been congestion. </para>

          <para>.- Will the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson)</inline> explain why the date on which tenders closed for the supply of dairy produce to government hotels and hostels for 1934 closed fourteen days earlier than in previous years ? I should also like to know why the successful tenderer for the previous four years was not notified of the change of date, and was thus deprived of the opportunity to tender? Although the firm despatched a telegraphic tender, it was received the day after tenders had closed, and could not be considered. The alteration of the closing date prevented a firm which had previously saved the Government &#163;300 in one year from submitting a tender. </para>

            <para>- I wish to convince honorable members of the futility of expenditure upon disarmament conferences in the pious hope that they will  exert an influence for the preservation of world peace. At the 1932 Disarmament Conference, the French delegation included M. Charles Dumont, of the  Schneider-Creusot  armaments firm, and the British delegation, Colonel A. 6.  Daway,  the brother of a director of Vickers Armstrongs, and now the political supervisor of the British Broadcasting Corporation. I think every honorable member will agree that the object of these gentlemen would be, not to preserve the peace of the world, but rather to promote the interests of firms engaged in the private manufacture of armaments. They would be prone to forward the ideal, not of world peace, but of world warfare. As a matter of fact, the only industry which flourishes as the result of competition is the armaments industry, because, the greater the competition among them for the various markets, the greater is the prosperity of each competitor. The ramifications of the ring engaged in this traffic are so extensive that it is able to buy and control legislatures, politicians, _ and high naval and military authorities. Included in the list of shareholders of Vickers Armstrongs are the Bight Honorable Neville Chamberlain, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Austen</inline> Chamberlain - winner of the Nobel peace prize in 1925 ! - and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Simon, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, whose opinions were quoted earlier in the day by government members in answer to arguments put forward by honorable members who sit on this side of the House. They then said that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Simon is not a shareholder of this firm. According to the records, he ceased to be a shareholder some time ago; but we know that it is quite possible for him still to retain his interest by having a dummy to act on his behalf. </para>

        <para>One of two illustrations of the manner in which these people carry on their operations will demonstrate to the general public the fact that the only purpose served by the appropriation of Commonwealth revenues for the continuance of alleged disarmament conferences is to enable members of the Government and others who are favoured by it to take trips abroad at the public expense. As I have already said, legislatures and politicians are bought by these people and support them in their operations, which tend towards the prolongation of wars and the disturbance of world peace. Armament vendors find that it is profitable for them to do that. Proof of the manner in which they can prolong wars is furnished by happenings during the great World War of 1914-18. If one combatant was in danger of running short of a basic raw material, his competitors in an enemy country carne to his aid. That can be proved from the records. English and French industries, through a neutral intermediary, maintained into Germany a steady stream of glycerine, nickel, copper, oil and rubber. </para>

            <para>- The bill proposes to appropriate this year &#163;250 for what is termed a world conference on the reduction and limitation of armaments. Although the amount is small, I contend that the expenditure is not warranted, in view of the experience of men who have closely watched the progress of events in this and other parts of the world. I was pointing out that the influence wielded by those who make a profit out of war is so vast that the mere discussion of disagreements at an alleged disarmament conference is not likely to induce in. the nations of the world a readiness to settle their differences peacefully by means of arbitration. That being so, the expenditure of even the small amount of &#163;250 upon the representation of Australia is not only unwise, but also unwarranted. </para>

Very little imagination is needed to realize the purpose for which that was required.

            <para>- I have already ruled that the discussion must relate to the bill rather than to the Estimates. The Committee of Supply passed the Estimates after debate, the resolution was reported to the House, which resolved itself into Committee of Ways and Means. That committee&#39;s resolution was adopted by the House. The items are now submitted for final ratification in the schedule to the Appropriation Bill. I think that the latitude permissible in n discussion on an amendment in Committee of Supply does not extend to the committee stages of an Appropriation Bill. The debate must then be relevant to the bill itself. I must rule, therefore, that the honorable member has exceeded that which can be permitted in the discussion on this hill. </para>

            <para>- In any case, for  the  reasons I have already given, I am opposed to the expenditure of this money upon a world conference on the reduction and limitation of armaments. Many honorable members opposite may be prepared to vote away Commonwealth revenues merely because such a proposal is brought down by Cabinet, but the Opposition is not prepared to do so. It is not ready to vote moneys to provide pleasure trips overseas for members and supporters of the Government. Owing to the application of the guillotine, many honorable members have not been able to refer to various items under the heading &#34;Miscellaneous claims&#34; concerning which they desire to obtain information. </para>

        <para class="block">There is, for instance, an item of &#163;52,000 under the heading of &#34; Contributions to cost of Secretariat of League of Nations &#34;.

            <para>- The schedule includes an amount of &#163;850 for &#34; Commonwealth Representation at the International Labour Conference, Geneva &#34;. The conference each year discusses very important questions concerning working conditions in various parts of the world; but its decisions have had very little effect in improving the lot of workers in any country, because the participating countries Lave never ratified any of its decisions which were of any consequence to the workers. Those countries which claim to have the &#39;most advanced working and social conditions for their workers show the least desire to improve the conditions of people of the more backward countries. Because of the wide ramifications of international capitalism British financiers are as much interested in repressing the Indian labourer and the Chinese coolie, as are the capitalists in those countries. The capitalists have various interests to serve, and wherever they are operating, they are internationalists in the truest sense of the word. They know no nationality, colour, or flag. It matters not to them whether the workers they exploit are white, yellow or black, and no people can possibly enjoy any improvement, of their conditions as the outcome of decisions of the International Labour Conference. It may be possible for workingclass organizations to obtain valuable data from the investigations carried out by the International Labour Office, but the workers will receive no actual benefit from conference resolutions. </para>

        <para>The &#34;goodwill mission to the East&#34; was undertaken last year under the leadership of a former member of this Parliament. I thought that the expenditure incurred had been already paid, but I find on the Estimates for the current year a provision of a further &#163;100 under this heading. The report furnished by the leader of the mission stated that he had obtained very valuable information during his trip abroad, but immediately after his return to Australia, and the expenditure of many thousands of pounds of the taxpayers&#39; money on a pleasure jaunt, he retired from this Parliament, and the whole of his experiences, whatever their value, have been lost to the Parliament. The Government is not warranted in meeting further expenditure on what  it has been pleased to call a goodwill mission. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Latham,</inline> who occupied a very influential position in the Cabinet, probably selected himself for that trip at the expense of the Commonwealth. I was opposed to the expenditure of this money at the time it was proposed, and I am definitely against any further payments. I ask the Minister to explain the reason for this provision of &#163;100. Is it to cover outstanding personal accounts of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Latham?</inline> I impress upon the committee my opposition to the expenditure of money on the three items which I have mentioned. I know that so far as obtaining any direct result is concerned, our opposition is futile, but that should not deter members of the Labour party from exposing the hypocrisy of those who give lip services to the cause of peace. </para>

          <para>. -  The honorable member for East Sydney has raised a matter which was debated at some length earlier in the day. So far as it was conclusive at all, the debate showed that the majority of honorable members are in favour of some curtailment of the right of private individuals to make munitions of war and have complete freedom in respect of their sale. Speaking to the motion this afternoon I reminded honorable members of the fact that there are certain misconceptions in this regard, in that active steps had been taken in the past to curtail the freedom of private manufacture and international circulation of munitions of war. In 1925, a convention was devised at Geneva to which all the members of the League of Nations were invited to adhere. Up to date only fourteen out of the 50 countries which are members of the League have adhered to the convention; prominent among the adherents are Great Britain and Australia. Had sufficient countries adhered, there would have been a wide range of restriction on private manufacture of armaments and their international circulation. </para>

            <para>- The honorable member is unduly suspicious of individuals. There is still some nobility of character among individuals, and the mere association of a delegate with the firm of Vickers, through his brother&#39;s wife&#39;s cousin, is not sufficient to carry conviction that the individual concerned is a scoundrel. It is evidently difficult for the honorable member to realize that there are some people who have decent feelings and high standards of conduct. As I have said, in- 1925 efforts were made to achieve a convention, to which the majority of countries would adhere, to limit the private manufacture and circulation of arms. Great Britain has been very active in trying to get this convention concluded, but has realized that it is most unlikely that sufficient countries will adhere to bring it into force. So Great Britain was prominent in getting the Disarmament Conference at Geneva to revise the convention, so that it would command the support of sufficient countries to bring it into operation. </para>

            <para>- Being convinced that there was no chance of a majority of countries adhering to the 1925 convention, Great Britain has been urging the Disarmament Conference at Geneva to bring forward for signature by various countries a revised convention in a form acceptable to them. This is one of the principal activities at the present time of the Disarmament Bureau of the conference. If there were no greater object in view than to bring this convention into operation, which, in a short period, would have a definite effect, it is hoped, on the private manufacture and circulation of armaments, the expenditure of &#163;250 by </para>

          <para>.- I understand that a contract at a price of about &#163;180,000 has been let for the installation of a cable telephone service between Tasmania and the mainland, because of the isolation which my State has suffered for many years. Honorable members from Tasmania, when in Canberra, do not enjoy the same telephone facilities as those at the disposal of other honorable members. When Tasmanian members desire quick communication with persons in their home State, they must send telegrams, and wait for replies. I hope that the work of providing the much-needed telephone service will be expedited. </para>

          <para>.- Although Canberra is situated in an agricultural district, it is surprising to find that the cost of living is much higher in the Federal Capital Territory than in almost any other part of Australia. Almost all the ordinary requirements of the people - even fruit - have to be secured from outside sources. A huge expenditure has been incurred in providing Canberra with parks and gardens, yet little has been done in the direction of reducing the cost of living. The short line of railway connecting Queanbeyan with the Federal Capital is under Commonwealth control, but only one waybill should be required. The extra freight due to the charge imposed, on the branch line from Queanbeyan to Canberra helps to add to the cost of living, which is greater here than on the Kalgoorlie goldfields. This cost should not be more than in an average country town. </para>

          <para>.- The remarks of the Assistant Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey),</inline> in reply to the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward),</inline> are astonishing. &#39;He said that the British Government favours the abolition of the private manufacture of armaments. This subject was discussed recently in the House of Commons at the instance of the Labour party, whose proposals were definitely rejected by the British Government. The Minister remarked that that government was waiting for action to be taken by other countries ; but, if it sincerely desired to put an end to the private manufacture of armaments and munitions in Great Britain it need not wait for international agreement on the subject; it could take effective action immediately. No doubt  some members of the present British Government are directly interested in private armament and munition firms. </para>

              <para>I understand that an act of the New South Wales Parliament passed in 1930 made provision for an option of purchase &#60;of Moscheto Island by Imperial Chemical Industries of Australia and New Zealand Limited, a company incorporated in Victoria, the option to be exercisable only within two years from the 30th May, 1930. The option was not exercised by the company. fi. The Government will not lie in a position to make any announcement in this regard until the committee appointed to inquire into the question of establishing a plant in Australia for the production of oil from coal by the hydrogenation process is in a position to give decisive answers to its reference. There are nt present po many unknown and undetermined factors, coupled with the question of obsolescence of plant, that it is not possible to determine the method or measure of protection that should be afforded the oil from coal industry. In these circumstances, a statement on the lines suggested would at present bc: premature. In the report furnished to thiCommonwealth Government the committee stated that pending experience of working of the large-scale experiment at  BillinghamonTea  no private organization adequately informed of the position would embark upon a premature venture of the kind: and the risking of public money would be equally unjustifiable. The position in regard to the shale oil industry is receiving consideration in the light of the report of the Newnes Investigation Committee and of discussions which have taken place since that report was prepared. </para>

              <para>The committee appointed to inquire into the question of establishing a plant in Australia for the production of oil from coal by the hydrogenation process was asked to report, amongst other matters, as to the employment possibilities of this industry. In this regard the committee stated that in the opinion of Imperial Chemical Industries Limited a plant  hydrogenating  1.000 tons of bituminous coal per day, or its equivalent in dry brown coal, would employ approximately 350 men on what is commonly termed staff-grade, 1,900 process workers, and a further 700 men engaged indirectly on maintenance. This personnel is apart from&#39; the minors who would be required for the daily production of 2,330 tons of bituminous coal, or, alternatively, 10,500 tons of wet brown coal. </para>
