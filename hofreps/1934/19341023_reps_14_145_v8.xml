                        has been a member of this House and of various Commonwealth parliaments for a considerable number of years, during which period he has earned the admiration, respect and esteem of, not only his own constituents in Tasmania, but also all honorable members of this House who have come in contact with him. He is a man of irreproachable character, and is upright and fearless in every respect. He is truly a fit and proper person to occupy the high position of  Speaker.  During the last Parliament he was  Chairman  of Committees, in which position he distinguished himself, and showed that he had a full knowledge of the practices and Standing Orders of the House. Another noteworthy feature of his service in the position of  Chairman  of Committees was his absolute impartiality. I believe that honorable members of all parties can testify as to that fact. In every way he upheld the dignity of the position, and he was efficient in all respects. I submit his name to the House with every confidence, feeling sure that he will at all times uphold the splendid traditions that surround the Speaker's chair and enhance the reputation and dignity of this, the National Parliament.

                                <para>- The honorable member who interjects was weeping for three weeks prior to the elections, and, if it had not been for his friends, the Communists, he would not be sitting in this House today. You will recall, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Parkes,</inline> that we sat here day after day last session, and heard the honorable member for Barton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lane)</inline> say " We must deport all Communists from this country ". Then the ex-Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> brought down an amendment of the Crimes Act. I notice that the present honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> has taken <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Latham's</inline> place; I shall refer later to the honorable gentleman. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Latham</inline> brought down the amending act, the honorable member for Barton declared to the Tories of his electorate, and of every other part of Australia. " Now we shall deport all Communists ". But it has since been ascertained that only 401 deportations have occurred during the life of the Nationalist and United Australia Party Governments, and that not one person has been deported for a political offence. We know the reason for this. The honorable member for Barton interviewed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Latham</inline> - I have heard it in confidence, but I break that confidence to-day - and said, " Do not deport the Communists from Barton ; they are my friends, and they will vote for me". When at the subsequent election <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lane</inline> was leading on the first preferences by a few votes, and the result depended on the distribution of the second preferences, he got the biggest majority of the Communists' 400 votes. </para>

                        <para>Another candidate for Barton was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Albert</inline> Willis, whom <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lane</inline> used to vilify. You have heard of him, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Parkes.</inline> He went down to Bulli and " ratted " on the Labour party. He afterwards joined the " T.B. " party in New South Wales. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lane</inline> said to him, " You know, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Willis,</inline> that I am with you. Give me your No. 2 votes And that is how Albert Lane got in! The honorable member suggested that I should not weep, but he was weeping and wailing all the time after the election started, until he got the assurances which he sought. </para>
                        <para>Before introducing some of the new members I shall deal with a few of my old friends. There is the honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marr).</inline> He represents an electorate which adjoins mine. I understand that he will be <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Marr in a short time. I saw his picture the other day. He appeared in a high hat, carried gloves in his left hand, and had a walking stick, and spats to match. He looked like a Berkshire pig. Nevertheless, I understand that he is going to resign his position in this parliament if he be made a <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, and</inline> that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stevens,</inline> the Premier of New South Wales, will take his seat. I was a bit jealous when I heard that. I was reputed to be <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang's</inline> dummy, but the honorable member for Parkes is now apparently <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stevens'</inline> dummy. </para>
                        <para>Next I come to the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Henry Gullett).</inline> He is one of the most capable men in the Ministry, and an ardent Tory and Nationalist. We all know where he stands. The next member of the Cabinet to whom I wish  to refer is the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. E. J. Harrison),</inline> a man of genial disposition, and who, prior to entering this Parliament, joined the All for Australia League. </para>

The honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Perkins),</inline> who, in  the last Parliament, was on the Treasury bench, has now to take a seat at the back. There was a good deal of shuffling  in  the Nationalist Consultative Council, in Sydney, and, after negotiations, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir James</inline> Murdoch and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sidney</inline> Snow conferred with the present Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill)</inline> and said "If you do not put Harrison in the Cabinet there will be trouble in New South Wales". </para>

                                <para>- I do not mind what the honorable member says. I shall deal with him later. We know the fight which the present Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. E. J. Harrison)</inline> put up on behalf of Japanese manufacturers when certain tariff items were before the last Parliament. On that occasion he tried to convince the House that Japanese pearl buttons should be allowed into this country free of duty. Some of our friends in the Country party, including the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory),</inline> said that he was a brilliant young man for suggesting such a thing. So now he is in the Cabinet. </para>

Although he occupies the important position of Minister for Commerce, he has had no rural experience. In fact it has been said on innumerable occasions that not one member of the present Cabinet represents a country constituency. What is wrong with the honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hawker)?</inline> Why should he not be the representative in the Cabinet of country interests? I cannot understand why he has not been included in the Ministry. Next we have the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White).</inline> Of him I say that he is the most humorous man in the House. </para>
                        <para>I now come to the right honorable the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons),</inline> who, prior to and during the last general election, said that the party which he leads was going to win seats everywhere. Tasmania has returned three Labour representatives for constituencies 'previously represented by members of the United Australia paTty; and had a representative of the Federal Labour party contested the Wilmot electorate, the right honorable the Prime Minister possibly would not himself be here. He will not be let off so easily on the next occasion. </para>
                        <para>I now come to the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies),</inline> of whom we have heard a lot, and who is now holding the seat previously held by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Latham.</inline> Although we fought that gentleman politically, and know that he was a hard, cold, calculating lawyer, we recognized that he possessed a great deal of ability. I do not think the new Attorney-General will ever catch up to his predecessor in that respect. However, I shall judge him by his actions. I shall still be here, when he has been defeated, to tell the people in the next parliament, including the Labour member who wins Kooyong, what sort of a man he was. </para>
                        <para>Next I come to the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> who sat in this parliament for the last eight or nine years, yet could not get into the Cabinet.

                                <para>- I have already heard it said that the Country party proposes to start a vigorous campaign against the United Australia party, and the right honorable member for North Sydney has been made a member of the Cabinet, because he is the only man opposite  capable of drawing crowds, and consequently is to be sent into country constituencies to 'break down the attack of the Country party. The right honorable member has a very hard row to hoe. It was hard enough for Moses when he led the wandering Jews, but he was on a velvet seat compared with Billy Hughes. </para>

                        <para>The next gentleman, whom I desire to introduce to the House, is the Assistant Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey).</inline> He possesses a good name, but he is a hard-hearted man. I have been to him on numerous occasions in connexion with pension cases. Honorable members know how pensioners are being treated. A man with the name the Assistant Treasurer bears should have acted differently, and, if he has a good heart, he should be able to do something for these unfortunate people in the future. At any rate, he is again occupying a seat on the Treasury bench as an Assistant Minister, while <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harrison,</inline> who waa not previously in the Cabinet, is a fullyfledged Minister. How can that be accounted for? I have about 25 pensioners' cases which I propose to bring before the Assistant Treasurer at the earliest opportunity. Another gentleman on the treasury bench is the Assistant Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis)</inline> who in the last parliament was also administering war service homes. During his administration more returned soldiers have been evicted from their homes than have been evicted by any number of landlords in Australia. </para>
                        <para>I now come to our genial old friend, who is shading his eyes and looking into the distance. I refer to the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archdale Parkhill).</inline> I should like to know if the right honorable the Prime Minister proposes to make him deputy-leader of the party. At any rate, that is what the people in New South Wales wish to know. They think that the representation of other States is already too strong, and they do not wish the Attorney-General to be appointed  deputy  leader of the party. New South Wales should be given a chance by placing the Minister for Defence in that position. </para>
                        <para>Passing from the Treasury bench I come to the honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hutchinson).</inline> He is not a bad youth, and I shall let him go. As is well known he had  a  terrific scramble to retain his seat. I read in the press where he said that in the House he had supported the claim* of the tobacco-growers, but I remember the night when the honorable member for Henty and the ex-Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> grabbed him by the arm as he was crossing to vote with honorable members on this side of the chamber, and said " Don't go over amongst those fellows, they are red. You are young, stop over on this side." </para>
                        <para>The next gentleman, who catches my eye, is the honorable member  for  Darling Downs <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Littleton Groom)</inline> - a gentleman who should be elected  Speaker.  I say that with due respect to the honorable member for Darwin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bell),</inline> who has been proposed for that position, because probably by six o'clock to-morrow morning, I shall be under his jurisdiction. A good deal can be said in favour of the honorable member for Darling Downs, but for two substantial reasons he deserves my support. The first is that he declined to help the government of the day which proposed to dispense with the federal arbitration system. I am pleased to see that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Littleton</inline> is still with us. If he is ever defeated politically I hope it will be by a true Labour man. I also recall the morning when it is said we raided the Treasury by voting for an additional £75 to our parliamentary allowance. When others were afraid to do so, the honorable member for Darling Downs stood up and supported the proposed restoration. </para>
                        <para>I come next to the new member  for  Martin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McCall).</inline> I  remember  it being broadcast on the night of the election that William "Valentino" McCall would be the handsomest man in Parliament. Previously, the honour of being the handsomest man in Parliament was equally divided between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> and myself, and  we  both felt hurt. But I shall have a talk with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> to see if we can hand to the new honorable member the belt for being the best looking man in the House. He has his hair, however, parted a little bit too far on one side, and if he seeks to be a proper Valentino he must use a little more oil. I remember that when the honorable member went into the electorate of Martin to fight for the selection against the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman</inline> he declared that this was the day of youth. He said, " We must have young men in the Commonwealth Parliament". I advise him now to glance at the occupants of the Treasury bench. He will probably go back to the people of Roseville and Bellara and say, "I withdraw the statement that old men should not be in the Parliament. They are there. I have nothing to say against those men. They are good old men". Here, sitting on my right, is one of the greatest old men who ever drew breath, my old friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maloney.</inline> If I were in the Parliamentary Labour party at  a  time when it had to choose a Ministry, I should vote for <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maloney</inline> to be in the Cabinet. When the new honorable member said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman</inline> was too old and that this was the time for young men he was  a  long way astray. When he opposed my friend the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> he got the honorable member for Parramatta to arrange for a meeting of bus-drivers and bus conductors at Rose Bay. He said to those men, " Gentlemen, if you return mc to Parliament on Saturday week, I give you my assurance that we shall have the buses on the road again within  a  fortnight ". The Stevens Government has been in office for a long while, but ask the honorable member for Parramatta if the buses were on the road again in  a  fortnight. I have not heard of the honorable member for Martin addressing the bus boys recently, and promising to get their jobs back again, but no doubt he will be able to explain that after I have resumed my seat. I want him to do so. </para>
                        <para>The next gentlemen I come to are the honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fisken)</inline> and the honorable member for Corangamite <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Street).</inline> They are like Siamese twins. Both appear in swallowtail coats and white spats. But their spats are the wrong colour. They should see to this. I remember, many years ago, when Frank Burge,  a  prominent footballer, was in his prime. He represented Australia and also New South Wales on the football field on numerous occasions. He was the idol of the people of Glebe, particularly the young fraternity. He used to  wear  his hair quite long over his collar, but  one  day he went into the hairdressers  and  had a neck shave.  His  hair was cut square across the top of the neck. When he appeared on the street on Monday morning, and for the rest of the week, every young man in Glebe was anxious to get his hair cut like Burge's. When the young fellows went into the hairdressers' saloons, the attendants said, " How will you have it done ", and the young men replied, "The same as Frank Burge's ". I also recollect that a good many  yeaTs  ago our friends Charlie Marr, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Parkhill,</inline> went into Buckley and Nunn's, in Melbourne, to buy spats. That  was  at the time when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. S.</inline> M. Bruce introduced spats into this Parliament. When they entered the shop the assistant asked them what they wanted, and  they  said, " Spats ". He said to them, " What kind"? They replied, "Just  the  same as Stan's". They followed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. S.</inline> M. Bruce, and to the new honorable members I say, " Gentlemen, you  are  dressed incorrectly for the Duke to-morrow. You need some dye on your white spats ". </para>
                        <para>I have already referred to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lane,</inline> and I notice that since then he has not interjected. Why not? </para>

                        <para>I shall not comment upon the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell).</inline> I did not expect the honorable member for Grey <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McBride)</inline> back here again. And we all thought the honorable member for Boothby <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Price)</inline> a " goner ". He  had  to get  the  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> to go over to South Australia to save  him.  The people said : " We don't want Price,  we  want one of our own men ". But,  anyhow,  he got through. </para>
                        <para>The honorable member for Macquarie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. John Lawson)</inline> also had  a  very tough " go ". But for the T.B. and the Communist votes he would not have got through. The T.B. vote put him in. At one stage <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jennings,</inline> the honorable member for Watson, was having  a  very tough " go ", but after a while things eased' up for him. </para>
                        <para>I now come to the honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stacey).</inline> We anticipated right through that he would be beaten. When the first preferences were counted, he was between 5,000 and 6,000 votes down; but the weaklings of the Labour party voted for two renegades and gave the honorable member their second preferences. He is, therefore, here by the grace of the Labour party. </para>
                        <para>Then there is the leader of the Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page).</inline> I must " tickle him up ". Ho had a unity conference three week!! ago in Melbourne with the Prime Minister. I should like to have been present to hear what they discussed, but we can well imagine it. The Doctor, no doubt, came into the room and said, "Well, Joe, we want three seats in the Cabinet - myself and Tom Paterson as two certainties, and then, for the third seat, we want Jimmy Hunter ". But the Prime Minister, as we know, was particularly anxious to get the honorable member for Gwydir <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Abbott)</inline> into the Cabinet. About twelve months ago when there was some talk about a Fusion Government consisting of members of the Country party and members of the United Australia party, you and I, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Parkes,</inline> were walking down towards the Hotel Canberra talking of the three or four most likely men to go into the Government. The newspapers said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thorby</inline> would be one and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Abbott</inline> another. Suddenly two men dashed past. One was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Abbott,</inline> and Joe Lyons was following him declaring that he wanted to catch <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Abbott</inline> as he was anxious to get him to join the Ministry ; " but " he added, " I cannot catch him ". Now <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Abbott</inline> says that he will never join the Ministry. </para>
                        <para>The next we come to is the member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser).</inline> He is all right. The member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McClelland)</inline> has not been here very long. He is, comparatively, a new member. When he has been here as long as I have he will be all right. </para>
                        <para>Now I come to the honorable member for Calare <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thorby).</inline> He put up a big fight, and in the course of it said some awful things about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons.</inline> He likened <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons</inline> to Ned Kelly. Afterwards he thought that he had better apologize, so he apologized to Ned Kelly. </para>
                        <para class="block">When the fight started in Calare, the candidates set to work to tear each other limb from limb. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Nott</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thorby</inline> were literally at each other's throat every night. They challenged each other on the platform and almost tore each other asunder. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons</inline> had three meetings in the electorate for <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Nott. Mr. Thorby</inline> said that they would never have <inline font-style="italic">anything to do</inline> with the United Australia party, and when there was talk in the newspapers about unity, he said that there would never be unity between the two parties. Yet at tha declaration of the poll he declared, " Let  by-gones  be  by-gones,  and let us come together." </para>
                        <para>Now I come to Jimmy Hunter, the Whip of the Country party. The strongest union in this Parliament, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Parkes,</inline> is the Whips' union, consisting of Sydney Gardner, Jimmy Hunter, George Lawson, and myself. As one of the Whips of this Parliament I shall not talk about the others. </para>
                        <para>Now I shall give some of my friends in the Labour party a bit of a boost. I shall pas3 by the honorable member for Kennedy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riordan),</inline> who appears anxious to occupy the Speaker's chair, and come to the good member for Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. George Lawson).</inline> Parliamentary life affects men differently. When I entered Parliament my hair was black. At that time I had only my own troubles, whereas now I have the worries of a nation on my head. As honorable members can see, those worries have turned my hair grey. The honorable member for Brisbane came into this Parliament with a nice smooth face; to-day his face has more wrinkles than are to be found on a washer-woman's thumb. He has become wrinkled in battling for the working class of this country. </para>
                        <para>I have not yet had the pleasure of an introduction to the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Frank Brennan).</inline> When the bill for the electoral redistribution of the State of Victoria was before this chamber in the last Parliament a count of heads showed that if the group of which I was a member voted for the redistribution proposals the Labour party could not win Batman. The honorable member for Kennedy pointed out that the old boundaries were better for Labour. </para>
                        <para class="block">The honorable member for Kalgoorlie, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Texas</inline> Green, can substantiate that statement because he asked our little group for support to save him in Kalgoorlie. The honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fairbairn),</inline> who, I am glad to see to-day attired fit to meet the Duke, said that the proposed redistribution was definitely anti-labour, and if agreed to would result in the United Australia and Country parties winning more Victorian seats than if the old boundaries were retained. The then honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dennis)</inline> said that under the redistribution proposals' he was certain to be re-elected. Jim Fen ton, who then represented Maribyrnong, said the same regarding himself. Jack Beasley, in a speech for which I love him, said " I am here to represent the working class. As the honorable member for Flinders claims that the proposed redistribution will be against Labour, I shall vote for the retention of the old boundaries. As a Labour man I shall vote so that Labour can win seats ". It will be seen therefore that the honorable member for Batman owes his re-election, first, to the honorable member for Kennedy, then to my leader, and, next, to the honorable member for Flinders. </para>
                        <para>During the election campaign the name of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> was frequently mentioned, both by candidates and in newspaper articles. In fact, the election was fought around <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang. Mr. Lang</inline> broadcast a number of speeches which numerous citizens throughout the Commonwealth requested to be published in booklet form. With your indulgence, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Parkes,</inline> I shall place on record some extracts from those speeches. You will be glad to see them incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> for I feel certain that every Sunday night you sat by your wireless set listening to speeches in support of the various candidates. In a broadcast speech dealing with the influence of the banks, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> said - </para>

                            <para>Last week we discussed and examined the anti-Labor election slogan of "A Labor Government will smash the banks andsteal your savings ". </para>
                            <para>To-night we will take another of their bogey cries : " Labor wants to establish political control of the banks ". And with that slogan, of course, they conjure up pictures of Parliament ordering the printing of millions of pound notes until the stage is reached where a pound note of. the future would be worth less than  a  penny is worth to-day. </para>
                            <para>To understand thoroughly this position we will have to go back to the commencement of the Commonwealth Bank. In 1910 there were only private banks in Australia, and in most States these private banks had the right to issue their own pound notes. </para>

                            <para>A few weeks ago, Professor Charteris, in one of his interesting broadcast addresses, said something along these lines: - " By the way, if any of you happen to know any of the statesmen who attended the  1911  Imperial Conference, ask him what the Dominion Ministers were told regarding the rising war cloud in Germany, and what steps were taken by Australia as a result of that conference to meet the threatened war cloud in Germany." </para>
                            <para>Now hearing these words, my mind went back to that time, and I recalled how Lord Kitchener came out and inspected our forces and made recommendations; how we adopted compulsory military training; how we ordered a navy which arrived twelve months before the war; and how, when the war did break out, our fleet was more than a match for any German fleet which might bo encountered in the Pacific; and our army organization was able quickly to mobilize a large force. </para>
                            <para>We seemed to be remarkably well prepared for an unexpected war. </para>
                            <para>There is an extraordinary similarity between the waywe prepared for the war and the way wo prepared for this depression- </para>

                        <para>Three years later, another official of the Bank of England, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Otto</inline> Niemeyer, came to Australia, examined the bankers' defences, andin that famous speech at Melbourne, when he said the Australian standard of living should come down, laid down the policy which has governed Australian banking during the depression. This conference marked the final surrender of Australian independence in banking. </para>
                        <para>In 1911 the Commonwealth Government set up a free and independentbank that became master of the banking situation in Australia, continued <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang.</inline></para>
                        <para>In 1924 this free and independent bank was merged with the private banking system in Australia. </para>
                        <para>In 1927, with the visit of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ernest</inline> Harvey, the whole of the Australian banking system became subservient to the Bank of England, and in 1930, with the visit of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Otto</inline> Niemeyer, the bank publicly acknowledged taking its policy and instructions from the old lady of Threadneedle-street. </para>
                        <para>And yet there are people who say to me, " Why do you publicly attack the banking system? Why don't you preach a moderate policy, and when you are elected, then bring about your banking reform?" </para>
                        <para>My answer is that any political leader who promises the people any improvement in their conditions, and yet hides from them the fact that he can do only so much as this outside financial ring allows him to do is not sincere, said <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang,</inline> emphasizing every word of this significant declaration- </para>

                            <para>And that leads us to another bogey - the Lang plan, he continued. At a conference held at Canberra in February, 1931, the Premiers had to decide what policy they would adopt towards <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Otto</inline> Niemeyer's declaration that the standard of living must come down. </para>
                            <para>There were only two proposals - the Commonwealth Government's proposal that the Premiers should ask the Commonwealth Bank for more credits and that from the New South Wales Government which you know as the Lang plan. </para>
                            <para>So far as the rest of the Premiers were con- cerned, they were like Middleton's roustabout - Hadn't any opinions; hadn't any ideas, he added, giving the intimate touch of the Premiers' conference room. </para>
                            <para>The objection to the Commonwealth proposal was that the Commonwealth Bank at that time was committed to the policy of the Bank of England, and unless the Bank of England agreed to it, representations to the Commonwealth Bank were hopeless. Long before this, the Bank of England, together with theReserve Bank of America, had decided upon a world policy of deflation, and they were not likely to alter it at the request of a Premiers' conference at Canberra. </para>
                            <para>There was a way, of course, for the Commonwealth Government's policy to be enforced, and that was by using Parliament to break the connexion between the Bank of England and the Commonwealth Bank. But that is another story. </para>
                            <para>The Lang plan could bo put into effect without the assistance of the banks. </para>
                            <para>I don't suppose many of you have forgotten the tirade of abuse that was hurled at me because of those proposals. </para>
                            <para>I remember the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Telegraph</inline> had a cartoon; it was a dog with my face on it, and underneath it were the words " Shoot the mad dog." </para>

                            <para>The proposals of the Lang plan were: </para>

                            <para>To-day the gold standard is something like the mother-in-law joke - too old a joke to be even laughed at. </para>
                            <para>The next one was the creation of a goods standard of currency. Just listen to this: This is what Professor Shann wrote in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> recently on his return from a trip to London. </para>
                            <para>Last Sunday I told you that Professor Shann was one of the authors of the Premiers plan and was the economic adviser to the Bank of New South Wales. In his article in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald,</inline> the Professor outlined a scheme for a managed currency which be said was much approved of in London. </para>
                            <para>I will now quote the Professor's words: " It challenges our courage and our intelligence in their fullest measure. It may sound to some good party men uncommonly like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang's</inline> goods standard. What of that? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> is a representative Australian, too, fond of ideals, but impatient of technique. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Basil</inline> Blackett, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Josiah</inline> Stamp, and Mr.R, G. Hawtrey, on the contrary, are men inside the charmed circle of the City of London, familiar with every point in its technique. If a goods standard as they fully understand it is monetary orthodoxy in 1933, it may prove the road along which Britain can lead a distracted world back to sanity." </para>
                            <para>Dear! Oh, dear! Proposed by Lang in 1930, it's the action of a mad mullah. It places a stain upon Australia's reputation that you will never be able to wipe out. It will ruin a nation; but proposed in 1933 by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Basil</inline> Blackett and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. R.</inline> G. Hawtrey it may lead a distracted world back to sanity. </para>
                            <para>I wonder will you ever learn. You believed the newspapers when they attacked Labour on the Lang plan; I wonder if you will believe them again! </para>
                            <para>Do you  ever  stop  to  think that this is  the  only country in the whole world where every daily newspaper, year in and year out, consistently supports the one political party? Do you realize the significance of that? </para>
                            <para>And now we come to the third plank of the plan - that of the suspension of overseas interest payments. </para>
                            <para>This,  you  will recall, was said to be a most un-British proposal. It would mean that Australia would  be  posted as a defaulter, they claimed. Our trade would be boycotted, they said. </para>
                            <para>Newspapers which ordinarily retained more  or  legs an attitude of dignity descended to the gutter  to  find language forceful enough  to  vilify me and my proposal. </para>
                            <para>Reading the criticism at the time, I often pictured the man who was writing the article tearing his hair in exasperation because his vocabulary was not equal to the occasion. </para>
                            <para>And yet, just listen to this: " The amount of interest that England is  in  default  to us is  £30,000,000. In her budget you will  find  that salary cuts restoration,  unemployed  assistance and income tax reduction amount  to  £30,000,000.  She  has stolen our interest  to  give  to  her own people." </para>
                            <para>Those are the words  of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Robinson</inline> speaking  in  the United States Senate last month  on  Britain's interest default  to  America. </para>
                            <para>The Lang Plan said: Suspend interest and use the money  to  provide employment for our own  people.  The British Treasurer defaults  in  his interest payment  to  America and Uses the money  to  restore salary cuts, increase unemployment benefits and reduce income tax. </para>
                            <para>Where  is  the difference? </para>
                            <para>There  is  Britain  off  the gold standard, drafting a goods standard  of  currency and defaulting  in  her overseas interest  to  improve the position  of  her own people. </para>
                            <para>Why  is  she doing  it?  Do you think the British Statesmen read the Lang Plan and said: That's a good idea; we'll copy  it? </para>
                            <para>In England and America  to-day,  and  in  Australia soon, there  is  the same fight going  on -  the fight  of  the Treasury officials  to  free themselves from banking domination. </para>
                            <para>Overseas interest  is  repudiated  - to  use the language of  our  Australian newspapers. Why? Is  it  because the people who propose the policy don't believe  in  honoring their obligations? </para>
                            <para>That isn't the position at all. But  if  they use their revenue  to  pay oversea interest they must then  go to  the bank for money  to  carry  on  their ordinary services. </para>
                            <para>To free themselves from the grip  of the banks  they advocate a policy which enables them  to  keep their revenues for their own expenditure. To get the control  of  credit away  from  the private banking system they advocate  a  new credit system of  a  managed currency on a goods standard. </para>

                            <para>One of the things the Australian newspapers told you at that time was that Australia was an honorable nation, and had always paid its interest. </para>
                            <para>Australia never paid its interest before the depression came, friends. We always borrowed it in London. </para>
                            <para>Another fairy tale they  tell  you is that depressions are caused because the supply of commodities exceeds the demand, and then prices fall. The law of supply and demand, so far as commodities are concerned, is as dead as the dodo.  It  belongs to the period when England  was  an exporter of wool, and the biggest factory in the world was a four-roomed house. </para>
                            <para>To-day we can grow more wheat, wool and butter than we can consume, and if we run the mass production factories for a fortnight continuously we can make  a  year'ssupply of manufactured goods. </para>
                            <para>The  law  of supply and demand belongs to an age of scarcity, and this is an age of plenty. The banker creates his scarcity, however,  by  manipulation of the credit system. </para>

                                <para>- On behalf of honorable members I congratulate you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell,</inline> on your election to the high office of  Speaker.  For many years you have been a member of this chamber, and we all are aware of your fine personal qualities. You have never stood higher in the , esteem of honorable members than you do at the present time. It is a great honour to any man to be appointed to the highest position offering in this branch of the legislature. You, sir, have won this distinction by reason of the facts that you have served your district in this Parliament for many years, and that in the last Parliament you occupied the position of  Chairman  of Committees, and discharged your duties with credit to yourself and the House. As was said by the honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hutchinson),</inline> you displayed not only marked ability in carrying out the duties of  Chairman  of Committees, but also strict impartiality in every decision which you gave. Notwithstanding the demonstration that has taken place this morning, I have no doubt that you have the entire respect of every honorable member in this chamber, irrespective of the party to which he belongs. You follow a long line of distinguished Speakers who have established splendid traditions in this chamber - men who have lef t behind them a record of fine service rendered to the community and to Parliament - and I am confident that those traditions will be upheld by you during your occupancy of the Chair. On behalf of honorable members on this aide of the House I assure you that the loyalty that was shown to your predecessors will be extended to you, and that you will have the co-operation of all honorable members in carrying out your responsible duties. I congratulate you upon your appointment, and trust that your record of office will bear favorable comparison with the fine records established by your predecessors. </para>

                                <para>- Had the minority in this Parliament the power to catch by the collar of the coat and throw out of the chamber men who, we thought, were abusing their privileges, there are on the Government benches many men, including some who hold ministerial rank, who would, on occasions, have been subjected to that indignity, and perhaps the honorable member who has interjected would have been one of them. I understand that the election of  Speaker  affords an opportunity, which on all other occasions is denied by the Standing Orders, to express the truth in the plainest possible terms and to lay bare the facts of different situations so that the community may be made fully aware of them. The extraordinary position which arose this morning was one to which, I feel sure, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell,</inline> you personally were not a party. I cannot adversely criticize the manner in which you discharged your duties in the office of  Chairman  of Committees in the last Parliament, although on occasions I differed from your rulings, particularly when you laid it down that a message from the Governor-General recommending appropriation precluded an extension of the scope of the legislation to which it related, and thus prevented our making provision for certain sections of the community who needed assistance but were not covered by the measure. Doubtless your ruling reflected the opinion that you held as to the lines that the debate should take. On those occasions the numbers were against me, and my colleagues and I submitted to the will of the majority. I am confident that while you were  Chairman  of Committees you found that the members of my party presented their views in a reasonable manner. We shall adopt a similar attitude towards you in your new position, even though the circumstances in which you have been placed in the Chair to-day have no parallel in the history of this Parliament. You yourself cannot feel pleased at tha manner in which you have been elected. I am sure you would have approved of the feeling of the House being disclosed upon any other nominations that honorable members might have submitted. Had that course been adopted the community would have been satisfied that, in the event of your election, which probably would have resulted, you were the deliberate choice of the House. We assure you that we shall always act in conformity with the Standing Orders. I hope that you will extend to us that reasonable latitude for which your predecessor was noted. We merely wish to have the fullest opportunity to express the ideas that we hold, and, what is most important, faithfully discharge our obligations to those whom we represent. I cannot compliment you upon your election because of the circumstances which surrounded your elevation to the chair ; but if, as I hope and expect will be the case, you display impartiality in the discharge of your important functions, every member of my party will be pleased to congratulate you at the expiration of your term of office. </para>

                            <para>.- As a new member I raise a question of privilege. We have always been given to understand that this Government stands for constitutional action ; yet it is the first to act unconstitutionally when the opportunity to do so presents itself. It is the practice in the British Parliament upon the occasion of the election of a Speaker to permit a member who has just been elected by the people to express his views in the frankest manner. The procedure of this Parliament has been modelled upon that of the House of Commons, and a similar practice has hitherto been followed here. I claim, however, that today that right has been denied to me. </para>

As a small minority of the members of this House, we of the Labour party of New South Wales shall raise our voices with respect to many matters that will come before you during your occupancy of the Chair, and it will be our duty to see that whatever privileges we possess are not taken from us by either the Government or any agency of the Government. We are making the present protest because we consider that we have been deprived of one of those privileges, that of submitting a nomination for the position which you now hold.

I can assure you that you have the confidence, respect and admiration of the great majority of the members of the House. Although we have witnessed an unpleasant and unseemly scene this morning, I believe that the circumstances of your election will redound to the credit of yourself and of the parties which supported you. A certain section of the House has suggested that it desired to nominate another honorable member for the Speakership, but that is not a fact. One honorable member, who spoke for a considerable time this morning, concluded his remarks by nominating himself, but the nomination was not even seconded. The proceedings of the members of that party were largely in the nature of a farce. We have to consider our position as members of this National Parliament, and we should avoid scenes that will be regarded by the public as savouring of a circus.

With your experience as  Chairman  of Committees, you will appreciate the fact that minorities in this chamber have rights and privileges which must be preserved, and in order that those rights and privileges may be safeguarded, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> must be strictly impartial in his decisions. You will also appreciate that, regardless of political differences, no member of this chambershould have rights and privileges in excess of those enjoyed by any other honorable member. </para>

We regret, however, that the circumstances of a great many people in Australia are not of such a character as to give the Duke of Gloucester, when he knows about them, the pleasure he would otherwise have. That, however, is a matter for us to remedy. We have done our best as a party to rectify this situation, and we hope that the time is near at hand when, by our efforts, the circumstances of a great many of our people will be materially altered and ultimately contentment and happiness will prevail in thousands of Australian homes from which it is absent to-day. </para>

                <para class="block">The death of Monsieur Poincare occurred early last week, and I immediately conveyed through His Majesty's Ambassador at Paris a message of sympathy from the Government and the people of Australia. Monsieur Poincare was one of the foremost statesmen in the history of France. He was President of the Republic for a period of approximately seven years, commencing in 1913. His name will always be associated with the heroic sacrifices of France in the great European War during which time a tremendous responsibility, indeed, devolved upon the occupant of the office of President of the Republic. For many years before and subsequent to that period he served his country devotedly and with outstanding ability as Prime Minister, and in several other ministerial offices. </para>

He was a member of this Parliament when I was first elected to it in 1910, and I can endorse everything that has been said regarding his genial personality. He was one of those who always preferred to do a kind action rather than offer an injury. He was attentive to his duties, and I can remember that, as Chairman of Committees, he carried out his work impartially and efficiently. I sincerely regret his death, and offer my sympathy, and that of my colleagues, to his widow in her loss. </para>

In this case it was my privilege to know the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mathews.</inline> When I first came into this House it was a pitiful sight to witness his sufferings.  His  illness was, I think, the result of the toll which the performance of his duties exacted from him, and of the nervous strain imposed upon him over a long period of years in this Parliament.  His  time has come, and he has now gone into the Great Beyond. He will be remembered by many for the part he took in the fight in the interests of struggling humanity. We desire to associate ourselves with this motion of sympathy with his sorrowing widow. </para>

                    <para>- The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mathews</inline> was my friend, mate and comrade from the time he first came into this House, and for many years before he entered it. He never broke  a  pledge, nor did he refuse to give help to another if he were able to give it. He was steadfast and true to every plank of the platform of his party, never failing to respond when he was called upon. No man in parliamentary life was ever held in higher esteem by his constituents and his friends than was the late honorable member for Melbourne Ports. His constituents knew full well that he would carry out his duties, and did not fail him when he was no longer able to take his seat in Parliament owing to the contraction of a most unfortunate and painful disease. No woman could have nursed an invalid with greater care, and no one could have been . more assiduous in her task than the widow of the late honorable member. He  has gone down to the deep dust preferring the ashes of cremation to the mouldering of the clay. I believe if there is another world he will be there to welcome his friends, for he had the capacity of making many friends, who not only loved him, but also held him in the highest esteem. </para>

                    David, a notable figure in Australia, passed away in Sydney on the 28th August last. He was widely known - indeed, far beyond Australia - for his eminent services in the cause of science and of exploration. Despite his advanced age, he volunteered for service in the Great War, and during his active service in France his special knowledge and great experience were invaluable to the Australian and British forces. He was a man of outstanding intellect, and charming personality, and his remarkable record of scientific achievement entitles him to rank high among those who have rendered very distinguished service to Australia.

                    <para>- I am glad to have the opportunity to associate myself with the motion that has been moved by the Prime Minister, expressing regret at the passing of my old teacher and personal friend, Professor David. Probably no person in the Commonwealth has done more for the Sydney University, for New South Wales, and for Australia, than the late Professor David. The knowledge that he possessed of the subjects which he taught, and the very practical interest that he displayed in all his students, made him an ideal teacher. He afterwards stimulated many famous men into doing wonderfully good work. When he first came to Australia he carried out a geological survey of New South Wales, which resulted in the discovery of the great seam of coal that brought into being the mines at Maitland and Cessnock which to-day are maintaining the coal industry of Australia. Subsequently he carried out in the Pacific and at the South Pole very extensive work which is of invaluable scientific interest. When well past middle age he helped to organize in the ranks of engineering students throughout Australia, a tunnelling corps which saw active service in France. On the battle front he was an inspiration to every one who came into contact with him. During the whole of his lifetime there was no physical or moral evil that he did not endeavour to combat. He also found time to take an interest in every philanthropic work that lay close to his hand. I venture to say that he and his wonderful wife exerted in Australia an influence for good that has not been equalled by any other couple in the history of this nation. </para>

                        <para>- The Government, having set up the royal commission, and given it certain powers to investigate the matters which have been referred to it, cannot dictate as to when it shall conclude its sittings', but we are anxious that its report shall be furnished as soon as possible. We are somewhat disappointed that the report has not yet been received, but we hope that it will come to hand in the near future. </para>

                        <para>- I think that it is fairly generally known that the Government is negotiating at the present time with the object of securing trade treaties with Belgium and Italy, but we intend to continue our negotiations with other countries also. As indicated in the Governor-General's Speech, an outstanding feature of the policy of the Government is the establishment of trade treaties with the object of increasing, if possible, and, at any rate, maintaining, the markets that exist for our primary products. It is impossible for the Government to indicate any particular time when it is hoped that these treaties will be concluded. We are pushing on with the negotiations as rapidly as possible, and I hope in regard to one of these countries, at any rate, to be able in the next few days to make an announcement that satisfactory trading arrangements have been completed. </para>

                            <para>- The matter will have to come to the Parliament finally. It was necessary to consider whether it would be possible to carry out such experiments in Australia simultaneously with those undertaken in England. I find that the cost of such a proposition precludes its adoption; but we are not losing any time so far as the investigations are concerned, and I can assure the honorable member that all possible steps will bo taken in order to attain success, which we hope will lead to the employment of, at any rate, a number of men on the coal-fields, where unemployment is now so severe. </para>

Further than that, even though we might be prepared to discuss this subject with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. MacDonald,</inline> he has made it perfectly clear, in a public statement, that, in view of the existing conditions, he has no proposition of any kind to make on it. The Government has no present intention of entering into any arrangement of the kind referred to by the honorable member; but I hope that at some time in the future it will be possible, in the interests of Australia, to provide once again for migration by people from the other side of the world to Australia. In the immediate future there is no intention of encouraging anything of the kind. </para>

A quota of approximately 13,000 tons was permitted to be imported under by-law until the 31st January, in order that the rural industries and the building industry would not be further inconvenienced. Production in Australia has not yet overtaken the demand, but new works will shortly be entering into production and it is hoped that this increased production, and the overseas supplies of galvanized iron, will result in overcoming the present shortage. </para>

I desire to know why have permits been refused to persons other than those who buy their iron from regular trading persons?

We have admitted the necessity for giving real and substantial relief to - primary producers who arc in difficulties, and, as indicated in the Governor-General's Speech, we shall lose no time in dealing with the subject. It will be necessary to consult each State  government  in regard to the matter,  because  each State will have its own peculiar difficulties. The Government has no power to deal with the subject without consultation with the State governments. The Loan Council will meet on Monday and Tuesday, and possibly on Wednesday of next week, in Canberra, and this opportunity, which is the earliest available will be taken to consult with the State governments on the subject. </para>

From the date that the report of the committee of inquiry was presented to this House, all that a soldier has had to do has been to pay such sums as his income permits him to pay as recommended by the Committee of Inquiry. Any person who complies with those liberal terms can remain in his home in complete security until August of next year subject to recommendation 4. From all branches of the returned soldiers' organization throughout Australia, expressions of appreciation have been received by the Government regarding the manner in which the War Service Homes Department is being administered. </para>

                        <para>- I am very glad that the honorable member asked that question, because, when I visited Tamworth, the honorable member was not present, so that I had to give to the growers whom I met there the information which I am about to disclose, instead of giving it to him. The growers, including representatives of the Australian Tobacco Growers Association, of which the honorable member is  president,  were represented at a conference held in Melbourne to discuss the needs of the industry, and at that conference a resolution was carried conveying a vote of thanks to the BritishAustralasian Tobacco Company for its generous buying policy, which was far better than the growers expected, and, on behalf of the growers, the mover wished to express their keen appreciation. That conference was arranged at the wish of the honorable member, as expressed in this House. The fact that the growers are able to sell good tobacco, this year at a reasonable price, and that there is a gradual turnover from the production of poorer grades to better grades, indicates that the policy of the Government is sound. If the honorable member would like a further conference to be held - and there have already been two or three at his request - I shall be delighted to meet the representatives of the growers if he will bring them together. </para>

Since then, I nave asked the Prime Minister on many occasions for information regarding the progress of the dis cussions which have taken place between the governments of the Commonwealth, Great Britain, New Zealand, and Fiji, and he has always replied that the matter was still under consideration.

                        <para>- It would be easy to take some action, but that would not be the same as guaranteeing a beneficial effect as the result of it. The matter is still under consideration. It is essential, if we are to take action of an effective kind, that there shall be co-operation between the governments of Great Britain, New Zealand, and the Commonwealth. We have been in consultation with the governments of Great Britain and of New Zealand for a considerable time. Only recently we received an intimation from the Government of New Zealand that two Ministers would visit Australia in a few days' time to confer with the Commonwealth Government on various matters, and this subject of foreign subsidized shipping will then receive urgent consideration. </para>

                            <para>- I agree with that. Efforts have been made to alleviate the position by conciliatory means. Departmental officers have been sent out to ask that steps be taken to abate the interference. The department has been reluctant to suggest that legislation be passed, because such legislation would have a far-reaching effect upon matters other than broadcasting reception. I shall bring under the notice of the Postmaster-General the complaint voiced by the honorable member, and I can give him an assurance that further consideration will be given to the matter, because I know that it has been constantly under the notice of the department. </para>

                        <para>- The World Council Against War proposes to hold a convention in Melbourne at an .early date, and for that purpose has sought the use of several public halls, but its request has been refused by the authorities which control those halls. An officer of the Attorney-General's Department has been engaged in making inquiries concerning the good faith of those who are promoting the meeting. Can the Attorney-General inform me if there is any direct relation between the refusal of the request for the use of the halls, and the inquiries that have been made by an officer of his department? If so, can he say why any hindrance should be placed upon a convention that is designed to be held for such a desirable object as that of world peace? </para>

Apart from his long parliamentary experience and his knowledge of parliamentary procedure, he has the greatest of all qualifications for a judicial position - a calm and placid temperament. He is not likely to be bustled by any scenes that maytake place, and I think every honorable member will agree that he will be fair and impartial in his decisions, being uninfluenced in them by his political views.

                <para>Mr.ROSEVEAR (Dalley) [5.56].- We have heard the merits of the honorable member for Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> extolled; but  I  think that the honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thompson)</inline> would have entertained us better if he had referred to the merits of the pact  as  the result of which the honorable member for Forrest was selected as the Government's nominee for this position. This office is usually the gift of the Government to one of its favoured supporters; it is one of the perquisites that areregarded as spoils to the victors. On this occasion the Government has been returned with a following of 32 in a House of 74 members. Therefore, at the moment, we have minority government. If it had not been for the fact that the Government feared an embarrassing situation over the  Speaker  ship and the -Chairmanship of Committees, I have not the least doubt that the splendid qualities of the honorable member for Forrest would have been unnoticed and remained unsung. But the Government has formed a pact with the Country party, and the position of  Chairman  of Committees is one of the gifts that permitted the bargain to be struck. I give the honorable member for Forrest his due. I say nothing against his qualifications for the position, nor do I question his fairness. In the last Parliament he occupied the position of Temporary  Chairman  of Committees  as  well as did any other honorable member. Nor do I doubt his honesty or political sincerity; but it is evident that the Country party is making preparations for stormy scenes on tariff questions since it submitted the name of the honorable member for Forrest as its nominee for this position. Presumably it is desired that his well known fiscal views shall be stifled when tariff matters are under discussion in. committee. This is another pact such as that entered into in December, 1931, when the Country party and the Government formulated  a  common policy upon which they were to fight the elections. They won  a  majority of seats in this House, and for months afterwards they charged one another with  a  breach of faith and with treachery to the pact. There was open rivalry at the last elections between the aspirants for seats between the Country party and the United Australia party. </para>

                    <para>- I  was leading up to the point that the proposed appointment of the honorable member for Forrest to the position of  Chairman  of Committees is more  a  matter of convenience than  a  desire to recognize his personal merits. Since the elections further negotiations have taken place, and  a  sordid struggle behind closed doors has occurred between the leaders of the Country party and the United Australia party for positions in the Cabinet. The whole of the press was able to tell the people, before this Parliament had assembled, that these negotiations were proceeding, and that the only serious difference of opinion was due to the "snavelling" for office, the Country party trying to obtain more portfolios than the United Australia party was prepared to concede. Yet the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> declared that his party was placing principles before place! No sooner had the negotiations broken down than the imminent meeting of Parliament indicated the possibility of an unpleasant situation arising, in which, by a combination of parties, the United Australia party candidates for the speakership and the chairmanship of committees might be defeated. Consequently, another secret conference between the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> and the Leader of the Country party was arranged, with the result that last night, before this House had an opportunity to discuss the merits or otherwise of the honorable member for Forrest, or, indeed, of any other honorable member for the position of  Chairman  of Committees, the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Sun</inline> was able to announce that the way was clear for the election of a Speaker and a Chairman of Committees.

                <para class="block">The question before the House is not the merits of the honorable member for Forrest, but rather how best to save the Government from an embarrassing position. The press tells us that the way is now clear. We in this House are concerned to know how the way was made clear; we should know what transpired at the secret conference held behind closed doors. Are we to understand that the compromise in regard to the Speakership and the Chairmanship of Committees is only the first step towards a pact by which the Country party will sell the primary producers of Australia to vested interests represented by the United Australia party? It is idle to attempt to make the House believe that the two gentlemen who have advocated the claims of the honorable member for Forrest for appointment as  Chairman  of Committees have done so because they were impressed by his outstanding qualifications for the position. Rather is it a case of political expediency in which the fitness of the nominee weighs not at all with the Government or those who support the nomination. The Country party is not game to share the responsibility of government by entering into a coalition with the United Australia party. It wants pickings without responsibility. Knowing that trade crises are likely to arise, it is afraid to accept the responsibility associated with them, yet is prepared to share the pickings of office. In the light of what has happened, what are we to think of the professions of the right honorable member for Cowper, who indignantly left a previous conference with the Prime Minister declaring that the Country party was concerned only with policy, and was looking not for office, but for principles ? To-day, the right honorable gentleman sells the Country party by compromising in regard to the Speakership and the Chairmanship of Committees. In making these remarks, I do not desire to reflect on the qualifications of the honorable member for Forrest for the position for which he has been nominated. But I shall not allow to pass unchallenged the suggestion that he had been nominated solely because of his fitness for the position to which he will doubtless be elevated. I do not know that  there  will be any opposition to his nomination. Such opposition would be futile. Nevertheless, I am of the opinion that members of this House should say whether the nomination is based on the qualifications of the nominee or is merely a case of political expediency. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not desire to say anything in opposition to the appointment of the honorable member for Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> as  Chairman  of Committees, the more so as I apprehend that the chances of my appointment to the position are almost incalculably remote. Looking about me, I see in this chamber a number of men who, by some means, entered this chamber during my furlough. One member, who is, however, not new to me is the honorable member for Forrest for whom I have only the friendliest of feelings. On one occasion in my callow youth - not recently - I made a speech on the tariff, of which the honorable member for Forrest approved. That was many years ago, but I feel there is some connexion between the circumstances of that time and my defeat at the poll. In my felicitations to the honorable gentleman,. I am concerned only with his pronounced views on tariff matters. It would appear somewhat difficult to reconcile those views with the Speech which we heard to-day from the representative of the King. That being so, inasmuch as he is the chosen of this protectionist Government and party, I would like to know, for the security of the country and the peace of mind of honorable members generally, whether an undertaking has been obtained, under bond and seal, that the honorable member will not, during this Parliament, make any further speeches upon the tariff. If that practical course has been taken, I can conceive of some real service being done to the country by  this  election, and such a service done to my electors and to me as will greatly benefit my electors and make further secure my seat in this House. I congratulate the honorable member is intelligent anticipation of his speedy and painless election. </para>

                    <para>, or his capabilities for filling the position of Chairman of Committees. But it is too much to ask honorable members to accept, as just one of those bolts from  the  blue, a proposal by the strongest and most uncompromising freetrader in this Parliament, the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory),</inline> that an almost equally strong freetrader, the honorable member for Forrest, shall be appointed  Chairman  of Committees - for if he is put in the chair he will be isolated  from  the discussion of the tariff, most of which will take place in committee under his chairmanship, and he will not be able  to  vote upon the issues raised. There is something  moTe  in it than that. When the position is analysed it seems to me that this action, involving a member of the purely freetrade and uncompromising Country party, following as it does upon the uncompromising attitude of the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page),</inline> is nothing more than an opportionment of the loaves and fishes. If this is done, the big guns of the Country party will have turned out to be guncrackers in some cases, and squibs in others. If it is an indication that the alliance that has already been spoken of will actually take place it is an example of coming events casting their shadows ' before them. I contend, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> that it cannot be reconciled with the action of certain honorable gentlemen in their adherence to party alignments right up to this moment. When we recall the political history of this country in this our National Parliament and in the State Parliaments, we find it has always been recognized by all parties that one of the greatest acts of political treachery a member of one party can commit is to accept office under another party. </para>

                        <para>- I withdraw that word. I said that this principle has always been recognized, and if you say that I am out of order, I withdraw it. We know that the Parliament of New South Wales was almost torn asunder, and the sittings of that House made impossible because of an action similar to this. It has always been recognized that a member allies himself with the party under which he seeks election. In my opinion, such an action as this goes very near to causing the people to lose faith in the honesty and integrity of their representatives in Parliament. A man goes to the country and swears by all the gods in heaven that with the party to which he is then allied he will destroy the other faction should his party get the opportunity to do so; but when he is returned, and is offered a position involving extra pay or privilege or standing, all his pledges are thrown overboard, and his promises to the electors forgotten. He no longer cares whether the Government carries out its policy or not. It is clearly the intention of the Government to take the honorable member for Forrest off the floor and put him into the chair so that he will be unable to exercise his vote in furtherance of the promises he made at the election. Honorable members should not countenance such action as the Government has taken in this matter. If I had the opportunity, I would show my disapproval by my vote, .but as I have not such an opportunity, I am doing it through my voice. The action taken by the honorable gentleman indicates a complete surrender on his part, and, so far as the members of his party are concerned, it is only one more of their sham fights. Another big gun turns out to be not even a gun cracker, but a squib. </para>

He and his party are now converted, and they have joined hands with the United Australia party because the problems facing the primary producers of ' this country exceed their intelligence. They are unable to cope with them. I understand from the remarks of honorable members that the honorable member who has 'been proposed as  Chairman  of Committees will mate one of the ablest chairmen who have ever been appointed; but that does not justify those who pose in this House as the saviours of the primary producers in selling their constituents to the very interests which have been farming the farmers all their lives. No doubt, these elected representatives of the primary producers who have taken part in the making of this bargain will later go out and tell the same old story to the farmers once again. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that the country people of the Commonwealth will be staggered at the sudden and complete conversion of the honorable member for Forrest. A pact has been entered into whereby a man, whose expressed opinions have always been directly opposed to the principles enunciated by the Prime Minister, has been elevated to a position of dignity by favour of the Prime Minister and his followers. To me the conversion of the honorable member for Forrest is welcome, because, if it is real, it indicates that he is on the right track at last. It indicates that, in his opinion, Australia must look after itself, that it must  protect its primary and secondary producers even to the extent of completely prohibiting those things- </para>

                    <para>. - I have nothing whatever to say against the honorable member for Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> who, having had considerable parliamentary experience, should be particularly fitted for the position of  Chairman  of Committees ; but I regret that the Country party, which, since the last election, definitely announced that it did not propose to enter into any pact with the Government has at the eleventh hour decided to provide it with a  Chairman  of Committees. The honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thompson),</inline> who seconded the motion, has been most hostile to the Government and to the United Australia party. In the election campaign he had not a kind word to say concerning that party, the supporters of which fought him tooth and nail. In these circumstances, it is amazing that he should second the motion, and, in so doing, provide the Government with an additional vote. The honorable member for Forrest has been one of the most uncompromising opponents of the Government's protective policy. He has been definitely opposed to tariff protection on galvanized iron and on wire netting. </para>

His  election reminds me of a man who said his horse had won a race easily; it was the only horse entered. I hope that the honorable member, in the exercise of his powers as  Chairman  of Committees, will be merciful to honorable members on this side. I have listened to the eulogies expressed regarding his capacity as a  chairman,  and some of the virtues to which reference has been made I have not hitherto discovered; yet I believe that he has the qualifications necessary for the office to which he has been appointed. The honorable member has been chosen for an important position, and I sincerely congratulate him. </para>

                    <para>. - I approach this matter from a different angle from that chosen by previous speakers. Their congratulations are centered upon what has happened in this chamber, but I consider that the straight course to take is to congratulate the honorable member on being the successful candidate inside the Country party room, following the pact entered into with the Government, for that is where the decision was made. So far as this House was concerned, the election was a purely formal matter; honorable members had little or no voice in determining it. I am of the opinion that the time is ripe for those outside Parliament to know exactly the nature of the negotiations, influences, and pacts which control the business of this House, for then they would be better able to appreciate the measure of democracy which exists in this country. I congratulate the honorable member for Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> on securing nomination within the party room, following the  arrangement successfully negotiated by his leader with the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons).</inline> I have no criticism to offer regarding his fitness for the position of  Chairman  of Committees; on the contrary, I freely admit that, when on previous occasions he occupied the chair temporarily, he exercised commendable impartiality. I have no personal animus against the honorable gentleman, for I believe that he will fill the office with credit to himself and to the Parliament, and that he will exercise sound judgment when dealing with those who in this place desire to express their views. I nope that during his occupancy of the chair the honorable member will not be influenced by any arrangement or pact which may yet be entered into. I do not think that he will be so influenced, for I believe that he has sufficient strength of character to follow the course which he believes to be right. If he does that, there will be no cause for complaint when his term of office expires. </para>

According to press reports, there is to be a further adjournment after that now proposed, following which Parliament will sit four days instead of three days each week, until the business of the first period of the session has been completed. If we can have an indication of that character it will help us to arrange our own personal affairs appropriately. </para>

                    <para>.- I wish to say a few words in regard to the recent methods of doing the business of this chamber. When I look back on our experience of the last two years, I am filled with the greatest distaste for a repetition of them. We have had long adjournments of Parliament followed by periods of rush business when honorable members have had to sit here night after night for unreasonably protracted hours to get through the business programme. In view of the fact that within the next few months we shall have to deal with vitally important questions affecting agriculture in Australia, I urge that we should take up the business in a reasonable way. I shall offer no objection to an adjournment of the House until next Wednesday, but from that time the sittings should be continuous until we have dealt with at least the most important items of business that await our consideration. There is no justification for an adjournment of Parliament for the whole of the week after next. </para>

I do not wish to see any more such sitting days if they can be avoided.

                    <para>.- Personally, I object to any adjournment of the sittings of this House while important business awaits our attention. There are, throughout Australia, hundreds of thousands of people who do not know from where their next meal will come, and the Government has given us no indication that it intends to provide work for these people who are to-day unemployed. During the election campaign, many promises were made to old age and invalid pensioners, and in view of the fact that the festive season is rapidly approaching the Government should take immediate steps to give effect to those promises. Consideration should also be given to the needs of many returned soldiers who before they went to the war were promised the earth by certain honorable gentlemen now sitting on the front bench opposite. There are, in my electorate, between 3,000 and 4,000 returned soldiers, nearly 80 per cent. of whom are out of employment, and 40 per cent. of whom are suffering from the effects of their war service. These men are looking to the Government for a measure of justice, particularly through the repatriation and pension departments. I suppose there is scarcely 1 per cent. of the men who saw four or five years' service overseas who are not suffering in some way from the effects of the war. These men also are entitled to special consideration from the Government. It is a fact - I have had several cases submitted to me which have been substantiated by medical evidence - that these men are entitled to pensions, but because the Repatriation Commission has been so heartless, apparently carrying out the policy laid down by the Government, they have no redress. While those conditions exist, I say that it is the duty of the Government to carry on and to attend to the immediate cares of those people who cannot help themselves. </para>

                    <para>.- I cannot let the motion go without entering my protest against it. The honorable member for Lang <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mulcahy)</inline> referred to certain cases. There are also many in my own electorate. With all due respect to the answer given by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> to a question asked by me this afternoon, I want to say that he did not indicate very clearly that it was the Government's intention to do something to relieve the position on the coal-fields. In my electorate he met approximately 1,500 youths, whose ages ranged from fourteen to 21 years, who had never done a day's work. He certainly indicated to a deputation that he was sympathetic with these boys, and that the Government would do something with the object of relieving the position, particularly on the coal-fields. But all that has been done has been the appointment of a committee, and that committee has made a preliminary report in which it has indicated that it is necessary for a hydrogenation plant to be set up in Victoria in the brown coal-fields. The tremendous influence which can be brought to bear by Victorian interests on the Government in these matters is evidenced by the fact that they can hold up the erection of this plant in the northern district for the purpose of considering whether Victoria is not a more suitable place for such a plant. Analyses show that there is more oil content in coal procured in northern New South Wales than there is in coal procurable in any other part of the world. </para>

                        <para>- While there is so much business to be done *by this House, and while there are so many people in dire distress, this House should not adjourn. If we are to believe press reports the Government intends to meet for only five weeks and then adjourn for a period of six months while the Prime Minister and others have a pleasant jaunt overseas, and while the unemployed are left to remain workless. Promises were made to the unemployed people of this country that a prosperity loan would be raised for the purpose of relieving unemployment, and that the Government would go on with the erection of this hydrogenation plant. Immediately the election is over, these promises have been forgotten, and have already been broken, and the unemployed find that it is not the intention of the Government to go on with this undertaking, irrespective of the fact that reports on it have been procured from overseas authorities, and that the Imperial Government has gone on with the work of extracting oil from coal. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> I consider that you could give a little more latitude on an adjournment motion like this than you are doing at the moment. I could not sit in my place and allow the adjournment of this House to take place without entering a protest. We propose to adjourn for a. week. What for ? So that we may all enjoy ourselves ; so that we who are getting full and plenty may get a little more, while thousands of people, as has been stated by the honorable member for Lang, do not know where their next meal is coming from. I would not be doing my duty to the people I represent if I did not protest. In my electorate, there are 7,000 miners unemployed, and without prospect of employment. If we may accept statistics as reliable, it means that there are at least 21,000 people in my electorate on the bread line. With all respect to  His  Royal Highness, I believe that we should get on with our work, and do something to alleviate the lot of those in distress. The Duke of Gloucester will not be permitted to know of the conditions prevailing among the unemployed. He certainly will not be taken to the coalfields, nor to the Lang electorate, where he would be able to see for himself evidence of appalling poverty. There he would see women and' children in want of necessary clothing, though I have appealed to the Government time after time to make such clothing available. Every time we make a plea on behalf of the unemployed, we are told that the duty of feeding and clothing these people devolves upon the States, and is no concern of the Federal Government. I say that every government in Australia, and every section of the community, should co-operate in this work. The Christmas season is fast approaching, but what prospect of good cheer lies before the unemployed? I appeal to the Government not to adjourn Parliament for a week. I believe that  His  Royal Highness would prefer us to carry on the business of the nation, to make an attempt to do something to relieve the sufferings of the unemployed. It has been said that we in this Parliament are not concerned with the unemployed, and that we are indifferent to their fate. That is not true of the members of the party to which I belong, nor of many members of the official Opposition. We object to the adjournment of Parliament at this time, more especially as we know that in about five weeks from now, Parliament will adjourn for six months in order to give certain members of the Government an opportunity to go overseas, and meet the people who have not the interests of this country at heart. They are more concerned with the making of trade treaties that will keep Australia in the' position of a vassal State as a provider of raw material for British industry. We should instead seek to develop our own manufactures in order to absorb our unemployed, and furnish a market for our own primary produce. The trouble is that some of those who sit in this House do not care a tinker's cuss about the unemployed. Much lip-service is paid to their cause when candidates are seeking the suffrages of the electors. We have now an opportunity to demonstrate the sincerity of what we then said. Let us seize it instead of merely coming to Canberra for 24 hours, then adjourning for a week, meeting again for four weeks, and then closing up shop for six months. I object to the motion, and propose to vote against it. </para>

                    <para>.- I intend to support the motion moved by the right honorable the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons),</inline> because it  appears  to me that certain functions in connexion with the Royal visit would interfere with meetings of the House this week. It is only right that the courtesy proposed should be extended to our Royal visitor. I rose more particularly to ask the Government not to commit itself to adjourning over the week during which the Melbourne Cup will be run, and to suggest that during the next few days it should definitely determine whether it will not be practicable for Parliament to meet that week. I appreciate the fact that many important events being celebrated in connexion with the Melbourne Centenary involve official representation of the Commonwealth Government; but investigations could be made as to whether proper representation would not be possible even if the House were to, meet on Wednesday of next week. The people of Australia, and particularly those resident in country districts, are looking forward with a great deal of hope to the work of this Parliament, and they would be cheered by the knowledge that we were to remain at work rather than to adjourn over the period suggested. I ask the Prime Minister to look further into this matter. </para>

                    <para>. - I trust that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> will make a statement in connexion with the matters referred to by the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James),</inline> the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page),</inline> and other honorable members. I object to an adjournment over the period &gt; proposed, particularly when I realize that this Parliament has sat for only four or five weeks during this year. When the Government and its supporters went to the country they said that an election was being held because they desired to obtain a mandate from the people upon many important issues ; but now that the general elections are over, and the people have decided in a manner more or less satisfactory to the Prime Minister, he is not at all concerned as to whether the House does, or does not, meet. All those grave issues to which he directed attention  prior to the election are in the air, and, apparently, are likely to remain there. We have been informed that the House will adjourn over a period when horses will  be  racing round a track in Melbourne, and that there are certain functions at which the Commonwealth must  be  properly represented. I wonder what the bosses would say if employees absented themselves from work because there were certain functions which they wished to attend. Men who acted in that way would be sacked, and we shall deserve the sack if we do not do our job. We are the paid servants of the people, and should do what  we  were told  by  the electors. This Parliament has been in recess for all but a few weeks of the current year, and there will  be  further adjournments until the end of the year. I strongly object to the Government adjourning Parliament until Wednesday next. Better arrangements could  be  made; Parliament couldsit longer this week. We shall have something further to say next week concerning a further proposed adjournment. When the Prime Minister moved this motion he should have made a statement in regard to certain press reports which have been commented upon. It seems that more information is available to the  press  than to honorable members. </para>

                <para>Mr.LAZZARINI.-During my membership of this Parliament in Melbourne, five cups were run, and I was not present at the running of any of them. Horseracing does not interest me. I think, however, that it is wrong for a horse race to be permitted to sidetrack honorable members away from their jobs at a time when the nation is going through a period of stress and trial. A job has to be done, and it is our duty to do it. This was stated by the Prime Minister at the elections, and repeated again in the speech of the Governor-General in the Senate to-day. If there is a job to be done, we should not shut up the House as proposed. We are paid our allowance out of the public funds of this country to do our job, and not to run away from it. But, by these frequent adjournments, we are running away from our job - a practice that is not calculated to increase the confidence of the people in democracy and in the system of constitutional government. I hope that the Prime Minister, in his reply to this debate, will indicate clearly what is proposed, and that he will offer some better excuse for the adjournment than that some honorable members desire to be present at functions in Melbourne. </para>

                    <para>.- I am glad to learn, from the speech of  His Excellency  the Governor-General, that it is the intention of the Government to make a complete survey of the unemployment problem in Australia. That inquiry will necessarily take some time, and as the plight of the unemployed is so desperate, I appeal to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> to take whatever action may be thought necessary to improve the lot of those people who are forced under existing conditions to live on 6s. a week, the amount of government sustenance provided. Although official statistics disclose that it costs from 22s. to 30s. a week to maintain a prisoner in our gaols, men out of work are expected to remain honest and live on 6s. a week! I recognize the difficulties confronting the Government, but the position of many unemployed is so dreadful that there should be no delay in affording relief. Medical officers of the Department of Health in Melbourne have made the statement - which to me is more terrible than the tragic death of a monarch, or the killing of a few hundreds of people in a revolutionary outbreak  - that in Australia, the land of abundance, there are children who have never known the taste of milk. I urge the Government to do something to rectify this terrible state of- affairs, and I hope that on Wednesday next the Prime Minister will be able to announce that action is to be taken. We should face this problem of unemployment as we would face a war, without regard to parties or personal prejudices. All honorable members should come together in a resolve that in a country like this, which produces an abundance of all that is required for our people, there will be sufficient food for every man, woman, and child in it. </para>

                    <para>. -  The honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> has asked to be told of the intentions of the Government with respect to future sittings of the House. I informed the honorable gentleman privately, as the leader of his party, that . what the Government had in mind was to adjourn over tomorrow and the following day, to meet on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday of next week, and then adjourn in order that honorable members and Ministers, too, may have an opportunity to take part in those celebrations in Melbourne which come to each State once only in  100  years. The adjournment is not due to a desire on the part of Ministers to attend the races in Melbourne, though I have been frank enough in the past in that respect. Last year, I moved the adjournment of the House so that honorable members could attend an event which, by many people, is regarded as one of very great importance. I did not move that motion for my own benefit, because I have never attended a Melbourne Cup; but I have no hesitation in saying that at this time of the year the great majority of the people of Australia are thinking about it. I repeat that I am not personally concerned about that race. On this occasion, the Government wishes to adjourn the House, be cause Victoria is celebrating its centenary, and important events in connexion with it have been fixed for that week.  His  Royal Highness the Duke of Gloucester will be present at a number of functions, and since he was invited to Australia by the Commonwealth Government, it is only fitting that the Government should be represented at those gatherings. The adjournment will enable the Government to do more than would be possible if Parliament were sitting, in two respects: first the relief of of unemployment mentioned by the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James)</inline> and other honorable gentlemen; and secondly, the tariff problems referred to by the Leader of the Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earl* Page).</inline> The Government is carrying on negotiations with a view to the making of trade treaties. Those negotiations are being conducted by a committee of Cabinet, which has been specially set up for that purpose, and more progress can be made with them if Parliament is not sitting. In addition, there are  60  or more Tariff Board reports with which the Government is anxious to deal and take action upon at as early a date as possible. The proposed adjournment will afford Ministers an opportunity to  cleaT  up many matters and bring them before the House before it adjourns over the Christmas holidays. The Minister who has been charged with the special duty of inquiring into matters affecting employment proposes to visit Melbourne. Honorable members will believe that the object of his visit is not to attend the Melbourne Cup, but to discuss with those who are able to help him definite schemes of employment which we hope to submit to this Parliament for its consideration. It is important that adequate time be given for the consideration of these matters by what, after all, is a new Government. I should like the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James)</inline> to realize that refusal to adjourn over tomorrow and the next day would not advance one step further the matters that he has in mind. The Government will lose no time in dealing with the problem of employment. The two days upon which  His  Royal Highness will be in Canberra will not actually be lost, because, in any event, we should not  have  any definite proposals ready for sub mission to the House during that period. The honorable member may disabuse  his  mind of the newspaper suggestion that  it  is proposed to have an adjournment extending over many months in  1935  during my visit to the Old Country. The work of this Parliament will have to proceed, whatever trips abroad may have to be made. Matters in relation to unemployment, trade treaties, and the tariff, are urgent and important, and they will be dealt with without delay. There will, of course, be an adjournment over the Christmas holidays. It is intended, however,  that  the Parliament shall re -assemble early in the New Year, so that its work may be resumed and as much progress  as  possible be made without delay. </para>

                    <para>.- I also protest against the proposed adjournment of the House until next week. In common with previous speakers, I hold the view that many people are in dire need  of  assistance from this Government, and that it should proceed immediately to deal with the major problems that confront it. The unemployed in the various electorates of the Commonwealth are looking for some definite proposals that will afford them relief. That relief was promised by the Government at the last elections. The Labour party at that time also placed certain proposals before the people, who, however, in their wisdom or otherwise - I believe otherwise - returned this Government to power in the expectation that it would take immediate action to relieve the conditions that exist to-day. If the Parliament is not to proceed with the business that it was elected to transact, those people cannot expect to receive the relief they expected. There are also other problems that demand immediate attention. The Wheat Commission has spent a considerable amount  of  money in making inquiries. Those who are engaged in that industry are very anxious  to  know what is to be done to guarantee a price for their product,  of  which they will have a  surplus  this year. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">Judging by the appearance of the crops, the wheat production this season will  be  substantial, and the growers expect a fixed price. They also desire an organized system of marketing their product. The Government must give the men in the industry some assistance along these lines. Harvesting will shortly commence, and it is necessary to do something, not in the sweet by and by, but in the near future. The growers should have some idea of the price they will receive for their wheat. In past years, low prices were usually received by farmers who sold their wheat immediately the crop had been harvested, the speculators receiving the benefit of subsequent rises in price. </para>
                <para>The wool position is much the same. Representing an electorate which covers probably half of New South Wales and the greater part of the wool belt in that State, I point out that the men in  the  wool industry expect a pool for  the  organized handling of their product, to enable them to receive a fair return for their labour. The tendency is for wool prices to slump, and the industry desires that prices shall he stabilized. The men employed in the industry are totally dependent on its success for their welfare, and large numbers of unemployed in the out-back areas also desire that the wool-growers shall be assisted. On these grounds I voice my protest against the adjournment of the House until next week.I should like the Government to tell the people definitely, without any further delay, what it proposes to do. </para>
