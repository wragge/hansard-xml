In my opinion, and in that of my colleagues, it is not competent for the honorable member to use the parliamentary institution for the publicity purpose proposed. We contend that, whatever may be alleged to have happened prior to his election to this Parliament it is not within the province of an honorable member to make imputations based upon such premises against any other honorable member. </para>

                                <para>- I am referring to the notice of motion which is to be placarded on the business paper, accusing an honorable member of this House of having made blasphemous utterances. If that is in order, there is nothing to prevent any honorable member from singling out others, and by notice of motion accusing them of having made blasphemous utterances, whether the charge be true or false. Thus this Parliament could be used as a vehicle for making charges without giving reasons or debating the question. If the honorable member for Barker may do that, so also may we, and the parliamentary papers may be placarded with unfounded charges of blasphemy against honorable members. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member for Barker is strictly conforming to the Standing Orders in giving notice that he intends to move a motion of privilege. In having named the subject that he intends to discuss on that motion of privilege, his object apparently is to intimate its nature to honorable members, so that they may prepare themselves for the debate that is to take place. I rule that the honorable member is in order in giving notice of his motion. </para>

The Postmaster-General's Department advises that since that time the ship has completed its work on this cable, and has returned to its home waters in New Zealand. As the chair which has been found on the beach gives some evidence that the wreckage may be in comparatively shallow waters, arrangements have been made for the Royal Australian Air Force Southhampton flying boats, which are now in Sydney, to make a search for wreckage of the <inline font-style="italic">Miss Hobart</inline> when returning to Melbourne during this week, if weather conditions are favorable. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to address a question to the Assistant Treasurer arising out of a letter addressed to me by the honorable gentleman on the 26th November, regarding sales tax on hospital ambulance equipment. Ambulance equipment was included in the list of exemptions brought down after the sales tax had been in operation for some period, and it was thought that this exemption would cover hospital ambulance equipment, as well; but, according to the Assistant Treasurer's letter, it does not. I ask the Minister to tell me now if it is exempted. </para>

Steps are being taken to establish a War Service Homes Commission (South Australian) Department, in Adelaide. From figures supplied by the Commission, a saving of approximately £4,000 per annum will be made as a result of the change. </para>

                        <para>- In view of the fact that a considerable number of Imperial ex-service men, who took part in the last war have become incapacitated in Australia, and also the facts that the Imperial Government does not recognize claims for pensions unless they have been submitted within seven years of the cessation of the war, and that in some cases these Imperial ex-service men were paid a lump sum in lieu of pension, I wish to know whether the Government considers that it is fair that such men should be faced with the necessity of having to make application for invalid pensions in this country when the responsibility of their maintenance should be that of the Imperial Government? Will the right honorable gentleman, during his visit to Great Britain next year, bring this subject under the notice of the Imperial authorities with the object of ensuring that pensions are provided by the government of the United Kingdom for these incapacitated men? </para>

                        <para>.- When the debate was adjourned on Friday, I was discussing the extraction of oil from coal by the method practised by the Lyon brothers. It has been admitted by the advisers of this Government, and of the Government of New South Wales, that these men are capable of producing suitable fuel in commercial quantities, and that they do not make exaggerated or extravagant claims. Recently, the Government of New South Wales sent a sample of coal to the Fuel Research Station at Greenwich, and the report received supports in every particular the claims of the Lyon brothers. It has been proved that this coal has a higher oil content than any other kind of coal in the world. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons),</inline> in answer to a question asked by the Mayor of Wallsend, stated to a deputation which waited upon him at Cessnock on 23rd March last, that if it could be shown that the Lyon brothers could obtain better results than were being obtained overseas in extracting oil from coal, the Commonwealth Government would assist in the introduction of the process in Australia. The results obtained by these local men, under strict governmental supervision, are infinitely better than those obtained by the British Fuel Research Station, both as regards the yield of oil and by-products from Maitland coal. Their claim to have introduced superior methods of treatment is confirmed by the opinion of the director of the Fuel Research Station at Greenwich, who stated that the coal obtained from the Greta seam was the best and most uniform that had ever been handled by his department, and went on to say that the best English plants operating would not be able to treat the coal to the greatest advantage. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The Commonwealth Government and its advisers would not lose any dignity by reversing the present policy of indifferent and masterly inactivity. There is not a person on the northern coal-fields who does not now believe that the Lyon brothers can do what they claim. A conference was called in Newcastle to consider this matter some time ago, and it was attended by eminent scientists, by the Minister for Mines in the New South Wales Government, and by others interested in the industry. I was also present, and at that conference the following letter from the Lyon brothers was read : - </para>

                        <para>During the past fifteen years we have spent £20,000 in investigating local coal and conditions, and having had previous experience in shale have definitely come to the conclusion that the production of oil from coal provides definitely better possibilities than the production of oil from kerosene shale. </para>
                        <para>Local coal and conditions are different to other parts of the world and I think we can safely claim that we have spent more time and money on local research than has been spent by any other firm or by any Australian Government. </para>
                        <para>At the request of the New South Wales Government in June last we were invited, in view of the report of the committee which investigated our work, to submit our proposals for proceeding commercially with our coal processing operations. </para>
                        <para>We submitted these proposals early in July and briefly they consisted of the immediate expenditure of £150,000 for the erection of a coal processing plant in connection with the Zara Street power house. </para>
                        <para>Such a plant to be the first unit of an industry capable of producing 1,000 tons of motor spirit per day, and using 2,000,000 (two million) tons of extra coal per annum. </para>
                        <para>The production of this quantity of coal and its subsequent processing would absorb the whole of the unemployed on the Maitland  coal-fields,  and due to the stabilizing effect on the industry would considerably reduce intermittency of employment. </para>
                        <para>Our estimate of the cost of motor spirit produced in such a plant is  ninepence  (9d. ) per gallon and not only would three hundred thousand (300,000) gallons of motor spirit per day bc manufactured at this figure but, by coupling the industry with that of electricity and gas would gave to the public cheaper electricity and gas. </para>
                        <para>It is for the Government to say whether the establishment of such an industry is desirable and, if so, to what extent they are prepared to assist. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">That statement bears out the opinion I have expressed on previous occasions that, if the treatment of coal for the production of oil were carried out in conjunction with the supply of gas and electricity, Australia would be independent of oversea oil supplies, and the people would be able to obtain gas and electricity at lower rates than now prevail. </para>
                    <para>All countries recognize that the success of the coal trade is dependent upon the progress made in the conversion of coal to oil. The procrastination of successive governments and their advisers is breaking the hearts of the miners, not only in the northern coal-mining districts of New South Wales, but also throughout Australia. Various Ministries have made a number of promises to rehabilitate the industry. As I remarked on Friday last, although the present depression in the coal trade may lift temporarily, the industry cannot permanently progress under the present methods, owing to the fact that fuels other than coal are now being largely used in the production of power. The replies that I have recently received from various members of the Government, particularly the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons),</inline> to the effect that it would be rather foolish to expend money for the purpose of experimentation at the present time until the results of inquiries now being conducted in Great Britain are known, show that Ministers are afraid to adopt a bold policy. Even if a few mistakes were made at the outset, a great deal of employment would be provided for our own people, and we should be encouraging Australian technicians, who, I claim, are second to none. Have we no confidence in them because they are Australians? It is claimed that £20,000 has been expended on experimental work by these people, but the policy of the Commonwealth Ministry is, " wait and see what happens in England". </para>
                    <para>That is not the spirit which inspired the hardy pioneers, whose enterprise led to the development of this country. There is no doubt that a great deal of employment would be provided if the low temperature carbonization process recommended by Lyon brothers were put into operation on a large scale. </para>
                    <para>In addition to the high cost of importing oil supplies, the Government is now faced with the cost of the dole, which is given to the miners who are idle. Last week I indicated the number of miners who were out of work in the northern mining districts of New South Wales. A similar proportion of the miners in the southern and western districts are unemployed. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Rivett</inline> has admitted that  Lyon  brothers can extract oil from coal ; his only criticism is that their plant is an experimental one, and not large enough to produce oil on a commercial basis. Since this firm can produce good oil from coal, why not give it the necessary financial encouragement to enable it to erect a large plant, by which it could help to supply the oil requirements of Australia? </para>

                            <para>- It is stated that £150,000 is required to launch the scheme on a commercial basis, and I claim that in view of the large number who could be employed in this - work the matter should be sympathetically considered by the Government and some indication given as to the extent to which the industry would be protected against imported oil fuel. It does not hesitate to assist other industries. Many rural industries have had more nursing than any others; but what help has been given to the coal-mining industry, in which, in New South Wales alone, prior to the depression, 24,800 men were engaged ? In the other States, of course, there are smaller coal-producing centres. This was formerly one of the largest industries in Australia, and we should do all we can to rehabilitate it. The international situation is tense, and war clouds are darkening. This great world storm may break in the Pacific, and, in such an event, Australia might be unable to obtain oil for motor transport purposes. We should not be so ostrich-like as to refuse to face the facts of the situation. If, at some future time, our oil supplies are cut off, the blame will not lie with those connected with the coal-mining industry. Every deputation that has approached different governments has shown that, apart from the rehabilitation of the coal industry and the provision  of  employment for our people, we have to guard . against the danger of war. In such an event we would not be in a position to defend ourselves, because we should not be able to obtain supplies of oil. My electors do not advocate, nor do I, the restriction of attention to the one process. I am not so biased as to say that the low-temperature carbonization process is the best. Not a great deal is known by us about the hydrogenation process, which is claimed to be the most economic. But I do say, without fear of contradiction, that there is room in this country for both processes. Seeing  that the  low temperature carbonization process is already established in Germany and in other parts of the world, and has been proved to be an economic and a commercial proposition, why should not the Lyon brothers be given encouragement to develop it here? Different persons who have approached me have alleged that the major oil companies bring too much influence to bear upon governments and the servants of governments, with the result that a favorable report cannot b'e obtained for the production of oil from minerals. </para>

                            <para>- That is perfectly true. We do not know what graft is practised. The major oil companies obtain such good pickings from the Australian market that they would not stop at graft to safeguard their interests. We have to take our courage in both hands. Thousands of good citizens who are anxious to obtain  a  livelihood are debarred from doing so. At one time the coal industry was one of the best industries in Australia. It employed a large number of people directly, and indirectly many others were dependent upon it for transport purposes. To-day it is stagnating. For 30 odd years Kurri Kurri held the Melbourne gas works contract; but that is now lost to it because of the cutthroat competition among the coal-mining companies for the little trade that is offering, and the town is in the throes of  a  greater depression than it has ever previously experienced. Those to whom I speak when I visit my electorate at the week-end ask me to give them some idea of how things are going. The Government wishes me to take to them  the message  that prosperity will shortly  appear.  How can a man in my position  hold out  any promise to these people?  There is  no hope for them unless  the  Government  is  courageous enough to tackle  the  problem. I do not wish to be accused, as I have been by the Prime Minister, of never having placed before  this  Parliament  a  concrete suggestion.  I  have probably wearied the House by my reiteration of the request  that  something be done in this matter.  While  not desiring to do that, I recognize  that  I owe a duty to those who have  sent me  to this Parliament, and that I  must fight  in their interests. In doing so, I  am  advancing the interests of this country; because, in the event of war in the  Pacific  - which has been forecast  - what possibility  would there be of our defending ourselves if our oil supplies were  cut off?  I urge that serious consideration  be given  to this matter. </para>

                        <para>.- The transcendent problem  in Australia  to-day is that of unemployment, and  it  is fitting that the debate on the  budget  should largely revolve around it. Many and varied speeches have been made,  but  one of the most remarkable to  which I  have listened is the speech that  was delivered  last week by the honorable  member  for Griffith <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Baker).</inline> After  a recital  of the names of certain men  who are  prominent in our national life, the  honorable  gentleman suggested that  there is  something sinister in their activities,  and  purported to make an accusation  against  success. Such an accusation  would  seem to denote the possession  by that  honorable gentleman of the form  of psychology  which would suppress  and destroy  rather than emulate. </para>

                    <para>Reference has frequently been  made to  the number of bank notes  which the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert.</inline> Gibson would  have been  forced to print had the Labour  party  during its term of office from 1929  to  1931 been not only in office,  but also in  power.

                    <para class="block">Robert Gibson to the position of Chairman  of  Directors of the Commonwealth  Bank. It  also occurs to me that that  appointment  was made more  or  less  behind the  backs of members  of  the party,  the  paramount idea probably being that,  sooner or  later, the more irresponsible  members  would seize control and that in  such  an event <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson would  act as a  bulwark against their designs.  I recollect  also - I hope that I shall not  offend  against either dignity or propriety,  nor  hurt the sensitive feelings of the  Chair  in what I am about to say - that  there  was rather a hell of a row when  the  party was informed of the decision.  I know  that it was considered an awful  thing  by those irresponsible members who  were  anxious to indulge in the wild and  mad  printing of notes. </para>

                            <para>- I intend to reply briefly, not only to the accusation,  but  also to the contentions put forward  by  honorable members who sit on this  side  of the chamber. It has been said  that,  although the Lyons Government has  been in  office for over three years, not  a great  deal has been done to relieve unemployment. I suggest that that is not  a  fact, and previous speeches from this  side  of the House substantiate  that  statement. The tenure of  office  of theLyons Administration may be divided into two parts, the first of which involved the rehabilitation of the finances of Australia,  the  restoration of confidence, and the re-establishment of credit. Those three important undertakings were necessary  as a  prelude to the economic reconstruction  of  Australia in this, the second term. Honorable members will remember that  during  its first six months of office, the  Lyons  Government had time for practically nothing but the preparation of legislation designed to bring about the downfall  of the  menace of Langism in New  South Wales. </para>

When I was interrupted, I was pointing out that the Lyons Government, in its first six months of office, was fully occupied in devising means to overcome the greatest menace to recovery in Australia and to the reemployment of the Australian people, that we have had for a number of years. At the end of the first period, honorable members who sit on this side of the chamber were able to claim that the fullest measure of success had been obtained in everything that the Government had set out to achieve. Confidence was re-established, investment showed an improvement, our finances were completely restored, and our credit was again sound. We are now embarking on the second period, that of what I may term economic reconstruction. That is my reply to the accusation of procrastination. </para>

                    <para>In regard to the assertion by honorable members on this side that the Government has not a comprehensive policy, I would point out that practically every item of policy which it presented to the people at the last elections, involves an attack on the unemployment problem. If </para>
                    <para class="block">I were asked to name the prelude to a world-wide attack on the problem, I should point to what has been achieved in Australia. First, there are stability and sound government; - government that begets confidence, stimulates investment, and sets the wheels of private enterprise in motion. I believe that a great number of the problems facing the world -would be much more speedily settled if every country could achieve the same stability of government that we have in Australia. Stability of government is what I might term the prelude to any attack on this problem, and it is for that reason that I take this first opportunity afforded to me to welcome the fusion of the two parties forming the composite Government. It should guarantee to Australia at least six years of stable government. </para>
                    <para>The question of employment is also involved in any consideration of rural rehabilitation. If something can be done to set our rural industries on a firm and sound footing, to give them confidence, and to restore the purchasing power lacking in the secondary industries, something real will he achieved towards a solution of the unemployment problem. </para>
                    <para>I come now to the question of trade treaties. If we can extend production, or if, by finding additional markets for our primary products, we can raise the level of commodity prices, again a real attack will have been made on the problem of unemployment. </para>
                    <para>The Government has brought forward a policy of public works. It may be termed its short-range policy of tackling the unemployment problem. That the Government is in a position to embark on a real and comprehensive policy of public works clearly shows that the confidence of the investor is high. Honorable members complain that full details have not yet been given to the House. I understand that the matter is still under the consideration of the Government, hut I am in. a position to assure honorable members opposite that a real and comprehensive programme is being evolved. </para>
                    <para>I would like now to refer to a statement made by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway)</inline> about the employment position in different countries. The <inline font-style="italic">World Economic Survey,</inline> issued by the League of Nations, bears out the contention of the honorable member for Martin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McCall)</inline> last week, that, within the last few years, the im- provement  in the employment position as been greater in Australia than in any other country in the world. A return compiled by the International Labour Office  also gives very comprehensive figures in relation to employment in the different countries of the world. Both publications are the  latest  available, that issued by the International Labour Office being dated September of this year. The figures given in these publications show that in regard to employment Australia is leading the world. </para>
                    <para>I now desire to speak on another matter which has scarcely been touched upon during this debate, and one to which I have given a great deal of thought. World conditions in all countries have altered very completely during the last 25 years. We have seen the abandonment of the old method of government, which operated in the 18th and 19th centuries, frequently referred to as the system of <inline font-style="italic">laissez-faire.</inline> To-day we have many forms of State control. We live in a world in which we see many new phases of State control. We have control of wages, control of output in many secondary industries, control of currency, and so on. I have often wondered whether or not in this evolutionary process this country has not lagged behind in not applying modern systems to modern conditions. No one nation to-day in the world can legislate as if it were a self-contained entity. Every nation is definitely a part of the economic world as a whole. In any plans we devise we must therefore take that important factor into consideration. In consideration of these changes can one ask: Is not some part of our Australian system obsolete, or, at least, behind the times? If so, is there any way by which we may correct it? For example, is there any root cause of unemployment inherent to the system under which we live in Australia to-day? I refer particularly to our industrial system. This matter was briefly touched upon by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> in his fine maiden speech in this House a week or so ago; but a good deal of elaboration could be made upon it. I ask that an inquiry be made into certain aspects of our industrial system in the hope that some root cause of the problem of unemployment may be found. Take the questions of the machine, hours, and costs. Instances of the effect on employment of the machine have been mentioned freely in this House, but no person in Australia can say authoritatively what effect the machine has had in relation to unemployment. The question is often asked: Is there any return to employment through the machine? I would answer " that question definitely in the affirmative. We know that as a result of massproduction methods commodity prices have in many cases been cheapened to such an extent that there has been made possible a wider dissemination of commodities to the masses. Perhaps the most notable exponent of the machine and its use as a factor in creating employment is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Henry</inline> Ford. However, it is definite that there has been some return to employment by the machine. But is the employment which is due to the machine overbalanced by the unemployment created by the machine? My answer is that the loss of employment due to the machine is not outweighed by employment created through its agency. Does that mean that we must reduce working hours in order to lessen unemployment? We have to realize to-day that we are only in the stages of the transition from manual labour to the machine, and that unemployment will continue to increase due to the more extended use of machinery. To-day we hear of a machine capable of taking the raw wool at one end, scouring it, combing it, weaving it, and parcelling it, without it being touched by a single human hand. If such a machine is universally employed, we can visualize the thousands of textile workers who will be deprived of employment. We must realize, too, that as man progresses and devises new machines he also creates the data for some other person to improve them. Unemployment has been created by the machine and as time goes on and the genius of man still further mechanizes production, unemployment must continue to increase. Does this mean that the hours of labour must be shortened? </para>
                    <para class="block">It may do so; but can any person in Australia state authoritatively to what extent hours should be lessened? This opens up further consideration of the. costs that would be involved if such a system were adopted. No country can take action without considering the effect on every other nation as part of an economic whole. If, therefore, we decided upon a reduction of hours of labour, which inevitably would throw additional cost burdens upon the export industries in particular, it might react to the detriment of Australia. The question to be solved by us is whether we cannot arrive at some process of reducing costs or of sharing costs in such a way as to make possible the further re-employment of our people. </para>
                    <para>The next point is the problem of the unemployed youth and the excess of unskilled labourers. In Victoria the boy problem is diminishing. It is possible to get boys of from fourteen to fifteen years of age placed in employment, but once a youth attains the age of eighteen to 23 years a difficult problem arises. Many parents are ambitious to educate their children to fit them better for the journey through life. If a boy is given a higher education he finds that when he leaves college at the age of eighteen or nineteen years there is no job for him. This is a very real problem which faces the country to-day. Then there is the problem of the excess of unskilled labourers in Australia. The Attorney-General mentioned that in some trades at least skilled labourers were at a premium. He mentioned the building industry. Here we have another phase of our national life that must become more apparent as time goes on. We meet here the effect of changes in the desires and activities of man. It may be said, perhaps, that the age of wood in the building industry has to a certain extent passed, and that the age of steel and concrete is with us. It may be that there are men willing and able to undertake the construction of wooden buildings, but not sufficient men able to undertake steel and concrete work. Undoubtedly, as time goes on, these changes, and other changes which the mind of man will devise, will affect us. Again the increased use of the  machine  will tend to reduce physical effort, and this will undoubtedly show its effect in the ranks of unskilled labourers. I ask whether this problem, together with that of unemployed youth, is not in some way related to our apprenticeship system? I should like a thorough inquiry to be made into it. I am asking this and other questions, but not answering them, for I have not the data on which to base an answer. I want to know the facts. I believe that in our present apprenticeship system there is to be found a root cause of unemployment. </para>
                    <para>I come now to the subject of women in industry, which was also mentioned by the Attorney-General. This is a phase of national life which has come into prominence in recent years. The employment of women in industry received a great impetus during the war. Our men were called away to fight and women stepped into their positions. When the war was over and the men returned, the women did not vacate their posts. They still hold them. I do not suggest that women should be debarred from competing with men - far from it. I rejoice at the degree of emancipation which women have achieved for themselves. The attainment of their independence, their desire to accept responsibility, and their proved capacity successfully to discharge responsibility, are worthy of high praise. I have no desire whatever to drive women back to the conditions of the Victorian era, when their lives were circumscribed and narrow in every respect. Rather do I desire that they shall be afforded every opportunity to make perhaps a greater contribution to our national life than they have made in the past. But while I acknowledge the right of women to compete with men, I also realise 'that in many instances the women have competed with men for similar work at lower rates of wages. This is probably the reason why they have come into industry in such great numbers. Here is another subject for inquiry, and the subject of costs again obtrudes itself. If wages are made equal for men and women in industry, or in certain forms of industry, then additional costs must be imposed. I realize, of course, that every large industry is seriously affected by its wages sheets, and the question of costs must lie looked into in a survey of this branch of the problem. I am enumerating these questions with the object of indicating the abundant scope for thorough inquiry into this vexed problem of unemployment. </para>
                    <para>The fourth point that I shall mention has relation to the conditions that apply in industry. In this connexion I ask whether our industrial system can be simplified, whether it is too wasteful, whether its overhead costs are a substantial cause* of friction between employers and employees. Is there not some way, or are there not some principles, that could be adopted to make it run more , smoothly and more perfectly for all concerned? I consider that our whole industrial system should be more elastic than it is at present. We are a primary producing nation dependent for our national income to a very great extent upon the sale of our commodities overseas. If the prices of these commodities fall, depression occurs in Australia; if they increase, we enter a boom period, with prosperity everywhere. When such a boom occurs employment is plentiful; but unfortunately employment on such a basis is not stable. We know from recent reports that a partial breakdown has occurred in. our industrial arbitration system owing to the failure of our numerous arbitration courts and wage-fixing tribunals of one kind and another to re-arrange our rates of wages so that they will be in keeping with our national income. I think every honorable member will admit that we should aim at a system of industry which will be stable and give continuous employment to the greatest possible number of people. Such a system would be far preferable to one that provides an abundance of employment in periods of prosperity and boom, but renders inevitable serious unemployment in periods of depression. If our industrial system and  wage-fixing  machinery were sufficiently elastic to adapt themselves to the variations of our national income, it would be advantageous to all concerned, for we should then achieve a degree of stability which is most desirable. I have heard the previous Attorney-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Latham,</inline> express the opinion, perhaps not in these identical words, but in words that are equivalent to them, that any stranger who inquired into our industrial system and used his powers of observation, would say that the whole thing had been designed by a lunatic. It must be conceded that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Latham</inline> had wide knowledge of the subject. He was Minister for Industry for many years and possessed a mind capable of formulating a sound judgment on the subject.  My experience has not been sufficiently wide to enable me to pass judgment. But if it is a fact that our industrial system could be described as the work of a lunatic, it surely is right and proper that this Parliament, and other parliaments affected by the problem, should take steps to rectify the position. If there is here a root cause of unemployment, we should be up and doing to meet it. The trouble is surely capable of correct diagnosis, and, given a correct diagnosis, there is more prospect of applying a permanent cure. </para>
                    <para>The present Attorney-General mentioned some of these points in his speech, and stressed the need for inquiry into the whole subject. He went on to say that unfortunately Ministers of the Crown were so busy with routine work that they had no opportunity to make a close study of the subject. Are we therefore to leave the problem without thorough investigation because Ministers have not the time to devote to it? I do not think that that is the inference which the Attorney-General desired us to draw from his speech. I quite agree that under existing conditions Ministers have not the time to devote to this problem that should be spent upon it. Therefore, I suggest that an exhaustive inquiry should be made into it by a committee of persons not connected with Parliament. If a report were made on it by the right men it would be accepted as authoritative. A report made by members of the Government, or even by a committee of members of any one particular party in this Parliament would, upon its presentation to the Parliament, become the centre of a first-class party political fight, and its value would be seriously impaired in the minds of the people. The discussion of the report in Parliament and elsewhere would tend to give a false impression as to its worth. For that reason, I suggest that a committee of men of proved standing in the community should be appointed to make the inquiry and present the report. If that course were adopted, the report would be regarded as of great value by the community in general. I suggest that a committee of three be appointed. I shall not suggest more than one name for membership of that committee; but there is one gentleman who, in my opinion, would make the ideal  chairman  of it. He is one who holds the respect' and admiration of every honorable member of this House, and who, by his wonderful devotion to public life, and his proved record of valuable work for the welfare of the community, is peculiarly fitted for such a duty. He is a man with a particularly keen analytical brain, which, of course, would be necessary in considering these problems. I refer to the former Attorney-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Latham.</inline> I believe that if he and two others were appointed to make this inquiry they could render an invaluable practical service to the Commonwealth. The other members of the committee could be, perhaps, a representative of Labour, and a representative of business and commercial interests in Australia who would be able from their experience to give valuable advice. I suggest, in all sincerity, that this committee should be set up at once, and that it should make a complete investigation into every phase of our industrial system, with particular reference to the points I have specified. The whole problem should be faced at the earliest possible moment. Though it may be vain repetition, I wish to say that I believe in the basic principles that underlie our form of government in Australia. I believe that the initiative and ambition of men will always be the driving force of progress. I would not suppress these qualities, as some honorable members wish to do, nor condemn success, as the honorable member for Griffith <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Baker)</inline> did. These driving forces, properly regulated and controlled,- are capable of doing a great deal for the benefit of mankind. If there is anything wrong in our industrial system or in the application of the fundamental principles which underlie it, honorable members on this side of the chamber are challenged to apply the remedy, and so do something which will be for the true benefit and welfare of the Australian people. This matter is urgent. Immediate action is essential. It is definitely necessary to the welfare of Australia that any mistakes in our form of government should be rectified; otherwise anarchy and choas  may overtake us and retard the genius and the progress of man. </para>

                        <para>.- The remarkable construction that has been placed upon the speech of the honorable member for Griffith <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Baker)</inline> by the honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hutchinson),</inline> together with some of the desires attributed to members of the Labour party by candidates of the United Australia party and Country party during the last election, cause me to address the committee. During the election campaign, we were charged with desiring to rob the people of their savings. The honorable member for Griffith has been accused of suggesting that persons who have been appointed to positions of influence in this country are dishonest. What the honorable gentleman said was that these gentlemen, through long occupation of their various positions, and the influence of their environment, have had their better judgment clouded by their own financial interests. We all remember that years ago we were told that when the present High Commissioner for Australia in London <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> became Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, lie immediately surrendered all his commercial and business interests. It has since been proved positively that this was not so. Immediately that gentleman was defeated for the Flinders division by the present honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway)</inline> he resumed the controlling interest that he had retained in the firm of Paterson, Laing and Bruce. </para>

                    <para>The honorable member for Indi then went on to show how the unemployment problem was being dealt with successfully by this Government. The whole secret, according to him, was that the present Government had re-established the confidence of overseas investors in Australia. I have here a typescript copy of an article which appeared in the London Chamber of Commerce Journal of January, 1933, in which there is quoted a speech made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> who, after his political defeat in Australia, went to London to look after the interests of his company. He spoke on the 2nd of December, 1932, and this is "what he said - </para>

                        <para>For the year ended 30th June, 1930, there was an adverse trade balance of £34,000,000, but as a result of the steps taken, by the end of June, 1932, this had been completely wiped out and Australia had a favorable trade balance of over £30,000,000. These figures showed what a tremendous task had been accomplished . . . Faced with the heavy fall in the value of its export trade and the necessity of providing some £30,000,000 for interest overseas, Australia had ruthlessly to cut down imports and the curtailment effected was from £131,000,000 in 1929-30 to £44,000,000 in 1931-32. This curtailment was elected by prohibitions or embargoes, surcharges, and very heavy increases in all customs duties. No other course was open to the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para class="block">What <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> did not say was that every member of the then Opposition - who were members of the party to which he had belonged - opposed the Labour Government's policy for the correction of Australia's adverse trade balance. It was a Labour government that re-established confidence in this country, but it received very little credit at the time from anyone in Australia. Indeed, the policy adopted by the Scullin Government at that time, would, I have no doubt, have been opposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> himself, had he been sitting in Opposition, just as it was actually opposed by his friends who remained here. </para>
                    <para>The honorable member for Indi referred to the effect of machinery on unemployment, and admitted that it might, to some extent, be a factor to be considered. It does not need much imagination to realize that it is a most important factor. The area which I represent in this Parliament produces three-fifths of the sugar grown in Australia, yet there are fewer men employed there in the industry than ten years ago, when the quantity of sugar produced waa not nearly so great. There is more sugar being produced per acre than was the case ten years ago, though it takes less cane to produce it and fewer men to do the work. Owing to improved agricultural methods, the use of fertilizers and the introduction of improved varieties of cane, the sugar content has been steadily increased; while the introduction of improved machinery, both on the farms air!  in the mills, has resulted in the displacement of labour. The same tendency is noticeable in the dairying industry.  At  one time any kind of old scrub cow was considered good enough,  but  to-day dairymen arestriving to  improve  the quality of their herds. The introduction and improvement of machinery has displaced millions of workers throughout the world. I am not one of those who believe that we should destroy machinery because it is hurting us, or that we can put back the hands of the clock. Like the honorable member for Indi, I believe that the use of machinery will be extended, but, unlike him, I have very definite ideas on the subject of working hours. I do not say that  a  curtailment of working hours " may be " necessary; I say that it is absolutely necessary. To begin with, we should shorten the working week to 40 hours. "We should not worry about what is happening in other countries. It may be that if we shorten the working week, costs will be increased, but that is not in itself necessarily an evil. In other countries of the world costs are low, yet they  cannot  find a market for their produce. We read of enormous quantities  of  coffee and other foodstuffs being deliberately destroyed in order to keep up prices. It is not because the people have all they want of those commodities that there is no market for them ; it is because they lack purchasing power. The honorable member for Martin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McCall)</inline> said that the amount of money available was limited. That theory has been worn out long ago. If  a  war were to break out to-morrow there would be plenty of money with which to finance it. </para>
                    <para>The honorable member for Indi unintentionally, no doubt, misconstrued a statement of the honorable member for Melbourne  Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway),</inline> who did not say or suggest that the honorable member for Martin was trying to mislead the House when he quoted certain figures. The fact is that the honorable member for Martin quoted from an official publication issued in September, while the honorable member for Melbourne Ports quoted from the same journal, but from the issue of a month later. That accounts for the discrepancy in the figures. </para>
                    <para>The honorable member for Indi asked that a committee be set up to investigate the problem of unemployment, and report back to this House. Ever since the inception of federation similar inquiries on other matters have been made, and especially since 1915. The reports have been produced at great cost, but no good has ever come of them because no attempt has been made to carry them out. A few years ago a royal commission issued a report upon a proposal to establish a system of national insurance, and, according to what we read, the report was a good one. As usual we were informed that no money was available with which to put the scheme into operation. It is always the same whenever a proposal is made to do anything which would be of real use to the people. For instance, in Northern Queensland, at the present time, a dangerous disease, known as Weil's disease has become prevalent. It has been proved that it is carried by rats, and already it has been responsible for the deaths of several sugar-workers. When it was suggested that active steps should be taken by the Commonwealth to combat the disease we were told that there was no money available, and that, in any case, it was a matter for the State Government. I maintain that it is the concern of the national government, because at any time it might spread to other parts of Australia. The disease is in no way peculiar to Northern Queensland, and might easily spread wherever there are rats to carry it. However, the cry always is, " If only we had the money ". I say that money is the only thing that is madeout of nothing. During the last election campaign honorable members opposite accused us of trying to rob the poor people of their savings. They know very well that in any scheme of credit expansion, the savings of the people would never be touched. More than 90 per cent. of transactions of the present time are settled in cheque currency. </para>

                            <para>- The creation of credit in that sense amounts only to an entry in the books of the bank, and the Labour party merely intended to extend  the system. The honorable member for Indi said that inure was a "hell of a row " in the Labour party room over the re-appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson as  chairman  of the board of directors 'of the Commonwealth Bank. I believe that a much better appointment could have been made, and that, I am convinced; was the opinion of the majority of the members of the party. However, he was reappointed, and he made some remarkable statements about what could be done in the way of finance. When a question was asked of the then Treasurer, M.r. Theodore, regarding the attitude of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson to the proposal for the export of gold, the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> ran out of the caucus room with his hands in the air so that the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> representative could see him; and cried that he would never - " so help me God," he said - be a party to the export of our gold. " Because," he said, " if that happens Australia's credit will go by the board." Yet within three months of his becoming Prime Minister his Assistant Treasurer, the then member for Flinders, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce,</inline> introduced a* bill - and he supported it - with the object of allowing the gold backing to our notes to be exported, and he had the temerity to claim that because he had re-established the credit of Australia the export of our gold was permissible. What is behind the currency of any country except the wealthproducing capacity of its people? The statutory authority given by this Parliament merely makes the note issue legal tender in Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson declared that there was no danger to Australia in the export of the gold backing of the note issue, and that all that was required to enable it to be done was an amendment of the Commonwealth Bank Act. It would have been just as easy for a Labour government as for this Government to print notes as they now stand ; there is no. gold behind them. The promise to redeem in gold has gone. The bank merely gives another note in exchange. There is certainly a greater touch of loyalty about the present Australian note in that a water-mark picture of the head of the Prince of Wales is included, but debts outside Australia could not be paid with these notes. To do that it is necessary to export produce. </para>

                    <para>I listened with interest to certain remarks made in another part of this building to-day to the effect that restrictions should be placed on our exports because of the position of Great Britain. One might agree with that, but for the fact that the figures indicate an increase of imports into Great Britain from foreign countries, while our exports to Great Britain have been curtailed. I have suggested in this chamber, and in many other places that the only way in which we can meet our internal obligations is by the export of our primary products, and that if other countries would not accept those products they would have no chance of being paid in any other way. In its issue of the 3rd October, the <inline font-style="italic">Queensland Producer,</inline> which is not a Labour journal, but represents the primary producers of that State, published the following extracts from a book written by Lord Beaverbrook: - lt would be a lie to say that: New Zealand is damaging the British dairy farmer. Last year New Zealand sent us only <inline font-style="italic">2i</inline> million  cwts  of butter, while foreign countries sent 3$ million  cwts  There is room in the market for both the British farmer and the New Zealand producer, if we shut out the foreigner. New Zealand offers us Empire free trade. The British Government has rejected it. </para>
                    <para>It would bc a lie to say that: The British dairy farmer is threatened with ruin because of butter imports from Australia. Last year, Australia sent us 100,000 cwts. of butter less than the year before. But Russia sent 240,000 cwts. more. Holland sent 100,000 cwts more. </para>
                    <para>It would be a lie to say that: The British dairy farmer is menaced by imports from the dominions. In the first three months of 1034 our import of condensed milk from British countries fell by £37,000 when compared with the same period of 1033. But our imports from foreign countries increased by £38,000. We took that sum of money from the British producers overseas and gave it to the foreigners. </para>
                    <para>It would be a lie to say that: The British dominions are the enemies of the British dairy farmer. It is the foreign producers who are the enemies of the dairy farmer. In the six months September, 1933, to February, 1934, our imports of butter from British countries increased by (i9,000 cwts. over the same period in the previous year. But bur imports from  foreign  countries rose by 169,000 Cwts. The British Government has in effect been offered Empire free trade by New Zealand, and could avail itself of that offer by diverting orders for butter from foreign countries to producers in Britain and the dominions. </para>
                    <para>It would be a lie to say that: The British dominions damage our pig producers. It would be true to Bay that we are buying more chilled and frozen pork - but we are buying a bigger proportion of it from foreign landa. In the first three months of 1934 we took 70,000 cwts. more of this pork from British countries than in the same months of 1933. But we bought 103,000 Cwts. more of it from foreigners. . . " If you spend a shilling on Australian butter, every penny of that shilling comes back to this country in the form of purchases by the Australians of British goods or interest-payments on British money invested in Australia. If you spend a shilling on Danish butter, only 3 id. out of your shilling will be spent by the Danes in this country. If you spend a shilling on Russian butter, only 2d. of the shilling comes back to Britain to give work to our people. Buy your butter from the Empire countries which buy from us. Shun the butter from foreigners, who do not spend their money in Britain." </para>
                    <para class="block">Effect could be given to that policy to a much greater degree than at the present time. A visitor from Great Britain stated this morning that the present position was due to Britain's financial obligations and its interests in other countries. As to that, there is not the slightest doubt. I have stated in this chamber on a number of occasions that the producers of Argentina receive trade preferences from Great Britain, so that Argentina's overseas indebtedness may be discharged. On one occasion the Consul-General for Great Britain in Argentina advised the British Government that, unless an army contract for beef supplies were given to Argentina, that country could not be expected to repay Britain the money lent to it. If foreign countries threaten that they will not meet their debts to Britain, it is only to be expected that in order to protect its own interests Britain will recognize that the only channel through which it can be paid is that which I have indicated.

                    <para class="block">We were told by the honorable member for Indi that a committee of inquiry should be established to investigate these problems ; but I contend that such a body would waste' a year or eighteen months in an effort to tell the Parliament what it should already know. Individual members have access in the Parliamentary Library to the definite opinions of the greatest world authorities on industrial and commercial matters as to the best means of solving our economic ills. Therefore it is unnecessary for a parliamentary or other committee to make peregrinations through Australia or any other country for the purpose of seeking advice. I should strongly object to such a procedure. It is patent to everybody that if it is now possible, in a certain number of hours, to produce twenty times more goods than it was ten years ago, something is radically wrong. Of course, this is due to the mechanization of industry; the machine has been put into use to do the work previously done by human hands. </para>

                            <para>- No, but the ideas on the subject held by the world's foremost authorities are, as I have said, to be read in our library. Our primary producers complain of a loss of markets. On the Atherton Tableland machinery made in the United States of America is largely used by the farmers. They motor to the towns in American cars and most of their work is performed by the machinery, chiefly American, driven by American oil. A few years ago,  300  horse teams were employed on the tableland ; to-day we see a few bullock teams, but practically no horses. Tractors are used for hauling logs to the railways. The market  for the  maize produced by the farmers has disappeared, largely because the horse has gone out of use. I am pleased to notice, however, that, in some instances, the horse iB being reverted to in place of powerdriven machinery. The mechanization of industry has been adopted to such an extent that in some cases on the sugar and cotton fields ploughing is continued throughout the 24 hours by using the shift sys'tem. In the sugar and cotton districts, as well as in other localities, labour is thus being displaced. This process will continue, and the evil will become more pronounced. L read some time ago a book in which it was suggested that the only logical way to deal with the problem of unemployment was to exterminate those now unemployed. That statement, was positively made, and that was the only inference to be drawn from the arguments advanced. When machinery becomes more efficient and more widely used, the extermination of more men will presumably be required, and only one or two machines will be needed to do all the work necessary. That may seem a stupid statement, but it is based on sound premises. We must either provide the unemployed with means of access to the things that they require in the shape of credit, or reduce the hours of labour in order to enable them to obtain their share of the necessaries of life. To continue to distribute the dole is to demoralize the unemployed, particularly young people who are forced to live on charity, instead of cultivating their physical and brain power. They are fast becoming human derelicts, and it is essential to put them back into industry. This cannot be done unless the present hours of work are reduced. For many years before I entered this chamber I was associated with the Australian Workers Union along the Queensland coast, and did a good deal of fighting in connexion with cases in the Arbitration Court. In that capacity the displacement of labour by machinery in the sugar industry was brought closely under my notice. To-day fewer men are employed in that industry than a few years ago, and not many years hence even a smaller number will be engaged in it, but no doubt as much sugar as at present, and possibly more, will be produced. If that policy is to be pursued it will bs impossible to employ the same number of persons as at present for the hours now worked. I refuse to believe that over-production has occurred until every unit in the community receives all that it requires to live in comfort, and since there are 300,000 unemployed in Australia we have not yet reached that desirable state of affairs. Australia and Britain are the two greatest stickinthemuds in the world in opposition to the reduction of hours of labour. Support of that statement is found by reference to the Geneva publications. When other countries have urged a reduction of hours at the International Labour Conference*, the Governments of Great Britain and of Australia, when representing the party now in power in either country, have invariably opposed such a proposal. Yet the party opposite professes to he anxious to find a solution of the problem of unemployment. </para>

                    <para>We have been told on many occasions that the present Government is anxious to find a way out. All I have to say on that point is that it works very slowly. As soon as the subject of the reduction of hours is mentioned, the member for Indi, who no doubt voices the views of honorable members opposite generally, says that that would increase the cost of production, a matter which had to be carefully considered, as Australia had to compete against other countries. I point out that we have not the least chance of being able to compete with other countries in the matter of costs. We remember that thousands of tons of coffee have been thrown into the ocean. Extremely low wages are paid to the sugar-workers of Cuba, Hawaii, and Fiji. In eastern countries the remuneration of workers is often not more than ls. a day, and in many instances it is as low as 6s., 5s., and even 4s. 9d. a week. Where do we hope to get under such conditions? How can we expect to compete with other countries? To do so, we should have to submit to much greater hardships than those from which we now suffer. Is it that there is a scarcity of those things which man needs? The conditions are so much better in Queensland, due to the administration of a Labour government, that many people are making their way to that State. In my electorate more than 1,000 men who are engaged on government works of different kinds do not belong to that particular part -of Australia. I do not blame people for going where they think that the conditions are most attractive. My only regret is that the provision made in other States is not sufficient to take off the unemployed market as many men as are being given work by the Queensland Government. If the provision in proportion to population were as great in New South Wales and Victoria, there would be a very considerable reduction of the number of unemployed, and the primary products which cannot now be sold would be consumed instead of being dumped. Every day one reads in responsible publications of the deliberate destruction of food that is needed by mankind. The continuance of that state of affairs will not help to solve the problem. The cost of production does not enter into the question. The goods have been produced and are available. The satisfaction to be derived from feeding the people is surely preferable to the clumping of goods into the sea. Last Sunday morning I was privileged to listen to a lecture delivered by the Bishop of Goulburn to the Church of England Men's Society. The statements of this responsible reverend gentleman were a revelation to me. Were he to make them in this chamber, the advocates of the continuance of the present system would squirm in their seats.  His  address is reported in last Monday's <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times,</inline> and may be read by honorable members, lt deals poignantly with the effect of the machine on the human family. A definite easing of our difficulty would be obtained by the reduction of the hours of labour by at least four hours a week. That would enable many of our people to obtain employment. </para>

                    <para>The Government made rural rehabilitation a specific issue at the last elections, and sought a definite mandate to deal with it. The problem really arises out of the condition of the farmers throughout Australia, and involves the question: What proposals should be instituted in order to give relief? There are two aspects of the matter: First, the position of the individual farmer; and secondly, the position of the farming community as a whole,- particularly in relation to the commodities produced. </para>

It will be understood that, as the Constitution now stands, the Commonwealth has not the power to deal directly with such domestic -matters as the tenure and financial security of the primary producer; it must accordingly act through the medium of financing existing or future State schemes. Consultation with the State authorities in order to determine the precise nature of proposals and the amount of  financial  assistance necessary, together with the terms upon which it should be provided, will at once be put in hand. </para>

                    <para class="block">Last year a committee of members of this House was appointed by the then Attorney-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Latham,</inline> to consider incidentally the position of the farmers of Australia so far as the States' schemes were affected by the Bankruptcy Act. The position presented itself in this form : It is highly desirable that farmers who are in reasonably good producing areas should continue the useful work upon which they are engaged. Owing to the depression and, in some cases, to governmental urging to increase  production, many primary producers throughout Australia' are carrying on under most difficult conditions. Is it possible to devise some scheme whereby relief may be given and production may be continued? The real problem is to enable these men to adjust their position under their existing liabilities. The Commonwealth promised to consider that matter and, if possible, to render assistance to achieve the end desired. The committee had to consider the position of the farmers in relation to State schemes. It found that, under the existing Commonwealth bankruptcy law, a petition presented against a farmer in certain circumstances  might override the provisions of the State law relating to rural relief. Accordingly, an amendment of the Bankruptcy Act was made, under which the judge in bankruptcy could order a stay of proceedings on a petition so that the farmer might not be placed in the position of a bankrupt and the State machinery could continue to operate. That is the law at present. The duty of dealing with this problem devolves primarily upon "the States, and not upon the Commonwealth. They are concerned with the settling of people upon the land, and have enacted appropriate machinery to deal with the matter. They have established banks for the assistance of rural industries, and have developed the whole of the administrative arrangements in such a way as to help the farmer to the fullest possible extent. The problem which had to be faced was the position of the farmer who, while practically insolvent, had yet some hope of success if his affairs could be adjusted in such a way that he could  continue  production until normal times arrived. Four of the States took steps to deal with the matter. The first was South Australia, which in 1929 passed the Debt Adjustment Act and later the Farmers Relief Acts. The object of that legislation was to enable meetings of creditors to he called, voluntary arrangements to be made, and financial assistance to be given, so that the farmers might continue production. The Farmers Debt Adjustment Act was passed in Western Australia, the Farmers Relief Act in New South Wales, and the Unemployed Occupier and Farmers Relief Act in Victoria. In all these cases, the States were really experimenting. They were opening up new avenues for the giving of assistance to farmers who were in distressed circumstances, instead of resort being had to the extreme measure of bankruptcy, which in many cases, unfortunately, means the winding up of a man's affairs and the distribution of his assets. The object of bankruptcy ought to be the relief of insolvent debtors, with due regard to the rights of creditors. The purpose of this legislation was not so much to satisfy the demands of creditors as to enable the producing debtor to reestablish himself financially. </para>

If honorable members desire further particulars, I refer them to the report of a South Australian parliamentary committee which carefully investigated the whole question of debt adjustment, and made a close analysis of the position of the farmers of that State. The report of the wheat commission, recently presented, says that it is estimated that the liabilities of the wheat farmers alone amount to £140,000,000. That is the enormous debt which about 60,000 or 70,000 farmers engaged in the. wheat industry in Australia have to carry.

                            <para>- Yes. As was pointed out by the Parliamentary committee in South Australia - " the present condition of the wheat industry, though serious, is not such as to afford any occasion for panic." It is necessary that legislation should be enacted to give those nien who, under normal conditions, would have a reasonable chance of success, such assistance as will enable them to remain on the land. That is the problem, and it is a pressing one. So long as economic nationalism continues, that problem will exist and must be dealt with; but the amendment moved by the honorable member for West Sydney, which is simply an instruction to the Government to place on the Statute Book a measure designed to provide £12,000,000 for rural rehabilitation, does not provide the machinery to give the assistance which he is so anxious to provide. It is necessary to consider what methods it would be adequate and wise for the Government to employ. It was aware that its power was limited. It knew what the powers of the States were. But it had first of all to consider to what extent the States were adequately dealing with this problem, and if they were dealing with it' inadequately, to ascertain the cause for that inadequacy, and to what extent the Commonwealth could render assistance. It is therefore reasonable for the Commonwealth Government to say that it will confer with the States to ascertain in what way it can help them, seeing that the Commonwealth's powers under the Constitution are, so limited. As a matter of fact, immediately this Government took office, the States were asked to submit schemes, and I understand that a scheme has already been submitted by New South Wales, and that other proposals are expected. From the Commonwealth point of view a federal scheme, involving the appropriation of moneys, should be uniform for the whole of Australia. The Government could not bring down to this House a request for a specific appropriation of moneys until a scheme submitted by the States had been considered at a conference with the States. That is only a reasonable way of dealing with the matter, </para>

                            <para>- I am dealing at the moment with the subject of individual farmers' debts, and in this connexion the schemes which have bee* in operation in New South Wales ana in some of the other States have been able to afford considerable relief, though it has been found necessary by some of the States to revise or modify them. The Premier of New South Wales, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stevens,</inline> is reported by the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> to have made the following statement at Holbrook in regard to compositions with creditors: - </para>

                        <para>I am satisfied that, with the provision of the requisite funds by the Government, an appreciable portion of the creditors of the heavily-pressed farmers would be willing to sell their claims upon the farmers at substantial discounts. Our first approach to the problem will be from this angle - that the Governments will provide the cash for voluntary debt adjustment in return for a cash settlement, the farmer becoming liable for the amount paid in settlement, or partsettlement of his debts, and that on this liability he shall be charged only the low rate of interest at which the Government will be able to raise the money, plus perhaps a small amount of administrative charges. Legislation to this end has already been introduced by the State Government. We are forwarding this week to the Federal Government our detailed proposals to give effect to the plans, and I have every ground for assuring you that before long a definite start will be made with this scheme. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>It is evident then that existing legislation will have to be widened in order to make it more inclusive and to provide a sum of money from the Commonwealth and States to permit of these adjustments. A voluntary arrangement between creditors and debtors will be facilitated by the granting of Government advances. </para>

                            <para>- In individual cases, they have been providing financial assistance, but we are now dealing with farmers whose whole position must be considered, and who are in a difficult situation because of continued low prices for their products. This necessitates complete schemes which will be of considerable help to the farmers. The New South Wales State Government feels that the undertaking will be of such a character that it will be necessary to have the assistance of the Commonwealth Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stevens</inline> has suggested that the Commonwealth will have to assume some responsibility. In these circumstances, the Commonwealth Government is not to be blamed for any delay in looking into the  position which exists in the States, and for endeavouring to get the States into harmony before bringing any proposal before the House. In this respect, it is deserving of commendation rather than condemnation. </para>

                    <para>The report of the Parliamentary committee in South Australia deals with a most important subject. It had been suggested that compulsory adjustments should be effected, but the committee drew attention to the danger of any suggestion of that kind, and considered that adjustments 'should be effected on a voluntary basis. The danger in any compulsory system is that unless great care is exercised the sources of credit through which the farmers derive relief may be destroyed. The committee was emphatic that the ordinary position between debtor and creditor should continue. That is the first aspect of the problem the Commonwealth Government has to face. </para>

                        <para>Although the bulk of the applications were received from wheat-growers, stay orders were actually issued to persons engaged in every sphere of primary production. It is notable in this connexion that as the benefits of the Act became known applications in increasing numbers were received from other districts irrespective of the type of farming carried on in those districts. The fact that the act is equally beneficial to graziers, dairy farmers, and other primary producers is being recognized, and the number of applications received from persons engaged in these other rural industries immediately prior to the expiration of the period under review indicates that the benefits o&lt; the Act will be widely embraced by these classes of primary producers prior to February 17th, 1934, the date of expiry of the period for the presentation of the stay orders. </para>

The condemnation which has been levelled against the Government is rather premature when the nature of the problem is considered, and when it is so essential to formulate a policy designed to confer the greatest benefit. </para>

                            <para>- Legislation was passed in South Australia as late as 1929, and only more recently in New South Wales and other States. No similar legislation has yet been passed in Queensland or Tasmania. Naturally, the Commonwealth Government could not enact legislation until the States had had some experience of legislation along the lines I have indicated. </para>

                    <para>The other point is the wider aspect of rural industries generally. This is a matter to which the Government has promised to give consideration, but which will also have to be considered by the States. It is necessary that the homegrown products of Australia should be disposed of under such conditions that producers will receive a fair price. The Government has called the State premiers together, and this problem will have to be considered in the light of the report of the wheat commission, and of the further information which will be contained in reports yet to he presented to the Government. The Commonwealth has already departed from strict orthodoxy in this regard. First of all, it made an entirely new experiment in connexion with the dried fruits industry and followed this later by legislation in connexion with dairy products, thus rendering considerable assistance to both industries. In both cases those engaged in the industries are able to get a more reasonable price for their products. To any one interested in studying the methods of other countries, I would recommend a study of the methods employed by the United States of America under the operation of the Farm Recovery Act and other legislation of a similar character, although it is very difficult to get any decisive evidence of the result of those measures. Professor Edmund des Brunner, of Columbia University, in his book " <inline font-style="italic">The Farm Act of</inline> 1933 - <inline font-style="italic">Its place in the Recovery Programme " ,</inline> says - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>It is clear therefore, that the administrators of this law have turned their backs on the old philosophy of unconscious progress, of <inline font-style="italic">laissez-faire.</inline> They  frankly  declare that the law is a bold experiment in voluntary social control applied to what from the dawn of history has been one of the most individualistic of industries. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">The primary producers of Australia have been feeling their way to a more complete organization of their industry. In Queensland, for instance, the dairying industry has been completely organized in respect of both production and distribution. At first co-operative control was exercised throughout the industry by a voluntary organization, but the Commonwealth Parliament, by passing the Dairy Produce Act, put the coping stone on the structure. The whole industry is now working under the authority and in accordance with the legislative provisions. </para>
                    <para>The tendency is undoubtedly for a more complete organization of production and distribution. We have seen the plight of the isolated farmers in Australia. I was born among farmers and have followed their experiences throughout my life. As Professor Brunner said, farming in the past was of necessity one of the most individualistic operations that one could imagine. Rut even the farmers have been forced to organize their industry. The dairy farmers, as I have said, have done remarkable things in this regard. By the application of science to their industry, they are now able to manufacture butter here which wins prizes in the great agricultural shows in other parts of the world, and which is appreciated highly wherever it is properly marketed. The whole world, as we are well aware, is in a state of flux, and it seems to me that 'the co-operative principle will have to be applied to a greater extent if true progress is to be made. The Commonwealth Government is working along sound lines in seeking the co-operation of State governments, and in trying to evolve a plan of action, based on practical experience, which will beneficially affect all concerned. </para>
                    <para>I come now to the grave problem of unemployment. The Government has been accused of laxity in facing this tremendous issue; but we have to remember that the many ramifications of the problem make it extremely difficult to deal with. There is, of course, the necessity to make immediate provision to relieve the existing distress, that should not, and cannot, be overlooked. I feel that the Government should put in hand suitable public works to meet this need. But there is also the need to consider the putting in hand of larger public works which will provide more continuous employment and enable our people who are to-day out of work, to live on a standard more in accord with the general standard of the Australian people. Immediate relief works should be financed out of revenue, while schemes for reproductive works are a fair charge on loan expenditure. A careful reading of both the policy speech of the Prime Minister and the Governor-General's Speech will show that the Government desires to give a lead in the putting in hand of large public works which will provide employment not only for people of mature years .who are to-day without work, but also for the youth of the nation. Some of the public works which the Government appears to have in mind are afforestation, water conservation schemes,  sewerage works for large country towns, more complete housing plans, and also the provision of electric light and power supplies in certain areas that are to-day without these facilities. An endeavour should be made to undertake enterprises which, upon completion, -will be permanent assets to the Commonwealth and also sufficiently reproductive to meet interest and sinking fund charges. If the works are not in this category they will simply add to the public debt and so be an incubus on the people. Some honorable gentlemen have jibed at the Government because -the suggestion was made in the Governor-General's Speech that additional research was necessary into the root causes of unemployment. My view is that there is room for a good deal of additional investigation. The Attorney-General properly referred in his speech to the constitutional limitations to the power of the Commonwealth Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly not. I have said that works should be put in hand immediately to provide for them. I am now elaborating the point that there is room for additional research into the root causes of unemployment. I am aware that many books have been written on the subject. Of writing there seems to be no end. But the investigation is still far from complete. The Development and Migration Commission presented a report to Parliament in September, 1928, on " Unemployment and Business Stability in Australia." I do not desire to quote from it, but I advise honorable members to read' it. They will then realize how intricate and complicated the whole problem is. The report deals, in particular, with business: cycles and the periodic length of deepdepression and high, prosperity. Thereis not a complete statement of the situation in Australia; but the statisticsindicate the cycles in other countries^ What we need is undoubtedly more? stability and regularity in our industrial enterprises, and I feel that useful scientific and economic investigations could, be made into this whole subject. Othervaluable reports were presented by the Development and Migration Commission.. If they were reviewed they would probably reveal various avenues of some activities that could be opened up with* advantage. </para>

The honorable member for Macquarie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. JohnLawson)</inline> said, a few days ago, that certain orthodox methods that have proved' effective in the past may have to be diecarded in favour of unorthodox methods.

Every honorable member -will admit that a serious problem is facing us. We will all agree, too, that some phases of this problem are not altogether suitable for party political consideration. We shall have to regard them in a less partisan spirit. I believe that if honorable members opposite submit any really sound constructive proposals for dealing with the problem of unemployment in Australia, the Government will gladly consider them fairly.

                        <para>.- A groat deal of attention has been paid recently in this Parliament to the problem of unemployment, for it is realized that every citizen has the right to happiness, and that under our present -social system millions of our people are being denied that right. Apparently, however, honorable members opposite do not realize the appalling circumstances of many of the unemployed .people of this country. </para>

                    <para class="block">Other honorable members who also were returned to this House by narrow majorities, have adopted a like attitude. They have the power in their own hands to force the Government to do as they desire. Their votes are the weapons they must use. Personally, I do not think those honorable members will do very much in that respect. They had an opportunity the other day to give the unemployed people of this country a little relief for Christmas, but had to be content to let a proposal go through which amounts .to no more than a paltry dole.. I know that there are many unemployed persons in Adelaide, and -the honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stacey)</inline> also advocated  that some relief should be provided for them, but he also missed his opportunity to compel the Government to do something practical. Instead, he further advocated an extension of trade with foreign countries - *Japan for instance. At the present time the shop windows of our cities are filled with goods made in Japan, and those goods are sold here in competition with the products of our own secondary industries. </para>

                            <para>- That is so, and I think the law requires that they should be. This afternoon the honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hutchinson)</inline> referred to the problem of finding employment for our youths, and said that in Melbourne it was quite easy to place boys of from fourteen to sixteen years of age, but that it was almost impossible to get anything for them to do when they passed their seventeenth year. They are too old at eighteen. Child labour is the order of the day, yet this Government makes no effort to improve those conditions. I myself have had some experience in trying to find employment for youths and young men. So bad are conditions at present that many young men leaving the universities with high qualifications are at a dead end. Recently one man whom I know left the engineering school of the Sydney University fully qualified, and all he was able to get in the way of employment was an offer of £2 a week. I asked him how many of those who graduated along with him had been placed in employment, and he told me that out of 240 only three had found work in six months. Four or five others had gone to America because their parents were able to afford to send them there, but the rest were walking the streets without anything to do. </para>

                    <para>There is much room for improvement in the administration of war pensions. Among my constituents are some men who served for years at the war. When they returned, though they were undoubtedly suffering some ill-effects from their experience, they did not feel justified in applying for pensions. They returned to their former employment, but now, after the lapse of some years, the effects of their war service are becoming evident. In some cases their health has broken down, but they are finding it extremely difficult to nave their claims recognized. I know of one man who was discharged from the forces suffering from partial loss of sight in one eye. For twelve years the department paid him a pension, but two years ago he was called before a medical board, and the medical officer stated that, whatever was the matter with his sight, it could not be attributed to war service. The department is dealing harshly with many returned soldiers, who are entitled to more consideration than they are getting. Many men were induced to go to the war by promises made to them by patriotic citizens, some of whom, though eligible themselves for war service, preferred to stay at home and make fortunes out of the conditions arising out of the war. The promises made at that time should be honoured. In some instances the promises were made by the leaders of the governments of the day, and it is repudiation on the part of Australia when those promises are not carried out. The present Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> when Prime Minister of this country, after the war, stated that he would make Australia a land fit for heroes to live in. He is not doing very much in that direction now. </para>
                    <para>The position in regard to war service homes also calls for comment. There are many such homes in my district, and the position of some of the occupants is deplorable. I believe that the Australian people would be prepared to honour to the full every promise made by past governments to returned soldiers. Not one citizen would quibble. Recently, a returned soldier, an occupant of a war service home, applied to the Repatriation Department for a pension, but he died before he could be medically examined.  His  widow was left with only her pension from the State Government, and on this she had to support herself and her two children. For several weeks after the death of her husband she continued to pay 10s. a week rent for the house out of 35s. she was receiving. In due course, however, she was notified by the War Service Homes Commission that it would no longer receive her money, and an ejectment order was issued against her. The case was heard in the Campsie court. I brought the matter under the notice of the Minister, and the case was adjourned for a month; but when it comes before the court again Parliament will be in recess, and the magistrate will have no course open to him but to order this woman and her children out into the street. I say that Australia has a duty, not only to the diggers, but to their dependants as well. Last Sunday afternoon a meeting of the occupiers of war service homes in that district was held, and a resolution was passed condemning the action of the War Service Homes Commission in trying to evict this woman. If a bailiff is sent to turn this woman and her children out I am afraid he will accomplish it only over the dead bodies of the men who were the comrades of this woman's husband. If there is any of the spirit of Anzac left in them they will not see this injustice perpetrated, and no one could blame them for defending the children of their mate. A meeting is to be held in the Canterbury Town Hall of all the occupiers of war service homes in the Lang, Barton, Dalley and Reid electorates. I know that the Minister for Repatriation will be invited to attend, and I hope that some good will come of it. This morning I received a letter setting forth the terms of the resolution carried by the meeting held last Sunday. The first request is for a re- appraisement of the capital value of war service homes, and a writing-down of those values by 50 per cent. Another request is that the rate of interest should be reduced to 2 per cent. That, I think, is a fairly modest request. Those who took up war loans were given tax free bonds, and, in my opinion, those who fought in the war should at least have the benefit of interest-free money for the building of their homes. A further request was that the power to evict persons from war service homes should be taken out of the hands of the War Service Homes Commissioner, and given to the Federal Government. I do not believe that any government would dare to evict the widow and children of a digger, but the present Government is quite content to paisa on the responsibility to officers of the Public Service. Occupants of these homes desire that their dependants shall have some equity in them.. I have a letter from the Minister in Charge of War Service Homes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thorby)</inline> who states, with regard to a lady against whom an eviction order was issued, " It should be mentioned that </para>
                    <para class="block">

                        no legal interest in the home." Do honorable members know that if a "digger" in occupation of a war service home dies, and has paid about £700 off a house valued at £900, his widow has no legal interest in the equity in that home I

                            <para>- If he does not make a will the equity reverts to the department. In the case to which I have specially referred, the department informed the widow, not only that she had no legal interest in the home, 'but that, in the "Minister's opinion, she should take a house in keeping with her present position. In my opinion, and in that of many others, if it were not for the New South Wales Labour Government, many of these unfortunate persons would be housed in dog boxes. Any Australian Government should be ashamed to leave such an act as this on the statute-book, if returned soldiers and their dependants are to be treated in this way. It is time the Government honoured every promise made to the men who, in most cases, were induced to go into the firing line overseas by the assurance that their dependants would be shown every consideration. Owing to unemployment, many of the occupants of these homes are unable to meet their obligations to the department, and I hope that supporters of the Government will endeavour to see that justice is done to them. </para>

                    <para>During the regime of the Bruce-Page Government, a great number of royal commissions and committees were appointed, and, for the last seven or eight months, another commission has been inquiring into the price of petrol. I have taken an interest in politics for about 30 years, and I think that the  chairman  of this commission, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lamb,</inline> has succeeded in obtaining so many appointments of this kind that he has lived practically on fees received from commissions, and for prosecutions conducted by antiLabour governments, both in the New South Wales and in the Commonwealth arenas. It is high time an end was put to the farce of appointing commissions. What do we wish to know about the petrol industry that cannot be obtained without such a costly investigation? Can a royal commission tell us anything of which we are not already aware about the  root causes of unemployment? Honorable members opposite know the reason for the high price of petrol, but they do not wish to make use of their knowledge. The present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> and the Minister for Bepatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> for many years, supported the view that I have expressed regarding the futility of appointing commissions. Even if they have lost the genius that made the cause which they advocated triumphant in the past, what men Labour has exalted to power ! The people of Australia would prefer politicians less ambitious, even if obscure, who, as Lord Bryce said, would at least give their own age no reason to fear them or cause posterity to curse them. Commissions are merely a means adopted by governments to defer decisions on important subjects. </para>

                and I ruled that the notice of motion could be given. I have since had time to examine the motion, and now announce that I do not propose to allow it to appear on the notice-paper in its present form as a question of privilege, which would take precedence over other business to-morrow. That, however, will not preclude the honorable member for Barker from raising to-morrow a question of privilege, without notice, and moving a motion upon it. There is a standing order which guides me in this matter, but I do not think it is necessary to quote it.

I have no wish to bringabout the resignation of any honorable member; but, as the motion was placed on the notice-paper towards the endof the last Parliament, and deals with such an important matter, the opportunityshould be afforded to have it considered.. I maintain that no Attorney-General" should be permitted to take a brief fromany oil company or combine. </para>

                    <para>.- I have no motion on the notice-paper, and as the result of very long experience in this Parliament never place one there. Such motions appear on the notice-paper from month to month ; they are discussed for a few moments, and when Parliament is prorogued are wiped off. No attention is paid to them. I regard the practice as farcical. We should so amend the Standing Orders as to make it plain that private members have no rights in this chamber in regard to obtaining an expression of opinion on particular questions. These motions are in the nature of advertisements. They have never been treated seriously, and never will be. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not agree with the view put by the honorable member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini).</inline> I think that the opportunities enjoyed by private members are few and far between, and that they should be jealously guarded. M!y experience, which extends over many years, has taught mo that, as the session proceeds, the rights of private members are habitually clipped and shorn to the disappearing point. Without presuming to violate the Standing Orders by discussing the motion standing in the name of the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Maloney),</inline> I would venture to say in general terms that the character of that motion is such that I should have supposed that the head of the Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> and the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> would be most eager that the matter should be dealt with at the earliest possible moment, because it involves questions affecting the rights of members and in a certain sense privilege. That being so, I consider that the practice followed in the past should be adopted in this case. If I may do so as a matter of propriety - it is not for me to dictate terms - I suggest that the motion should be regarded as urgent and be dealt with at the earliest possible moment. I join with those who would ask the Prime Minister to see that an opportunity is given to discuss it before the House rises for the Christmas recess. </para>

                <para>I understand that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> has moved the adjournment of the House thus early so as to give honorable members an opportunity to discuss the notes exchanged between the Minister of State for Trade and Customs for the Commonwealth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> and the Consul-General for Belgium in Australia, which have resulted in what is virtually a trade treaty with the Government of Belgium. </para>
                <para>I very greatly regret that the importance of this matter did not impress upon the Government the advisability of submitting the treaty to Parliament for ratification before it was entered into. </para>
                <para>At the outset I wish to say that I appreciate the difficulties which confront a Minister in an endeavour to negotiate a trade treaty with any country, particularly if it be a foreign nation. The Minister for Trade and Customs has the distinction that he is the first Australian Minister to negotiate a trade treaty with a foreign country. This treaty marks the initial instalment of the quota system on the part of Australia. The quota system is the commencement of a new movement for the regulation of trade and industry, and I submit that it is more provocative to other countries than the tariff protectionist policy formerly pursued. In a perusal of this memorandum honorable members will find that Japan, which buys more wool from us than any other country and which has a glass factory turning out glass equal to that produced in any other country in the world, is to be shut out altogether, while Belgium is to be given the substantial quota of 2,000,000 square feet on the basis of requirements of 7,500,000 square feet. Other countries have to share a quota of 900,000 square feet. Japan to-day is sending window glass to New Zealand, and to other countries. I submit that the Government has blundered badly in not submitting the treaty to Parliament for ratification before it was entered into. I believe that all prospective trade treaties should be subject to parliamentary discussion and sanction before they are concluded. The Canadian-Australian trade agreement, entered into by the Scullin Government with the Government of the Dominion of Canada, was preceded by a lengthy discussion in this chamber, and finally the proposed treaty was ratified. There was a special clause inserted in that agreement - clause 9 - which reads as follows :  - (1.) If at any time - </para>

(2.) Upon the withdrawal of any notice given in pursuance of the last preceding subsection, goods of the kind specified in the notice shall, when imported from the Dominion of Canada after a time and date to be fixed by Proclamation, again become subject to the tariff which would have been applicable to them if the notice had not been given. </para>

                <para>Parliament has not been asked to ratify this far-reaching treaty. It has been entered into by the Government, and the only opportunity afforded honorable members to discuss it is the limited one of debating it on a motion for the adjournment of the House; with no opportunity to cast a vote upon the merits or demerits of the treaty. It is a distinct breach of the definite election pledge made by the Prime Minister. </para>
                <para>It is of paramount importance that the secondary and primary industries of this country should not be imperilled as a result of a trade treaty entered into behind the back of Parliament. In October of last year the Tariff Board made a searching investigation into the glass industry. I ask the Minister now if he has a copy of that report, and why he has not made it available to honorable members ? As a matter of fact it was the fourth investigation into glass since that made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pratten</inline> as Minister for Trade and Customs in 1925, when the deferred duty was recommended. That duty was further deferred from time to time, and it was that duty which the Scullin Government put into operation. It remained for the present Government to offend Belgium by bringing about total prohibition. First it wiped out the deferred duty made operative by the Scullin Government, and then when importers had 3,000,000 square feet of glass on the water, it came down with a total prohibition. That was in September, 1932. This prohibition now stands, but under it imports are to be rationed. </para>

                <para>Mr.FORDE. - Yes. The Government bungled in first taking the duty off, and then allowing the importers to order 3,000,000 square feet, only to find the Government putting a prohibition on and declaring that the 3,000,000 square feet should be rationed. Prior to the Scullin Government imposing the deferred duty in June, 1930, eighteen months' supplies were imported by importing agents, so as to make the starting of the Australian factory impossible. When it was known that the industry was to be started in Australia, 19,200,000 square feet was imported in 1929-30 as against 10,200,000 square feet in 1928-29. These large importations were brought in so that they would be in hand in Australian warehouses and there would be no demand for the' product of the Australian factory. The duty was taken off by the then Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Henry Gullett)</inline> on the 1st September, 1932, and replaced by a revenue duty of 2s. and 4s. It was, however, readily seen that the Australian industry would be imperilled. The case put up by the managing director of the Australian company was irresistible, and a total prohibition was subsequently imposed and has remained in force for two years. I want to know what is the nature of the last Tariff Board report, and if that report is available. When the present Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline></para>
                <para class="block">White) was in opposition he was always very loud in his clamour for the latest Tariff Board report. He always asked why was not the last Tariff Board report made available to honorable members. He said "Has the Minister something to hide, or has he got the report in his bag?" I ask him now to be good enough to make available to honorable members the last report of the Tariff Board on glass. The Tariff Board held its inquiry in October and November of last year and after over twelve months has elapsed surely honorable members have a right to know the board's recommendations. The reports that we have been able to obtain are dated 1925, 1932, and the 26th January, 1933, and in each case they were based on inquiries made six months previously. Surely the Minister will be good enough to distribute copies of this report before the Houseis asked to vote on this motion for the adjournment. If he does so, it willenable honorable members to study the report. I submit it is quite a reasonable request. The Tariff Board must have come to the conclusion that the Australian industry is an efficient one and that the price and quality of its product are quite satisfactory. Can there be something in the recommendations that the Minister does not wish us to see? I submit that this departure in tariffmaking is fraught with grave danger to the great industries of Australia. In this instance it happens to be a secondary industry; to-morrow it may be a great primary industry whose fate is at stake. Honorable members on both sides of the </para>
                <para>House are vitally concerned in this matter. If the Minister pursues this policy the protection policy of Australia may be bartered away overnight, without giving honorable members or the people generally an opportunity to prevent it. </para>

                        <para>- The Tariff Board must have submitted the report because investigations were carried out twelve months ago. I know it is easy for the Government to say that until the Government has taken some action upon an industry pursuant to a Tariff Board report, it is unusual to make the recommendations of the Board available. But the Minister has taken very definite action upon this report, for he proposes to submit this industry to the imposition of a quota, and he is to restrict Australian production. He is to say to the Belgians: "You may exploit this market to the extent of 2,000,000 square feet," and to the other countries: "You may have 900,000 square feet." But to the Australian manufacturers a market for only 60 per cent, or 4,500,000 square feet is to be available. We must admit that the action taken by the Government must lead the overseas countries one by one to threaten to prohibit the importation of goods from Australia. When the Government gives way to one country what logical argument can it put forward to refuse to give way to another? At the present time, Italy, Japan, Prance, Germany, China, and other countries are making representations to the Government and the outcome will be that, if it gives way, a substantial increase of unemployment in Australia must inevitably result. The protection policy of Australia is interwoven with its future prosperity. This is even admitted by men like Professor Copland, who cannot be looked upon as a high protectionist.

The Minister, in a statement which he made on this subject on the 19 th November, said - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>I announce the successful conclusion of a provisional agreement with the Belgian Government, whereunder that Government, in return for permission to import into Australia a limited quantity of Belgian window glass annually, has agreed first to remove all restrictions on the importation into Belgium of Australian frozen meat, and, secondly, to withdraw the threatened embargo against the importation of Australian cereals. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>I must congratulate the Belgian Government on the success which has attended its efforts to obtain a substantial percentage of the Australian market for its window glass manufacturers, but the Minister is deserving of censure for jeopardizing the future of a great secondary industry. The Australian window glass manufacturing industry has been made vulnerable to the attacks of window glass manufacturers in countries where  wages  and labour conditions are much inferior to those of Australia. It must be noted that the Belgian Government has given no guarantee whatever that it will purchase any Australian meat. All that it has said is that no restriction will be placed upon Australian meat entering Belgium, and that the duty on Australian meat will not be higher than that applicable to the meat imported from any other country. </para>
                <para>The Minister informed .us that on an Australian annual consumption of 7,500,000 square feet of window glass, which was the consumption when the negotiations with Belgium began, the Australian manufacturers will hereafter have 60 per cent., those of the United Kingdom 10 per cent., those of Belgium 28.7  per  cent., and those of other countries 1.3 per cent. On any Australian annual consumption in excess of 7,500,000 square feet, the Australian manufacturers will have 50 per cent., those of the United Kingdom 12.5 per cent., those of Belgium 35.8725 per cent., and those of other countries 1.6275 per cent. Is it fair play to this great Australian industry that it should be denied the advantage of an increased Australian market to this extent? It is entirely unjust! This policy must inevitably retard the development of this industry and militate against increased employment in it. The Australian window glass manufacturers have spent £300,000 in installing a plant to operate the  Forcault  system of manufacture, which they consider to be the best in the world for making window glass; their factory has a capacity of 12,000,000 square feet per annum, and for the last eighteen months they have supplied the whole of Australia's requirements, giving employment to 406 persons. That number is, of course, in addition to more than 3,000 persons employed by the glass manufacturing industry throughout Australia. The window glass manufacturing company has lately been producing at the rate of 9,000,000 square feet per annum. This has supplied all our requirements and made possible the building up of reserve stocks. The restriction of the sales of the company to about 5,000,000 square feet per annum must inevitably have the effect of adding to its overhead1 costs. If the volume of production is reduced in this way, the price of window glass must inevitably be increased. If this happens, there will be an outcry from the public. The importing interests are hoping that they have the thin edge of the wedge and that they can capture the whole Australian market. </para>
                <para>I cannot agree with the statement of the Minister that the existing and proposed prohibitions of Australian imports by Belgium were brought about by the force of public opinion in that country. There was no outcry from the Belgian Government when the Scullin Government imposed the deferred duties, nor was there a protest in 1925-26 when the deferred duties were first provided for by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pratten.</inline> The only outcry has come from the importing agents in Australia who have been' very active. The effect of the policy that has hitherto been pursued has been that the price of window glass has fallen, as the following table will show: - </para>

            <para class="block">It will be seen that the price of glass has fallen from a maximum of 8$d. per square  foot  for 0/70 united inches, 16 oz., to 5$d. and from lid. for 0/70 united  inches,  21 oz., to 7d. The increases shown on  the  23rd July, 1930, and the 31st January, 1933, were caused by the glass distributors and not the Australian glass manufacturers. As soon as the local glass manufacturers succeeded in effectively organizing their industry the price fell. </para>
            <para>I wish now to deal briefly with the great importance of large secondary industries to Australia. Most honorable gentlemen realize that the home market is the best that our primary producers can have. The following figures, made available by the Commonwealth Statistician, show the percentages of certain important Australian primary products exported and consumed locally: - </para>
            <para class="block">
                <graphic href="145331193411283_33_4.jpg" />
            </para>
            <para>Those figures indicate the great importance of the local market to the Australian primary producers. If the local market is fostered and developed by the establishment of great secondary industries, those engaged in primary production must reap real advantages; but, if the policy that has resulted in the giving away of a large percentage of our window glass market to manufacturers in foreign countries is applied to other secondary industries, how can the primary producers expect to build up a larger market locally for their products? The granting of this concession by the Government to manufacturers in a foreign country strikes a blow at employment in a great secondary industry of this country. </para>
            <para> I suppose that the Government is not likely to revoke its decision in this connexion. The agreement will doubtless continue in force for twelve months. But in order that the severity of the blow may be lessened I hope that favorable consideration will be given by the Government to the suggestion made this afternoon by the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nairn)</inline> that the glass imported from Belgium shall be distributed in Western Australia and South Australia chiefly. Probably some of it could be sent to ports in Northern Queensland. The freights on glass from Belgium to Australia are the same, irrespective of the port of landing in this country, whereas the freight charges on glass delivered by the Australian manufacturers is much greater for some ports than for others. The freight from Sydney to Western Australia is practically the same as that from Belgium to Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I have no desire to do the honorable member an injustice; but he was then Minister for Trade and Customs. At any rate the prohibition was imposed by the Lyons Administration. I submit that the manner in which this agreement has been made is fraught with great danger. It is the thin end of a'1' wedge that may be used to destroy our protective tariff. What answer will the Government give to the glass manufacturers of Japan, Germany, France and Italy when they ask for consideration? One weak decision encourages other countries to make threats. I shall not comment on the insult that has been offered to the /tass manufacturers of Great Britain by allowing them only 12 per cent, of any increased trade that Australia may have in glass as against 50 per cent, to Belgium. </para>

                    <para>.- Those who have listened to previous speeches on this subject by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> and have heard his speech this evening must have found it humorous indeed. I marvel at the  easy  manner in which the honorable member is able to change his opinions. He said something about the failure of the Government to table the latest report of the Tariff Board on this subject. How many reports of the Tariff Board were suppressed while the Scullin Government was in office ? </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>My earnest desire is that the Customs Act should be amended so as to make the tabling of reports compulsory. In the old days the Tariff Board was a sort of star chamber, which sat in private, but we got that altered, and now evidence must be taken in public. The reports of the Tariff Board do not belong to the government of the day. They belong to Parliament, and the act should provide that, within a reasonable time after their being presented to the Government, they should be tabled. As regards the importation of glass, it would seem that some one must have had inside information, because one firm was able to buy up practically all the available supplies of sheet glass prior to the imposition of the embargo. The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> said that the demand for glass was improving, and would increase still more because of the boom in the building trade consequent upon the return of prosperity. The other day, however, he was telling us that there was no return to prosperity, and that the country was still in the depths of the depression. The Labour party now objects to government control, but when that party was in office it, was the greatest offender in this regard. </para>
                <para>This agreement is based on an embargo on the importation of glass. I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to the following amendment of the Customs A.ct which was made last year : - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>Where, prior to the commencement of this section, the importation or exportation of any goode has been prohibited by proclamation, and the proclamation is in force immediately prior to such commencement, any such proclamation may be re-enacted, cancelled or varied by regulation, and until cancellation shall remain in force according to the terms in which it was issued, and, if varied, shall have effect according to its terms as so varied. Any such proclamation not re-enacted by regulation within six months after the commencement of this section shall cease to have effect. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">If the embargo on glass is to continue, it will have to be renewed in the near future by regulation, and the regulation can be declared void by Parliament. We are very glad that we were able to have that amendment inserted. In. the past the government of the day was able to prohibit the importation of goods by proclamation, and Parliament had no redress. It is doubtful whether, if the law had ever been tested, the Government really did have this power, because I believe it was meant to apply only to the prohibition of goods which might be deleterious to the health and morals of the people. It was never intended that the Government should be able to impose a general prohibition. We intend to use all the influence we possess, both inside and outside Parliament, to make it impossible for governments to continue to exercise this arbitrary power. </para>
                <para>I am afraid that this agreement will create a harmful precedent, particularly in regard to our trade with other countries. I should strongly oppose it altogether were it not for the fact that we are to get some little benefit for the time being. I do not agree with the principle, however, of permitting the Government to enter into trade agreements with other countries without first securing the approval of Parliament. I have no doubt that, in this instance, a majority of honorable members would have approved of the agreement; but it would have been better if they had been given the opportunity to do so. I strongly urge that the Government should by motion obtain the approval of Parliament to the agreement. The practice we are now following is too dangerous. The effect of the agreement will be to create a demand from other countries for favorable treatment, also. It seems to me that the Government's policy in this regard is dictated by opportunism, and that it has evinced reluctance to grapple with the problem effectively. </para>

                    <para>.- This agreement will have a far-reaching and harmful effect on our international relations. Owing to the development of economic nationalism most countries are now giving marked attention to trade treaties and quotas. In the past, governments generally relied on tariffs to regulate international trade; but it seems that in the future tariffs will play a minor part compared with treaties and quotas. The new method will create difficulties, and will lead to retaliation, misunderstanding and loss. I agree with the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> that the pursuit of this new policy will seriously affect the economic life of the community. A protective tariff imposed by any country is apt to be criticized by those overseas manufacturers who desire a free market for their produce, but if a tariff does not discriminate between countries there is little danger of retaliation. An agreement of this kind, however, by its very nature invites retaliation.

In this trade treaty between Belgium and Australia the quota system has been introduced, and this will affect our relations with all other countries with which we trade. It will be the forerunner of many other treaties or' agreements that will seriously affect the secondary industries of Australia. In the present agreement, meat, grain, and glass figure prominently. The manufacturers of glass in Australia have, according to the Minister, been protected at the expense of the producers of meat and barley. </para>

                <para>Let us briefly review the history of the events that led up to the imposition of an embargo on the importation of glass. In the first place, the embargo applies only to plain sheet or window glass. It does not extend to plate glass or figured glass, nor to glass used for household purposes or for lighting. Several years ago the Belgians developed what is known as the Fourcault process for the manufacture of sheet glass. An Australian company bought the rights for the Commonwealth, and afterwards had to buy the necessary machinery from the Belgian manufacturer. There was only one firm in Belgium which could supply the machinery, and it did so under license from the holders of the patent rights. The supplyingof that machinery provided employment for Belgian workers, and profits for Belgian manufacturers. The machines, when they were brought to Aus- , tralia, were capable of producing all the sheet glass needed in this country. By selling the rights to an Australian company, and by supplying the necessary machinery, Belgium recognized the right of Australia to produce its own sheet glass, and Belgian interests accepted our Australian money for those rights and for that machinery. Now Belgium desires to go back on her bargain and, after having sold us the right to make our own glass, wants to compel us to continue buying our glass from her. </para>

                        <para>- It is true. Belgium threatens that, if we do not agree to its proposal, it will place an embargo upon Australian meat, wheat, and barley. Similar pressure was exercised prior to the greatest turmoil in the world's history. Belgium, which asked Australia to come to its aid in a war in which millions of men were slaughtered, now desires to break an agreement made by it with this country. I have before me the following statement signed by the 300 workmen employed in the window glass industry in Australia :  - </para>

                <para>In 1925, the Bruce-Page Coalition Government, with the full facts before it, as the result of a Tariff Board inquiry, granted, protection to the Australian sheet glass industry, and that action brought forth no opposition from Belgium. If the tariff had not been tinkered with, there would not have been any trouble; but people who knew nothing about the business - importers who were thinking only of their own profits - induced the Government to remove the protection. The representatives of overseas manufacturers immediately booked up orders for large supplies of glass. The Government could not fail to realize that it had made a mistake which threatened to ruin the Australian glass industry, and throw hundreds out of work on the streets and on the -dole. The embargo on importations followed, and from then on there has been trouble with Belgium. <inline font-style="italic">[Leave to continue given."]</inline> Now we have this agreement on the quota basis. Is Belgium entitled to it? If this agreement is ratified by this House, will not the granting of it be a breach of the much placarded Ottawa agreement, and an offence to Australia's larger customer, Japan ? Such a differentiation between two countries is bound to create ill will. If, on the other hand, the protective duty originally provided were allowed to stand, there could be no opposition from any quarter. . </para>
                <para>The Australian manufacturers never asked for prohibition, nor have they sought the quota system. The fiscal policy of Australia ought not to be the subject of piecemeal treaties and quotas. " Hats and macaroni for wool ", " barley and meat for glass ", " dolls and toys for scrap iron" savour of the ridiculous. Where will it end? Discrimination between overseas countries and between local industries means offence to overseas countries, injury to local industries, and starvation for the employees. If Belgium can force this Government to sacrifice the Australian glass industry, what is to prevent Italy, Germany, and Japan each selecting its own pet line, forcing goods upon us, and demanding that the Government should enter into similar treaties ? </para>
                <para>It is usually stated that the Australian glass company is a monopoly; that is true, but what is the alternative? There is only one, and that is to buy from a monopoly overseas. Pilkington's now absolutely controls the whole sheet and plate glass industry of Great Britain. The Fourcault sheet glass factories in Belgium are a monopoly, and the Belgian glass monopoly is controlled by Libby Owens, of the United States of America.

There is not one word in the agreement that guarantees acceptance of Australian primary products; the only statement is that Belgium will agree to waive all restrictions into Belgium of Australian meat preserved by a cold process, and not to enforce the embargo on Australian wheat and barley. </para>

                <para>Australia is a young eountry, a paradise in the making, abounding with all the gifts of nature; yet we have arrived at the sorry position in which we have to ask our own people to close down their industries, and dismiss their employees, in order that some other country may send in the goods it desiresto manufacture to keep its factories open and its employees working. What an anomaly ! Let Australia give a lead and declare that it will  not  be entangled in quotas  or  treaties which are the breeding ground of wars and rumours of wars. By adopting this agreement as the easiest way out of a seemingly difficult position, we are definitely pledging ourselves to be involved in the present mad policy, in a mad world, of  Bowing  the seed of international discord. The repercussions of this insignificant agreement  will  have a detrimental effect upon Australia. Those who believe that they are gaining something by it will be the first to rebel against that into which they will later be led. They will find when cotton, bananas, and other commodities are affected, that they have agreed to a dangerous precedent, which has not only destroyed secondary industries, but also had repercussions on primary industries. The honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> has expressed disagreement with the policy  of  entering into trade treaties before their ratification by Parliament. Both externally and internally this agreement will have a devastating effect. I hope that the House will consider the points that have been put forward by the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde),</inline> as well as the suggestion of the honorable member for Swan. I am not criticizing the Government, because I realize that it is in a very difficult position. The whole world is faced with the same difficulty. In agreeing to quotas, however, we are undoubtedly planting the seed which leads to war. All wars are the result of trade agreements, because one country tries to get the better of another. Our policy should be to build up our internal economy, and so improve the conditions of both the primary and secondary worker in this country. In the interests of the people of Australia as a whole, I appeal to the House to repudiate the action of the Minister for Trade and Customs. </para>

I suppose that no man is equally responsible with him for having caused dislocation of trade in Australia without having consulted Parliament in any way. He has been instrumental in bringing down hundreds of violent increases of duty, which have made the Australian tariff the highest in the world, and in imposing innumerable embargoes. The glass embargo was imposed without the authority of Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- It was, in fact, imposed without the authority of Parliament. For over two years the honorable member and his party prevented Parliament from having a voice in tariff matters. Therefore, it is ridiculous and unjust of him to complain that this agreement has been made by the Government without having first obtained the authority of Parliament. </para>

                <para>The selfishness of the Opposition is difficult to understand. Australia is a considerable gainer in its trade with Belgium. This small agreement proposes to restore to Belgium an opportunity to trade with Australia in glass to an amount of something less than  £20,000  a year. For the last five years our export trade to Belgium has averaged  £5,250,000,  while our purchases from that country have amounted to only about  £750,000;  consequently, we have had an advantage in round figures of  £4,400,000  annually. Wherein, then, lies the justice of the complaint against this small restoration to Belgium, one of our best trade friends? Upon three items alone the result of this agreement will be to restore to Australia trade to the value of over  £500,000  a year. Those are the primary items, barley, meat and wheat. It is true that there was no formal exclusion of barley from the Belgian market.Thethreat of exclusion, however, destroyed the Australian trade in that commodity. There was complete exclusion of meat by the Belgian Government, and that particularly affected the State of "Western Australia. The meat industry is established at "Wyndham, and handles the cattle of the Kimberleys and the western portion of the Northern Territory. The Belgian market was particularly valuable to the meat producers of those areas. A big trade, amounting lo about £80,000 a year, was worked up before an embargo was imposed upon the importation of Belgian glass into Australia. The result of the embargo was the withdrawal of that trade. .During the last financial year we were able to send to Belgium only £10.000 worth of our meat, and even that small trade would be completely lost but for the negotiation of this agreement.  For  some years Western Australia has been selling to Belgium roughly two-thirds of the meat output of Wyndham. Last year, however, it could sell only one-tenth, the remaining nine-tenths being thrown on the already glutted British market. To those who speak about Australian industries, I would say: Compare the position of the producers on the eastern coast of Australia with that of those who are engaged in the cattle industry in the Northern Territory. This year the industry has been so depressed that the average gross return to the growers in the Northern Territory and the Kimberleys has been only £2 17s. a beast. The beef producers in those areas work under terrible tropical conditions for a starvation return. They pioneered the industry, and at one time it was valuable to them. When we talk of settling the open spaces of the North, let us try to appreciate the grave injustice that is done by embargoes or duties to those who are doing their best for Australia under conditions which are immeasurably worse than those experienced on the eastern coast. </para>
                <para>There have been days of futile discussion on the subject of unemployment T use the term " futile " because not a single scheme of value has emerged. Had this agreement not been made, about 400 or 500 men in that one comparatively small industry would have been thrown on1 the unemployed market. Compare that with the wages earned by the men in the glass industry who produce £20,000 worth  of  that commodity in a year. I cannot understand honorable members being  so  cruelly inconsiderate towards those who are producing in the back country  of  Australia. It must be obvious to them that these embargoes produce retaliation, which is destroying one after another the  primary industries. I hope that honorable members will consider the effect  of  their extreme protection policy, and try to remember that if we are to hope for something like a restoration  of  employment we must first give primary industries a fair opportunity to live. </para>

                    <para>. - I  am very much afraid that the expectations of the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> "with respect to this trade agreement will not be fulfilled.  I  am inclined to think that many of us are disposed to blame particular tariff measures for what is a world position.  I  recognize, probably as well as any honorable member, the importance of our trade with Belgium, and, indeed, with all countries. Particularly do I feel that Western Australia must preserve friendly relations with Belgium especially, and with die world in general. When I look at the facts, however, I discover that there is a very great similarity between the contraction of the trade done by Western Australia with Belgium during the last five years, and the decline of the trade done by the United Kingdom with that country in the same period. I think it will be admitted that the United Kingdom has not imposed any very special disabilities upon trade with Belgium. In 1929 the value of the imports from Belgium to the United Kingdom amounted to £44,000,000, while in 1933 it was £12,900,000 - an enormous reduction which, of course, is evidence of the great slump that has occurred in world trade. The value of the exports to Belgium from the United Kingdom was nearly £19,500,000 in 1929, while in 1933 it was £8,800,000. It is therefore clear from an example taken from outside Australia that there has been an enormous shrinkage of the turnover in respect  of  both exports and imports. </para>

                        <para>- It does not matter what they are; the figures are comparable, because the character of the commodities which have flowed from country to country has not profoundly changed during the period of the depression. What has happened is that the volume of commodities of the same character which have been exchanged has greatly lessened. Western Australia has done a considerable volume of trade with Belgium, to the advantage of that State. In the last five years it imported from Belgium goods to the value, in English currency, of about £150,000. If we add 25 per cent. to make the figures comparable, we find that in Australian currency our imports have been valued at about £187,000. In the same period our exports to Belgium have been valued at £1,707,000. In the first year of the five-year period our imports, expressed in sterling, were valued at £50,000, and in the last year they had shrunk in value to £20,000. Our exports in the first year of the five year period were valued at £566,000 in Australian currency, and in the last year, £245,000. It is therefore clear that our exports to Belgium shrunk by a little more than one-half in value, and that the imports to Western Australia from that country have also shrunk by a little more than one-half. In 1932-33, the year before Western Australian meat was shut out from Belgium, the exports of Western Australian frozen beef to the United Kingdom were valued at £94,000, and those to Belgium at £43,000. There was a little trade with the East Indies, valued at £199. Our main trade was with the United Kingdom and Belgium. We sold twice as much to the United Kingdom as to Belgium. The Minister now proposes a trade agreement with Belgium which gives to Belgian glass manufacturers a much greater advantage in the Australian market than is given to the United Kingdom. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know that the manufacturers in the United Kingdom ought to be. I am in favour of trade agreements. I believe they are a necessary way of escape from some of the entanglements of the present situation; but the agreement which has been made, apart from objections which have been raised against it on the score that no opportunity has been extended to this Parliament to discuss it, contains an essential weakness, in that it gives exclusive access to Belgium in the Australian market, while it gives to Australia only the same rights of access to the Belgian market as are enjoyed by the world at large. Further, the agreement perpetuates the exclusion from the Australian glass market of countries other than Belgium. I refer to countries with which we have developed and maintained trade, and which probably will see in this agreement with Belgium a means which they shall endeavour to emulate in order to make special agreements with Australia to secure monopoly rights so far as imports to Australia are concerned as against the world at large. There is, indeed, a very grave danger in such a policy. I find that countries which manufacture glass are as follows: - Great Britain, Belgium, Italy, United States of America, France, Germany, Czechoslovakia, Finland, Russia, Japan, China and Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I decline to accept the dictum that the pre-war dimensions of a country's export trade axe any criterion at all of its economic necessities. Something makes all previous comparisons entirely meaningless. Apart from questions of currency, which enter into this matter so importantly, there are other difficulties, in that countries have to find some way to dispose of their surplus production. And if it should happen to be glass in Germany, the United States of America, or Japan, what are we to say to those countries which are large buyers of our primary products, when they submit to this country an alternative similar to that which has been submitted by Belgium? Obviously, while trade agreements are essential it is impossible for us to look at the trade of a country in its relationship to one specific commodity. We get from Belgium no different treatment from that enjoyed by countries against which our general tariff embargoes still operate. I  feel moat decisively that this agreement has been very hurriedly made without adequate consideration in a haphazard attempt to rectify blunders which the Government has made in the last three years in respect to the glass industry, because it is quite clear that no embargo was imposed against Australian meat until we placed an embargo on the importation of Belgian glass. The policy in operation hitherto in this Parliament was to treat all foreign countries upon an entirely identical basis, and no country had any trade grievance against Australia until the present Government imposed an embargo against the importation of Belgian glass. Now the Government lifts the embargo against glass, but perpetuates the embargo against every other country that seeks to trade with Australia in glass, even after paying the deferred duty. </para>

                        <para>- Then we get nothing in the way of a scientific adjustment of our trade relations. The honorable gentleman is buying into a policy which has many provocations involved in it, a policy the advantages of which may be far outweighed by its repercussions in other countries. I submit that generally the question of Australia's trade should no longer be dealt with in this piecemeal fashion. I have very strong objections towards the piecemeal application of tariff duties to certain commodities. Such a policy is not wise. Any policy which is put into operation haying for its object the betterment of people situated in one part of Australia to the detriment of those living in another part is unsound. We must look at the question in the interests of this country as a whole, regarding Australia as a unit with which we shall bargain with the world as a whole, giving preference to countries within the British Empire. We can thus build up our trade relations with the world generally. But if we make the mis-, take of singling out different countries outside of the British Empire and giving them rights denied to others, and advantages not shared with the United Kingdom, all hopes of preferential trade within the Empire must disappear. Furthermore, all hopes of reasonable appreciation of our position by foreign countries would seem to be greatly diminishing. I regret the procedure the Minister has devised. It would have been far better for Parliament to have had a proper discussion of this treaty. The Minister could then have given effect to such a policy in connexion with  thiB  agreement as would fit in with the view which this Parliament holds of Australia's trade position. </para>

                    <para>.- Honorable members on the other side of the House have criticized this agreement from roughly three points of view. Some have said that it unjustifiably sacrifices the interests of an Australian industry. One thing, I think, clearly proves  that that at any rate is not true. I have here a copy of the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline> in which the shares of the Australian Glass Company are quoted. One pound shares to-day are quoted as, buyer 61s. 9d. ; seller, 62s. Before the particulars of the trade agreement were published, the shares of this company were quoted at only a few pence below that figure. The bulk of its assets are represented by other types of glass. But the fact that the shares have not depreciated, I think, quite definitely disproves any allegation that an Australian industry has been sacrificed. In that fact also lies the answer to the second criticism put forward by honorable members, " that, whereas this agreement permits Belgium a certain entry into the Australian market for something over 2,000,000 square feet of glass, it does not guarantee entry for any particular quantity of Australian product into the Belgian market ". The fact that Belgium receives a quota with a definite limit in itself assures to the Australian industry the major part of the Australian market, and assures it in a rigid and absolutely unshakable way. It is that security which has maintained the value of the company's shares and the prospects of the men in the factory retaining their employment - and those prospects are far from poor. In the very nature of things, by the very fact that the Belgians are guaranteed entry for the limited quantity of 2,000,000 odd feet of their window glass, on which a tariff duty of 2s. per 100 square feet must be paid, there is an assurance of restriction of imports. The mere fact that even in the palmy days, when the Belgian glassmakers had the bulk of the Australian trade, Belgium was buying from us goods worth ten times the value of the goods that we were buying from Belgium, makes it quite evident that the interests of Australia have been very fully safeguarded. The concessions now made in respect of the unrestricted entry of our goods into Belgium are of immense value to our primary industries. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The third criticism offered of this agreement must, of course, have been considered by the members of the Government before the agreement was made. It has been said that the very fact that we have parleyed with another country in order to attempt to regain markets that had been lost, is an invitation to other countries to insist that we parley with them. World conditions, as truly described by the honorable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin),</inline> are such to-day that only by parley with countries with which we wish to trade and which wish to trade with us, can we hope to increase our overseas markets and improve the prospects of our exporters. It is on the oasis of treaties and agreements with other countries that we must build our hopes for world recovery. This agreement will undoubtedly reduce the market available for the Australian manufacturers of window glass, but it will also undoubtedly increase the market for other Australian manufactured goods, for it will help to restore the value of some of our primary exports. By doing that, it will increase the general purchasing power of the people of Australia, and a large proportion of that increase will undoubtedly be expended on manufactured goods. </para>
                <para>The honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> says, by interjection, that we have no guarantee that Belgium will purchase our goods. I admit that no figure is specified in the agreement; but it is to be presumed, surely, that if Australian goods are allowed unrestricted entry into Belgium our primary producers will be able to place in that country the proportion of their products that they were able to place there before any restrictions were imposed. The Australian primary producing industries mainly concerned in this agreement are the meat industry of North- West Australia and the barley industry of several States, but principally of South Australia. This brings me to the point which I consider to be most vital. The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> said that we should do everything in our power to build up the home market for our primary industries, because this was the most valuable market. From the point of view of the Eastern States, that may be so; but no increase of the purchasing power of the factory workers of Sydney could compensate the cattle-raisers of North- West Australia for the loss of their market overseas. So long as the Navigation Act remains in force, it will be out of the question for beef to he sent from Wyndham to the Sydney market except at prices even more ruinously low tuan those to which the cattle-raisers have had to re-adjust their conditions in the last few years. We have a continent to settle, and we should endeavour to settle every pan of ii that is reasonably fertile. A good deal of North Australia is poor, but much of the North-West Australia, and the Kimberley, in Western Australia, contains large areas of good cattle country. As the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nairn)</inline> has pointed out. the value of those districts has been reduced by the loss of the Belgian market for our meat. The effect has been that the gross value of cattle per head has been reduced from £3 15s. to £2 17s. It must be remembered that cattle raising is in that part of the country the sole industry. About 300 workers have been affected in the window  glass  industry by the making of this agreement. Some of these are storemen and packers who should be able to obtain employment in certain other directions. The census returns of last year show that in the Wyndham and Hall's Creek districts of North-West Australia there are 744 persons who are practically altogether dependent upon the cai tic industry. An additional number in the adjacent areas of the Northern Territory are also dependent upon this industry. As to the barley producers, I point out that only those of South Australia export barley, but the value of the barley produced in Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland is based upon the return obtained for the barley exported by the South Australian producers, plus the value of the freight from South Australia to Melbourne or Sydney. The quantity of barley grown in Australia is greater than the quantity consumed here. The type of barley that we grow is suited  for  making malt for beer agreeable to the continental palate, but, unfortunately, it is not for some reason agreeable to the English palate. Efforts to change the type of harley grown in Australia have not been very successful. In the Yorketown, Minlaton, and Warooka districts of South Australia, where barley-growing is the principal in- dustry, there is a population of 5,500 people. These are not solely dependent upon barley-growing, for a certain amount of stock-raising, wheat-growing, and salt-scraping is also done ; but barleygrowing is the leading industry.  In the  districts of Yorke Peninsula, around Maitland, where barley accounts for  practically  half  the  agricultural activities  of  the community, and in the Millicent  district,  there are 6,700 people; and around Clinton there are 1,530 people dependent, to a considerable extent, on barley production. This makes, in all, more -than 13,700 people whose prosperity depends, to a  large  extent, upon the price that they can obtain overseas for the barley  that  they export. The value that the employment of a few extra workers  in  the  window  glass manufacturing industry  may  be to a few primary producers who market their garden products  in  'Sydney, and  to  a few tobacco-growers, could not possibly be regarded as a compensation for  the  loss of the overseas barley market to  the  thousands of people to whom  I have  referred. Honorable members are cruelly narrow if they consider that the extension of the- industries of two or three of  our  great cities will enable us to obtain greater security for the great bulk  of our  people, and to maintain Australian standards for the white race in this country. I do not pretend to make any scientific assessment, but  I  submit  that every  settler that we can maintain  in  NorthWest Australia is a definite defence  of  British  and  white standards for everybody elsewhere in Australia. </para>
                <para>It has been said that certain dangers will arise through the adoption  of the  quota system. Everybody realizes  that  those dangers exist, but the only  basis  upon which trade can be allocated so  that  people can see what the real effect will be, is the quota basis. This advantage must be weighed against any disadvantages of the system. If the difficulties of the window glass manufacturing industry had been adjusted by a lowering  of  the customs duty on window glass,  tha  Australian industry might have been completely annihilated, and even then  Belgium  might not have obtained our trade. It might have gone to some other country. Certainly, it would not have been possible for us- to accord Great Britain a larger share of any increased trade that might  have developed. Admittedly, trading by quotas is an innovation.. It is not an Australian innovation; it has been forced upon us by world conditions to-day, and is something that I fear we must face whether we like it or not. I commend the Government for having made a good bargain, and for having done something that will make it possible to maintain our White Australia and good Australian standards of living. I consider that this agreement will have the effect of increasing instead of diminishing the purchasing power of our people. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to comment, briefly, on the debate that has taken place this evening. The honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hawker)</inline> has summed up the situation in such a way as to suggest to me that the whole question is one in which the struggle is now developing between various primary and secondary interests in this country. We shall have to wait to find out which will finally predominate and survive. The honorable member, of course, looked at the subject from the point of view of his own State. He was anxious that certain markets should be. provided for Australian meat and barley in. Belgium. On the other hand, it has also been contended by certain other honorable gentlemen in industrial electorates that we must do our utmost to retain and  develop the secondary industries of this country for the purpose of providing as much employment as possible for our people, and of increasing their purchasing power. It will be seen from, this statement of the case that there is undoubtedly a clash of interests in our own country. The honorable member for Wakefield quoted certain figures relating to the production of harley;, but I point out to him that we have no guarantee whatever that Belgium will purchase that quantity of barley from us. The agreement merely provides that the Belgian Government will remove certain embargoes that have been placed upon Australian meat importations into Belgium, and will, not restrict the importation of Australian barley. If the Australian producers are able to place these products on the Belgian market at competitive prices, the people of Belgium will probably buy them; but if other countries are able to market their products at a lower figure, we have no  reason  to believe that the Belgian  Government  will be very disturbed about it "or will feel any obligation to buy from us. We have to remember that other countries are producing barley under conditions  which  would not be tolerated in Australia. It may happen, therefore, that after all, the people of Australia will be required by the imposition of taxation to subsidize the barley-growers in some way, because even with this agreement they may not be able to market their products in Belgium in competition with other countries. Whether we pay the taxes directly or indirectly does not matter, because the subsidies must be made up somehow. In any case, it is problematical whether the benefits claimed for agreements of this kind will ever eventuate. When the Ottawa agreement, was entered into w&lt;were told that all sorts of benefits were to follow. Britain was to take more of our wheat and meat, but only a very short time had elapsed when Britain was seeking to cut down our quotas, particularly in regard to meat. Now the latest information is that the wheat quota is also to be reduced. So the struggle goes on between the conflicting interests of one country and another, and between the various conflicting interests within each country. It is evident that agreements of this kind do not touch the root of the trouble. What is really required is to increase the general demand for our produce. Even in our own country the market could be developed. A great many families in Australia to-day, for instance, could do with more meat if they could afford it. and the same thing applies to families overseas. Honorable members must recognize that there is something fundamentally wrong with things as they are. and that the matter cannot be corrected by any system of bargaining such as is represented by this agreement. The present agreement definitely injures one section of the community on the pretence that it will confer a benefit upon another section. The Australian glass industry is directly affected, and no one can. deny that that industry will, as the result, be able to offer less employment than before. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The honorable member for Wakefield said that the displaced workers might be able to secure employment in other avenues, probably on the waterfront handling the increased volume of imports. That is poor consolation for those who will be thrown out of work, as any one must realize who visits the waterfront and sees how many men are there at the present time unable to find anything like regular employment. </para>

                        <para>- There is not even proof that any extra employment will be provided there. Other similar attempts to stimulate our export trade have failed. Every recent move seems to be in the direction of restricting output. The activities of the primary industries are being curtailed in every direction instead of being extended. Those who argue in favour of the present restriction say that production in the ordinary way should not be interfered with, but that the surplus products should be stored. What will happen when the restrictions are lifted? There will be an immediate glut on the market, and prices will fall to still lower levels. Are we to assume that the whole future of the Wyndham meat works is bound up with the attitude of Belgium towards our trade? It seems to me that Belgium is not a very large factor in world affairs, and that we are tending to place somewhat too great reliance upon her. Moreover, it seems now to be generally admitted that other countries will try to secure from us a similar agreement to that which we have made with Belgium, and if that be so, it seems inevitable that our secondary industries, one after another, must be sacrificed on the altar of expediency. It is quite evident that that is the future envisioned by the honorable member for Wakefield. It is a poor lookout for those living in the industrial areas of our cities, who depend upon the secondary industries for employment. Those of us who represent such areas have a definite obligation in this matter. We are not unmindful of the needs of the primary producers, and wish them to receive a fair and proper return for their labour, but we are not prepared to go to the lengths that the Government has gone in this agreement by sacrificing a secondary industry. That course is totally unnecessary. The metropolitan interests are at least as important as those of the country, and we shall soon find ourselves in a very sorry plight if we destroy one secondary industry after another in order to placate the primary producers, particularly when we realize that in this case there is no guarantee that the primary interests concerned will benefit. </para>

                        <para>- The market for glass in Australia is limited owing to our small population, and the glass company has installed a plant capable of supplying the whole of that market. If part of the market is to be supplied by Belgium it is obvious that the Australian Glass Company cannot continue to produce at maximum efficiency. Its production costs will increase, and this, in turn, will place it in a still worse position to compete with foreign manufacturers. It has been said that the producers of barley and meat will obtain benefits which will more than compensate for any injury to the glass industry. Evidently the barley and meat have been put on one side of the scale and the glass on the other, and the beam has tipped against the glass industry. The Government said that only 300 or 400 men at most would be affected by this interference with' glassmanufacturing industry, and that they would be absorbed in other activities. The matter is not so simple as that, and this principle, once admitted, is likely to be extended very rapidly to other industries. In any case, what we hope to gain by trade with foreign countries may quite easily be offset in other directions. The Danes were quick to circumvent the provisions designed to give dominion butter preference on the British market. In order to offset the duty of 15s. per cwt. they devalued their currency, and even exported cream to Great Britain to be made up into butter there. It is natural for every country to conserve its own interests first, and even Britain is being forced to take this course at the expense of her dominions. I think it will he found after this agreement has been in operation for some time that the balance will be against Australia. </para>

                    <para>.- I am pleased that the Government has entered into this agreement with Belgium, though it is not nearly so far-reaching as I should like to see it. The honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> said that he would like to see the primary producers obtaining a fair return for their labour, and so on; but such wishes do not help the primary producer very much. It is the preponderance of city interests in this Parliament, brought about by the growth of secondary industries, that has placed the primary producers at so great a disadvantage  compared with the fostered industries of the cities. This is proved by figures prepared by the Commissioner for Taxation. In one year the taxable income of Australia was £122,000,000, of which the primary industries, including the mining and pastoral industries, yielded only £5,000,000, while the secondary industries, including the glass industry, yielded £117,000,000. What would happen to the secondary industries of Australia if the great exporting industries were ruined, if they were wiped out altogether, as seems possible under our present policy of seeking to become self-contained! In one year Australia received from Italy, Belgium, France, Germany and Japan trade to the value of £40,000,000 more than that of the trade which it gave to those countries. This state of affairs cannot continue. The United States of America now realizes that its attitude of isolation has not succeeded and it openly confesses that it must reverse its policy, recognizing that goods must be paid for with goods. Australia cannot expect to sell its products to other countries if it buys nothing from them in return. </para>

                <para>Some of the remarks made during this debate, particularly by honorable members on the Opposition side, astonish me. A plea has been advanced on behalf of the unemployed, and those who receive the invalid and old-age pension, as though these are the only persons whom certain honorable members represent in this Parliament. Yet we now have them speaking in defence of monopolies and profiteers. The honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hawker)</inline> has shown that the shares of the Australian Window Glass Company, which was established shortly before the depression began, have increased in value from £1 to 61s. 9d. Compare that with the position of the meat producers in the north-western portion of Western Australia and the electorate of Kennedy in Queensland or that of the wheat-growers of Australia. The honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fairbairn)</inline> recently named a score of companies whose shares have increased in value during the depression by up to 150 per cent. Do members of the Opposition ever realize that the economically unsound position of many Australian secondary industries is largely responsible for the prevalence of unemployment? No doubt there would be fewer men out of work if certain uneconomic industries had never been established in this country. We should be infinitely better off if we had concentrated on a number of industries that could be carried on economically and could sell at least a proportion of their products abroad. What would be the position of Australia if it were not for our exporting industries? It would become like a besieged city, and employment would be Unobtainable. Nothing should be done to prevent Australia from exporting its primary products. At the present time its exports amount to £15 a head of the population. The cities of Melbourne and Sydney do not produce one shilling a head for export, whereas Western Australia's exports realize £37 a head. Yet the cities have a greater voice than the country districts in governmental affairs. Truly the primary producers are placed at a tragic disadvantage. </para>
                <para>I agree that, as suggested in the first place by the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nairn),</inline> the glass requirements of South Australia and Western Australia should be met by means of the imports under the treaty rather than from the factory in Sydney. I think the Australian company would not object. </para>

                <para>I would welcome trade agreements with any nation that gives us such a favorable balance of trade as does Belgium. In one year Australia received trade from Belgium to the value of £9,000,000, compared with £900,000 worth of trade which Belgium obtained from us. It is not surprising that that country aud Japan expect Australia to do some business with them. We should show a spirit of reciprocity. Italy now proposes to exclude 50 per cent. of the wool previously purchased by it from this country. We cannot afford to lose such a valuable trade. We might well sift out some of our uneconomic industries for the purpose of increasing reciprocal trade with other countries. This policy would be advantageous to our people, and employment in Australia would be increased. I hope that the present agreement is only the thin end of a wedge that will enable similar treaties to be negotiated with other countries. </para>

                    <para>. - Some honorable members seem to suggest that there is a clash of interests over the treaty with Belgium. Although I am desirous that meat production in the north-western portion of Australia shall succeed, I should be sorry to think that such, a treaty would injuriously affect an Australian secondary industry. I shall refer in the first place to the difficulties with which meat producers in North Australia are faced. Some years ago the cattle produced in the Kimberley district found a market entirely in the southern portion of Western Australia. At that time, that State had comparatively few farmers, and its meat supplies had to be brought from the Kimberleys. Great trouble was then experienced because the small cattlemen could not obtain space for their cattle on the boats. It was mainly reserved for large cattlemen. Men who. had driven their fat stock for six weeks to Wyndham or Derby found that the space had been fully engaged by the large growers on Dalgety and Company's vessels. This led to the inauguration of the shipping service established by the Western Australian Government expressly for the purpose of meeting the needs of the small growers, who were given the first call on the space. Good cattle were subsequently produced by the farmers in the southwestern portion of the State, and then the northern cattlemen had to find a fresh market. No private company was prepared to risk its capital in the establishment of meat works, so a Labour government came to the assistance of the meat producers, and built freezing works at Wyndham. Although the large firm of Vestey's closed down its meat works across the border at Darwin, the Western Australian Government continued to carry on its works in the northern part of Western Australia, and it is now providing an outlet for cattle from the Northern Territory. If these works were closed down, ruin would overtake the growers both in the Kimberleys ' and in the Northern Territory. While fault has been found by every anti-Labour government in my State with the government meat works, no ministry there has had the temerity to close them. Their establishment has resulted in the opening up of a portion of the State which had not previously been developed. The employees in the industry at the works receive the best of conditions. Although the Belgian market has been lost to the growers for two years, about 230 men have been employed for from six to eight months each season, and the meat has been exported and placed in cold storage in London awaiting a market. The cattle in these vast areas are half wild, and consequently no opportunity is presented for the selection of stock for breeding purposes. This inferior meat has been purchased by Belgium to replace the horse flesh formerly consumed. The Belgian meat market is thus the cheapest in the world. The State Government provides ideal conditions for its employees, and affords employment in a portion of Australia seventeen degrees south, of the equator where there was none worth speaking of until these meat works were established. For only 25s. a week the men enjoy a splendid table, the equal of which is not provided for the same tariff in any capital city. The living quarters are first class, there is au abundance of ice and cool drinks, and an excellent water supply. In addition, there is a picture show for the entertainment of the employees, who are a credit to Australia. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I have no wish to set one industry against another, but I do say that this House should regard as of supreme importance the opening up of the back country of Australia. The question is: Are we to have a densely populated white race only in the more fertile parts of the continent, denuding of population the more vulnerable parts by making no provision for employment in them? There is a disposition on the part of honorable members who represent city electorates to look after their constituents at the expense of the people of country districts. The honorable member for Kennedy and I have a bigger task than the average member because of the size of our electorates. I always endeavour to stifle any feeling of parochialism with which I may be assailed, and which is quite natural. For instance, although a representative of a Western Australian electorate, I have always fought for the sugar industry of Queensland. The point that I have always made is that it is established in the tropics and is responsible for 180,000 members of the white race being settled north of the tropic of Capricorn. For the first time in the history of the world, white men have beaten the nigger at what was supposed to bc his job. Therefore, it is our duty to stand up and protect them. But I want to see established in the northern part of Australia another industry that will remain there; and the cattle industry is the only one which at the moment has a possibility of doing that. Optimists may say that tropical fruits may be grown there, but considerable difficulties have first to be overcome. No one, however, can say what the future may disclose. </para>
                <para>I consider that the Government has not in the negotiation of this treaty exercised that vision which we might have expected. An examination of the document shows that when the annual consumption in Australia is in excess of 7,500,000 square feet the share of the Australian manufacturers is to drop from 60 per cent, to 50 per cent. As last year the Australian Glass Company made 9,000,000 square feet, of which 8,000,000 square feet was used in Australia, we may say that from now onward the Australian manufacturer will be entitled to provide only one-half of the window glass consumed in this country. </para>

                        <para>- It seems to me that the Australian manufacturer is to have a very small share of the trade. In my opinion a better bargain could have been driven. I cannot help remarking, as several previous speakers have done, that there is no provision for Belgium to take a quota of our beef or barley. Presumably, it has merely to lift the embargo. That is a one-sided arrangement. The Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> may say that Belgium is bound to take our meat, but T am not certain of that and consider that he has been outmanoeuvred. We have guaranteed Belgium 28.7 per cent, of the glass required in this country up to 7,500,000 square fest, and an additional 7 per cent, on whatever is required in excess of that quantity. If the Minister can clear up this point I shall feel more satisfied than I feel now. We shall see directly whether there is a catch. I believe that there is. </para>

That would make for cheaper glass, and have, a tendency to keep the Australian manufacturer intact, enabling him to compete on better terms in the large centres of population, thus conferring a benefit on all concerned. </para>

                    <para>. - It is pleasing to hear an honorable member of the Opposition stressing the importance of the great meat industry to a country like Australia ; but it was rather surprising to hear that honorable gentleman conclude his speech with the suggestion that the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> had made a bad bargain with Belgium in connexion with this matter. Prior to the imposition of the embargo on the importation of Belgian glass into Australia, Belgium was an exceedingly good customer of ours for frozen meat. Looking at the figures relating to the trade balance between Australia and Belgium, one finds a very extraordinary state of affairs. For the tcn years ended 1932, Belgium bought from us over £64,000,000 worth of goods, while during the same period we bought from Belgium less than £8,000,000 worth; it took from us £.1 worth for every 2s. 6d. worth that we took from it. During the five years ended 1932, we. took from Belgium glass of an average value of £47,000 per annum. During that same period Belgium took from us in meat alone an average of £348,000 worth per annum - seven times as much value in meat as we had taken in glass. In addition, the value of the barley which Belgium took from us was very greatly in excess of the value of the glass which we took from that country. It appears to me that the honorable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. A. Green)</inline> is viewing the matter entirely from the wrong angle. He has suggested that we have granted Belgium a quota in respect of glass, and that, Belgium having given us no such concession, we are not entitled to assume that it will take any meat from us. Can the honorable gentleman not look at the matter from the point of view that we have imposed a condition on Belgium, in that it may not send to us more than a certain quantity of glass, whereas it has. imposed no such restriction upon us? So far as quota restrictions are concerned, we are free to send to Belgium as much meat as it can take from us. On the other hand, Belgium is not free to send to us as much glass as we may require. </para>

                        <para>- It is not; it is an absolutely clear statement of the position. A quota is a restriction. The honorable gentleman would suggest that a quota is an advantage rather than a disadvantage. 1 would mention a further point for his consideration. I do not know that he needs it to be emphasized, because in the. early portion of his speech he spoke of the great value of the meat industry to Australia. I ask him, which would be the more valuable to Australia, if we had to make a choice, to develop in the Northern Territory or in the northern part of Western Australia an industry which enables something to be done with those huge areas, and to give as much employment as we can at the Wyndham Meat Works, or to have a rather larger turnover in one additional factory owned by a monopoly in Sydney? </para>

                        <para>- Or, on the other hand, having a monopoly of our own market for glass with an additional output of a value of perhaps £18,000 or £20,000, and the door absolutely closed against our meat by a country which formerly took from us in value seven times as much meat as we took from it in glass, a veritable tyro in economics would not argue that we were not getting a better bargain in the arrangement we have made. The Minister for Trade and Customs is to be congratulated upon having been able to place before the House a proposition which shows that this market is again open to us; that we shall be able to sell meat to a country to which  we formerly sold large quantities. To those honorable gentlemen who seem to think that the closing of one market does not matter, on the ground that our meat may be sold elsewhere, I would point out that the price would be bound to be very greatly depressed. Probably the fact that Belgium has not been buying our meat in the last year or two has had something to do with the extraordinarily low prices which have been ruling for our frozen meat. It seems to me that there are not two tenable sides to this particular question. I admit that there are two sides to most questions, but if one has to decide between giving £18,000 worth of trade in order to open the door to £500,000 worth of trade in exchange, it demands only one answer. </para>

                        <para>- They have no guarantee that we shall take their glass. We take their glass only to the extent that our merchants want their glass, and then only up to the point to which those merchants are restricted by the quota. On the other hand, they take our meat up to the point that their buyers want our meat with no restriction whatever. I hope the honorable member for  Kalgoorlie and other honorable members will endeavour to get it into their minds that quota is restriction; that it is rather a taking away of something than a granting of something, and that in the bargain we have made, we are able to sell our meat without restriction, whereas on the other hand we take glass from Belgium only in the quantities laid down in the agreement. I think the agreement is in favour of the meat and barley industry and other Australian industries which are of greater importance to Australia than a mere £18,000 worth of window glass. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, but the Minister cannot be accused of being a humorist. The honorable gentleman tried to convey to this House that the restrictions on the entry of Belgian glass to this country were imposed by a Labour Government. That is not a fact; they were imposed by another Government. It was the Bruce-Page Government, of which the Minister was a member, that provided for the imposition of the deferred duties. The duties imposed by the Scullin Government were the Bruce-Page Government's duties. </para>

                <para>The Scullin Government merely imposed the deferred duties, but the present Government placed a prohibition against the importation of glass, and it was this action which brought about retaliation by Belgium, which lost to the cattle-growers of this country a share in the Belgian market for the last two years. It is of no use for honorable members opposite to shift their ground. The present Government is responsible for the embargo placed on glass by interfering, in the first place, with the duties which they themselves had imposed. I refer to the duties imposed' by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pratten,</inline> who was a Minister in the Bruce Page Government. </para>
                <para>The exception taken to this agreement by members on this side of the House is that it was not submitted to Parliament before ratification. Honorable members on this side of the House representing cattle-raising interests in this country have the welfare of Australia at heart just as much as honorable members supporting .the Government, and they should be permitted to speak on behalf of the interests which they represent in this House.

                    <para>The agreement, restricting as it does the output of our factory to about 0,000,000 square feet per annum, will necessarily result in a severe blow to us. A factory designed and equipped to produce 12,000,000 square feet of glass cannot hope to keep costs down to a proper level on the quantity now allotted to us. Both the shareholders and workers must inevitably suffer. Employment will unquestionably be affected. The agreement has not been made without cost. We do not concur in your statement that employment in the glass industry will not be greatly affected. We do not propose, however, to spend time in criticizing the agreement that has been signed and put into effect. </para>

Honorable members might discuss this matter until to-morrow morning, but the Minister has definitely made up his mind that while we may discuss it, no opportunity will be given to vote upon it. The letter continues - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>We are simply forced to accept it. We will, therefore, mention only two points in this letter. The first is that the Government has not been fair to us in forcing a restriction upon our output and then blaming us for it. We must very definitely differ from you in your statement that - " the action of the glass company in requesting the imposition of the deferred duty prior to the date on which it had been deferred, and years before it was in a position to produce glass, has brought about the present position ". </para>
                    <para>When we asked for the imposition of the protective duties to stop the flooding of this market with imported glass the Government recognized such action to be necessary if wewere to be enabled to start this new industry. We gave an undertaking to have our factory in production before the stocks then in the Commonwealth were depleted, and we did as we promised, but, as your department well knows, we met with obstacles that hindered successful production for a few months (not years). There was, however, never any serious shortage of glass, and at the most a few hundred boxes imported under by-law would have got over the period of temporary anxiety. The cause of the hindrance to our production is well known and should have called forth a little sympathetic consideration from you and not adverse criticism. It was not the imposition of the duty that brought about the present trouble - it was the removal of the duty that did it. If the Bruce-Page rate of duty on glass, which was imposed by the Scullin Government, had been left alone, there would have been no trouble from Belgium or any one else. </para>
                    <para>The second point we would mention is that the Government could now lessen the damage to the Australian industry without  affecting  the quota from Belgium, by directing the imported glass to certain Australian ports. In the past the Australian glass has sold, landed at each capital port, at the one price. This has meant that freight from Sydney to Fremantle, or to Port Adelaide, or Hobart, lias been paid by the Australian manufacturer. If the imported glass were directed mainly to those ports which are farthest from Sydney the whole of the requirements of the three smaller States would be supplied without extra  cost  to the foreign suppliers and without extra cost to the importers. Seeing that Western Australia is particularly interested in meat, and South Australia in barley, we suggest that they might ha.ve major portion of Belgium's quota of glass. This will leave more of the market in New South Wales and Victoria to the Australian company and save thom the coastal freights to the distant ports. Tn view of the greatly increased costs of production that must follow its restricted output, the Australian manufacturer must either reduce distribution costs or pass them on to the buyers concerned. Such an increase in costa may he at least partially avoided if the Government directs most of the imported glass to the States of Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania. We would, therefore, urge you to lessen the blow to this industry and at the same time assist in keeping the cost of glass in the smaller States down to the level of the price in Now South Wales and Victoria by directing the imported glass to ports that will reduce the payment of coastal freight on Australian glass to a mimimum. </para>

                <para class="block">In view of the cock-sureness of the Minister for Trade and Customs on this subject, and for that matter on every other one that he discusses, I felt that it was proper I should read this letter so that it could bo incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Ilansard</inline> and circulated widely. It sets out the case clearly from the point of view of the company. The Minister, and also his colleague, the Minister for the Interior tried to saddle the Scullin Government with the blame for the loss of our meat trade with Belgium. The fact is that the muddling of the Lyons Government, and its interference with the deferred duties provided by the Bruce-Page Government, were solely responsible for the loss that our meat producers have incurred in this respect during the last two years. </para>

                    <para>. - Honorable gentleman opposite have shown clearly that they have been hard put to it to criticize this agreement. Even though the representatives from Western Australia who sit with the Opposition have drawn largely on their eloquence in the endeavour to fault the agreement, they have failed to do so. I ignore the remarks made by honorable gentlemen who have merely tried to bc personal. In fairness to the window glass manufacturing company I directed the department to inform them on the day previous to the tabling of the agreement that our twelve months' negotiations with the Government of Belgium had reached finality. I regret that an endeavour has been made to make political capital out of that action. </para>

                <para>We must remember that the Government of Belgium had actually prohibited the importation of Australian meat into Belgium. The prohibition of the importation of Australian barley into Belgium was withheld only at the urgent request of the Government. The honorable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. A. Green)</inline> should take that important fact into consideration. If he would prefer a straight-out agreement that Belgium should purchase £1S,000 worth of beef from Australia and that Australia should purchase £1 8,000 worth of window glass from Belgium - and Belgium at one time proposed an equal purchase of meat for glass - let him say so. I do not think that his constituents would be pleased with him if he did so. The Government has made an excellent agreement, for it has left open an unlimited market for certain Australian products in Belgium. We should do well to remember that for very many . years our trade to Belgium was worth ten times Belgium's trade to Australia. The barley grown in South Australia is of a type acceptable to Belgium. Our competitors for that trade are mainly Algeria and Turkey, and we found that we could not divert this barley to British or other markets. It is of course, impossible for me in the few minutes at my disposal to tell the full story of the twelve months' negotiation of this agreement. If honorable members opposite knew everything that had happened they would realize that the Government had acted greatly to the advantage of Australia. Had the honorable member for Kennedy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riordan)</inline> in particular known all the facts he would not have been prepared to accept <inline font-style="italic">ex parte</inline> statements such as those in the letter which he has just read in preference to the statements of responsible members of the Government. The policy of this Government has been definitely beneficial to Australian secondary industries. The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> repeated to-night the story that we have heard so often from him that the Scullin Government's policy had resulted in the employment of many additional people in our secondary industries. But we know very well that the number of people in employment in Australia decreased month by month throughout the life of that Government. Since this Government has been in office the number of factory employees in Australia has increased by 68,000. The ' Australian Glass Manufacturers Company Limited actually enjoyed the benefits of an embargo for two years, although it was not entitled to such consideration. The honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Garden)</inline> put his point of view with much more dignity than that shown by the honorable member for Kennedy. He was naturally alarmed at the prospect of the falling off of employment in this industry in his electorate. But the prospects of the industry have not suffered, for the honorable member for "Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hawker)</inline> was correct in saying that the value of the shares of this company had increased slightly since the announcement of the agreement with Belgium. The honorable member produced a list of names and said that these men were naturally afraid that they would lose employment. Naturally any individual would feel concerned if his job were placed in jeopardy; but when I asked the honorable member if any of these men had received notice of dismissal he replied: "No". I think no one will be dismissed ; because the Australian industry has an assured market of 60 per cent, of the Australian trade, and 50 per cent, of any increase of trade that may eventuate. How many other industries enjoy such favorable conditions! This treaty was not just handed out to us by Belgium when we asked for it. It was only finalized after a great deal of negotiation. Over and over again in t'his House I was asked what progress was being made in these negotiations; and not being in a position to divulge such information, I had to bear the  odium of the criticism levelled at me on such occasions and simply reply that certain progress had been made. Now that the treaty has come down I appreciate the fact that from the other side it has been commended more than condemned. Honorable members opposite find themselves hard put to it to criticize the treaty. The main point in the criticism is that a departure had been made from ordinary procedure in dealing with such matters. But the procedure followed by the Government was justified. If we follow the train of events leading up to the treaty the position was that in 1925 the Tariff Board recommended certain deferred duties of ltd. per lb. and 40 per cent. British or 2d. per lb., and 60 per cent, foreign, with an immediate revenue impost of 2s. British and 4s. foreign. Successive Ministers acting under the power conferred upon them under the act, published notices in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> deferring the deferred rates which the Tariff Board had recommended should not  be applied until December, 1930 ; but the Scullin Government put these deferred duties into operation on the 30th July, 1930. That was the beginning of all the trouble. The deferred duties were imposed before the industry was ready. At that stage it was inefficient, and' later it was reported as inefficient by the Tariff Board. I admit that it is now operating on an efficient basis. The embargo was re-imposed because of reasons put forward by the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Garden).</inline> A delegation representative of both sides of the House and of employees in the industry waited on the Government, and the Government feared that if no embargo was imposed to counteract the flood of imports it might create unemployment. The embargo was subsequently continued, but it was only conditional on there being no scarcity in Australia. Honorable members who were in this chamber at that time are aware that there was subsequently no scarcity of window glass in Australia. The Australian company stood up to its obligations under this arrangement but recently for a while was unable to meet the demand. I cannot understand the honorable member for Cook saying that the company now has large stocks at its disposal. The honorable gentleman must have got that information somewhere. How can the company have such large stocks on hand when recently it could not meet demands? It made representations to the Government a year ago that if the embargo were lifted it would have to close its works and put men out of employment. In the interim an inquiry has been carried out by the Tariff Board, and in the interim also Belgium definitely put a prohibition on Australian beef, a large quantity of which comes from the Wyndham meat works, which are situated in the electorate represented by the honorable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. A. Green).</inline> The manager of those works, together with others, came here as a deputation to ask the Government if it could not do something to counteract Belgium's action. The Government has taken action with that end in view, but it has not achieved its object without having to face many difficulties. </para>

                        <para>- Australia has to recognize the quota system. We cannot afford to remain isolated so far as world trade is concerned. The quota system has arrived, and most countries to-day are formulating agreements under that system. Pt at least has this big advantage, that under it guaranteed markets can be found for industry. If the Government had reverted to the revenue rates of 2s. and 4s. only, what would have happened ? The industry may have had to go out of existence. Agreements under the quota system preserve markets, and in this case the Commonwealth Government has made an agreement with  a  country that has been  a  large buyer of our primary products. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; but this is purely  a  temporary agreement, which will exist for twelve months. After that date it oan be revoked at two months' notice. In any case, it is merely a prelude to  a  general agreement between the two countries, which will be brought forward in  a  general way for ratification. I hope this procedure is satisfactory. I would not like honorable gentlemen to think that the matter was sprung upon them. Tariff items cannot be discussed' in advance. A schedule is brought down and the duties operate at once. So it is with such matters as this agreement, which involved prolonged negotiations with Great Britain and Belgium. The third party interested, the Australian company, was advised that something was to be done on a certain date, but it was not furnished with particulars. </para>

                        <para>- It is; but the honorable gentleman must remember that, although Tasmania is not a large exporter, two-thirds of Australia's wool is exported to foreign countries. Highly industrialized countries like Belgium are potential buyers of our primary goods; and, keeping our trade balance always in view, it is obvious that we should come to terms with those countries. Another criticism levelled against the agreement is that it will encourage other nations to make demands on Australia. We have dealt with them under the most-favoured nation clause, and countries which previously sent glass to Australia have been given their quota <inline font-style="italic">pro rata</inline> to what they exported to this country in previous years. If a situation should arise when another country with a trade balance very favorable to Australia wishes to enter into a trade agreement with us, .we shall find a basis that will be of benefit to Australia, which will protect our own Australian industries, and preserve good international relations. </para>

                    <para>- The Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> made one statement which I cannot allow to go unchallenged. He said that the trouble between Australia and Belgium had arisen from the fact that the Scullin Government had imposed a prohibitive duty on glass. Then he went on to say that his Government stood for the promotion of international trade by the removal of impediments, while the Scullin Government had pursued a policy of prohibition. The fact is that the only government that ever prohibited the importation of glass into Australia was the Lyons Government. The trouble with Belgium began when the present Government started backing and filling in its treatment of the Belgian glass exporters. Until then there bad been no trouble at all. Let me briefly recapitulate the history of the window glass industry in Australia in order that we may get these matters in their true light. Away back in 1925, the Bruce-Page Government, which included representatives of the Country party, was in power. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pratten</inline> was Minister for Trade and Customs, and representations were made that there should be established in Australia a new industry for the manufacture of sheet glass. In order to justify expenditure by the company the Ministry of the day imposed a deferred duty of approximately 16s. per 100 square feet of glass. The proposal was sponsored by the Government, which contained Nationalist and Country party representatives, and was supported by the Labour party. The whole Parliament was behind it. On the strength of that a company that was already engaged in the manufacture of glass of other kinds was asked to embark on a large capital expenditure in order to undertake the manufacture of sheet glass. Immediately the importation of sheet glass was accelerated with the result that the company hesitated to begin, knowing that it was a difficult matter to comply with the conditions of a deferred duty, because it would be required to be in a position substantially to supply the requirements of Australia before the duty would come into operation. In 1930 the Labour Government was in office. We made an appeal to the manufacturers and to others to provide all the employment possible. The Australian Glass Company said that it was prepared to go ahead with the manufacture of sheet glass if it were given the protection promised by the Bruce-Page Government. It added that stocks of imported glass had been kept up to a year's supply, and that immediately it made a move to obtain machinery for the manufacture of sheet glass those stocks would probably be increased. We told the company to go ahead with its preparations, and provide what employment it could. It was estimatedthat, 300 persons would be employed. We made an investigation, and found that there was at that time over a year's supply of sheet glass stored in Australia. We received an undertaking from the company that if we put the deferred duty into operation it would immediately takesteps to commence the manufacture of sheet glass, so that it would be in full production before the existing imported stocks were consumed. </para>

                        <para>- It encountered one or two difficulties at the beginning, but any one who had any sympathy with Australian industry would have made allowance for that. All the Government had to do to meet the difficulty was to admit sheet glass under by-law as was done in the case of galvanized iron. Immediately it became known that the duties were to be imposed, and that the company was to begin manufacture, a flood of imported! sheet glass reached Australia, although at that time the depression was at its height and the building trade was practically at a standstill. The imports increased from 10,000,000 square feet in 1928-29 to- 19,000,000 square feet in 1930. </para>

There "was eighteen months' supply of imported glass in Australia when the company was ready to go on the market. The company, on the strength of a duty which was imposed, not by the Scullin Government, but by the Bruce-Page Government, -took measures to embark on the manufacture of sheet glass. </para>

                        <para>- It is not different. A deferred duty represents an honest effort by a government to assist a new industry, and is a promise that protection will be forthcoming when the company is in a position to produce. In the case of the glass company, however, as SOO 11 as it became known that the deferred duty would be made operative, the country was flooded with imported glass, so that there would be no market available when the company began manufacture. Everybody knows that sheet glass to be produced economically must be turned out in large quantities. The company had to spend £300,000 on plant, and it was entitled to some consideration. The Scullin Government imposed no higher duty than that which was introduced by the Bruce-Page Government. We had no trouble with Belgium over the duty, nor over any of the prohibitions which we imposed. As everybody knows, those prohibitions were necessary in order to safeguard the finances of Australia. The Lyons Government, however, abolished the protective duty on glass, reduced it to a  revenue  duty, and then, three weeks later, imposed an embargo. As soon as the Belgian manufacturers got their glass on the water <inline font-style="italic">en route</inline> to Australia they found that an embargo had been imposed, and then, naturally, they became annoyed. There was no retaliation from Belgium over the duty; that came only when the embargo was imposed by the Lyons  Government.  The duty had been introduced with the approval of all parties in Parliament in 1925, and, as a result, the industry was established and is now giving employment to. approximately 400 </para>

Our purpose was to. maintain an industry which had already been established in Australia. What crime has this company committed that it should be treated in this way? At the request of a Nation alistcumCountry party Government, it sets up its machinery and plant at a cost of £300,000, because of the promise of a deferred duty to become operative when the factory commenced production. The factory is in production. The company surmounted its initial difficulties ; it is now producing the best quality of glass and has brought its prices down by 35 per cent. Now this Government is willing to strangle it. </para>

                    <para>.- I should not bave risen at this late hour to support the action taken by the Government had not the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> related such an extraordinary story about the whole business. But he told only one half of the story, and brought out only those points which would support his argument against the step* taken by my colleague, the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White).</inline> I congratulate the Minister personally upon his achievement in making this trade agreement. I can only hope that when I make trade agreements with other countries, they will be as advantageous to the people of Australia as is this one with Belgium. We have every reason to congratulate the Minister for having re-opened an avenue of trade worth £500,000 to Australia in return for a loss of trade representing approximately £18,000. </para>

                        <para>- We have every reason to anticipate that we shall hold it under the most-favoured nation treatment, which we shall enjoy. I am not surprised that the honorable member should feel some apprehension on the point, because the South Australian export trade in barley is vitally affected by an agreement which will enable us to continue the sale of our surplus production. Our great problem now is to sell a rapidly-increasing production in rapidlycontracting world markets. Unless we overcome this difficulty - I hope that we shall as the result of trade negotiations with other countries - our chief concern will be, not the unemployment of a few score of workmen, but the lowering of the standard of living for every man, woman and child in Australia. On this point I present a few figures so that honorable gentlemen who are opposing the Government in this matter may realize the difficulties that confront us. The successful disposal of our surplus production is not a party political matter. As every one knows, on the measure and value of that surplus, depends the prosperity of every Australian industry. If we compare our exports for 1933 and 1934 with the average exports for the four years ended 1928-29, we shall find that our export of barley was doubled, that of mutton and lamb increased two and a quarter times, that of butter increased two and a half times, that of eggs increased by nine times, that of canned fruits by three and a half times, and that of sugar, raisins, and currants was doubled. These facts surely bring home to honorable members the folly of attempting to oppose an agreement of this kind. The honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Garden)</inline> has admitted that so far no one has lost employment as the result of this agreement, and, at most, as the Leader of the Opposition has said, the effect might be to throw a few score of men out of work. To-night the honorable member for Cook mentioned a petition from 300 workers employed by the Australian Glass Company, but did not suggest that any of them had either lost or were in danger of losing their jobs. I undertake to say if one went around Australia with a petition to be signed by those who will benefit from the improved export trade in harley, frozen meat, and other products affected by this agreement, one could quite easily obtain the signatures of thousands of farmers. It is desirable that I should direct attention to the particular action which caused exasperation in Belgium and induced the Government of that country to take drastic action against Australia, by threatening to place an embargo against the importation of Australian barley. There was a deferred duty on sheet glass in 1930. The Tariff Board had recommended that it be deferred until the 30th August of that year, but the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde),</inline> when Minister for Trade and Customs, brought the date back to the 30th June. At the annual meeting of the Australian Glass Company five, days later, the  chairman-  said - </para>

                <para class="block">Not until August, 1932, two years and three months after the prohibitive duty had been put on, did this company actually come into consistent production. Such favorable treatment is without precedent in the history of protection in Australia. The company produced glass intermittently before that time, but it brought about unemployment in the building trade, and the supply of glass was always short. Speaking from memory, I suspended the duties in the early part of 1932, to relieve the building trade and admit, under by-law, glass from overseas to the value of £3,400; but not a word against that action was said in this House. In the case of the present agreement, the House was informed of the Government's decision on the day on which the agreement was signed. </para>
                <para>The action of this company has exasperated Belgium, and has led to retaliation by that country. It is astonishing to hear the honorable member for Cook (&gt;Mr. Garden) speaking in a most sympathetic manner about great monopolies. It is novel to have my right honorable friend the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin),</inline> after his campaign against the banks, supporting this extraordinary company which has misused protection and upset Belgium, with which for years Australia has enjoyed a favorable trade balance in the proportion of ten to one. The company should have pioneered this new branch of its business, and not loafed on Australia. The Australian Glass Manufacturers Company Limited came into existence as the result of a merger in 1922. Since that date it has declared net profits to the amount of £1,750,000. </para>

                        <para>- The Australian Glass Manufacturers Company holds 289,000 out of 300,000 shares in the Sheet Glass Company. The latter is a dummy company; in reality, it is the Australian Glass Manufacturers Company. Out of the £1,750,000 of disclosed profits, that company has paid £1,250,000 in dividends, and has put by disclosed reserves to the amount of £500,000. Further, it has paid off £250,000 as depreciation on land and plant that had been greatly expanded during the years in which they were depreciated. Moreover, there is every reason to believe that it has still further undisclosed reserves. Yet our friends opposite, who pose as the champions of the workers, and the opponents of monopolies, are now found supporting big vested interests. <inline font-style="italic">[Leave to continue given.]</inline> Honorable members listened a few nights ago to a long recital by <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> honorable member for Griffith <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Baker)</inline> of big vested allied interests in Australia. The last dividends paid by the company were 9 per cent, on debentures, and 9 per cent, on ordinary shares; but now, because it is asked to suffer some small setback after the enormous privileges it has enjoyed under protection and the amazing profits it has obtained, it is suggested that, owing to this agreement with Belgium, some of its employees may be put out of work. With great respect to Australian manufacturers, I have no hesitation in saying that if this agreement results in men being pui out of work after all that 'has been done to assist secondary industries in this country, it will be a great blot on Australian manufacturers. </para>

                        <para>- It would appear to those outside who review the situation that Parliament is reducing itself to a farce. Although this discussion may give the protagonists of the Australian Glass Company an opportunity to defend it, and the alleged opponents of monopolies the opportunity to attack it, no tangible results will 'be achieved. The agreement having been signed, and Parliament not having an opportunity to amend it, shows that the policy now adopted by the Government is a negation of that which its supporters advocated during the election campaign. I remember the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> vigorously protesting against any form of restriction. The electors thought that when honorable members spoke of restrictions, they were speaking only of restricting the export of surplus production, and not of restricting the production of an Australian commodity required on the local market. The Government has stated repeatedly that the solution of the unemployment problem must have priority over all other matters, and that the only way in which unemployment can be reduced is by stimulating private enterprise. Yet, in this instance, we find that private enterprise, instead of being stimulated, is to be restricted, and the Australian worker is to have fewer opportunities to secure employment. </para>

                        <para>- The Government has agreed to restrict the export of meat to the United Kingdom, and, although no announcement has been made in Parliament, has already agreed to a further restriction on the export of our surplus wheat. The Government is restricting not only the sale of the exportable surplus of certain commodities, but also the opportunity of the Australian people to buy goods of local production, andis thus placing a further obstacle in the way of rehabilitating industry. I agree with other honorable members that such trade agreements or restrictions as affect Australian producers, demonstrate the confusion in the minds of the members of the Government and their inability to handle the situation. But in endeavouring to remove one difficulty they raise two other obstacles. The Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Henry Gullett)</inline> says that if we trace this matter to its source, we shall find that the trouble commenced when Belgium used retaliatory measures against the Scullin Government, but the difficulty arose as a result of the bungling over the Ottawa agreement. When that agreement was introducedits opponents said that other nations would take retaliatory measures against us. We were told that after giving consideration to local producers we should keep our tradewithin the British Empire. We were then told that our difficulties could be overcome by following a policy of giving preference to producers within the Empire; but now we are told that the only salvation for the Australian producer is to be found by sending as much trade as we can to foreign countries. This contradiction demonstrates that trade does not " follow the flag " ; actually it follows the most profitable market. While speaking of the alleged glass monopoly, the Minister might have told us something about the meat monopoly. He might have explained to honorable members why it is that, notwithstanding the fact that the Ottawa agreement was ratified by this Parliament and by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, Australian meat producers who were promised so many bene fits under the agreement are now placed at a disadvantage in comparison with the meat producers of Argentina. </para>

                        <para>- If the Minister cares, to read the recent speeches of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Elliott,</inline> the Minister for Agriculturein the British Cabinet, he will find that the British Government is assisting Argentinemeat producers. The agreement between the Commonwealth Government and the Beligan Government provides that the quantity of Belgian glass to be placed on the Australian market is not to exceed £10,000 in value, but does any honorable member imagine that the Belgian Government or Belgian people will long be satisfied with an agreement which provides that in return for the purchase of quantities of Australian barley or Australian meat we shall in return purchase only £10,000 worth of their plate glass? We are informed that this agreement is to remain operative only until a more comprehensive agreement is brought down, and that this is only a temporary arrangement. Honorable members can rest assured that when further agreements of a like character are introduced into this Parliament it will be found that the output of other Australian secondary industries has been restricted. It is not hard for us to take our minds back to the time when the Government was opposed to the limitation of production in any industry or to the regulation of exports. I can refer honorable members opposite to speeches in which they criticized strongly the actions of the Soviet Government in organizing and regulating its export trade. </para>

                        <para>- Doubtless it applies to the glass industry as well as to other industries. I am not putting up a plea for the Australian Glass Company, because I have no doubt that it avails itself of every opportunity to slash the wages of the workers and . lower their conditions, as is done by every private individual who controls an industry in this country. The point I make is that this is a low-wage Government. It believes in the policy of reducing the costs of production. I have heard the honorable member for Calare <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thorby)</inline> refer repeatedly to the burdens borne by industry. He has said that all rural awards should be suspended and that the conditions provided for by the Hut Accommodation Act of New South Wales should be abolished. </para>

                        <para>- On another occasion I shall read from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> the speech of the honorable member in which the statement occurs. He has opposed every piece of humane legislation that Labour governments have placed on the statute books of this country. Yet he now talks about the preservation of white labour conditions, and the existence in other countries of a form of slave labour! It can at least be said that in the old days, when a chattel slavery existed, a certain value was placed on a slave, and even when he was denied employment, he was cared for because of that fact. Under the existing social system, however, so soon as industry cannot provide profitable employment for a worker it throws him on the industrial scrapheap. No consideration is given as to how he or those who are dependent on him eke out an existence. I am aware of the difficulties that confront the Government. As a matter of fact, they are economic difficulties that will not be overcome by either this Administration or this Parliament, if an attempt is made to deal with them on the present basis of society. The same difficulty confronts governments in every country of the world where there is a similar economic structure. I candidly admit that I believe in the complete reconstruction of society. I have no wish to protect monopolies such as the Australian. Glass Company merely in order that they might have an oppor tunity to exploit the Australian workers and consumers. Nor am I here as an advocate for overseas monopolies, to give them the right to exploit Australian workers and consumers. While the present order is allowed to exist, however, it is at least advantageous to preserve as much employment as we can for our own people, and to ensure that they receive wages that permit of their living in a decent state of comfort. Honorable members opposite, who are the champions of private enterprise, have said that one of the reasons for the reduction of taxation within the last couple of years was to give private enterprise an opportunity to expand and thus to reduce the number of unemployed workers. Here is a company which, at the invitation of the Government, extended its operations. It says that it is able to provide for the production annually of 12,000,000 square feet of this particular glass; yet its opportunities to produce are to be limited. Honorable members opposite may be able to tell us exactly in what way they intend to deal with the situation in relation to unemployment while believing on the one hand in restricting the exports of our primary products and intending on the other hand tolimit the opportunity of secondary industries to meet the requirements of the local market, and at the same time being opposed to the inauguration of government works. Only in those three directions may the unemployed be absorbed or their number lessened. The one conclusion to which this discussion leads us is that the unemployed will receive no consideration whatever from this Government; they are to be mercilessly scrapped or passed over. If I am not permitted to make the statement here, I shall make it from every public platform - that thefarce of Parliament- </para>
