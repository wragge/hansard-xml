                        <para>- On Wednesday last the honorable member for Echuca brought under my notice certain allegations that have been made concerning meat purchased from the Queensland Government. I have had inquiries made regarding the meat supplied to camps of training in Victoria, and I can say definitely that the honorable member was grossly misinformed by whoever told him that the meat in question was purchased from the Queensland Government over eighteen  months ago. Frozen beef from Queensland has been supplied to camps in Victoria, but it has been of first export quality, killed and passed by Commonwealth Government inspectors in Queensland, and again inspected on arrival at Melbourne. </para>

The publication of such allegations, without any reply being possible under the circumstances at the same time, must seriously prejudice recruiting. </para>

                        <para>- I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Defence if he has any information regarding a recent explosion of munitions of war in England. Is he aware that by that explosion several hundred persons were killed, and half an acre of houses some miles away demolished ? In the light of that experience, is it the intention of the Government to proceed with the proposed arsenal near the Federal Capital, and, if so, will the Government pay the difference between the premiums chargeable for ordinary policies of insurance on house property and human life, and the extraordinary premiums which will be charged in respect of the house property at the Federal Capital, and on the lives of future members of Parliament? The proposed arsenal will be about 61/2 miles from the Federal Capital. I had the distance measured. </para>

                        <para>- The charges for handling wheat in the various States are estimated to be 41/4d. per bushel in New South Wales, 4d. per bushel in Victoria, 51/2d. per bushel in South Australia, and 41/4d. per bushel in Western Australia. To handling charges are added other charges for freight, varying from 31/2d. to 41/2d. per bushel. A few days ago the Treasurer promised the farmers that, at the end of April, they should receive a further advance of1s. per bushel on the wheat, but from that advance are to be deducted the charges which I have mentioned, aggregating from 7d. to 8d. per bushel, which leaves the net gain to the farmers from 4d. to 5d. per bushel. As it has been estimated that the price obtained for the wheat will be 4s. 9d. per bushel, and as that can be accurately determined, I ask the treasurer it it would not be possible to make the farmers now a net advance of1s. per bushel, and to deduct the charges for handling and freight from the remaining 9d. ? </para>

                        <para>- I should like to inform honorable members that the Treasury Department does not administer the wheat business, which is in the hands of a Board consisting of representatives of the Commonwealth and States, the Prime Minister being Chairman. ' The Wheat Pool is financed by the Board under a guarantee to the Banks by the Commonwealth and the States, and all that the Treasury has to do is to make the best financial arrangements it can for carrying out the Board's recommendation. Anything that I have said in regard to the wheat matter is only as Treasurer giving effect to the Board's recommendations. I am only the guarantor on behalf of the Commonwealth, and act on the recommendations of the Board. The statement made the other day was a statement of a recommendation by the Board which has been approved by the Treasury. I am not in a position to do anything except on the recommendations of the Board. If the Board makes any further recommendation, it will be my duty as Treasurer to do my best to help so as to give effect to it. </para>

                        <para>- We do not propose to interfere with the importation of cornsacks through the usual channels, but, as by reason of the vagaries of the weather, a harvest sometimes exceeds the estimated yield by 15,000,000 or 20,000,000 bushels, and is sometimes beneath the estimate to a corresponding extent, no private dealer will take the risk of importing in advance a sufficient number of sacks to provide for a large surplus, and thus, when there is a full harvest, there is always a shortage of cornsacks, which brings about an increase in the price, not only of the sacks needed for the surplus, but also in the price of all sacks imported. The Government proposes to do three things. In the first place, it will not collect duty on the imported sacks. Secondly, it will see that the sacks are sold at cost price, plus the expenses of handling and a reasonable commission. Thirdly, either directly or ' through agents, or through the Wheat Board, it will import a sufficient number, of sacks to provide for a full harvest, and will carry the whole of the liability that is so incurred. Thus the farmer may know that there will be sacks sufficient for the most bountiful harvest, and that these will be obtainable practically at cost price, and will not be dutiable. </para>

                        <para>- I can only answer the question in a general way. A few days ago the honorable member for Grampians introduced a deputation which laid before me certain facts' in connexion with this matter, and asked that the Government should prohibit the importation of certain luxuries, and consider the question of the excessive importation of certain other articles which, during a time of war may well fall under that classification, and consider the effect of this both on Australian industries through the alleged extraordinary increase in the amount of  such imports and upon the finances of the country.- I replied that I regarded the matter as one of very great importance, and I would bring the request of the deputation, together with the facts put before me, under the notice of Cabinet. Expressing my own opinion, I said that I thought the deputation had made out a very strong case for regulation of the importation of luxuries during war time. In accordance with my promise, I brought the matter before the Cabinet, who regarded it as most important. In the course of discussion Ministers saw how intricate the ramifications of the proposal are. It affects, for example, very intimately the finances of the country, as regards both the receipts of the Treasury and the ability of the nation to bear the heavy burdens now imposed by war taxation and war loans. It is obvious on the face of_ it that to send money out of this country and out of the Empire at a time when every atom of wealth is essential, is a suicidal policy. It was considered that a <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> case was' established for the . restriction or regulation of imports from countries outside the Empire. . Such a policy seems to be dictated both by common prudence and the circumstances in which we now find ourselves. The facts to which the deputation directed my attention clearly involved the ability of the people to contribute to those further war loans' that are inevitable if the war continues. The financial position is now very serious in regard to every one of the States. That market which formerly was open to us for war loans is now closed, practically, and any policy which has a tendency to restrict unnecessary expenditure will necessarily make available wealth that otherwise would possibly find its way out of the country as payment for luxuries imported from places outside the Empire. The Government have considered the matter from the point of -view put forward by the honorable member for Grampians and his deputation, and "have decided that, as a general policy, it is favorable to the regulation of imports. We are now considering to who: extent and in what way we can give effect to that policy, so that we may keep the wealth of the country within the country and the Empire, make available for loan and other purposes money which otherwise would be dissipated in unnecessary expenditure, and, at the same time, encourage, as far as is humanly possible, the industries of Australia, and increase the opportunities of employment for our own citizens. With these objects in view, the Government are now considering the policy of regulating imports. It will be generally admitted that we cannot run amok, or proceed without due care in a matter so complex and difficult. Every item to be dealt with must be closely scrutinized. However, I have indicated the policy of the Government, effect to which will be given straightway. </para>

I will hand to the Prime Minister, privately, a list of the articles which I think may be dealt with as I suggest, but I will not name them, because I think it is better that the Government should evolve their own list, and not be able to say that certain articles appear on it at the request of somebody outside the Government. </para>

                            <para>- The Government will do that. The circumstances in which  we  are now placed give a very wide meaning to the term luxuries. The responsibility is thrown upon the Government of promoting the welfare of this country, without which it is impossible that Australia can do its utmost in the war, and clearly the encouragement of industry is one of the means by which that can be most effectively assured. I am glad that the honorable member for Yarra has not mentioned any particular item. To have done so would have been improper, and the Government would have been at once confronted with a host of objections. I can only assure the House that the general policy of the Government does not stop short at what are termed luxuries, but contemplates a regulation which, while not being general and sweeping, will have the effect of achieving the ends I have mentioned. </para>

                                <para>- I do not know who these people are, or what the honorable member has in his mind; but one cannot have an omelette without breaking eggs. There is, or there is not, a policy in this country in regard to Australian industries ; there is, or is not, a war ; and there is, or is not, an imperative demand for money. The honorable member admits, I assume, all these things. All these facts being admitted, the Government has, obviously, to take some action; but we shall have regard to the position of every person. We are not going to benefit A to injure B, C, and D. That would be the act of a fool. If by prohibiting the importation of luxuries we gave employment to ten people and threw 250 out of work, of what avail would that be? We must have regard for the general welfare of the community. Since the honorable member has put this question to me, let me invite the House to consider for a moment the use of silks, so-called. Nowadays, I suppose there is hardly a woman in any class who does not wear silken garments of some sort. It is well known that thousands of people in Australia are employed in making up such garments'. If we prohibit the importation of that material, and throw those people out of work, we must do something for them. And that is why I say that the question is difficult and complex. When the honorable member for Maribyrnong asked me a question in regard to a certain list, I had to point out that before completing such a list it was necessary to look into the whole question and to see that we did not do incalculably more harm than good. </para>

                        <para>- I am quite sure that there is no law in the country that prevents the statement by any member of Parliament of anything he chooses to say, except the Standing Orders and that good sense and restraint which honorable members choose to impose upon themselves. The publication of such statements is in a different category, and if any honorable gentlemen choose to so abuse the position they occupy as tribunes of the people as to class in the same category the King of England and the Emperor of Germany at a time when England and Germany are locked in a life and death struggle, not for the preservation of monarchy, but for the preservation of liberty, I take it that this House and this country do not expect that the law shall distinguish between persons, whoever they may be. I do not know what can be done with regard to what has been said by an honorable gentleman in another place. I can only say that the statement seems to me obviously cheap, insincere, inexcusable abuse, meaning nothing, and utterly incompatible with the oath the honorable gentleman has taken in order to draw the money upon which he lives. A man who comes to Parliament and takes the oath of allegiance to the King, and after eating his Majesty's salt makes statements of that kind, is not even fit to be guillotined. </para>

                    <para>- The honorable member for Macquarie yesterday charged me with having made treasonable utterances, and he alluded to an address I had delivered at a certain place. At no time in my life have I ever given expression to any words that could be truthfully called treason. </para>

                    <para>- I have already tried to make it clear to the House that the effect of the proposed payment would be to put the farmer in each State on a level. That being so, in some of the States the farmer will get more from this next instalment than in others. It will depend upon whether he has, or has not, paid the freight and handling charges. Where he has, he will receive the full amount; where he has not, then of course the amount of the freight and handling charges will be de ducted. In short, the answer is that those farmers who have already paid these charges 'will not have to pay .them again, but will receive the full amount, and without the deduction to be made in the case of the other men. The net result will be that the farmers in all States will, when this instalment has been paid, have received the same amount of money for their 1915-16 wheat. </para>

                        <para>- The position of the fruit industry, and of 'the apple industry in particular, has much improved since I last spoke on the question. There have been since then two large shipments which have materially relieved the position. I can hold out very little hope of those shipments being continued, but it is not anticipated that the quantity of apples left in Australia will be more than can be consumed here, now that we have prohibited the importation of American apples. In any case the Government will take such steps as will have the effect of minimizing, if not entirely eliminating, any loss that may fall on the grower. </para>

None of us is familiar enough witE' the Russian situation to know precisely what is 'the meaning of this most dramatic and most amazing episode. In the history not only of this war, but of the civilized world, there never has been a revolution so complete, so far-reaching. At one stroke a great figure has disappeared, and what is more to the point, the whole bureaucracy - the governing class of Russia - has disappeared. The Duma, which was yesterday dismissed at will, the sport of this or that official appointed by the Czar, is now the ruler. Whether that is an omen of good or evil depends entirely, in my opinion, on the nature of the forces that are directing this revolution. I confess I do not know, and a man would be a fool to stand here and dogmatize about it. But if it means that Russia is going to pull out of this war- </para>

It would appear that in this case " even the ranks of Tuscany could scarce forbear to cheer." The Prime Minister's action, however, should be carried a little further. Where public documents are published without authority before they have been received by the Governor-General, or dealt with by the Government, some decisive action should be taken. Every honorable member will agree with me that the receiver is worse than the thief; that the bribery is worse than the bribed, and that the person benefited by a wrong act should be punished when the individual guilty of that wrong act is also punished. Throughout my life my sympathy has generally gone out to the under-dog, and while I compliment the Government for the action they have taken in regard to the premature publication of the report of the Federal Capital Commission, I have something further to propose.

The honorable member on rising intimated that he rose to a question of privilege, and before doing so he handed to the  Clerk  a copy of a motion with which he proposed to conclude his speech. Before I give a ruling, it would, perhaps, be as well to read the motion with which the honorable member proposes to conclude his remarks. It is as follows : - </para>

In <inline font-style="italic">May,</inline> on which we are bound to rely, we find it clearly laid down, in the 11th edition, page 272, that if a question of privilege is raised it must be in connexion with something affecting the House or members of the House.

It affects departmental administration; and, in regard to it, the Government may or may not take action.

It is perfectly clear that no one can rise to a question of privilege unless he concludes his remarks with a motion. The honorable member for Melbourne was courteous enough to supply me with a copy of his proposed motion, and, therefore, I knew exactly what it was he intended to propose. It became my duty to satisfy myself whether or not the motion came within the definition of " privilege," and on that point I have given my ruling. Of course, if the honorable member desires, he can take the sense of the House as to whether my ruling is correct. </para>

                        <para>A number of eases have arisen in which refunds are demanded by the Pay Office from soldiers returned from overseas, because of overpayments, either alleged or actual, made to them. Will the Minister representing the Minister for Defence have inquiries made as to whether this hardship to returned soldiers cannot be in some way obviated, and whether the Pay Office cannot be made more directly responsible for any mistakes of the kind made in the future? </para>

                        <para>In many cases the overpayments are due to the fact that advice from abroad regarding casualties affecting soldiers' pay is not received until after the "overpayments" have been made.

                        <para>- There is one class of over-payment to which the reply makes no reference, but which I find fairly numerous. When non-commissioned officers go with reinforcements they lose their rank on joining their unit. Under present conditions, when a man loses his rank, the fact is not always notified to the Pay Office, or, if it is, it is not acted upon, with the result that the men and their dependants are paid more than, under the regulation, they ought to be paid. In such cases I desire the Department to stir up its officers, so that hardship will not result to these men and their dependants on suddenly finding themselves, through no fault of their own, called upon to repay large amounts. I ask the Minister to take the matter into his consideration, because it was these cases that caused me to ask the original question, in the hope of securing some alleviation of the present conditions. </para>

We are very desirous of encouraging industries, and developing the resources of Australia, and the Government will give the most earnest consideration to the matter referred to in the question. It is perfectly clear that the mere discovery of oil, unless in payable quantities, would be of very little value, while, of  course, the discovery of oil in payable and great quantities would practically revolutionize our industrial outlook. </para>

Since the control of External Affairs has been handed over to me the matter has been dealt with by the Minister for Home and Territories, so that I am not closely acquainted with the details. If the prospects are as I have been led to believe they are, there should be a very hopeful outlook for the oil industry in Papua, and the Government will do all they can to develop it. </para>

                        <para>- With reference to the question asked in this House on Tuesday last by the honorable member for Maranoa as to whether my attention has been drawn to the fact that, in numerous post-offices throughout Australia, as the result of juniors being called upon to handle the allotment pay of soldiers who have gone to the front, the Treasury was being defrauded of considerable sums, and whether I would take action to protect the Treasury by seeing that these junior officers were not required to deal with such matters, I desire to state that I have had inquiries made, and find that there is no trace of any papers in the Treasury regarding the matter. It is understood that nothing is known of it by the Auditor-General or the Postmaster-General's Department. The Postmaster-General's Department received a somewhat similar complaint, signed "James Lowe, Moonee Ponds." Inquiries made by the Postmaster-General's Department and the Police Department failed to discover any such person. </para>

Certainly they have no hold over the Newnes companies, which carry on the largest shale-mining operations in the Commonwealth. The object of the Commonwealth is the encouragement of industry and the development of our resources, as well as the discouragement of German control of our industries, no matter whether they are carried on under English or any other names. </para>

                        - I would like to know from the Prime Minister whether there is any truth in the rumours that are abroad that there is a possibility that Australia may have to abandon the White Australia policy? It is said by some people that, owing to certain coloured races having taken part with the Allies at the front, it will be no longer possible for Australia to maintain this policy, and I would like to know if the Government intends to re-establish the Pacific Islands kanaka trade?

                    <para>. - It will be remembered that when we were in Committee the Minister for Home and Territories moved an amendment in clause 5 enabling munition workers, who were under agreement with the Commonwealth for service outside Australia, to exercise their franchise overseas exactly as our soldiers will do. The Senate has inserted after the word " munition " the words " or other," so that the clause as amended by it will provide that, munition or other workers under agreement with the Commonwealth for service overseas will be entitled to the same privilege in this respect as our soldiers abroad. This, I think, is a reasonable amendment, to which we should agree. I move - </para>

                <para>As the House will not meet again during its present lease of life, I desire to tender to the officers of the House our high appreciation of the manner in which they have carried out their duties. Happily for us, ever since the institution of this Parliament we have been admirably served. To those who sit at the table and take down, for the purposes of the official record of our debates, the words of wisdom which fall from our lips we owe so much that no effort of mine could do adequate justice to their services. I know very well that with whatever feelings we may approach the contest, they, without doubt, come to it with feelings of undiluted joy. We owe very much to them, and although they "take us down " in one sense, they certainly do not do it in another. I personally owe them very much, and am very grateful. </para>
                <para>There is another matter about which I should like to speak, and that is the illness of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> who has exercised the functions of his high office with distinction and credit. Until this cloud darkened the political heavens he was a friend and colleague of mine of many years' standing, and both as a friend and as the Presiding Officer of this House, where the representatives of the people sit, I do most sincerely regret his illness, and trust that it will be only of short duration. </para>
                <para>To you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker,</inline> I may express the sense of satisfaction that it has been to the House that during <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker's</inline> absence you, having been called upon to take up his- duties, have done so in so capable a manner. It must relieve <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> to know that during his absence, one so well calculated as you are to fill his place has been found. </para>
                <para>I shall not say anything as to what is before us, because it is one of those things that mere words cannot adequately portray. Honorable members opposite know me well enough to feel assured that, personally, there is not one of them to whom I do not wish well; but, politically, of course, I consign them to Hades with that thorough sense of fitness which characterizes me. 'I could have wished - I am sure we all could have wished - that this cup had. passed from us; but it cannot be. Parliament, as it is, is unworkable. We must go to the people ; and obtain from them that verdict which will enable those who receive it to carry on the business of the country in a way that the circumstances demand. We are not to settle our business in the way they have settled theirs in Russia. We are to go to the people, and they are to decide who is to govern this country. </para>

                    <para>.-. I join with the Prime Minister in his expressions of gratitude to the officers of the House for the manner in which they have carried out their duties, and also in the sympathy that he has extended to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> in his illness. The general public can have no true conception of the strain which the Speakership entails upon the holder of that office. I do not know why it is that this House is so different from the Senate, which in my time at least as a <inline font-weight="bold">Senator certainly</inline> had a very serene atmosphere. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> is very highly strung, and his -extreme desire to carry out his duties in an impartial and conscientious manner' has no doubt affected his health very greatly.. We all hope he may be rapidly restored to health, and that he will long grace the Chair in this House, no matter what party may be returned to power. I would also express the thanks of this House to the gentlemen of the press, who must often feel bored in having to listen to our well-meant efforts to do our duty tothecountry. </para>

                        <para>- The difference between the position of the representatives of the press and that of the honorable member for Henty is that while they have to sit here hour after hour there is no obligation on the part of the honorable member to remain in the chamber during the delivery of an uninteresting speech. It is usual at the breaking up of the House of the. Representatives for the Prime Minister to indulge in a series of: complimentary remarks, but I am glad, and I appreciate the fact, that the right honorable gentleman has not followed the practice oh this occasion. I agree that personally, and generally speaking, . we have no animosity towards each other; but in the contest between the two great parties in the Commonwealth it is impossible for us to fall on each other's necks in friendship. I wish there were some method by which we could pension off our friends opposite, and allow honorable members on this side to run the country; though, at the same time, I am quite in accord with the opinion that the absence of a strong Opposition is not in the public interests. We are now going before our masters, the people, by whom our fate will be decided. I sincerely hope that honorable members opposite may be defeated, and that we on this side will be returned to power to carry out the policy that we believe to be in the interests of this great Commonwealth. At the same time, I realize that it would be a very bad thing for the country if honorable members opposite were not returned at all; and all I desire for myself and colleagues is a sufficient majority to enable us to realize our policy, with, perhaps, some ten or a dozen of the best amongst honorable members opposite to ably and eloquently state the policy of the Liberal party. I should like to express high sentiments of benevolence and generosity; but there is great difficulty in doing so, for I feel that it would be very much in the nature of the bow of the duellists of old. No doubt the forthcoming contest will be bitter, and I hope every effort will be made to conduct it in as gentlemanly a manner; as possible, so that when we return, those of us who do will be able to forget our personal differences in the interest of this great Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>. - There are just two matters I should like to bring under the notice of the Government before the House rises. I know that this is an expiring Parliament, and that the Government may be an expiring Ministry, but my requests are pertinent and urgent. I am rather sorry that the Prime Minister has left the chamber, for I hope to present a deputation to him shortly in relation to the procuring of tramway rails for several tramway trusts in and around the city of Melbourne. The money is available, and it is only the shortage of rails that is holding up the work and keeping large numbers of people out of employment. These rails are required by the tramways trusts of Footscray, Northcote, Preston, Fitzroy, and Hawthorn. </para>

                        <para>- I am preferring a request in the interests of large numbers of people who are out of work, and I can only hope that the honorable member for Grey is as anxious as I am in this regard. The Tramway Trusts are composed of members of municipal councils and other prominent citizens; and the deputation of which I have spoken will seek to impress on the Prime Minister the necessity of pressing forward the manufacture of steel rails in Australia, so that we may not experience this lamentable shortage in the future. Of course, I know that the matter is full of difficulty, for it is said that Russia has made a request to Australia for steel rails, and there is a shortage everywhere. The other matter to which I desire to refer is connected with the premature publication of the report of the Royal Commissioner on the Federal Capital works. I should like to make it clear that I do not know <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Quinn</inline> myself, and that I have not been approached by that gentleman or any of his friends ; but in the trouble <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Quinn</inline> has fallen by the way. I think, from the words which fell from the Prime Minister yesterday, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Quinn</inline> had no intention of divulging any secrets, and that he acted quite innocently. </para>

This, I am sure, would be very acceptable to the men, and as there are plenty of blankets available the matter has only to be mentioned to be attended to. </para>
