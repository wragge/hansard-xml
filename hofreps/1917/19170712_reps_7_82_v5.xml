                        <para>- I ask the Postmaster-General whether, notwithstanding his fever for <inline font-style="italic">economy,</inline> he can see his way to abolish the practice of reducing the size of telegrams to the dimensions of 11/2 inches by 1 inch, and whether he cannot provide a clean, cheap envelope for enclosing the messages ? My telegrams come to me in a dirty condition out of the pockets of the telegraph boys, where they have, apparently, been in close proximity with string, tops, and other articles of boyish enjoyment. But I have ascertained that very serviceable envelopes can be bought wholesale for about 3s. 6d. a thousand. I ask the Minister whether he can see his way to increase the expenditure of the Department by the use of such envelopes ? </para>

The same opportunities will be given to the State&#39; of Tasmania as are afforded to any other State. In this matter, I do not wish to anticipate what I propose to say later on in regard to shipbuilding. I may add that the Labour organizations of Tasmania should have been represented at a congress which took place recently, and sat for several days. &#39;That they were not is entirely their own fault, and not mine. </para>

                        <para>- In reply to the honorable member&#39;s question, I have to say that this question was carefully inquired into by a conference comprised of men representing the agricultural societies, racing clubs, and remount! authorities, who advised that a comprehensive scheme of horse-breeding should be formulated in order to raise the standard generally of horses throughout Australia, and thereby increase the economic wealth of the country and put the horse supply for military requirements in a satisfactory condition. The advice of the Grown Law authorities is being sought as to the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth to adequately deal with certain of the recommendations of the conference. Certain action recommended to be taken by State authorities has been referred for the consideration of the several State Governements. One of the recommendations was the establishment of an experimental stud, and the mares for this are now being selected and three stallions have, already been obtained. </para>

                            <para>.- As  honorable  members know, it is  a time-honoured  practice to indulge in.  a  rather lengthy debate on the Address-in-Reply, particularly when honorable members have come back from an election. On this occasion, however, so far as the Opposition is concerned, we desire to allow  the  Government, which was elected  as a  Win-the-war Government, to bring forward the measures they no doubt have prepared, so that the people may have  an  opportunity of judging whether Ministers are able to make good their professions  on  the public platform. Before resuming  my  seat I desire to compliment the mover  and  seconder of the Address-in-Reply. We  are  anxious to get on with the business,  and to  see the Bills foreshadowed in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech. </para>

I desire to know whether, if leave be granted, honorable members will be precluded from making any remarks on the subjects dealt with in the statement of the Prime Minister? The right honorable gentleman had an opportunity to make his statement on the Address-in-Reply ; and it would appear that he is taking this opportunity, and in such a way, that no other honorable members will be able to discuss the questions he deals with; and unless we have some opportunity of discussing the matter I object. </para>

                    <para>. - The statement I wish to make amounts to a .mere capitulation of facts, and will be very brief. I desire first of all to address myself to the sugar question. - The Commonwealth has entered into an agreement&#39; with the State of Queensland - the main points of which are perfectly well known to this House and the country - under which the Commonwealth has to take from Queensland all sugar produced within that State at a price of &#163;21 per ton, 94 per cent, titre. The agreement is for a term of twelve months, and postulates certain fixed conditions obtaining during its currency. They are that the price shall&#39; be <inline font-style="italic">&#163;21</inline> per ton, that the wages, and conditions of labour shall be as prescribed by the tribunal which gave its award before the agreement: was entered into, and that refined sugar shall be sold to the public at 3&#163;d. per lb. The honorable member for Indi mentioned yesterday the effect of the agreement upon manufacturers, especially manufacturers for export. I wish to announce that the Government have made an arrangement which will enable manufacturers for export to obtain sugar at the same price as they paid last year; so that their position in that respect&#39; is in no wise altered. Honorable members know that the practice in regard to export has been to grant a rebate equivalent to the amount of the import duty. That, however, was varied during recent years, the rebate being fixed at an arbitrary amount of &#163;4, which was the mean of the import duties spread over foreign sugar, plus&#34; home-grown sugar used for export purposes. It is on this basis the present arrangement has been made. Jam manufacturers therefore will enter upon the forthcoming season in exactly the same position as they occupied last year. I shall explain later precisely how this will affect the Commonwealth in relation to its agreement with Queensland. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I desire now to make a statement with regard to the wool clip. As honorable members know, the greater part of last season&#39;s wool clip was sold to the British Government at a flat rate of 15&#163;d. per lb., plus 50 per cent, of the profit, if any, on such of the wool as was sold for other than military purposes.  That  arrangement has been satisfactory, and although I am not in a position now to announce definitely how much money will be returned to the pastoralists, I wish to announce, in order to remove a misapprehension that is in the minds of many wool-growers, that 10 per cent, will be paid on a day to be fixed next month. In regard to the new season&#39;s clip, honorable members who have given the matter any thought must have realized that unless we had succeeded in financing the next clip Australia would have been faced with a position of financial chaos, if not disaster, and that the disposal of the clip has been a matter of very serious concern to the Government. I am glad to be able to announce that the Government have now completed arrangements with the British Government under which the latter will take the whole of the Australian merino and cross-bred clip at the same price and upon the same conditions as last&#39; season&#39;s clip. I think the pastoralists of the Commonwealth are to be congratulated on that arrangement. </para>
                <para>There is one other matter of the utmost possible importance to which I wish to  refer, and I can deal with it only in the broadest possible outline. I refer to the position of the Commonwealth in regard to the export of its products overseas. Honorable members are aware that Germany is relying for victory in this war upon its submarine campaign, and it is idle to deny the gravity of the position arising therefrom. The losses of vessels are very great, and are not limitsd even by the sufficiently startling&#39; returns which we read each week. The campaign has other effects than the sending of vessels to the bottom of the ocean, amongst others, it deters a very large percentage of neutral tonnage from venturing out of port. The effects of the submarine campaign upon this country are most serious. I shall mention but one instance, which, if the people will consider it, will bring home to them, perhaps, better than anything else can do, what war means to the economic and industrial welfare of this country. One of the terms of the contract made between the Commonwealth and the British Government was that the latter should move 600,000 tons of wheat per month from Australia. During the month of June, not one bushel of wheat was shipped from this country to Britain. Were I to speak for hours, it would be impossible to conjure up a picture more striking than is limned by this bald statement, viewed in its proper perspective. The need for shipping grows with each passing day. Our products are heaping up here in Australia because of the damming of the channels along* which they formerly found their way to market. Happily, there is a prospect of our being able to ship a not insignificant quantity by way of America. The Government is endeavouring to marshal its resources for the transport of wheat, flour, and such other products as are now permitted to enter Great Britain for shipment to the western -coast of America, to be taken thence overland to the Atlantic, and so to Great Britain. We hope in that way to make much better use of our shipping,&#39; as each vessel will have a shorter mileage to steam per ton of produce carried, and the utility of the fleet at our disposal will be very substantially increased. This, however, will relieve the position only to a relatively small degree, and the realization of the . fact has compelled the , Government to attack the problem of ship- building in deadly earnest. We know that even under the most favorable conditions the quantity of shipping that can be constructed in Australia will be but a small part of what is needed to transport our products. But we believe that with the hearty co-operation of labour, and the adoption of those methods by which alone modern industry can succeed, we may within a reasonable time add materially to the tonnage at our disposal. The result of a conference with the representatives of fifty-two branches of organized labour interested in this project has been most gratifying. We have been met in a spirit which leaves nothing to be desired. The Government asked, as a basis for the establishment of shipbuilding, guarantees for  (1)  the continuity of industrial operations,  (2)  the dilution of labour, and (3) the adoption of piece-work under certain conditions. After long discussions, affording ample opportunity for careful consideration of the position, after the remission of questions to the unions, and the making of further explanations, so that each particular point was hammered out in detail, the conference- yesterday carried the following resolution : - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>That this conference, after hearing the Prime Minister&#39;s reply to the reports and decisions of the unions on the questions submitted, and while respecting the unions&#39; decisions thereon, is strongly of the opinion that the best interests of the unions concerned would be served by adopting the proposals of the Government. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">The conference has now disbanded. The delegates are returning to their unions, determined to recommend the adoption of the proposals of the Government, and in anticipation of their recommendation being accepted, we shall take all steps necessary for the immediate launching of the enterprise. The acceptance by the unions of the proposals of the Government will, however, be a condition precedent, lacking which nothing will be done. The material that will be used in the building of the ships will, with very few exceptions, be produced and manufactured in this country, so that the industry will be purely Australian. I do not wish to create the impression that this is the only or the final solution of the question. The Government realizes that upon the maintenance of a steady stream of products to Great Britain must for many months depend the safety of that country, and will  exhaust every means at its disposal to insure an adequate supply of tonnage. The British Ministers, living in the very maelstrom of war, are doing their best, notwithstanding the avalanche of criticism directed against them by men who have not their tremendous responsibilities. They have shown a strong desire to help Australia, and a keen sense of appreciation of our efforts to co-operate with them. </para>
                <para>By the purchase of our wool clip, our financial and industrial situation has been enormously relieved. The financial position of the Commonwealth would have bordered upon the impossible without the &#163;40,000,000 that has been paid by the British Government for our wool. As far as I can see, however, there is no solution of the difficulty of exporting beef and mutton. There is a solution - though it may not be altogether satisfactory - for the difficulty of the fruit-growers. The local market will consume a fair quantity of the fresh1 fruit produced, and there is a possibility of preserving the rest. But we can hardly hope to find refrigerated tonnage for our normal quantity of export meat, while our cool storage depots are already full to the brim. The contract that we made with the British Government for the export of rabbits is thus brought, temporarily, at all events, to an end. We cannot put&#39; any more meat into cold storage, and what is now there will be taken out so slowly that the pastoralists must for some time maintain their flocks and herds upon the hoof. The wool having been sold, I do not know that the growers of sheep need be cast down by the prospect, though the situation of the cattle men is, of course, different. Insulated tonnage is scarce at the best of times, and has now become as rare as diamonds. It may be that the compulsory increase of our flocks and herds will prove to be of very great advantage to Australia. </para>
                <para>There is accumulated in this country cargo sufficient for fifteen refrigerated steamers and 548 general cargo steamers, and the number of vessels available to lift it is to that almost as a mole hill to Mount Everest. These facts illustrate our dependence on the Empire for our economic, financial, and national existence, and, at the same time, go to show better than anything else how Australia can help to win the war. They show, too, how helpless Australia is by herself to do anything, even to exist. There are things about which we may not speak, dangers grave beyond the power of words to express, but these things . about which we can speak show clearly what .the war means to us, and how necessary it is that all sorts and conditions of men in Australia, employers and employees, rich and poor alike, should adjust themselves to their present environment, so that each man may do his duty. </para>
                <para>The honorable member for Corangamite asked me if there is any chance of getting cheese away. My slumbers are disturbed nightly by just such questions as that. Is there any chance for exporting wine, eucalyptus, mutton, and many other things? I can only repeat that while the number &#39;of genera&#93; cargo-carrying steamers is severely limited, the number of those possessing insulated space has come down almost to zero. What I have said is not to bp regarded by the pastoralists or others as the final and irrevocable determination of the problem. It is a statement of the present position, which is growing worse every day. America is making heroic efforts, as Great Britain has been doing all along, to meet with construction of shipping the destruction of the Hun. But it requires no specialized knowledge to understand that it is easier to destroy than to build up, and that those engaged in the work of destruction start with a tremendous advantage in their favour. And the situation must grow gradually worse. We can only face the position with resolution, do what is possible to ease it, and pray that on sea and on land our Forces may soon press home their attack and snatch victory from the palsied hands of the foe. </para>
                <para>Another matter to which I wish to refer relates to the question of the storage of those products which we are not able to transport oversea. In normal seasons, during the month of July all &#39; the wool stores are empty. The position to-day is quite different. There are hundreds of thousands of bales of wool now in the stores, and next month the new clip will begin to trickle in, and from then on the new storehouses which we have secured will become full, and more than full, of the new wool. This problem, however, is a comparatively minor one when  compared with the problem that faces us with regard to wheat. That is much more urgent and difficult. By next February, unless there is an outlet found other than those we can see now, we shall have 6,000,000. tons of wheat in Australia. Tomorrow I am to meet the State Premiers in order to finally arrange the details of a wheat storage scheme. I hope that the matter will be settled to-morrow, so that a system of silage construction may be begun without delay. It is a matter of extreme urgency, and should not be delayed in any circumstances. </para>
                <para>I have not had an opportunity of discussing with the Tasmanian representatives the proposition for drying apples, but the Government have called a conference of fruit-growers, which will meet during this month, with a view to organizing the fruit industry on such a basis as will enable it to dispose of its product to the best possible advantage during &#39;the coming season. The conference will consider the possibilities of marketing fresh fruit throughout Australia. We shall endeavour by judicious organization to get every fruit-grower the best possible price for his product of fresh fruit by preventing irregular competition between one grower and another and the cutting of one another&#39;s throat. An endeavour will also be made to deal with such fruit as cannot be so marketed by drying, canning, and by jam making. In this connexion I was very pleased to be able to announce, as I did at the beginning of my speech, that arrangements have been made whereby sugar can be obtained at such a price as will enable the manufacturers in this country to compete with those in other countries in the matter of export trade. </para>

I, therefore, suggest that it direct its attention to the question, in order that I may be armed with the best advice and counsel when I meet the Premiers, and so that I may get the job settled. If honorable members have anything of a useful nature to say in connexion with any of the matters upon which I have touched, I hope they will take this opportunity to say it, so that the Government may have the fullest advice on these matters. </para>

On this occasion, as on many others, the sitting was suspended at the request of the Prime Minister, and such a request, in the circumstances, is not usually refused by the House. </para>

By way of illustration, I would remind honorable members that there is no standing order providing for the luncheon and dinner adjournments, but the chair is automatically vacated when the usual hour arrives. </para>

                        <para>. - We occupy to-night a somewhat extraordinary position, since we are inviting honorable members to agree to the Estimates and pass an appropriation Bill in respect of the financial year which has just closed. This is my first experience of the kind, but the course we are proposing must betaken in order to conform to the requirement that an Appropriation Bill covering the Estimates in chief for the whole year shall be approved by Parliament.. During the financial year 1916-1917, to which these Estimates relate, we had a number of Supply Bills. Three different Treasurers have asked the House to deal with such measures during the twelve months, and every penny of expenditure for which these Estimates provide has already been voted. That being so, although honorable members may avail themselves of this opportunity to discuss any question of importance relating to these Estimates, I would remind them that they have had such an opportunity on at least four or five different occasions during the financial year, when Supply Bills have been submitted. </para>

                            <para>- There are no adjustments to make. The whole of the revenue and expenditure has been dealt with, and the moneys have all been spent with the full authority of Parliament. Interim financial statements having reference to the year just closed were put before honorable members on the 6th March, 14th June, and 11thinst. The Budget papers have also been presented, and as the end of the financial year was upon us before we passed the last Supply Bill, information given to honorable members has been much more complete and up-to-date than that relating to any other financial period of which I have any knowledge. In these circumstances, and since we have had at various times a good deal of discussion regarding the expenditure for the financial year to which these Estimates relate, I think it would be wise for honorable members to reserve their criticism for future proposals rather than to discuss finances that have already been dealt with. With these few observations I believe I shall be doing what is right, and what is in accord with the wishes of the Committee, by simply moving - That the Estimates be agreed to. </para>

                        <para>.- I desire to enter my protest against the way in which the Estimates are being and have been dealt with by this Parliament for several years past. It seems to me that to bring down the Estimates for the consideration of honorable members after the financial year covered by them has closed, and, as in this case, after the Parliament responsible for them has actually expired, is a very loose way  of  transacting public business. We are supposed to be the custodians of the public purse. </para>

                            <para>- I am not dealing with any particular Government in this case, but I hold that, as custodians of the public purse, we certainly ought to have some control over the expenditure  of  the Commonwealth. Under the loose system  which we are following, the Government of the day, and not members of Parliament generally, have complete control over the finances. Private members have very little opportunity to take exception to any proposed expenditure, or to make any proposition in the direction of economy. I am not directing my remarks particularly against the present Administration, since they have only recently come into office, but this objectionable practice is becoming more and more pronounced, and I wish to know what we, as representative men, are going to do. Are we going to allow this practice to continue, or do we intend to assert our rights, and to insist upon the Estimates being dealt with at the proper time? </para>

In that case they were submitted in good time. The Estimates for the financial year beginning on 1st July, 1907, were submitted en 8th August, 1907; those for 1908 on the 14th October, 1908 ; those for 1909 on the 12th August of that year; those for 1910 on the 7th September of that year; those for 3911 on 26th October of that year; and the Estimates for 1912 on 1st August, 1912. The Estimates for the financial year beginning 1st July, 1913, were not dealt with until 2nd October of that year; and those for 1914 were dealt with on 3rd December - when practically six months of the year to which they related had expired. The Estimates for the year beginning 1st July, 1915, were dealt with on 9th May, 1916, or only a month before the expiration of the financial year; while the Estimates for 1916-17 are being dealt with to-night, after the financial year to which they relate has actually closed. The whole of the expenditure for which they provide has been made without Parliament being afforded an opportunity to discuss it. It may be said that this delay was in consequence of the war- </para>

                            <para>- I believe that the Treasurer will make an effort in the direction I have indicated, but I am going to enter my protest lest he should be tempted to continue this very objectionable practice. Since the outbreak of war in 1914, there might have been some legitimate excuse for delay in dealing with the Defence&#39; Estimates. We have been passing through abnormal times, so far as Defence expenditure is concerned; but- will any one say that the war is any justification for the failure of the House to deal with the Estimates of the ordinary Departments ? Such a contention cannot be substantiated. The Finance Committee has had before it the evidence of experts in connexion with this very matter, and has been told by them that the ideal system would be to deal with the Estimates in the first month of the year to which they relate. Under that system, Supply Bills would be unnecessary. These, experts told us that heads of Departments should be required to supply draft  Esti-mates  to the Treasurer not later than April in each year, so as to afford him opportunity to cub down where necessary, and to make what;- alterations are required between then and the end of June. If that practice were followed, there would be no need for Supply Bills, which, under the present system, are put before us every two or three months, and serve only to delay the transaction of public business. They also add materially to our printing bill. In these days, when iti is necessary to economize, I know of no place where economy could be practised with better results than in this very House. It is unfair that millions of pounds of public money should be expended without members of Parliament having a chance to make their voices heard as to what reductions should be made, and as to whether or not the votes asked for should be granted. I shall not take up &#39;the time of the Committee in dealing with this subject further, but I felt that I should be failing in my duty if I permitted these Estimates to be passed as a whole without entering my protest. If the Treasurer does not alter this state of affairs, he may expect to come in for some very severe criticism at the hands of honorable members on both sides. Members are just about tired  of having their rights whittled away in this .manner. It is the duty of the Treasurer of the day to submit his Estimates within a reasonable time, so that honorable members may have ample opportunity .to decide what is best in the interests of the country, from a financial point of view; and I hope that such a course will henceforth be followed. </para>

                            <para>- I withdraw the remark. I have been, as I say, seventeen years in this House, and I have seen Labour Governments, year after year, introduce Estimates that have previously passed through the Caucus. On such occasions every member of the Labour party has been practically gagged from saying anything against the proposals; and I have seen millions and millions of money passed with only one Minister present, and two or three honorable members behind him, while the rest were either in the billiard-room or playing bowls in the garden. Yet to-night we have &#34; Satan reproving sin,&#34; and laying down for the first time in his life wholesome  rules which should be observed by Treasurers. These are very good rules indeed ; some very good schemes have come from Satan; but at the same time we desire to know the source of the maxims that are placed before us. This afternoon we had a homily from the honorable member for Cook on a variety of things, and the Government were ridiculed for not having any business to put before the House. This was the result of what I shall not call a trick, but a piece of legerdemain, which no doubt honorable members opposite thought very brilliant. The idea was to put the Ministry in a difficulty in consequence of their having no legislation to submit; and it was simply a well-conceived piece of very transparent conjuring. The Government very naturally thought that when the Address-in-Reply was before us honorable members opposite would have the courage to say in the House what they had been telling the people outside. However, not one of them has had that courage or stood up to say one word against the Government or their policy ; their sole idea was, by this little ruse, to put the Government in a difficulty before the public. The Ministry was perfectly justified in assuming that the Labour party would, as it always has done, waste three or four weeks in criticising the Government) of the day. Now I suppose honorable members opposite imagine that they will be able to say to the people in the parks on Sunday,  &#34; See what the Government have done; we have brought them to a pass in which they have no business to put before us.&#34; As a member of some years&#39; standing, I think the Government were justified in assuming that the Labour party were going to waste time, as they have wasted it in previous sessions, over the Address-in-Reply. </para>

                    <para>Last night the Leader of the Opposition took occasion to charge me, as I have been charged for the last fifteen years, with not attending Parliament as regularly as he does himself. There is this distinction between the honorable gentleman and myself - that I live in another State and have occupations of other kinds than Parliament, whereas he has lived at the Seat of Government all his time, has made a profession of politics, and has nothing else te think about. That is my answer to the honorable member. I challenge him to compare my at tendance for many years with that of any Labour member from any State but Victoria. It ill-becomes the honorable member, who is supposed to set an example in courtesy as well as in politics, to the members of his own party, to harp on an old song of this sort which has really nothing in it, and only casts . reflection on himself, seeing that he lives within a couple of miles of Parliament House, and has made a business of politics for all these years. I repeat that I consider that the Government would be perfectly justified if they were to move the adjournment of the House for a fortnight. The measures they have intimated their intention to place before us, including one connected with shipbuilding, and another with repatriation, represent schemes that require a great deal of thought on the part of Ministers, and are open to much honest and candid criticism in the House. If the Government were to allow themselves to be misled by the transparent ruse attempted this afternoon, and were to bring forward any of their measures in a state so incoherent and unfinished as to lead to . greater trouble than would otherwise have to be met, they would lack political courage. </para>

                        <para>.- Apparently the honorable member for Parkes is very sore about what I said last night, and has apparently not slept well after the few well merited remarks I made regarding him. If the honorable member really feels very sore, I should not mind apologizing for what I said, but I do not think that he was justified in the remarks he made as to the members of the- Labour party playing billiards and bowls. I think that my record will bear inspection, not only for regular attendance here, but for attendance in the Chamber during the whole of the sittings. It is well known that the honorable member is the worst offender in this regard, and cares moro about earning fat fees at the Law Courts than he does about his parliamentary attendance. As a matter of fact, it took the honorable member all his time to win his selection, and he would not have won it but for the aid of the Minister for the Navy and the Ministerial telegrams sent on his behalf. And this is the man who presumes ito lecture this House! We all know, however, that he talks with his tongue in his cheek. He has the audacity to talk about my being supposed to teach my followers manners. When it comes to a question of manners, we, of course, look to the honorable member for Parkes. As to bowls and billiards, we know that the honorable member&#39;s favorite sport &#39; is to go fishing in golf stockings. I do not care what I said last night, because I think that be deserves it. It is true that I was not so fortunate in choosing my parents as was the honorable member, and I did not have the advantage of a university education, but, nevertheless, I think that! my public record will compare with his. If I have made a profession of politics, and, as he says, live on the game, I have given my constituents as good value as has any other member of this Parliament. That, however, is a matter about which I do not! boast, though I must say that it ill-becomes a gentleman, cultured though he claims to be, to start sneering at others as the honorable member has done to-night. However, we on this side are anxious to win the war. I should like to know what the honorable member for Parkes is anxious to do. I should say that, instead of being a member of the &#34; Win-the-war &#34; party he is really a member of the &#34; wagthejaw&#34; party. </para>

                    <para>If these Estimates are ready to-night, why were they not ready at a quarter-past. 3 this afternoon? -Is this business tonight an afterthought on the part of the Government? Ministers were supposed to be ready with win-the-war legislation, and yet they have to fall back on these Estimates, which every on&#169; knows could be passed in five minutes, as similar Estimates have been passed on other occasions. There is, of course, no objection to passing them, because every penny has been spent, and we can do nothing further with them now. Honorable members have said that this is the first, occasion upon which the step proposed tonight has been taken, but I think similar circumstances have arisen previously. The honorable member for Parkes will remember that in 1902 or 1903 we passed Estimates for the year ended the 30th June, 1901. That was on account of the exceptional circumstances arising out of the first Tariff debate, the session having lasted sixteen or seventeen months. So far as I am concerned, the Treasurer can have the Estimates without delay. I do not desire to hamper the Government in this respect. I am anxious to see the legislation that they propose for the purpose of winning the war, and when it is introduced I shall deal with it to the best of my ability. </para>

                        <para>. - The suggestion made by the honorable member for Henty last night and the honorable member for Hunter tonight is one that should commend itself to the attention of every member of the Committee. 1 have not been in Parliament as long as the Leader of the Opposition and the honorable member for Parkes, but if my memory serves me correctly every Commonwealth Government has .handled the Estimates in precisely the same way. The Estimates are kept back as long as possible, and generally about the last week in the session there is an all-night sitting, and honorable members are told that if they do not pass the Estimates and send them to the Senate before the next day the Senate will adjourn, and the public servants will not be able to get their money. We have an all-night sitting, and a few hours are allowed the Senate in which to pass the whole of the Estimates, and then we are invariably met with* the statement, &#34; What is the good of crying about matters now, when all the money has been spent, &#34; At this time every pound of expenditure should be carefully weighed. We know that there is an economic stress all over the world, and that it is worse than useless to expect to borrow money from England. It is not creditable on the. part of any Premier or Prime Minister to approach England for big loans at a time when the Mother Country has to finance practically the whole of the Allies, and I am sorry to read that one Australian Premier is in England to-day simply cadging for loans. A community like Australia should be ashamed to add to the difficulties of the financial situation in the Old Land. However, what is past is gone, and I do hope  that we shall have an opportunity of dealing with the next Estimates in a proper manner. This is not a matter which concerns any one particular party or member, and I hope that we shall have an adequate&#39; opportunity of dealing with all proposed expenditure in the same thorough fashion as would obtain in any business concern. To-day, if ever in the history of the Commonwealth, all details of expenditure should command the attention of honorable members. </para>

                    <para class="block">MATHEWS (Melbourne Ports) &#91;8.20&#93;. - I propose to say a few words about the Estimates for 1916-17, and if I were allowed to do so I should like to refer to those of 1914-15, because they included expenditure that had never been discussed by Parliament. First of all, I wish to reply to the &#39;flattering remarks made by the honorable member for Parkes. The honorable gentleman charged honorable members with playing billiards and bowls. He ought to have added that sometimes honorable members are seen in the bar. This is the first time that I have ever heard any honorable member speak of his fellow members in that fashion, and the remarks of the honorable member for Parkes reflect no credit upon him. A billiard table has a straight cushion, without any indentation to accommodate big stomachs; that is why he does not play billiards. And he cannot play bowls because he has not seen his feet for years. The remarks of the honorable member were not warranted. I always thought that he conducted his politics on a higher plane than such personalities, and I believe that he will apologize for what he has said. </para>
                    <para>The Estimates for 1916-17, like all others, are supposed to be a true reflection of the expenditure by the Government. As a matter of fact, they are not. We were told that the expenditure by the British Government on behalf of the Commonwealth for the maintenance and equipment of our troops at the Front was about &#163;33,000,000, of which we had repaid &#163;8,500,000, leaving nearly &#163;24,000,000 still owing. At a meeting recently I made a statement that the Commonwealth owed the British Government on this account. &#163;50,000,000 or &#163;60,000,000. </para>

                        <para>- I tell the right honorable gentleman most emphatically that he cannot prove correct his statement that the Commonwealth owes only &#163;23,500,000, to the British Government. The position of Australia in. regard to the Forces sent abroad is different from that of Canada. From the moment the Canadian Government places its troops on the transport until their return, the British Government pays the whole of the expenditure. Australia, on the other hand, enlists, trains, equips, and transports troops to the Old&#39; Country, maintains them there and at the Front, and for every article used, and every bullet and shell fired, the Australian people have to pay. We have been told that the cost of maintaining the soldier abroad is approximately 6s. a day. I ask honorable members to cast their minds back to the South African War, in which the British Government maintained in the field about 250,000 men. The whole of the manufacturing resources of the Mother Country were utilized at high pressure to produce commodities for the troops in Africa, and the greatest mercantile marine in the world was hard pressed, at a time when there were no enemy ships abroad, to transport those commodities. Yet when I asked the Assistant Minister for Defence what percentage of the material and equipment used by our troops was manufactured in Australia, he answered, &#34;Almost the whole of it.&#34; It is impossible for that statement to be correct. We have sent from Australia as many men as the British Government had in South Africa during the Boer War. And we know that there is not enough khaki manufactured in Australia to keep one division supplied. </para>

Therefore, we know that the expenditure by the British Government in connexion with Australia&#39;s representation at the Front, instead of being only &#163;33,000,000, as we have been told, may have been nearer &#163;130,000,000. </para>

Why are we not told the facts? When the honorable member for Capricornia was Treasurer, I asked him what was our indebtedness in this respect, and he said about &#163;8,000,000. That figure rose later to &#163;14,000,000. When the honorable member for Grey was Treasurer, I asked him the same question, and his answer was &#163;18,000,000; later, the figure rose to &#163;22,000,000. I ask the present Treasurer, and he does not know. The people of Australia should know exactly what have been our disbursements on account of the war up to the present time. Why do the Government keep the people in a fool&#39;s paradise ? For eight years after the South African War the Australian Governments were still repaying to the British Government money expended in their behalf during that campaign. </para>

                            <para>- I can assure the right honorable gentleman that since I have been in this House money has been voted in Australian Parliaments to recoup Britain for expenditure on Australian troops during the South African War. I mention this matter merely to illustrate my point that we do not get a true statement of the finances. General Anderson was intrusted by the Commonwealth Government with the responsibility of looking after the interests of Australia in England, and I do not suppose we could have sent a better man. I do not pretend to be able to assess how much we owe on account of the war, but common sense teaches me that the amount stated by the Treasurer does not nearly represent the expenditure incurred in our behalf. If we desire to have a true statement of expenditure, it is the duty of the Treasurer to cable to England for particulars. I am not charging the Treasurer or officials with remissness. I acknowledge the ability of the Treasury officials, and the interest that they take in the discharge of their duties, and I admit that the Treasurer possesses vast experience in financial administration. But he must know that we are not in possession of a statement of the expenditure made by the British Government on our behalf. </para>

I am aware that we cannot expect to obtain absolute accuracy, but we should be told as nearly as possible what is the amount of our indebtedness. </para>

Any member, whether a financial expert or not, has the right to ask for information of this kind in the interests of those whom he represents. I trust that, within the next fortnight, the Treasurer will endeavour to obtain from the British Government as near an account as possible of their expenditure on  behalf of our Forces. He will be remiss if he does not do that. </para>

                        <para>.- I understand that to-morrow a Conference is to consider the. erection of stores for the protection of wheat, and I ask the Treasurer to realize the desirableness of having this matter handled solely by the Commonwealth Government. There is afoot, 1 believe, a movement to enable the States to do the work separately and individually, but it would be regrettable if they were left to compete against each other for supplies, and if uniformity of method, which is&#39; desirable, were not attained. </para>

                        <para>. - Honorable members have been entertained this evening with complaints against the evil practice of deferring the consideration of Estimates, because this prevents members from devoting the vigilant attention to the Government expenditure which is necessary in the public interest. No doubt, the honorable member for Hunter was perfectly correct in what he said, but so long as I have had a seat in Parliament, here and in South Australia, it has been the practice to make these complaints, and I am tired and sick of hearing them. The delay this year has been due largely to the political circumstances which brought about the last election. It is often a difficult matter for Ministers to obtain Estimates from the Departments, and the preparation of Estimates is sometimes delayed because urgent political business is being pushed on by a Government for party purposes. </para>

                            <para>- I propose to suggest a remedy. Nothing much is to be gained by continual growling. What we need is a way out of the difficulty. Members know that now and again the consideration of Estimates will be held up for perhaps two days, merely to wring a promise from a Government, and that after such a &#34; stone wall &#34; millions have been voted in a few minutes. What is the use of holding up our hands in holy horror at the delay on the present occasion? Those who support a Government naturally support its Estimates, while an Opposition naturally debates every item in them, in order to delay public business. That is part of the political game, which is as old as the hills, and which, I suppose, will be continued in the future. Personally, I cannot see that anything is to be gained by holding up Estimates, except for the purpose of getting information regarding any particular item that may be challenged. This Government is pledged to do all it can to secure economical administration in the interests of the war, and I believe that Ministers intend to fulfil their promises. I remember an occasion on which a group of members supporting a State Government went to Ministers and said, &#34;You must reduce your Estimates to a certain sum, or we shall not support you.&#34; A Government will take more notice of action like that than of anything else. It is useless to complain about delay in the submission of Estimates if members are not prepared to take any practical step to secure  reform.  For twenty-five years <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Hume, in the House of Comm&#39;ons, did nothing but challenge the Estimates of the Government; but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Bright, who sat beside him, said that it was a useless waste of time. He was of the opinion that it was only by bringing pressure to bear directly on a Government that reform could be secured. It is for those who support a Government to see that the administration of affairs is sound and economical. I do not say that any demonstration is required at the present time. My object is to expose the humbug of the system of complaining ineffectually. In my opinion, the country does not suffer much from delay in the consideration of Estimates, though it does suffer when a party pledged to economy does not see that the Government gives effect to its policy. The responsibility is on the Ministerial supporters, rather than on the Government. As a former member of the Labour party, I know that the members of the Caucus never &#39;worried much, about the Estimates. They were content merely to bark; the consideration of ways and means was with them of the last importance. Another parliamentary humbug is for members to urge a Government to exercise economy in administration, and then to ask for increased expenditure on some particular object which they favour. The inconsistency of such action is obvious. The honorable member for Melbourne Ports stated in his constituency that we owe the British Government something like &#163;60,000,000 on account of war expenditure. In saying that, the honorable member was talking of something about which he had no knowledge, and might as well have named &#163;200,000,000, or any other sum.  It is generally believed that we are indebted to the Old Country in this connexion for from &#163;28,000,000 to &#163;30,000,000; but it must be a difficult matter for the Home authorities to furnish precise information regarding our indebtedness at any particular time. However, I agree with those who say that we should have information from them on this subject as soon as it can be obtained. </para>

                        <para>.- The country should know that these Estimates belong to the last Parliament, and have been introduced to-night merely for the purpose of creating discussion, because the Government have absolutely no business to place before Parliament. They have nothing whatever to do with, this Parliament. They cover the expenditure for the year ending the 30th June, 1917. Every penny in the schedule has been expended long ago, even before this Parliament came into being. </para>

They have had two months now since&#34; the elections, and they have held their party meetings, and their Cabinet meetings, yet they put before Parliament a Governor-General&#39;s Speech which the seconder of the motion for the adoption of the  Address-in-Reply.  a supporter of the Government, describes as merely empty phrases ; and when they found that- the Opposition were not prepared to waste the time of Parliament for two weeks in discussing a placard of fine words, they had nob a shred of business to put forward, and so these dead Estimates were brought forward in order to fill in or waste time. </para>

These men are walking about the streets in idleness, yet the Government have no business ready. Honorable members of the  Opposition  were prepared to remain silent, and allow the Government the opportunity to bring forward business in order ito test the sincerity of Ministers, and ascertain if they had any measures ready to help the soldiers, but we are told that it was a trick on our Dart when we did not propose to talk empty nothings for a fortnight. </para>

This Parliament, the members of which have been called together from one end of this continent to the other, is to be adjourned for a fortnight to enable the Government to prepare some business for its consideration. As a matter of fact, the Government have no proposals for winning the war. They have no business ready to meet the urgent conditions that exist ; no business ready to provide for the proper treatment of our disabled soldiers, or for the widows and dependants of men who have gone to the Front ; nor have they any business ready to provide for reasonable pensions for our soldiers. The Government are paying some of our disabled men the magnificent pension of 7s. 6d. a week. They have nothing ready to remove any of these grievances. They desire honorable members on this side of the House to give them suggestions as to what should be done. They would have us talk for a fortnight in order that the Government might carefully note our suggestions. At the end of that time, this so-called Win-the-War Administration would bring in their legislation on the lines suggested by the Labour party, the members of which they told the people were Huns and in the pay of Germany. </para>

                        <para>- That interjection shows the mental calibre of the honorable member for Calare. We know that the daily newspapers will not expose the hypocrisy of the Government&#39;s &#34; win-the-war &#39; &#39; policy. They are owned by the capitalists who provided the money for the Government&#39;s party campaign at the last elections, and they will shield the Government all the time. &#39; They will hide these facts, and go on excusing the shortcomings of this Administration. They do that day after day. But we have in the galleries some few people who have witnessed the spectacle of this so-called &#34; Win-the-war &#34; Government meeting the House without an item of business to put before it. I rose only to put this fact pointedly before those members of the public who are able to listen to me and to those who read <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> My desire was to let them know that this Government not only refuse to deal with important matters affecting the farmers of this country, but that, after all their talk of winning the war, after all their flapping of the flag and their resort to patriotic shibboleths, they have not one proposition to submit for winning the war or for helping those who are fighting our battles at the Front, or the dependants they have left behind them. </para>

                        <para>.- If honorable members required any proof of the hollowness of the Opposition cry, they have had it in the speech to which we have just listened. It is evident that the trick which they sought to play this afternoon has been countered to some extent by the&#39; introduction of these Estimates. No one knows better than does the honorable member for Cook that, although the expenditure for which these Estimates provide has been dealt with by way of Supply Bills, it is necessary that the Estimates-in-chief should be passed, and that they should be followed up by an Appropriation Bill. It matters not whether such business be done now or six months hence; the fact remains that it must be done, and the Government are to be commended for introducing these Estimates to occupy our attention while they finalize their proposals. I invite honorable members to consider the hypocrisy of the cry of the honorable member who has just resumed his seat. It was only yesterday that the Governor-General&#39;s Speech outlining the work of the session was submitted to us, and I have repeatedly known the debate in this House on the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply to extend over several weeks. The honorable member for Cook had something to say regarding the question of repatriation. I have a very vivid recollection of the honorable member&#39;s departure for Canada some time ago. He went away, and left to his mates in the party the work of dealing with repatriation. That being so, the less he says as to his anxiety to transact such business the better. </para>

                    <para>Some question has been raised as to who prepared these Estimates. As a matter of fact, three different Treasurers have had something to do with them. They were brought down in the first place by the honorable member for Capricornia. Later on I had a share in the handling of them for three months, and subsequently the present Treasurer came into office, and took them over. When I took office as Treasurer I foresaw that there was likely to be a shortage in the returns for the financial year which closed on 30th June last, and that we should not be able to make ends meet, save by the exercise of rigid economy and the free use of the pruning knife. When a Treasurer leaves office before his Estimates have been dealt with, it is somewhat difficult for him to ascertain the degree of retrenchment for which he has been responsible. But when I vacated the Treasury I&#39; was careful to ask the Secretary, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collins,</inline> to furnish me with a return showing the reductions made in the Estimates while I was there. I have all the details of the reductions made by me, but it is sufficient for me to inform the Committee that I reduced the Estimates to the extent of &#163;2,150,000, and this notwithstanding that I increased by &#163;200,000 the amount provided for pensions, and made  provision for an expenditure of &#163;750,000 in connexion with repatriation. Shortly put, these Estimates have been reduced to the extent of something like &#163;3,000,000 since they were originally introduced by the honorable member for Capricornia. I find that, although the financial year nominally closed with a surplus of &#163;1,678,000, there was actually a deficit of over &#163;1,300,000, since we brought forward &#163;$,000,000 from the previous year. </para>
                    <para>Let me now refer to some of the taxation which was imposed while I was in office. The Income Tax Bill, although mutilated to some extent by the Senate, has been responsible for a fair increase in revenue, the returns from that source jumping from &#163;3,900,000 to &#163;5,600,000. Then, again, the revenue from probate duties rose from &#163;626,000 to over &#163;1,000,000 last year. The loss of revenue has occurred chiefly in &#34; connexion with Customs and to a small extent in connexion with Excise. The falling-off in Customs revenue during the &#39; financial year was largely attributable to the submarine campaign. If ships cannot come here, there must necessarily be a falling-off of Customs revenue. Some honorable members have complained that the entertainments tax has not realized as much as was anticipated. The responsibility for that fact, however, rests with the House itself. The schedule to the Bill providing for the tax was ruthlessly cut down by honorable members. They were not even satisfied with the exemption of 3d. and 6d. tickets, but practically extended the exemption up to tickets of ls. each. As the result of their action considerable revenue has been lost, many of the cheaper picture shows having reduced their charge from ls. to 9d. .so as to avoid the tax. It is interesting to note the amount that we have received in taxation, the bulk of which has been imposed for war purposes. The income tax represents  over &#163;5,000,000; the land tax over &#163;2,000,000; the probate duties over &#163;l,000-,000; and the amusement tax over &#163;110,000. This return from the amusement tax is only for a half year, so that it may be doubled in order to show the total revenue. These figures all taken together represent a total of about &#163;9,025,000. We have now to briefly look at the commitments for the war for last year. In round figures our war loans represent &#163;130,000,000, of which &#163;80,000,000 was raised in Australia, and the balance in England. On this indebtedness the interest amounts to &#163;5,850,000, and a 1 per cent. sinking fund means another &#163;1,300,000. The war pensions for this year will amount to about &#163;1,000,000, and repatriation to &#163;750,000. In these figures we have indebtedness which must be met by taxation, and what I desire to show is that our direct taxation up to the present has met our commitments in connexion with the war. The figures I have just mentioned total about &#163;8,900,000, and our direct taxation amounts to &#163;9,025,000. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. I have already shown that we came out on the wrong side of the ledger by &#163;1,323,000. I had, however, provided for a war profits tax, which, on the best estimates I could obtain, would have produced about &#163;1,500,000 in the two years 1914 and 1915. Before the elections I urged the Government to pass a War Profits Taxation Bill, because I felt that otherwise we should come out on the wrong side. Besides, it is not fair to those who have to pay the tax to delay the measure, for it means that we shall have to come down on them for three years&#39; taxation, which will be all the more difficult for them to meet. </para>

                    <para>I have heard several people complain of the amount spent on the war, and it was quite common to hear it said during the elections that we had &#34; done enough.&#34; In this connexion, it is interesting to know what is the charge on the people of the Old Country as compared with the charge on the people of Australia. Quite recently it was announced in a speech by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bonar</inline> Law that Great Britain is spending &#163;7,000,000 per day, or &#163;213,000,000 per month, and this, with population of 50,000,000, means 2s. 9d. per head for every man, woman and child. In Australia our expenditure is &#163;4,500,000 per month, or &#163;147,942 per day, which, spread over a population of 5,000,000, works out at 7d. per head, as against 2s. 9d. at Home. In other words, England is spending, in order to win. the war, four and three-quarter times as much per head as we are in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. On a previous occasion I referred to our commitments for the future, which will have to be met by very heavy taxation. Last year, at any rate, the whole of our public works were constructed out of revenue, representing an amount of about &#163;4,714,000 up to the 30th June, 1917. In the previous year &#163;2,000,000 was spent on public works out of loan, but last year the whole expenditure was out of revenue. Last year we spent for war purposes out of revenue &#163;8,400,000, so that there is a good margin to work upon if necessary. It is quite evident to me that it will be impossible to carry on our public works out of revenue, and all works, except those of the most urgent character, will have to be closed down. There is one phase of the war, and of the financial position in . Australia, that is truly remarkable. Prior to the war in 1914, the accumulated deposits in the savings banks of Australia amounted to something like &#163;84,000,000, whereas about two months ago, as shown from figures supplied by the Commonwealth Bank, they stood at about &#163;100,000,000, showing an increase of over &#163;16,000,000. Then the deposits in the Associated Banks in 1914 were &#163;163,000,000, whereas the latest figures show that they now stand at &#163;183,843,000. These increases amount to about &#163;36,000,000, and show the savings of the people during the period of the war, notwithstanding the fact that we have withdrawn from the savings of the people some &#163;80,000,000on loan. For war purposes defrayed from loan money there is something over &#163;20,000,000 lying to our credit in the Commonwealth Bank, and if I mistake not, there is about &#163;22,000,000 due to the Imperial Government for what they have done for our troops at the Front. In this connexion I understand that the Treasurer has made an arrangement to pay so much per mouth. I desire, however, to refer to the haphazard methods adopted in the past for arriving at an estimate of our indebtedness to the Imperial Government; and a little incident that came under my notice throws some light on the matter. When I went to the Treasury, I noticed in my predecessor&#39;s statement an item of &#163;1,900,000 which was said to be the amount due to the Imperial Government for moneys expended on our Forces up to the 30th June, 1916. I could not get any data to satisfy  me, and I cabled to London, with the result that I found that the indebtedness, instead of being &#163;1,900,000, was &#163;8,500,000. This, I think, bears out what I say as to the haphazard, lax way of estimating the expenditure on the other side. In my opinion, there ought to be a bigger effort made to repay this amount to the Imperial Government, who, I am sure, are doing this work very willingly. </para>

                            <para>- That may be; at any rate, it will represent a good many more millions. It is well for us to understand exactly what the financial position is, and I suggest that, instead of keeping the &#163;20,000,000 lying in the bank and earning no interest, it would be much sounder finance to reduce the Imperial, debt. There is much that I should like to say in regard to what England is doing in connexion with the war, but I do not wish to occupy further time. I feel confident that there will have to be stringent economy in Australia in regard to public works and other expenditure, and there must also be heavy taxation. The complaints that have been made against the Government this afternoon about the non-introduction of legislation are, in my opinion, unreasonable. Much of this legislation is of a very technical character and requires the very closest scrutiny; and I believe that when the measures for repatriation and other purposes are introduced they will commend themselves to honorable members. . </para>

                        <para>.- In one respect the Government is not doing all that is possible to win the war. It is evident, from the statement made by the Prime Minister to-day, that Australia is in a serious position in regard to the shipment of frozen meat, rabbits, wheat, butter, and other commodities, and it seems to me that the Government have not done as much as they could have done to utilize some of the large steamers engaged in the coastal trade. We are all anxious to make sacrifices to assist the Old Country and to feed our Allies, but we are allowing to continue on the coast large  steamers  such as the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Katoomba,</inline> some of them of 8,000 and 9,000 tons, when smaller steamers could handle the coastal trade, thus freeing the bigger vessels for the transport of our products to the Old Country. </para>

                            <para>- I hope the Department will not occupy a year in investigating it. Both the local producer and the consumer abroad are in a bad position, and it is the duty of the Government to make the best possible use of every steamer on the coast.. I understand that New Zealand has almost depleted its coast of shipping by sending all the larger ships overseas with produce. There are at least seven or eight steamers on the Australian coast which could be utilized for that purpose. </para>

                            <para>- I understand that one of my officers is a member of the Board, but further than that I have no direct connexion with it. The Government is looking into the shipping problem very particularly ; and I believe with the honorable member for South Sydney that if investigation proves that there are on the coast ships that. could be spared for oversea transport purposes, they should be utilized for the carrying of our produce to Europe. But, whilst one may lay that down as a sound principle to work upon, the practicability of it has to be established by an examination of all the factors which make up the problem. The main thing is to ascertain how much space is being wasted at the present time on and about our coasts. On that point various opinions have been expressed. </para>

                            <para>- It seems to me that one way of winning the war is to increase the stability of this country as well as other portions of the Empire, and I do not know that we shall increase the staying power of the nation by throwing its industries out of gear if that can be avoided I admit that the paramount question at the moment <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> the feeding of the armies at the Front, and the people of the other countries which are allied with us. Next comes the problem of increasing all those agencies which mean resource and staying power in the form of wealth of some kind or other. The extent to which shipping can be spared is the subject of serious inquiry by the Government, and I hope the honorable member for South Sydney may be proved to be right, and that it may be found on examination that a great deal of the coastal shipping can be utilized in the overseas trade. But there are two sides to the question, and I am afraid the honorable member will find that if our own industrial concerns are to be kept going reasonably, not generously, a great deal of the shipping which he imagines can be so readily sent away to other countries will be required on our coast. I am not dogmatizing on this matter. It is a problem which we should approach with an open mind, and act only after consideration of all the facts concerned. The Shipping Board is investigating the matter very seriously with a view to ascertaining if it is possible to accomplish the objects which the honorable member has in view. </para>

                        <para>. - I am desired by the Farmers and Settlers Association of South Australia to place before the Committee the views of that body in regard to the proposals referred to to-day by the Prime Minister for the storage and protection of wheat from mice and weather. The Prime Minister stated that he would like to hear any statements honorable members had to make before the meeting of the Conference to-morrow, so as to obviate any criticism later, when he had done his best,. Three of the wheat-growing States of the Commonwealth have determined to enter upon the bulk handling of wheat, and in order to protect their wheat in the immediate future they intend to construct silos that will be capable of utilization in connexion with the new scheme. I have no word to say against bulk handling for those three States which have resolved to adopt that system, but on behalf of the Farmers and Settlers Association of South Australia, and also on behalf of the South Australian farming interests, I assure the Committee that 90 per cent. of the farmers of that State are absolutely opposed to bulk handling. Therefore, if the provision of silos, for the better protection of wheat in the near future, is to be approved by the Conference to-morrow, the South Australian farmers desire to be exempted from such an arrangement. I know that the Vaughan Government included bulk handling in its policy, and that up till the time of the last Conference South Australia joined with the other three wheat-growing States in advocating the provision of silos. But this scheme, supported by the Vaughan Government, was defeated in the South Australian Parliament, and it is the opinion of the Farmers and Settlers Association, after taking voluminous evidence, that 90 per cent. of the South Australian farmers are opposed to bulk handling, and, therefore, to the provision of silos for the protection of their wheat. </para>

                            <para>- They have considered labour and every other phase of the question, and whilst bulk handling might be appropriate for Victoria, New South Wales, and Western Australia, in which States the bulk, if not the entire, shipping is done at two or three ports, it is not appropriate for South Australia, which has ports at intervals of 10 or 12 miles all along its coast line. We have no desire to condemn bulk handling, so far as it applies to the other three States. For many reasons the bulk handling of wheat is not desired in South Australia. I therefore ask the Treasurer to put this proposition before the Prime Minister. It is not usual to provide silo accommodation for more than one-third of a normal crop. But if we in South Australia are allowed to erect mice-proof grain sheds instead of silos, we can, for what it would cost to provide silos for one-third of the crop, adequately and effectively protect the whole crop. I hope that consideration will be given to that matter at the Conference to-morrow. There is in the various station yards of  the State nearly enough iron to cover the sheds that are needed. </para>

                        <para>.- I wish to say something regarding the position outlined by the Prime Minister this afternoon. He told us that something like 548 general cargo steamers are needed to lift the general cargo now stored in Australia, and about fifteen insulated ships to take away the vast amount of produce now in cool storage here. During the electoral campaign every Ministerialist promised his constituents to do all in his power to maintain the industries of Australia, and to see that every pound of wealth which it was possible to produce would be obtained, and the same promise is given in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech. To-morrow a conference is to be held to devise means for saving the wheat crop, and a huge sum is to be spent to that end. The cost of reconditioning the wheat this year, and the loss already sustained, would altogether pay for the erection of sufficient silos to hold the whole of next season&#39;s harvest. But while the Government is willing to make provision for the protection of the wheat, it is doing nothing to help those interested in butter, rabbits, and other perishable produce that has to be kept in cool storage. The Prime Minister airily told the pastoralists and graziers that they would be all right, because they could keep their produce on the hoof. But those to whom I referred are not in that position. And the Prime Minister has not said that he will do anything for them. The rabbiting industry is now a very large one. In 1908 about 7.000,000 pairs of rabbits, worth &#163;336,000, were exported; in 1914-15 the exportation was about 10,000,000 pairs, worth &#163;531,000; and in 1915-16, 11,000,000 pairs were exported, worth &#163;724,000. During two months of this year something like &#163;4.00,000 worth of rabbits and hares were exported. The rabbit industry is linked with other industries which are even more important, and these, as well as it, will suffer if more refrigerated space is not provided. I have taken interest in the rabbit industry for the last ten years, not from the exporters&#39; or employers&#39; point of view, but from the point of view of the man who catches rabbits. </para>

                            <para>- In June last I pointed out to the Prime Minister that the rabbiting industry, so far as the provision of carcasses is concerned, would practically cease at the end of the month if the Government did not take action, and that other industries were similarly situated. What I foretold has come about. I said that it was necessary that the Government should take steps to provide refrigerated space, leasing buildings in the  different  capitals, if necessary, and installing the proper machinery. On the 21st June, I received, by direction of the Prime Minister, a letter in which this statement occurs - </para>

                    <para>The Prime Minister is now in correspondence with the Imperial Government in regard to the stocks of frozen rabbits now accumulated in cold storage, and has urged that action be taken to relieve the position. </para>
                    <para>It is understood that many of the packing firms have given earnest consideration to the question of providing additional refrigerated storage, and, in view of the fact that the position will be relieved if the Imperial Government find it possible to provide space for their purchase of rabbits, it is felt that to undertake building cool chambers at this stage might not prove a remunerative undertaking. </para>
                    <para class="block">That statement does not tally with what the Prime Minister said to-day. We have been told that private firms are taking steps to provide the necessary space, but if that be so, no one knows anything about it except the Prime Minister. With the exception of a small amount of space held by the Rabbit Combine, there is none left in Australia, and no steps are being taken to provide more. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; and whoever is responsible for the machinery which is being provided to deal with the export of rabbits does not occupy an enviable position. For six months the leading men in the&#34; rabbit business lived in Melbourne, and about two months ago the result of their labours here was made known. There is now a combine which absolutely controls the export of rabbits in this country. Any one may pack, but the export of rabbits is controlled by the combine. I will not say that the combine has worked the Government, but it has so impressed those in charge of this matter that it has got practically all that it wants. They have got control of the whole industry, and have cornered the refrigerated space to the detriment of other industries. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, child slavery. The refrigerated space in Australia is today bursting with rabbit&#39;s, butter, and meat, and the Government is not -giving effect to its promise to maintain its industries, and to reduce the cost of living. It refuses to provide more space to keep going the industries that need it, and it has taken no steps to bring about the reduction of prices. Immediately it was returned to power, the cost of butter was increased by something like1d. per lb. Although there are thousands of tons of butter in cool storage in Australia, the Government does not intend to tread on the corns of its friends by reducing the price of butter to the people of Australia. The price-fixing machinery in Australia to-day is a farce. </para>

                            <para>- No; but some firms which were not in the combine were operating, and, not being in the combine to-day, they have been forced out of business. The loss of the carcasses will be a very serious matter to Australia, especially in war time, when the waste of every pound of meat is  a matter for serious consideration. The position is that the trappers are compelled to trap either for the carcasses or for the skins, and they are at the mercy of the combine. Of what use is it to trap for skins if they cannot get paid for them? It would be a good step for the Federal Government to take, even at this late hour, to fix a price for the man who catches the rabbits, and to provide refrigerating space, which will never be wasted in a growing country like Australia. Furthermore, the rabbiters should be allowed the same concession as the Rabbit Combine enjoys, both for carcasses and for skins. </para>

                    <para>.- I have not the slightest objection to the Prime Minister obtaining leave to bring in this Bill, and to advance it to the second-reading stage on Wednesday, provided that he does not ask that the debate on the motion for the second reading shall be proceeded with until we have had an opportunity to examine the measures. The Prime Minister may have leave to introduce as many Bills as he pleases, and may move the first and second reading of those Bills on Wednesday, as long as the Opposition are afforded an opportunity to go into them before we are asked to proceed with th6 debate. I think that that is a fair offer. What Bills does the right honorable gentleman wish to go on with.? </para>

But instead of Orders of the Day being called upon, as provided for under theStanding Orders, and thereafter notices of motion, the Prime Minister had a few words privately with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> as the result of which he left the chair for three or four hours. That action deprived me of my right to submit the motions, of which I had given notice in the proper way. If the Government are going to deny to honorable members on this side rights to which they are entitled under the Standing Orders, then they need not expect any privileges from us. If the Standing Orders are to be side-stepped and twisted in order to prevent the consideration of business which I have put before the House, as I have a perfect right to do, then I shall do my best to see that neither the Prime Minister nor any other honorable member opposite receives at the hands of the Opposition any privileges for which the Standing Orders do not provide. </para>

They are certainly not those who have so much to say to the farmers, but who take advantage of the powerful majority they have in this House, to prevent the discussion of business of importance to the farmers.

I think I am entitled to raise an objection, and to prevent his obtaining a special privilege and using his position to block me, as a member of Parliament, from proceeding with legitimate and important public business properly before Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- The point of order that the Minister for the Navy sought to raise has fallen flat. Before leave is granted to the Prime Minister there ought to be some understanding as to the way private members&#39; business is going to be treated. People imagine when they return a member to this House that there are all sorts of opportunities afforded for righting many wrongs. But, as a matter of fact, the  opportunities that an honorable member has to do anything in regard to public business are very limited indeed. ( </para>

But he will not prevent my doing the business  I  think  I  ought / to do in this House. This only shows how mean and paltry the Prime Minister can be, resorting to personalities when he has no business to place before us. As a matter of fact, when the question of private business was raised last night, the Minister for the Navy objected to private members having any time, whatever; and, although there was an opportunity to-day to make some arrangement, we have had no announcement on the subject.  I  submit that before concessions _ are granted tlo the Government by this side we ought to know how we are going to be treated in regard to business we desire to bring forward. Surely matters are not to be altogether one-sided. The representatives of nearly  1,000,000  people of this country should have some opportunity to submit business to this Chamber, and at present no such opportunity is afforded </para>

                        <para>- I have the authority of the Standing Orders to go on with my business, whereas the Prime Minister has none, and now seeks to proceed with fresh business without authority. By preventing these motions on the notice-pa,per being discussed, as the Government are now doing with the  Support  and connivance of honorable members behind them, they are really giving their decision against the farmers; they are deciding that the farmers shall not be paid the 4s. per bushel guaranteed by the Government. We were told by the Treasurer yesterday that the Government had &#163;20,000,000 at credit in the Commonwealth Bank, on which no interest was being paid, and yet the Government do not pay the farmers the full 4s. per bushel; The Government has had no use for this money for  nearly  twelve months. </para>
