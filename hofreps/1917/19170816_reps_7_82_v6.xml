I understand that there has been a rearrangement of the Ministerial offices, and that the work which was formerly done by the Department of External Affairs has been distributed between the Departments controlled by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Home and Territories. </para>

I ask why the prohibition on trading in respect of Wehrenberg and Co. and about 200 other German firms in Japan, and against Beer, Sondheimer and Co., and about 200 other firms in &#39;the United States of America has been withdrawn. I refer to the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Gazettes</inline> of June and July last. </para>

                            <para>- I think that the question is one to which an answer has already been given. The prohibition relating to firms doing business in Japan was withdrawn at the instance of the Japanese Government, which has itself imposed a prohibition on the trading of the firms mentioned, making our prohibition unnecessary. As to the prohibition affecting the United States of America, if . the honorable member will put a question on the business-paper, I shall endeavour to give him an answer to it to-morrow. </para>

                            <para>- Seeing that there were military police in the crowd outside Parliament House, yesterday,I was anxious, to know whether they were there under instructions from the Defence Department, and, during the course of the reply of the Minister for the Navy, I said that they may have been merely sightseeing. I think that it was a perfectly reasonable question to put, because it is generally understood that military police are merely to look after their own class, and when I saw them among a crowd of civilians I was anxious to know whether they wore there under instructions or not. </para>

                                <para>- By way of personal explanation, I wish to say that this is a matter to which I attach considerable importance, and when I heard the statement of the honorable member Immediately saw the Minister for Defence,, and asked him whether he, or any of his officers, had given instructions for military police to be in attendance. He said, that he had given no such instructions, but that he would inquire whether any had been given. The report that I have referred to is that which has been furnished as the result of that inquiry. The Government would view with the greatest possible disfavour the introduction of military police into what is a purely civil matter, in regard to which, there would be no excuse whatever for the introduction, of the military. That is the attitude and the policy of the Government. </para>

                        <para>- I have not received any such . petition. I have many times stated the position of the Government in regard to this matter. The policy of the Government, and, I understand, of Parliament, is to encourage Australian industries and the consumption of Australian products. The question of allowing importations of fruit will not be considered until it is found impossible to give effect to that policy. The fruit-growers of this country have been consulted in reference to the matter covered by the honorable member&#39;s question, but they have not advised any relaxation of the restriction on importations, except possibly during December and January; and the Government are mow considering to what extent, if any, the embargo may be relaxed during those months. </para>

Yesterday when I was asked a question in reference to these shares I learned that they had not been sold, but the public trustee informed the Solicitor-General, from whom I obtained my information, that the matter of dealing with some thousands of enemy shares involves a good deal of detail work. However, he has completed his arrangements, and he proposes to sell the shares forthwith if possible. That applies to the shares mentioned by the honorable member as well as others. </para>

                        <para>- Some time ago 1 received a circular from an association, and signed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger,</inline> with reference to the importation of luxuries. I made several inquiries of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger,</inline> one of which was in reference to the quantities, not merely the prices, of goods imported. I have received no reply or acknowledgment of my communication, and I should like to ask the Minister for Trade and Customs &#39;whether he can see his way to provide the House with that information, as all members received the same circular ? </para>

                        <para>- The circular was sent to me, and I wish to state emphatically that the facts were not placed before the public in their true light. It&#39; mentioned merely the value of importations, and not the quantity of goods entering Australia. I know for a positive fact that many imported articles have risen- in price from 20 per cent. to 70 per cent., and that very few articles are how imported which do not show an increase of at&#39; least 20 per cent. over the purchase value in 1915. Therefore, figures as to the value of importations are not a true criterion of the quantity of good&#39;s imported. I can assure honorable members that there has been an enormous falling-off in the quantities imported. </para>

                        <para>- The matter has been brought under my notice. In view of the fact that manufacturers of Australian whisky enjoy a good protection under the Tariff - the Excise being less than the import duty - and also the double protection afforded by reason of the enormous freight costs on imported&#39; spirits, I think that they would be well advised if they recognised that their products should be sold as being of Australian manufacture. Australian spirits, once the Excise duty has been collected, are released from any further control so far as the Commonwealth is concerned. It is a matter for the State authorities to see that whisky and other spirits made in Australia are sold assuch. </para>

                            <para>So far from this corps being hurried into existence, its formation has been contemplated since 1902, and probably earlier. The object of the regulation in respect to the formation of an Army Ordnance Corps is to enable this branch of the service to take its correct place in the military organization, as in all other armies of the civilized world. One of the main points aimed at in forming the permanent, corps is to enable a corresponding &#39;militia organization to be formed consisting of selected men who are employed on corresponding duties in business houses, and whose services would thus be available to augment the permanent staff and administer all ordnance services in camps on mobilization. The  Chairman  of the Royal Commission was informed, by the Minister of his intention to take action in this matter and offered no objection. It is not proposed to defer action. </para>

                    <para>As  chairman  of recent meeting of fruit importers, I desire to place before you our Queensland position with reference to the proposed embargo on American apples&#39;. As far as it is possible for us to see, the present supply of Tasmanian apples will be exhausted about the end of September. </para>

                        spoke against this motion,, as he &#39;thought that if the duty on American fruit coming into Australia was increased, America would adopt the same attitude towards Australian fruit, and this would be detrimental to the working up of trade between America and Australia. On the motion being put to the meeting, it was lost.

(Laughter.) Australia could store fruit to keep up supplies throughout the year; but America had the advantage of natural ice, which gave cheaper storage. Growers in Australia, should maintain control of the Australian markets rather than build their hopes on a problematical American market.

                        (Tasmania) seconded the motion. The importation of American apples, he stated, would be ruinous to our cool stores. American Stunners were now fetching 14s. per case on the Sydney market, because they were highly coloured - although tasteless and inferior to the. Tasmanian fruit-whereas he was now getting only 7s. a case on the same market for his finest Sturmers.

                        H. Lamb- (Victoria) spoke against the motion, and stated that this proposal had been turned down at State Conferences. The present protection was very high, as, including cost of production, freight, and other charges, apples could not be landed from San Francisco under 12s. per bushel. The imports of American apples, he thought, was showing a tendency to decrease.

                        Griffith (Victoria) stated that, with the opening of the Panama Canal, they were in a position to land fruit as cheaply in New York as in London.

                        (Tasmania) advocated Free Trade in fruit, and said their object, as growers, should be to cheapen fruit, so as to increase the consumption. Australia could grow every kind of fruit as well as any place in the world, and. should be able, to stand against all competitors. As to our cold-storage fruit being killed by imports, he instanced Doncaster, where the cost of storage amounted to only id. per case a week. This left ample margin to meet competition.

                        (New South Wales) stated, that they should study reciprocity with other countries. The present duty, on citrus fruits was 4s. 2d. per cental. He had received numerous&#39; inquiries from America for Australian fruits. The motion, on being put to the meeting, was lost on the casting vote of the  chairman.

                    <para>A letter which had been received from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> H. Davey from the <inline font-style="italic">Fruit World,</inline> and published in our last report of the executive meeting, at which meeting a motion was carried in  keeping with that carried at the Australian Conference of Fruit-growers, protesting against placing a prohibitive duty on American apples, was read. It was understood that the Prime Minister intended to prohibit the importation of apples during the period of the war. This action was being supported by the New South Wales and Tasmanian Fruit-growers&#39; Association. A discussion took place as to whether the council should take any further action in this matter. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mair</inline> moved&#39; that no action be taken by the council. He thought that the reason . the Government intended to prohibit the importation of apples at the present time was because they required the shipping space for matters of more vital importance to the carrying on of the war, also in keeping with the intention of the Government to prohibit luxuries during the war. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> stated that recently the Prime Minister, speaking at Harcourt, said that it was the intention of the Government to prohibit the importation of American apples to assist the fruit-growing industry. He understood, however, that, before taking action, the Prime Minister intended to confer with an Advisory Committee. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lawford</inline> stated that the question to be decided was, whether Victoria was in favour of prohibition or not. He favoured a reciprocal trade (Hear, hear!) <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hatfield</inline> questioned whether the action promised by the Prime Minister would be to the interests of the Australian fruit-grower, as Victoria could certainly not compete with the American fruit when on the market here, as the quality was much better than the Victorian apples, which had to be taken out pf cool stores. He thought it would be the same on the American market; Australian fruit would be more likely to capture the market than the American cool-stored fruit. After further discussion, the following motion was moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> H. Lang (Harcourt): - &#34;That the Prime Minister be informed that this association, and also the Australian Fruit-growers&#39; Conference, has always been opposed to raising any bar against the importation of American apples, &#39;even to the extent of increasing the duty. These associations have had in view the very great possibilities of America as a market for Australian fruit, and, therefore, have at successive annual Conferences favoured the policy of a practically open door. We further desire to say that we do not in any way wish to influence the Prime Minister in any decision he may make with the object of conserving freight during the war.&#34; This motion was seconded by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hubbard,</inline> and carried. </para>
                    <para>I have now given chapter and verse for my statement regarding the attitude of the fruit-growers of Victoria and Australia generally in this matter. The statements that I have read are in direct contradiction of that of the Prime Minister to-day. The right honorable gentleman is interfering in a matter with which be is not acquainted, and his evident want of knowledge is leading to a most unfortunate position, so far as the fruit-growers and fruit-consuming public of Australia are concerned. .1 have been in almost continuous consultation on this subject with the Minister for Trade and Customs who, being himself an orchardist, is well acquainted with the position. Of course, I have no record of the honorable gentleman&#39;s! opinion, but I am disposed to think that he views rather favorably the request that has been made, particularly from Sydney and Brisbane, for permission for the importation of American apples for the latter part of the year. The Minister for Trade and &#39;Customs,- who would naturally be expected to control this matter, is not allowed to give effect to his knowledge; the Prime Minister&#39;s veto overshadows his actions, and the public must suffer in consequence.. On the 26th July the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs),</inline> drew attention, to. the price of apples in Australia. One has only to look into the windows of retail shops to see apples ticketed at anything from 5d. to 6d. per lb.,- and information is readily obtainable to show that the wholesale rates for fruit run from 12s. to 16s. per case. To my knowledge, most of the fruit now selling has been in cold stores for a considerable time. It was bought up by speculators at 6s. to 8s. per case, and is held by them in cold stores,  and, as it is only allowed to be dribbled but to the public, an artificial shortage is created. The public are not only fleeced in regard to the price, but they are also limited &#34;in the matter of the amount of fruit that is allowed to go into consumption. A rather peculiar commentary on that position of affairs is the fact that almost daily there is a statement in the&#39; press by the Prime Minister, or by those who are advising him in this matter, pointing out how necessary it is that  the public should eat fruit, and particularly how -advisable it is that they should eat apples. For some time we were deluged with all sorts of suggestions in &#62;the press as to how beneficial, useful, and healthy apples were as an article of diet, and as to how easily they could be prepared for the table. </para>
                    <para>I submitted a question to the Minister  for Trade and Customs on the 27th July, and, in reply, he promised to have a return prepared showing the amount of fruit that is available in Australia. % Any determination as to whether apples should be imported should be based upon that information. No honorable member could put up an argument in favour of the importation of apples from America or elsewhere if there were sufficient fruit available in Australia. The information placed at my disposal by the Minister for Trade and Customs has enabled me to form an estimate as to what fruit there is available in Australia. I understand that there are 200,000 cases in Queensland, <inline font-style="italic">New</inline> South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia. The returns from . Tasmania are not quite complete, but, according to such information as is available, there are probably 200,00.0 cases in that Stately. </para>

                            <para>- I thank the Minister for that information. I was basing my calculations , on a rough estimate of 400,000 cases being available at the present time. On the average, the normal consumption of apples in Australia is about 40,000 cases per week. When fruit is cheap there is no difficulty in disposing of 60,000 cases per week, but 40,000 cases per week is the normal consumption, and, with fruit at its present price, I question whether the consumption now is over 30,000 cases a week. Taking the normal consumption at 40,000 cases per week, the quantity of apples now available in Australia will supply us for not more than ten weeks. If the rate of consumption be reduced, the quantity should last for three months, but that can only be done . by artificial restrictions, either through the imposition of higher prices or by limiting the quantity to be taken out of cold storage. In that way the supply. might be made to last until the end of October. </para>

                    <para>A request was recently made through the Prime Minister, to the , Minister for Trade and Customs. for permission to import 75,000 cases from America during this season. Last year, when there was a fairly good crop in Australia,we imported 142,000 cases from America, and in order to show that this importation did not have any detrimental or disadvantageous effect on the fruit-growers of Australia, I have only to refer honorable members to the report of the Fruitgrowers&#39; Conference. They say that there should be an open door. They do not even suggest any limitation as to the number of cases to be imported or any increase of duty. Therefore, if, during a good year, Australia could afford to import 142,000 cases without any detrimental. effect to the fruit-growing industry, it is an easy thing to show that when there is an admitted shortage of fruit, such as we have experienced this year, there should be no trouble in disposing of the limited quantity of 75,000 imported cases, which is all that the fruit merchants are asking to be allowed to import this year. </para>

                        <para>Mr.FINLAYSON. - My experience is that the main source. of trouble. is. the bad facilities provided by railways and shipping companies. If the honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser)</inline> would go down to the wharf and see. the . way in which oranges from Maryborough &#39;are handled, he would see a sight that would be enough to make him shed tears of blood. The accommodation that the shipping companies provide for fruit is simply disgraceful. </para>
                        <para>But the fruit that is . now available in Australia is in cold storage, and the other difficulty, arises that, . when it is taken out of cold storage, it must be put into immediate- consumption or go bad. Within a month the fruit that is now available in Sydney and Brisbane will be absolutely useless, because it will not carry over a journey that will take more than a day by rail or by steamer. Neither Broken Hill, nor Bourke, nor any western town of New South Wales or Queensland can possibly hope to see an apple after the end of this month until February, when probably the new crop will be available. Between the end of the Australian fruit season and the. beginning of the new season, the only way in which the supply of fruit to the outlying portions of Australia has been maintained has been by importing American fruit. </para>

One of the happiest features of progress in Australia to-day is the fact that the fruit-growers are largely copying the American system of packing and preparing fruit for market. </para>

                        <para>The Prime Minister suggests that he will review this matter at the end of September, but by that time our stocks in Australia will be nearly exhausted. It takes ships three weeks to come from America, so that, even if the Prime Minister is favorably disposed, and arrangements are made immediately, there will be at least a month or five weeks in which there will be no fruit available. The Minister for Trade and Customs knows that arrangements have to be made a very considerable time ahead with the fruit-growers, in America in order to secure space on the steamers. Any one acquainted with overseas shipping knows that arrangements have to be made months ahead; so that, even if arrangements were set in hand immediately, I question if it would be possible to land the first shipment of apples by the 8th October, </para>

                                <para>- The fruit merchants have their arrangements in hand. They are merely waiting for information from the Minister for Trade and Customs to the effect that the importation will be permitted. They suggest that only half the amount should be imported this year as compared with what came in last year. The reason for this is the fact that the vessels are not now available. There will not be the cold storage available to bring the larger quantity across from America. If arrangements are made immediately, and 75,000 cases are imported, they will only last, at the outside, from the 8th October to the end of December. The&#34; fruit that would be imported could be easily absorbed by Queensland and New South Wales without a single case of American fruit being available for other States, and by Christmas there would not be an imported &#39;apple&#39; left in Australia. There is no possibility of Competition with, the local article, or detriment to the Australian fruit-grower, by allowing this importation to take place. The Prime Minister says there must be no importation, and the public are being misled - I . do not think, deliberately - by reports in the press regarding the difficulty fruit-growers are likely to have in regard to the disposal of their surplus crop, and there is talk of providing machinery to supply dried fruit to the British Government and the markets on the other side of the world. But that surplus is in connexion with next year&#39;s crop, and, judging by the splendid rains which have fallen in the fruit-growing districts, and the present indications of the forthcoming season, the apple-growers will have an extraordinarily good yield. Probably in those circumstances  they will be wise in placing an embargo on importations which would deprive them of the Australian market, but that position has not yet arisen, and cannot; arise for the next six months. If the American apples which are now prohibited were allowed to enter the Commonwealth, they would disappear before the end of this year. The Minister for Customs has been offered a guarantee that if American apples are allowed to be imported, not only will they be absorbed by Queensland and New South Wales alone, so that there can be no detriment to the fruit-growers of the other States, but the prices to the consumers will be limited. </para>

                                <para>- I am sorry the honorable member makes that statement, because the Australian fruit-growers are not of his opinion. They are most anxious to cultivate trade with America, and one of the peculiar facts in connexion with this matter is that whilst, on the one hand, we are talking about the&#39; advisability of appointing a Trade Commissioner in America to promote the sale of Australian products, we are, on the other hand, saying to Americans that we do not want their products to be sent&#39; to Aus- &#39; tralia. Fruit-growers have sent experimental shipments to America with gratifying success, and through the agency of the Panama Canal they are in as close touch with New York as with London. There are very good opportunities for promoting the sale of Australian fruit in America. The seasons of the two countries are opposite. While the American fruit season is on the Australian season is off, and so there ought to be a reciprocal arrangement. </para>

In a return placed on the table of the House on the 8th August, at the request of the Leader of the Opposition, these figures in regard to the export of apples occur - </para>

                        <para class="block">Honorable members will see that last year we exported nearly six times as many cases of apples as we exported this year. The decrease was not alone due to the fact that there was limited shipping space available, but was equally due to the circumstance that we had not the same quantity of fruit available. There is a shortage of fruit this year, and it is in order to make good that shortage that I appeal to . the Minister to remove the existing embargo on importations. I ask him to take that step now because it is necessary to immediately make arrangements if the fruit is to be landed in Australia in time  to be of any service, at all. If the Minister waits till the end of September the whole machinery of importation will be thrown out of gear, and instead of the fruit arriving here to supply the market when Australian fruit is exhausted, there will be two or three months of an interregnum between the exhaustion&#39; of the local article and the arrival of the imported. In any case, if the importation of apples immediately began with, the first ship leaving America, which would be due to arrive here about the 8th October, we could not- possibly import more than 75,000 cases before the end of the year,  and that quantity could be absorbed without the slightest trouble, and certainly without any detriment whatever to the fruit-growers of the Commonwealth. Next year, when, we hope, a big crop will be available, we can deal with the importation question in the light, of the circumstances then obtaining. But to-day there is no reason or justification for a continuance of this prohibition. It is unfair to the people of Australia, and will tend to maintain the price of apples at the present rate, with increases as the season advances. </para>

                                <para>- About 4s. or 5s. per case, and at one period it was almost impossible to get buyers. The responsibility -for. that lies with our inefficient methods of distribution. It is not the grower who is getting the&#39; big prices now, but rather&#39; the speculators, who have held the fruit in cold storage and forced up the prices. It is all very well to talk about protecting the &#34;grower; the unfortunate fact remains that he is so- much tied up with banks and other financial institutions that he is glad to take the best price he -can get, and, although the wholesalers are getting to-day 16s. per case, the growers from&#39; whom they bought the fruit probably did not get more than 6s. or 7s. It is not fair to the consumers of Australia, or to the growers of America, that the prohibition of importation should be continued .a day longer. </para>

They can hold  uo their supplies much easier than we in Australia can, and thus insure a continuity of supply all through the year.

If those apples are allowed to land here there would be no competition with the Australian fruit, and our fruit-growers, if the reports of the annual conference are to be taken as a guide, are neither opposed to the importations of American fruit nor in favour of any additional duty, being imposed upon it. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will review this prohibition at an &#169;surly d.&#163;it&#38; </para>

In fact, prices were higher than they are at the present time. There are no American apples on the Australian market to-day, but there are to be seen in shop windows apples equal  to any that have ever been placed before the public. And this, notwithstanding that in Tasmania and other parts of the Commonwealth last season the moisture was so excessive as to give rise to a great deal of black spot, in consequence of which  apple-growers suffered considerable loss.&#34; </para>

                                <para>- Quite so. I do not hold any special &#39;brief for the orchardists of the Commonwealth. There are not many apple-growers in my elec-0 borate, but I am anxious that the industry should be fostered. I have been informed by men who can speak with authority that it is impossible to get&#39; Australian apples on the American market. That, being so, why should we give the American growers a preference over our own producers? </para>

                        <para>Much has been done by private enterprise in Tasmania to establish cool stores, and these stores have been successfully employed by the small growers. I am informed that the owner of the cool stores in my State gives the growers better terms than can be obtained in respect of either the Victorian Government cool stores or the co-operative cool stores a little way out of Melbourne. In short, it costs more to put apples into cool storage here than it does in- Tasmania. I am hopeful that cool storage in Tasmania will be considerably increased, so that the small growers may have an opportunity to conserve their supplies, and, by placing their fruit on the market at regular intervals, be able to keep their industry going as a fairly payable proposition. The value attaching to fruit-growing land is given to it only by the trees thereon. I question whether any bank would advance a shilling an acre on orchard land except for  the fruit trees upon it. Such land is of very little -value for other purposes. In&#39; the early days, what was known as third class land in Tasmania could be obtained for 10s., and even 5s., per acre, because its value for fruit-growing purposes was then unknown. To-day the position has changed, and large areas which were at one time thought to be of very little value are now devoted to apple-growing. </para>

                                <para>- And the honorable member for Brisbane has been, putting before the House the case for the fruit merchants of Sydney and Brisbane. As to the interjection, made by the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. West)</inline> I would say that the apple production of Western Australia is very small compared with that, of Tasmania. Western Australian apples are carefully graded, and they colour up very well. Tasmanian apples may lack the colour of those grown in Western Australia, but their flavour is infinitely better. The Western Australian growers get their fruit on the London market a fortnight before the Tasmanian apples, and, catching the early market, thus ob- &#39;  tain higher prices. </para>

                                <para>- I realize that the honorable member is not quite in earnest. My chief concern is &#34;for the grower and the consumer in the Commonwealth. We, in the Commonwealth, hope next year to have a production of  6,000,000 bushels of apples, and it is questionable whether we could ship more than 1,500,000 bushels, even if they are evaporated, and place them on the Home market. </para>

                                <para>- I think not. We have no objection to their coming in once our own apples are off the market. We strongly object, however, to the admission of American apples at the present time, seeing that small growers have considerable quantities in cool storage. The return which&#39; the Minister for Trade and Customs is having prepared will disclose the quantity of apples in cool storage in the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>.- I should first like to draw attention to the objectionable manner in which questions are being answered concerning the expenditure of &#163;2,068,000 on Government steam-ships. It is nearly a year ago that we were promised a Bill to deal with this matter, and I have brought it under the Prime Minister&#39;s notice from time to time, with the only result that a measure has been promised &#34; as soon as possible.&#34; Hundreds of thousands of pounds are being spent, and hundreds of thousands of pounds are being received by somebody; and I venture to say that neither the Treasurer nor his officers know anything about the business. These methods are irregular, and I hope that honorable members opposite, who pride themselves on their commercial knowledge, will see that the matter is attended to. We on this side, though strong in intellect, are few in numbers, and we can do nothing, especially with a gentleman of the disposition of the Prime Minister, who  allows his utterances to be coloured by his vindictiveness. </para>

                        <para>As Prime Minister we have a most eloquent gentleman, who has paraded before the country as a great anti-German. Some honorable members on this side, who have ventured to speak in favour of peace, he has described as pro-German. It will be remembered that the Prime Minister went to England and elec-  trifled the people of the Old Country by speeches and methods, which, I think, are open to some criticism. </para>

                                <para>- I am prepared to reply to that interjection. I made that statement in regard to the Anzac vote when addressing the electors at Bendigo, and when I wished to prove that in Australia there was an intolerable censorship. I told the audience that I was about to make a statement concerning the Anzac vote which would not appear in any newspaper in, Australia on the following day, and I quoted from a statement which the honorable member for Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Finlayson)</inline> had shown me in the Glasgow <inline font-style="italic">Weekly Herald</inline> - as an extract from another newspaper - that the Anzac vote was, I think, 106,000 against, and 40,000 or thereabouts for. </para>

                                <para>- I . am not sure that I did. The point is that there was a censorship regarding the Anzac vote; and, after my statement to the people at Bendigo the Prime Minister and his supporters were in a difficulty. The statement was, I believe, kept out of the Melbourne newspapers at the time, but the Government were compelled to allow, it to appear in the Bendigo newspapers in order that they might show I was wrong regarding the censorship. &#39; </para>

                        <para>However, I must revert to the speeches of the Prime Minister in the Old Country. There the right honorable gentleman was spoken of as&#39; a strong man of action - as not only a man who could talk, but a man who could do things. Recently, I asked a question about some shares that were held by enemy subjects prior to the war. It has been stated in the press that thousands of shares were so&#39; held at that time, and that they are now in the hands of the Public Trustee. The question I asked was how many of the shares had been sold, and the Prime Minister&#39;s reply was, &#34; None.&#34; . This is a very curious answer, in view of what appears in the book entitled <inline font-style="italic">The Day, and After.</inline> This book is described on the title page as containing more speeches by the Right Honorable W. M. Hughes, Prime Minister of Australia, with a preface by the Right Honorable Lloyd George, M.P.&#39;, and as &#34;printed by authority.&#34; The price marked is1s.; but I understand that at Cole&#39;s Arcade, in Sydney, some hundredweight or more of the volumes are marked &#34; This lot 3d. each.&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George, in his preface, describes the speeches in very eulogistic terms. </para>

                                <para>- Ordinary working Germans employed on the wharfs at Rockhampton were deprived of work. International law appears now to be a dead letter, but, prior to the present war, it was held that, although in former times private, as well as public, property went to the conqueror, private property in modern times in every case remained sacred. If, for instance, Japan had thoroughly beaten Russia, she would have taken the public property of that country, but would have respected the rights of private ownership. I am not now discussing the ethics of , the Prime Minister&#39;s proposal to sell these shares ; I am merely pointing out that the right honorable gentleman told the people of Great Britain that the shares had been sold, whereas they are not yet sold. It is said, moreover, that the other day, when it was proposed to sell them, certain persons went to the Government and got the sale put off. If the Labour party had failed to act in a matter of this kind, we should have been described by the Prime Minister as pro-Germans. I should like to know what reply the Prime Minister has to make to the charge that he misled the public of Great Britain, and has failed up to the present time to deal with these shares in the manner in which he said they had been dealt, with. I have it on the authority of the right honorable gentleman that hundreds of thousands of shares in Australian companies are in the hands . of the Comptroller-General of Customs, who is acting as public trustee. Now that the question has been raised, the Government is prepared to act,. Had it not been raised, the Prime Minister, who has been parading his <inline font-style="italic">loyalty</inline> throughout the country, would have done nothing, and the shares would have remained in the hands of the public trustee. </para>

                            <para>With reference to your letter of the 29th May, and previous correspondence on the subject of the maize crop, I am directed by the Prime Minister to inform you that, in reply  to representations in this connexion, the British Government advised that, as there was insufficient tonnage for wheat and flour, they were unable to negotiate for the purchase of by-products of maize. </para>
                            <para>I am to add that, so far, maize-growers have not availed themselves of the invitation of the Prime Minister to organize, and submit for consideration, a scheme for dealing with the problem, in view of the absence of oversea freight. </para>

                        <para>Many of us thought that action would have been taken in this matter before the imposition of new duties on Friday last. If the Excise duty on starch made from rice were increased to 2d. per lb.; and the Excise duty on starch made from maize left at Id. per lb., it would stimulate the use of maize. At least 1,000,000 bushels of maize could be used to make starch and other by-products. The rice used in this country is imported from&#34; countries in which it is grown by means of black labour, and when imported for the making of starch it is admitted duty free. But starch can be made of maize just as well as of rice, and 98 per cent, of the starch used in the United States of America is made of maize. If the Government is desirous of helping the man on the land, it will give practical consideration to this question&#39;. In many parts of New South Wales, and in very many parts of Queensland, there are rich scrub lands on which wheat, barley,, and many other cereals do not do well, because in a climate like that of Queensland, with such rich land, and a big rainfall, the straw grows so thick that it is impossible to property dry it before stacking, and thus mildew spoils the grain. It is only after the ground has been cropped many times that these cereals can be grown on it profitably. Much of that land is consequently put under grass for the pasturing of dairy cattle. It is a waste of land, which is as good as that at Warrnambool, to use it only for pasturage, and if encouragement were given to the growers of maize by guaranteeing, through the Tariff, a reasonable price for their production, &#39;this &#60; land would be  largely devoted to maize growing. In my electorate, maize has been sold, in small quantities for as little as ls. 3d. per bushel. The Maize Products Proprietary, of Footscray, has stated in writing that if it had reasonable protection for its&#39; manufactures it would be able to give at least 4s. a bushel for maize, which would mean a price of more than 3s. per bushel to the growers, who are now getting from ls. 3d. to ls. 6d. per -bushel. In Australia there is room for a population as large as that of the United States of America, where they have over 110,000,000 inhabitants, and grow over 3,000,000,000 bushels of maize a year, as against about 5,000,000 inhabitants here. Unless encouragement is given to the primary producer, good land will fall out of cultivation, and men will come from the - country to compete with the labour already in the cities and towns. There is an Excise of Id. per lb. on starch made from rice imported free, but when duty is paid on the rice, at the rate of 3s. 4d. per cental, the Excise is not levied. I suggest that, to encourage the manufacture of starch from maize, the Excise duty on starch made from rice should be in creased to 2d. per lb., or the manufacture qf starch from rice imported from black labour countries should be prohibited. </para>
                        <para>Another anomaly in the Excise duties is the fact that, although in America and elsewhere the product of maize is used very largely in the manufacture of beer, it is specially penalized in Australia. The Excise duty on ale, porter, or other beers not made exclusively from barley malt and hops, is 6d. per gallon, as against 5d. per gallon on ale, porter, or other beers made from barley malt and hops. </para>

                                <para>- Probably potatoes do not produce a good spirit. If maize will provide a good material for the purpose of making ale and stout, why should it be penalized ? If the product is not good, it will not be used. At any rate, I do not see why it should not be put on an even keel with the other items. Then, again, in regard to glucose. The honorable member may say that I am up against sugar, but I do not support any particular industry. I support every industry that needs support. The glucose that is manufactured in Melbourne from maize is used by brewers and confectionery manufacturers, and why should it be penalized? </para>

                                <para>- But, after the war, it. will come in again. If the factories know, that, after the war is over, they will be protected to the extent that, through the war, they are now, they will manufacture glucose from maize. It is no encouragement to an industry, especially in a new country such as Queensland is, where there are very few things, that can be grown when the land is first cultivated except maize, not to provide in the Tariff that the local production shall have at least protection against articles that are imported. If these concessions were made, a firm at Footscray, which is now using 1,500 , bushels of maize daily, could use 1,200,000 bushels per annum, which is equal to 4,000 bushels daily. That would be of immense assistance, and the means of settling large numbers of people on the land. We hear from the Prime Minister that no assistance can possibly be given to the shipping of maize. That is practically saying that it will be useless to put our soldiers on some of the richest land in Australia without alteration of the Tariff. It offers no encouragement to men to extend their cultivation in a new country, and it will operate as an inducement to them to go into , the towns and find occupations there. If for no other reason, the Government should, with as little delay as possible, make such alterations in the Tariff as will enable them to settle returned soldiers and others on the land of which . I have spoken, to make it more productive, so that more producers may be in a position to feed those. who are living in the towns. I trust that the Minister for Trade and Customs will go into the matter fully, and that it will not be long before , we can convey from this House some information that will encourage our young men to settle on the land, instead of harbouring in the cities. </para>

                            <para>.- My object in rising is to place on record a few facts, and to express a few opinions on the situation confronting us to-day. We have heard the Prime Minister talk about cutting out the cancer of German influence, and we have heard him say that a number of us are identified with German interests. To-day I asked the Prime Minister a question, and, in reply, I was told that the prohibitions against German firms were no longer necessary because they had been imposed by the United States of America and Japan. A prohibition appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Government Gazette</inline> on the 7th June last in connexion with certain German firms operating in Japan, and it was removed because, as the Prime Minister has explained, a prohibition having been imposed by the Japanese Government, there is now no need for that prohibition on our part. In spite of what the Prime Minister has. told us, I say that there is no prohibition imposed by Japan on any German firm operating in its territory. As a matter of fact, from the beginning of the war the Japanese Government have not put up any prohibition against any German firm operating in its. territory. As long as any German firm operating in Japan conducts itself in accordance with the laws of Japan, it can carry on operations there. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                        <para>The removal of the prohibition here is entirely due to the fact that Japan wishes to do a larger trade with us, and finds that her means of carrying on trade with us is curtailed by reason of such a large portion of her . business being in the hands of German firms operating in her country who were affected by our prohibition. The Prime Minister talks about eradicating German influence, and he prohibits any trading with the Aachen and Munich Fire Insurance Company, of Queen-street, yet one can carry on business with the same firm operating in Japan. We prohibit the importation of products in the names of the Deutsche Apotheke, Weinberger and Company, Winckler and Company, Fiecke and Company, Meier and Company, Berg, Werner, and Company, and so forth, &#34;yet we can carry on correspondence and business with those firms in Japan. The same thing applies in regard to the United States of America. We have had a prohibition against German firms who carry on business in America. Suddenly, on the 12th July, that prohibition was removed. The prohibition applied, among others, to Bauer, Phillip, and Company, and Beer, Sondheimer, and Company. The latter was the firm connected with the metal gang operating in Australia. The other day there appeared in <inline font-style="italic">Dunn&#39;s Gazette</inline> a notice of the reconstitution of the Electrolytic Smelters. The names of Seigfried Hirsch and Frank Snow appear as foundation directors. And while we were talking of cutting out the cancer of German trade the Aaron Hirsch people had a lot of concentrates at Port Pine, and the Union Bank made advances to Frank Snow, who was the agent handling these concentrates. Furthermore, the Prime Minister, while talking about cutting out the cancer of German trade, immediately opened the door so that the Union Bank could open up negotiations with the Aaron Hirsch Company through America. To-day I asked why these prohibitions had been removed, and I was told that it was no longer necessary to impose, them because Japan had imposed them. I maintain that Japan has not imposed them. </para>
                        <para>In. regard to the shares held by enemy subjects, I also took the liberty of asking the Prime Minister a question. While the right honorable gentleman was telling the people of England that the whole of the German cancer had been eradicated, and on his return to this country made the same affirmation, at the same time charging many of us with having been direct agents of the Germans, he placed the whole of the metal business, and a large amount of other industrial business, directly in the hands of W. L. Baillieu and others who were the very instruments for the introduction of the Germanic in- . terests in Australia, and right up to the outbreak of war were direct &#34;pals&#34; of that influence, and ever since have been the local controllers of Germanic interests. </para>

                                <para>- Frank Snow. The claim was made that 100,000 German shares would be forfeited, and that German influence was to be eradicated. These shares were to be placed in the hands of a Public Trustee, and held by him for sale. The Minister for Trade and Customs has held them for fourteen months. Why are they nob sold? A few months ago,&#39; when people began to say, &#34; Why not act as well as talk?&#34; articles began to appear in the various metal journals. </para>

Because Rodgers and Company,&#39; of the Sydney section of the metal gang, did not desire them to be sold. We do not know why, but one fact is evident, namely, that Rodgers and W. L. Baillieu and Company did not want the shares put on the market at that juncture. </para>

                                <para>- I am not talking about pre-war times, but about the operations during the last few months. This action was taken, since the outbreak of war. The Metal Exchange was formed only recently. Several months ago the Prime Minister said that he. was going to have these shares sold immediately, and the statement he made to-day, that they would be sold forthwith, is merely a repetition of what we heard before. The moment he made that statement the metal crowd began to object. One would naturally ask, Would they not be pleased to get the possible increment of value between now and the end of the war ? I do not know why they objected, but I do know what appeared in the press and what is said in financial circles. </para>

                                <para>- I suppose they cheered because they appreciated the fact which the honorable member disclosed to them. The reason which the honorable member quoted is one of those to which I was leading, but it is not the only reason. It is the especial argument of Rodgers and Baillieu, and the other members of the metal &#39;gang, that the flooding of the market with a large number of these German shares at this particular juncture would destroy the value of their shares. That would be a perfectly legitimate consideration for the Government to take into account, but if that is the reason . for not selling the shares, why do not the Government say so ? Do not make bogus excuses or pretences. Do not tell the people that you have eradicated&#39; the last element of German influence when you have not. Say straightforwardly that the reason you axe not putting the shares on the market is that the flooding of the market -with the property of Germans would depreciate the value of the shares of other large holders in the metal companies of &#39; the Commonwealth. Those shares could not be put on the market without destroying the value of the shares of the metal gang, and they had to choose between the interests of their pockets and the interests of their country - whether they should lose money or should destroy the Germanic influence, and take away German interests in Australian industry. Faced with that alternative, they said, &#34; Let the Germans retain their interests rather than that we should lose any of the value of our shares.&#34; </para>

On the other hand, we are now again told that they are to be sold forthwith. </para>

                        <para>To-day the Labour newspapers of the country are almost entirely the only papers which are subjected to the censorship. Those journals are not  allowed to publish, what is allowed to be published in the daily press. If a Labour journal seeks to republish a paragraph published in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> or the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> it must submit the matter, to the censor:  When the matter is. submitted, the paragraph is eliminated; and if it is not submitted, the Labour paper is prosecuted. In regard to the matter which we wished to republish from the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> after we had been prosecuted, we submitted the matter to the censor. He cut out half of it, and said we could publish the balance. We could publish the essential facts, but we might not comment upon them. At the end of this <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> notice, which was signed by the Minister for Trade and Customs &#34; by  His  Excellency&#39;s Command,&#34; there appeared the words &#34; God Save ,the King.&#34; So I wrote at the head of my article, &#34; God save the- King.&#34; What could be more loyal? But - the official censored &#34; God save the King.&#34; I objected to my loyalty being brought into -question in that manner, and I asked, &#34;Why censor &#39;God save the King &#39; ?&#34; The answer I received was, &#34; I do not think you mean it.&#34; So it is right through&#39; the piece. Publish &#34; Three cheers for France,&#34; well and good; publish &#34;Three cheers for Italy,&#34; all right; but attempt to publish &#34; Three cheers for Japan,&#39;&#39; and out it goes, because &#34; We do not think you mean it.&#34; They censor not only what you write, but what they think you mean.&#39; Here is a paragraph  that appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Broadmeadows Camp Sentry,</inline> a little paper published by the Sportsmen&#39;s Thousand - </para>

Here is another instance : Herbert Brookes said &#34; he preferred German militarism to Australian unionism.&#34; He was allowed to make that statement, and it was published throughout Australia. </para>

Perhaps I shall save a lot of time and argument if I tell the honorable member that I think Australian unionism should be stamped out in the same way as German militarism. If it cannot be done by the ordinary processes of the law, we are rapidly marching to the stage when it will probably be done at the point of the bayonet. If the remark made by Brookes was not calculated to create discord, what was? .1 proposed to write, in reply, &#34; Brookes and his crowd want conscription, not to win the war, but to smash unionism.&#34; If Brookes could make his statement, had I not a perfect right to make the other remark in reply? I did not object to the liberty given him.  His  remark did not help the enemy; it did not stop recruiting; but when I retorted that Brookes was not trying to win the war, but to smash unionism, the censor intervened. Where is the justice in that? These censors draw about &#163;30,000 a year in salaries. The salaries . of the censors in this State would amount  to about &#163;8,000, but the, majority of papers &#39;in Melbourne are not censored at&#39; all. There are newspaper offices in this city which the censor never enters, and whose publications he never looks at; but any little Labour journal suspected of radical tendencies - whether it be the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin,</inline> the <inline font-style="italic">Labour Gall,</inline> or any other - may not print a line that &#34; Brown is going to sell sausages to-morrow &#34; unless it submits the matter to the censor, and then he would probably delete the paragraph on the ground that it might refer to German sausages. </para>

                                <para>- The censor went on to say that I would not be prevented from using such words &#34; if the context of such statement is unobjectionable.&#34; He feared that my object was to show that the Prime Minister was not helping to win the war. Are statements made by me to be censored merely because they are &#34;objectionable &#34; ? There is only one sound principle to be observed in any interference with the liberty of the press. The right to publish any statement should be determined by the question of whether or not that statement is injurious to the . country, or is calculated to help the enemy, or to stop recruiting. In this article, I had not a word to say which would come under any of those headings. I merely proposed to show how the Prime Minister was doing his utmost to win the war. The censor, in this letter, went on to say, however, that the context was &#34;objectionable,&#34; and that the same remark applied to another article entitled &#34;God save the King.&#34; I was at perfect liberty, he said, to print those words as often as I desired, provided that they conveyed no objectionable meaning. In other words, he said, &#34;You are. at liberty to print the words as often as you like, if you mean what you say, but I am not sure that you do.&#34; The deletion of the words &#34; Three cheers for Japan!&#34; was also held to be correct, because, read in conjunction with the rest of the article, the implication, &#34;whether sarcastic or not,&#34; was not permissible. In other words, I must not publish anything that is sarcastic. The censor said, further, that I would not be allowed to state that the daily press of 15th June had announced that hundreds of pianos were about to arrive &#34;from Japan. An announcement had appeared in the daily press to that effect, and I desired to reprint , it. I wished to give the public the benefit of the knowledge that they could get good, cheap Japanese pianos. Why should that knowledge be denied them? I wanted to make known the fact, but the censor said, in effect, &#34; We will not allow you to publish it, because there- is an objectionable context to the statement.&#34; My remarks, apparently, were considered to &#39; be satirical, and, therefore, could not be published. This, then, is the state of human liberty in Australia. </para>

                                <para>- I was careful to use the words &#34; more or less.&#34; As a matter of fact, the basement was crowded with police. I went down to have a look at them. I also wished to give the people the information that a fire brigade was close at hand with about a thousand yards of . hose ready to squirt water on the people outside this building. I was not allowed however, to make known that fact to the general public. Why was my question suppressed ? The answer is that the Government did not want the country to know what was being done in that direction.. Such absurdities of suppression do no good to the Government or any one else. </para>

                        <para>There are two fundamental facts with which I have dealt. The first has reference to the outrageous censorship unfairly and improperly exercised, and the second relates to the assertions which have been made as to the extermination of German influence in Australia. That, assertion is a fraud on the public. German ownership in the industries of Australia is as great as it was at the beginning of the war. I do not believe that the Prime Minister - I shall say nothing about his colleagues - has any real intention of eradicating German holdings in the industries of Australia. When the war is over those interests are going back to Germanic companies, and the talk that we have heard as to the eradication of German influence is the biggest flam that was ever perpetrated upon a great Democracy. </para>

At the same time, I feel that he has raised a very grave issue, the importance of which has been emphasized by the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey).</inline> As one who took a very keen interest in the efforts made to eradicate the German interests in the Australian metal industry,I feel that the country is entitled to. know whether or not any direct German interests will benefit in the use that has been made of our base metals since the outbreak of the war. The whole matter ought to be cleared up. </para>

                                <para>- As I pointed out while the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey)</inline> was speaking, the market value of these base metals to-day is very different from what it was when steps were . taken to eradicate the German interests in these companies. Immediately after the outbreak of war there was an almost complete dislocation of the trade, but soon after it was put on a different footing. And it is the position at that stage which ought to be definitely cleared up. If the statements which the honorable member for Capricornia and the honorable member for Bourke have made are true in substance, then we have not tackled this question as we should have done. The honorable member for Bourke mentioned a man in the public life of Australia who, he said, had, before the war, some association with German  interests.  The nature of that association or connexion the honorable member  did  not tell us, but he went on to say that today this public man had resumed his former relationship with the&#39; German companies. That is a very grave charge, and it cannot be allowed to rest where  it is.  If, in Australia, any man during the course of this the most bloody war in the history&#34; of mankind, has allowed himself to be associated with enemy interests, then the matter cannot be allowed to rest where it is. Those responsible for the statement, as well as the gentleman named, and the Prime Minister, who has handled this question from the first, cannot allow  it  to stop where it is. </para>

                        <para>Coming to the question of the ownership and value of these shares, there must be something wrong&#34; with the trusteeship which has been set up in respect of those shares if residents of Germany are still allowed to participate in the profits made by the companies concerned as the result of the base metal industries of Australia. The honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> made a clear-cut distinction between international policy with regard to territory taken, in war and the individual rights in property of the citizens of belligerent countries. Between the two he drew a clear line of demarcation, and I hold that in the trusteeship under discussion an equally clear line should be drawn. On the day on which these shares were taken over they should have been valued, and any subsequent increase in their value should go to the Empire, and not to Germany. </para>

                        <para>I now come to a subject that was raised in the House yesterday.1 I refer to the unique opportunity that is afforded to Australia at the present time to obtain . some of the blood stock of Britain, which is the finest in the world. This is one of the most valuable assets of the Old Country, and it has taken not generations, but centuries, to. create.  Unfortunately, owing to the war, the studmasters there find themselves placed under very restricted conditions, and they are compelled to disperse some of the studs in their possession. Recently, at the instance of yourself, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker,</inline> the House considered very carefully the question of blood horse breeding as a sound basis of a defence system. Personally, I have taken much interest in horse breeding, arid I think I can, with , all modesty, say that if we wish to perpetuate a high type of animal, the foundation must be pure blood. Many of the great studmasters of the Old Country are men of landed estate; but, with a complete disregard of their life&#39;s work, and the work of their fathers before them, they are prepared, in a patriotic spirit, to disperse their studs in order that the land may be put to the production of corn and other foodstuffs for the people. Our climate is, perhaps, even better suited for breeding than that of Great Britain, and now, when our larders are full, we have, as I say, an excellent opportunity to lay the foundation of what ought, in the future, to be the greatest studs in the world. The French Government, I may point out, have paid as much as &#163;22,000 for one good sire in England ; and though we do not wish to take advantage of the studmasters at Home in their present circumstances, we should awake to the opportunity that is now presented, when these great studs are to be scattered to the. four quarters of the earth. </para>
                        <para>I should not appeal so strongly were it not a fact that private individuals are, iri a great measure, prevented, almost debarred, by the restrictions on shipping under the control of the British and Australian Governments, from themselves embarking on the project. The brains, business capacity, and foresight of the studmasters of Australia account for the high _ standard of our own flocks and herds; and I am sure there is sufficient enterprise left to secure further improvements. I suggest that the Government get quickly into communication with the British Government, in order that we may secure a supply &#39;of brood mares and sires with which to found what, as I have said, should be the most famous studs the world has even seen. </para>

                            <para>.- The question of German .financial interests in Australian mineral ventures is one the discussion of which I do not think any honorable member regrets. When it was first raised, the proposal was to force a sale of German share holdings throughout Australia. I pointed out as forcibly as I was able to the Minister who was then acting for the Prime Minister that the action &#39;proposed could* not help the Australian mineral industry, and must inevitably help the German shareholders. To force a sale at a time when the disturbance of the money market would detrimentally affect the Australian Treasury -to what extent I am not in a position to state - and would give these German shareholders the capitalized value of the war values of &#39; the minerals produced, would manifestly be. bad policy. I suggested that the proper course to adopt was for the Government to take some steps which would insure these German shareholders being absolutely debarred from exercising any influence in the control or governance of the companies in which they were shareholders. I have since suggested to the Government that they ought either to arrange to credit the public trustee with the values of these German holdings at the date of the declaration of war, or hold them until after the war, and then sell the shares and grant the proceeds to the German holders. </para>

                                <para>- I do not know that we are compelled to make provision for these increases in dividends to.-go to German shareholders. Germany . broke the world&#39;s peace, and I think  German  shareholders must take their share of the responsibility of the German people. So far as the capital value of the shares is concerned, undoubtedly they are entitled only to what the shares were worth at the time that we extended Australian  hospitality  to. them and their money. As to subsequent increases in dividends, what right have these German shareholders to them, considering that their own Government has brought about the intense suffering to the British and other peoples in the world, which the. metals produced help to avenge. </para>

                        <para>I have risen this afternoon not so much to deal with the question of German shareholders as to draw the attention of honorable members to what I consider to be a false step either already taken - I am informed it has been gazetted, though I cannot find the notice - or proposed to be taken in connexion with&#39; another aspect of German ownership. I refer to &#34; good-will &#34; in German trade. It is now a considerable time since I urged upon the Government .of the day, led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> and subsequently on the first Hughes Administration, the desirableness of killing German good-will here by abolishing the use of German trade names and descriptions The House was given to understand that that - course was to be followed, and, I think, with two exceptions it was followed. In one of these cases the persons who got the licence to produce under a German trade name have ceased to use it; and now; to my intense astonishment and regret, I find it is actually proposed to abolish the German copyright in those trade names and descriptions, and allow any manufacturer in Australia, who desires to make immediate profit, to popularise them by using them indiscriminately. I cannot imagine any way better calculated to help German trade good-will in this country. </para>
                        <para>The more people we have turning out goods under German names and descriptions, the more surely will Germany profit in Australia after the war is over. In the drug trade, for instance, the trade names are merely coined names for mercantile dealing in certain well-known com-: pounds. The ingredients of the- drugs are thoroughly well known, and there is no particular fetish in the trade names. But these names have received a value because of the great commercial efficiency of the German agents in this country and throughout the world. The public have been led to believe there is some particular magic in the drug covered by the name. There is no magic, but the public believe there is, just as an African fetish worshipper believes there is some magic in the .fetish behind the priest. </para>
                        <para>We shall have a whole host of persons turning out, for instance, aspirin, and all competing in articles under that name. </para>
                        <para class="block">When the war is over, and the Germans come here, they will proceed to sell the drug under the name which they have popularised. Their agents will say, &#34; Now we offer you the real original article&#34;; and there is no doubt that the Australian public will flock to buy what is offered. As a very reasonable course, which the Government ought to have followed on its own initiative nearly two years ago, I have suggested that we get into touch with the British Government, and all the allied Governments, and arrive at a common list of synonyms for all these drugs. </para>

                                <para>- Occasionally that is too long,&#39; as, for instance, in the case of aspirin, the formula of which is acetyl-salicylic acid. As a matter of - fact, there is no particular reason why we should not call a drug what we. choose; and I would point out&#39; that one synonym for this drug, suggested in Sydney, was eutosal. If we could arrange with all the allied peoples that particular drugs shall be sold in - allied countries only under synonyms fixed upon, we should at one stroke of the pen, while the war is still on, wipe out existing German good-will in the trade for ever. </para>

                                <para>- I think that that should have been done by democracies at the beginning, - and not left until this period. In nothing has the public been so exploited to its detriment as in the selling of quack medicines, the misuse of which, in many cases, does more harm than the drugs properly applied could do good.. But I am not dealing with that aspect of the matter now; my aim is the killing in this country of German goodwill in drugs. The only argument with which I have been met is that the terms of peace will decide these things. I wish to expose the futility of that argument, and to warn honorable members against being too optimistic about the conditions of peace. &#39; It is ludicrous to say, when engaged in a life and death struggle, &#34; Put this matter off until we have the other side down.&#34; We have a chance now, by mere secretarial action, to do lasting good to our own people, and lasting damage to our enemies.. Why, then, wait for the conclusion of peace? I do not want my words to be exaggerated or misunderstood, but I venture to say that any concession obtained by agreement from Germany for the destruction of her post-war trade will bethe most difficult that we can extort from her. To talk of such things at a peace conference will be the surest way of consolidating German opinion against peace. I believe that, as the pressure of war becomes more and more intolerable in Germany, we shall gain unofficial allies there in the great producing and manufacturing interests which are threatened with utter ruin. Those connected with such industries will shortly begin - if they have not already started  - to influence their Government in favour of peace. But we shall drive them into the other camp, and make them, for their own preservation, implore their Government! to&#39; wage the war to the bitter end, if we try to get what we want in this matter by arrangement with Germany. The best way to deal with the thing is here and now, and in concert with our Allies, as an ordinary act of domestic administration. We have the power. </para>

German merchants will not be able to say after the war, &#34; .This is the original secret preparation, the only valid drug.&#34; They will have to sell their drugs under our&#39; trade names, stating as well, if you like, the formula of every preparation, and they will have to compete with Australian manufacturers on fair terms. There will be no resurrected fetish, to be used to their advantage. </para>

                                <para>- My present object is the public good in this matter. Personally, I would put the Australian manufacturers on the same plane as all others by requiring them to state their formulae. But I want the Government, .now, to say under what names these articles shall be sold. If that is done throughout the allied countries we shall kill for all time the preying on the ignorance and credulity of the masses, which has brought great gain to Germany. I urge the Government to take immediate action. The only answer that I have received to my most recent representations on the subject is that the matter will receive consideration. The Attorney-General&#39;s Department is so congested that very little gets beyond&#39; that stage there. </para>

I know something of the work that he has done in exposing the actions of certain German concerns here in regard to which the Government&#39; have not been so firm as. he and I could have wished. From my student days at St. Mary&#39;s, I have advocated the nationalization of medicine, and I should like the Government to insist that no medicine shall be sold in Australia unless its complete formula is stated on the bottle containing  it. </para>

                                <para>- That increases my respect for the honorable member. Perhaps in .the future we may together advance this matter. I have, ever since my* student days, resented the giving of. fictitious names to medicines. This disguises their value, because it makes it impossible to ascertain the bed-rock prices of the drugs of which they are composed. In my student days I advocated the nationalization of the public health, and I do it still in my advanced years. A man&#39;s . health is more to him than his houses or lands, and should not be treated as casually as it is often treated how. A man who is earning from &#163;3 to &#163;4 per week will frequently continue at work although unwell, because, unless a member of a friendly society, he cannot afford medical advice and the loss of. time which treatment involves. Those who have experience of animals know that horses, dogs, cattle, and sheep lie down when they are ill. They do not, like human beings, force themselves to work. No drug should be permitted to be sold under a name which will impart to it mysterious properties. Let the formula be on the bottle, and let the price qf the drugs that are used be known. Many years ago the firm of Rothschild increased the price of mercury and iodide of potash to such an extent that the Lock Hospital at which I was then an. officer was unable to buy sufficient iodide of potash, then the accepted and best cure foi* that terrible disease syphilis, but, because of this accursed war, and I believe, too, .of men&#39;s greed for gold, the price of these drugs is even higher to-day than it was at the time of which I speak. Iodide of potash was 20s. per lb. then, but there are drugs whose price in Australia has increased 1,700 per cent. during the present war. This is an infamy. </para>

                                <para>- Yes. For the last quarter of a century I have been advocating the&#39; affixing to each bottle of medicine of the formula of the preparation. I believe that I was the first student in my hospital to advocate the nationalization of medicine, but now some of the greatest minds that have illumined the practice of surgery and. medicine hold that it should be under control. The Government should adopt a strong hand in regard to the practice of drug taking. I would not allow any drug to be sold except under its proper formula. Every honorable member must have had experience of the sad effects of the drug habit. That habit . is increased, I think, by the mystery attaching to certain names. I hope that in the future no firm will be able to sell drugs under the name of a patent medicine, but that the formula must be stated in every case. This will do much to prevent the accursed drug habit by tearing away the veil of mystery that now surrounds many preparations. I hope that when the turmoil of this war has ceased we shall nationalize medicine. Health is too sacred a thing to be at the mercy of any man. Thank God, there are very few doctors who are not beyond reproach ! There is no profession in the world with so large a percentage of men in it interested in the welfare of mankind. That profession certainly does give to 1, 2, or 3 per cent. of its practitioners opportunities to benefit themselves  at the expense of their fellows, and to utilize the exigencies of the war to extort high prices. I hope that, if it should be necessary, all the profits that the exigencies of the war have permitted the holders of drugs to obtain, will be taken from them. If I could sway the Government, I would urge them to take over every increase in the price of drugs that has not been brought about actually by the war. I hope I can impress on the minds of honorable members that health is a sacred quality, and that no drug should be sold under a name unless the formula is on the bottle. Thus, the friends of those who are the victims of the drug habit can see when those unfortunates are taking too large quantities of drugs, and can advise them to give up the habit. I would like to see the Government control the whole of the drug industry. For a quarter of a century I have been advocating the nationalization of medicine. Health is too sacred a matter to be exploited in order to sell secret remedies, or for purposes which the Germans have shown themselves <inline font-style="italic">facile princeps</inline> in employing. </para>

We should be able to control everything from the time that it comes through the Customs House until it is sold. We should not permit it to bo adulterated or interfered with in any way before it reaches the buyer in a State. If we have not the necessary legislation, let us pass it, so that this Parliament, which is the dominant Parliament in the Commonwealth, may have control over&#39; these matters. It . is ridiculous that any article should be permitted to come&#39; into the community and be injuriously adulterated, and that the Commonwealth should have no control over the article once it has passed through the Customs. </para>

Money,. buildings, and wealth are nothing in comparison with that God-given power which* we know as health; and if the Government would help in the matter of the nationalization of medicine, they would have no keener follower than myself, even though I should be sitting in Opposition. I trust that the words of the honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Kelly)</inline> will bear fruit. I hope that  the Government will give consideration to the matter ; and I trust that we, will follow the splendid lead that Western Australia has set. Every Australian should have a fair chance of living a healthy and long life. </para>

                            <para>.- Several young fellows living in the Calare electorate have passed the necessary examinations to qualify them for- commissions in the Australian Imperial Force, but, as they were not twenty-three years of age at the time of qualifying for the position of second lieutenant, they were prevented from holding commissions. Not wishing to enlist as privates, they had to retire from the Australian Imperial Force, but many of them paid their own fares to the Old Country, and, on arriving there, received commissions in the Imperial Army. In fact, I understand, 1,000 young Australians have done so ; but they prefer to work with Australians, and to  lead Australians at the Front. The Imperial Government permits officers twenty-one years of age to hold rank at the Front, but the minimum age is twenty-three years in connexion with the Australian Imperial Force. I do not know why this discrimination exists. Two or three of these young fellows cabled to me recently asking me to do my level best to get the Federal Government to remove the prohibition against their employment as officers of the&#39; Australian Imperial Force, on account of their not being twenty-three years of age. They are anxious to join the Australian Forces, and to lead Australians at the Front. If the Imperial Government will allow lieutenants twenty-one years of age to lead men, why should we not fall into line? There should be some co-ordination in this matter. </para>

                        <para>This afternoon I submitted a question in. regard to ..the attacks which were made_ yesterday afternoon on the room in which the One- Woman-One-Recruit  League, meets in Melbourne. There are about 260 ladies in ,that league. Each member endeavours to secure one recruit for the Australian Imperial Force, &#39; and having secured him, looks after his welfare and the welfare- of his parents, wife, or children, and follows him after he leaves Australia, supplying him with papers and parcels, and so forth. I was astonished on reading the paper this morning to see that any set of people in Australia would so far forget themselves as to attack this very patriotic band of women. Yet the so-called pacifists, who assembled outside Parliament House yesterday, made a wicked and malicious attack on the members of this league, who had assembled in their room for the best of worthy purposes. <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Brock,</inline> a lady who lost her&#39; husband at &#39;Gallipoli last year, and who has five children, was very roughly handled by a crowd who broke in on them. The Government should afford these women sufficient protection. In my opinion those who broke into the league&#39;s room should not have been permitted to leave. They should have been arrested and called to account for -their action. The Government ought to take the matter into serious consideration, because the One- Woman-One-Recruit League &#34;is an. association which has the best of objects, and is one that should be encouraged in every shape or form. </para>

                            <para>. - This .afternoon we have heard a great deal about German interests and German names. I agree that the German who gives trouble should not receive the benefit of having his shares held for him and sold at a high figure, but it is hard to&#62; fix the right price for a German&#39;s shares. If we fix a pre-wartime the shares&#39; may be worth less now. If we fix on a certain price after the war the shares may be made worth more then . than they were before the war. The only thing is to deal with each case on its merits. I suggest that the best way in which to fix the German and injure him is to take the lowest price whereever it is. In common with many others, I considered that the Prime Minister,&#39; when he dealt with the metal question, had done a great stroke for the people of Australia. When the war broke out our metal industry looked to be in a very bad position, but the Prime Minister called a conference, and came to the relief of the industry, and everything was supposed to go on smoothly. The German interest was to be wiped out, and. the Britishers were to receive the benefit&#39;  of the profits. It is very evident, however, that this did not take place. From what we learn from the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey)</inline> nothing has been settled; nothing of a tangible character has been done to see that the Prime Minister&#39;s intention was carried out. I am one of those who hope that something will be done in that direction, because, with our knowledge of German instinct for business, I feel certain that those shareholders will see that their interests are safeguarded. I remember speaking at a meeting one night in commendation of the action of* the Prime Minister in arranging to oust the Germans from the metal industry, and to insure the predominance of British control. An individual whom I had never met before spoke after me and smote me hip and thigh, and asked me to point out the difference between exploitation by the German capitalists and exploitation by the British capitalists. He said he would just as soon be starved by a German as by a Britisher. He evidently knew a good deal about the metal trade, because he showed that by the arrangement made by the Prime Minister the opportunity would still remain for Germans to receive benefits from&#39; their interests in the metal trade, whilst the British or neutral shareholder would be able to make fortunes out of the people. We know that since the outbreak of war the prices of metals have risen enormously. The cost of production, we are told, fixes the prices of commodities, but that was not the governing factor in connexion with the increase in the price of metals, and. my critic on that occasion was right when he charged me with having supported a Prime Minister who had not considered the interests of the people. At that time I was a supporter of the Prime Minister, and I understood that the arrangement he had made would insure that whilst the Germans got no benefits from the metal industry, neither would&#34; other capitalists be allowed to exploit the people. Instead of that being the effect of the Government policy, the&#34; metal companies have been allowed to make large fortunes. </para>

                                <para>- That man may be all right; but I am alluding to the employees oh the large mines who, when they approached the owners for better wages on account of the increased cost of living, were refused because the profits which the companies had made were needed to pay the war-time profits tax. I am sorry to say that if the Bill now before the House is passed in its present form they will not pay those profits to the Government. The Prime Minister has yet to answer the charge made to-day by the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey),</inline> and we desire an assurance that whilst the Government are preventing the Germans from getting benefits from our metal industries&#39; during the war, they will also see that the men to whom the law has given an opportunity of earning big profits shall not exploit the people. I agree with the man who said that it would be just as well to be starved by a German capitalist as by a British capitalist. I am willing to prevent the German capitalist from . making money out of the horror that is taking place in Europe, for whilst many of my party do not agree that the Germans were responsible for the war, I say they were. At the same time, I say. that British capitalists ought not to be allowed to make the enormous profits that are being made . out of the metal industry owing to the arrangement which the Prime Minister made in the interests of the British people. No Government will be doing its duty which does not look very carefully into this matter, with a view, firstly, to preventing Germans getting the benefit of the Australian conditions which they are fighting to destroy, and, secondly, to insure that the British or&#39; neutral capitalists shall not amass fortunes by reason of the conditions brought about by the war. </para>

                                <para>- It is very evident that German interests are reaping profits from the metal trade of Australia, and that no official system has yet been devised to prevent their doing so. The moneyed interests which control the metal shows of Australia are amassing large profits. They are securing large dividends, and are also placing large amounts <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> reserve funds, ostensibly to meet their war-time &#34;profits taxation. I am surprised that the Treasurer, knowing that all this money has been banked, ready to, meet his demands, does not propose to take it. </para>

                                <para>- I believe I can explain why no full and complete action has been taken to prevent German interests reaping these profits. We all know that the large moneyed interests of the world move within certain circles. If, for instance, it was proposed to float a railway company in the Old World, the prospectus would be placed on the market in which it is known that the railway moneyed circle operates. Again, if it were proposed to float a gold-mine, the promoters would go to the circle which deals in gold-mining ventures; or if a big electrical company were to be floated, the promoters would go on the market in which the big electrical investors operate There is also a very large circle which, deals only with metals. If the shares held by Germans in the Australian metal companies were sold with the object of ridding Australia of the -German interest, the very circle which held those shares would repurchase them. We have in Victoria a body or syndicate or company of men headed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Baillieu,</inline> who is, admittedly, one of the best financiers in Australia, and whose advice was sought by the Government when we were considering the financial situation at the outbreak of the war. He is largely&#39; interested in the metal industry, and it is understood that he represents German money handled by the metal section. If these shares that were held by Germans were sold to-morrow, would we have any assurance that German money would not again be invested in them? Try as we will, we cannot hope to get rid of this Germ&#39;an interest. I need not enter into a discussion of the way in which German interests are bound up and interwoven with the various metal companies; it is well known .that it is impossible to separate them from the other moneyed interests of the world. That is one reason why .this question has not been handled as it should have been. Why then should we not candidly make this admission ? Why do we not say that all the talk as to the eradication of German interests in the metal industries of Australia was so much make-believe, with the object of raising false hopes in the minds of the people and to enable the moneyed interests involved in the trade to reap larger profits than before. I am very pleased that this question has been raised to-day. In view of what has been said, it is impossible that the Ministry should refrain from making a plain statement on the subject. </para>

                        <para>I wish now to say a few words in regard to the great war. It is quite unnecessary that I should explain, at the outset, that my British sympathies are as  strong  as those of any mam t We belong to a race that feels that it is &#39; never beaten, but it would be folly on our part not to recognise that there are other races who entertain the same feeling with regard to themselves. This horrible war is going on, and a man dare not raise his voice on the question of peace terms lest he be called a pro-German. That is the position in every British community. It is nonsense, how- - ever, for us to say that we are going to bring the German to his knees. Beading between the lines, I believe that he has &#34;had enough, and is willing to accept peace; but I do not believe that we can hope to enter Berlin within the next decade. In. these circumstances, why should a large section of the people, and their representatives, insist on saying, &#34; We are going&#39; to bring the German to his knees, and will not talk of peace until we do &#34; ? I think the British Government made a big mistake in refusing to allow representatives of Labour in Great Britain to meet Labour representatives of other countries at the Stockholm Conference. It is quite possible that no benefit may &#39; result from that Conference, but I think, nevertheless, that Labour in Great Britain should have been represented at it. The working section of &#60; the British Empire are just as strong in their love of country, and just &#39;as patriotic as are the workers of any other land, and their representatives at such a Conference would take care that their love of country was upheld. </para>

I should like to know whether the British Government and our Allies are determined that there shall be no peace until the Germans sue on their knees for it, or until the Allied Forces enter Berlin. If they are, then I am afraid that at least another 1,000,000 lives will he sacrificed, and much more; misery and starvation will Have to be endured. </para>

                                <para>- That is quite beside the question. If we were to refrain from speaking on any subject until we were sure our words would have some effect, then I am afraid we should have but few reforms. It is not for me to attempt to lay down peace terms; but those who have the destinies of the, whole world in their hands should make some statement as to the terms on which they would consider peace proposals. That would not be unmanly on their part, nor would it lead the Germans to believe that we felt we were beaten, or were craving for peace. The first and paramount condition of peace should be that a repetition of the horrors of war shall be rendered impossible. </para>

                                <para>- Admittedly.; but does the honorable member seriously believe, as. some do, that we can hope to beat the Germans to their knees? Above all other things, after this war there should be no more large standing armies or fleets. Let us think for a moment of the indebtedness we in Australia shall have incurred in connexion with the . present war. If, after the war is over, we are still to maintain a large standing army and a big fleet, with all their appurtenances, the taxation of the Commonwealth will be enormous. The obligations that we have already to meet are such as to strain the skill of . the financiers &#39;of Australia for many years. If, when this war is over, we are to have a large army and a big fleet, with dockyards, naval bases, and so forth, -the position will be preposterous: Britain and her Allies should tell Germany that . this fight will go on until we are assured that there will be no possibility of any more horrors such as the war in which we have been so long engaged. Then they should say to Germany&#34;, &#34; You brought about this horror. You overran Belgium, Serbia, and a large part of France, carrying devastation wherever you went. You shall make reparation for every tree and house you wantonly destroyed.&#34; That should be the second condition of peace. As to the acquisition of territory, I am going to make a statement, which I do not expect will receive the. commendation of the House. It is this: That the captured German colonies near Australia are not worth fighting about. They are not worth considering. </para>

It is of no use to the Commonwealth so far as its occupation by white men is concerned. And so I say that the question of the retention of captured German territories could be readily settled. The time may come when we shall be glad to have on the islands near our shores white instead of coloured men.

                        <para>I have been suggesting what I think might be put forward as our minimum peace terms. As to Poland and Alsace-Lorraine, the question of what shall be done with them is on all fours with that of the question of Home Rule for Ireland. It should be left to the people of those countries to deal with, and not , to the consideration of men who have not for those particular countries the feelings that their own people have. I maintain that Britain and her Allies would not show any sign of weakness in demanding what I have suggested as minimum peace terms. I would not have peace for one jot less. As to conquered territory, the British, in times gone by, have been just as flagrant in . their actions, and just as much to blame, as have other countries. It is high time that we considered the matter. . Millions of men are being killed and maimed ; and yet those of us who talk of peace are charged with being pro-Germans. We should suggest terms of peace, showing the irreducible minimum that we can accept, always providing for reparation for the injury done.

                                <para>- The honorable member will agree with rae that we are fighting only for peace. We hear the bald statement that we must &#34; bring Germany to her knees,&#34; and it is apparently forgotten that, in the process, millions more will be killed and. maimed. If we can&#39; attain all that is necessary for humanity without this slaughter, why not do so ? When a man takes the attitude that I do now, he is, as I say, &#39;regarded as pro-German, or his intelligence is doubted. Personally, I do&#39; not care if my intelligence is doubted, nor do I care if I am charged with being pro-German, for those who know me best will not believe it. In common with others, I have friends at the Front; and I know that day after day fresh armies are sent there, with the sole object of ultimate peace, and the punishment of those who caused the war. If we can attain that end now, why not ? If we continue fighting on it will certainly leave us open to the charge, so frequently made, that this is only a trade and commercial war. I do not- believe it is a trade war as far as Britain is concerned. </para>

Much of that might be very -well left unsaid, for the main thing is to finish the war. I can understand the feelings of honorable members towards myself, for I have exactly similar feelings towards those who talk of peace without reparation. It is a question of degree; and, in my opinion, the view I take is the more sane one. </para>

                                <para>- If an international arrangement of the kind were made, with all the countries in it, the self-interest of each nation would prevent any repetition of the actions of Germany. Does any one believe that if Germany could go back to July, 1914, she would again inflict these horrors on the world ? People talk of  &#34; bringing Germany to her knees,&#34; but the Germans are like ourselves ; if  they  ave beaten, they decline to admit it. Now that the United States of America have entered the conflict the whole civilized world is involved, the small European neutrals being kept out only by fear. In my opinion, there will be no&#39; more &#34; scraps of paper,&#34; because no country would dare to .do in the future what Germany has done in this connexion. I will leave the matter at that. </para>

This company, although called &#39;&#39; British,&#34; has not a single British shareholder. It is registered&#39; in Great Britain, and there are half-a-dozen men there who own one share each, the object, of course, being to legalize the formation of the company. In proportion to the very large business that the company does, there are very few Australians employed by, it. The company does employ 17,000 Malays. </para>

Under such conditions as these the company seeks to secure, the trade of the people of Australia.

                        <para>The importation of &#34; Shell &#34; benzine to Australia, which is claimed &#39;to be of great value and importance to this country, is really to th*&#187; disadvantage of the pro-  ducers  of Australia; and that is a fact which I wish to drive home. The total imports of this stuff from the Dutch East Indies, is, approximately, 50,000 tons a year. This, of course. is not a large trade; but, still, we ought to secure all the outward shipping possible. The commodity is brought in tank steamers to our ports, where it is pumped into tanks on the shore, employing practically no labour. The vessels then pump water in for ballast, and go away without any of the produce of Australia. </para>
                        <para>Shipping i*. ot all things, essential to us at the present ti  inn  This benzine, if it did not come from the&#39; Dutch East Indies, would certainly come from the United States of America, which is now&#39; in alliance with ourselves. I am very glad to know that the present Government are seeking to make shipping arrangements by which there will be a considerable increase in the importations from America- If, in addition to other imports, these vessels from America brought the petrol and benzine we require, they would be available for conveying our wheat and other produce to the markets of the world. </para>

                                <para>- That is so. I venture to think that, if we inquired, we should find that the employees who are spoken of as Australians could1 be really classified, for the most part, as Dutch. Of course, it is very questionable whether they are really  Dutch,  because there has been much transferring from one nation,ality to another in order to meet war conditions. At any rate, they are not true sons of Australia, but of alien race. The letter goes on to say - </para>

                        <para class="block">Is it a &#34; pleasant reflection &#34; to think that, in buying this benzine, we are benefiting alien races ? My object is to let the public know the facts, for then the advantage of closer trading relations with our Allies in the United States of America would be appreciated. I believe that these people are more sympathetic wilh our enemies than with us, and if our enemies were to determine to&#39; enlarge the sphere of their submarine warfare, it would be most advantageous to them to be able to &#39;get from these neutrals on the high seas the first essential to the Working of a submarine. This is a big consideration. I hope that the Government, when it has concluded arrangements with our Ally, the United States of America, for working in unison in regard to shipping, will say, &#34; We shall not allow produce to come to this country except in cargo ships suitable for the conveyance of our produce to other parts of the world.&#34; </para>

                        <para>I draw attention bo another point in connexion with the company, and that is that, under its articles of association, it has but one director, Detterding, and its shares are held not by individuals, but by other companies with which it is interlocked. When, in the last Parliament, I moved the adjournment of the House to draw attention to this matter, I pointed out some of the peculiarities of the balance-sheets of the company, but as my time was somewhat limited, 1 was not able to emphasize this particular point. Undoubtedly a company such as this, whose shares are held by other companies, &#34;can  bo  juggle with figures as to show a loss where otherwise a profit would have to be shown. The Government, and the Treasurer in particular, should look into the financing of this concern. On the occasion to which 1 have referred, 1 quoted from the balance-sheets of the company to show . that it has been working here at nominally a great loss, but we know - and the keenness to get trade displayed in this letter is evidence of it - that it is making great profits out of its Australian business. </para>

The company has sent out broadcast over this country a letter in which it tries to make it appear that &#34; Shell &#34; benzine . should be used in preference to any other. There is no justification on the score of quality for using that brand of benzine in preference to any other, because oil of the highest quality is obtainable in the United &#39; States of America, nor is there any justification on the score of price, because there are American oils which can be obtained for less; I speak with knowledge, as being one of the oldest motorists in Australia. </para>

Moreover, its use prevents Australia from getting shipping which would take its products to other parts of the world, and it gives employment, for the most part, to the people of coloured races. I say, in reply to this impudent letter, that the people who consult their own interests will not use this particular commodity, and I say fairly and squarely that I would hit the company in the face in regard to this matter. The users of &#34; Shell &#34; benzine, moreover, use it to the disadvantage of the Commonwealth as a whole. I say that those who exhibit boards advertising the fact that &#34; Shell &#34; benzine, imported by the British Imperial Oil Company, is to be had within, would, if they were true to their best interests, pull them down, and deal in benzine calculated to give better results to Australia as a whole, and at least equally good results so far as car owners are concerned. </para>

When the honorable member spoke of himself as one of the oldest motorists in Australia, it occurred to me that his trumpeter must be dead, since he was reduced to blowing his own trumpet. We know that there are two companies in Australia which compete for the sale of benzine and petrol. The honorable member has told us that when he last discussed this matter on a motion for the adjournment, of the House, he was prevented, by want of time, from placing his case fully before honorable members. But I find that he was granted an extension of time in order that he might state his case fully.

It states that the company employs Australians. Its casing and tinning is done in Australia. This is a Protectionist Parliament,, and honorable members, generally, will hold that it is better for this tinning and casing to be done here than Outside the Commonwealth. </para>

                                <para>- No, but the timber can be got here. The oil imported in case is admitted without duty on the tins and cases, but the. British Imperial Company for its cases must either pay duty on imported timber or use Australian timber. If the honorable member for Echuca <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Palmer)</inline> knows anything about this company being anti-British his duty is to go outside this Parliament to make these statements, and denounce the company as an enemy firm. He should not, under the privilege of Parliament&#39;, make statements concerning people who are not here to defend themselves. That is what I take exception to. Since I have been in public life I have never attacked an individual who has not been in a position to defend himself. That is why I have objected time after time in this House to officers of public Departments being at-, tacked here, where they cannot speak in self-defence. It is a cowardly thing to do. whether in relation to an individual or a company. If there is anything in the statement, the honorable member has made he has a right to go further,&#34; and make a direct charge against the company &#39;outside. I thought the honorable member was going to make a longer . speech, and I was going to look up the figures regarding the imports of benzine and petrol. The manufacture of cases and tins is an asset to Australia, and the people employed in that work here are Australians, and not the Malays or Chinese the honorable member mentioned to-night. </para>

                            <para>.- I am glad to have heard the Leader of the Opposition&#39;s statement. When the honorable member for Echuca <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Palmer)</inline> made his statement to the House in the last Parliament 1 listened to all of it, and was certainly impressed by it. The managing director of the British Imperial Oil Company, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wagstaff,</inline> some considerable time afterwards interviewed me, and asked me if I would ask a question in the House of the Prime Minister regarding&#39; the inquiries which had been instituted abroad in connexion with his company. I put the question, and the Prime. Minister&#39;s answer was read by the Leader of the Opposition to-night. I am satisfied that the. information the honorable member for Echuca <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Palmer)</inline> possesses .does not contain the whole truth. Whoever has primed him up has not given him the full facts. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that when dealing with the private affairs of individuals or of companies it is very unfair to attack them within these walls, where they have .no power to reply. The British Government are not likely to give to the Prime Minister of Australia, on a matter on which he cables for information, a misleading reply, or to send any reply until they have fully investigated to their own satisfaction the conditions of the company .concerned so far as lies in their power. I know nothing, about who holds shares in the company, and am not here to &#34;advertise its wares, but the managing director is as straightforward and honorable a man as there is in this community.  His  public action in Connexion with the petrol inquiry in New South Wales will bear out that statement. </para>

The honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Yates)</inline> enlisted in the Military Forces about seven months ago He was a member of an infantry corps to start with for several months. He was then transferred into another branch. </para>

That wants explanation. The honorable member stated in this Chamber that be is in the King&#39;s service, and has to obey the orders of his superiors, and that the fault rests with the Government that he is still sitting here after being seven months in khaki. If it is the fault of his superior officers, or of the Government, that the honorable member is still here when men who have been enlisted for only five or six weeks have&#39; been already sent to the Front, I ask the Government now how it is that an honorable member of this House can exercise influence, or can have influence brought to bear- </para>

                                <para>- I say &#34; any member.&#34; How can any honorable member of this House, or any other  House,  exercise influence to be kept in Australia, when men who enlisted months after they did are at the Front? It is a mighty bad advertisement for the politicians of Australia if they are going to enlist in the King&#39;s service and get credit for being in the Australian Imperial Force, and be able to come into this House seven months after enlisting. That wants, serious explanation from whoever represents the Defence Department here. , I have no personal objection to the honorable member. I merely interjected during a speech he was making here, that it was about time he was at the Front, as he had been long enough in khaki. </para>

                                <para>- In what I am saying I am not referring to the honorable member personally. I made the interjection jocularly, or it may have been in the heat of the moment, although I do not think I was very heated at the time. The, honorable member, however, returned to the attack so often that I thought I ought to reply. I have never been afraid of being hit. I am prepared to accept the honorable member&#39;s statement that his being here is not his fault ; but it passes my comprehension how a member of Parliament can get back into the artillery, the very branch of the service that was &#39; reputed to be overloaded, after . the Defence Department had asked men in the artillery to volunteer for the infantry. It is not a nice advertisement for the legislators of Australia that such a thing can occur in our midst. </para>

I thought the House was engaged in more important matters than my position in the Military Forces, and had decided not to refer to it, but now that it has been mentioned, I am pleased to have the opportunity of stating the real facts. There are a lot of little-minded people in this world and in this House, particularly in one or two instances. </para>

                                <para>- If I have misjudged the size of their minds I apologize. Nevertheless, that is likely to be thought from the remarks they have made. I may be wrong, but I was only thinking what deductions might be made by those who read the remarks of those particular members in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> or the press. The Defence Department is greatly wanting in not taking to task those people who are using my position, and the position of other honorable members, in the same manner as the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Boyd)</inline> has inferentially used it to-night. Only last week in the Adelaide <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> appeared a letter written by a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> R. Henley, of Semaphore-road, Exeter, in the district of Hindmarsh - whether inspired or not I do not know - saying it was time the Defence Department sent <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. G.</inline> E. Yates, M.H.R:, to the Front, as he was not really in training, but was wasting his time in Federal Parliament House.I replied to that letter correcting the misstatement. I knew it was a political and splenetic attack on me, and I could afford to pass that over. But I did point out that the time I spend in this House is my leave, to which I am entitled as well as any other soldier, and I have a right to occupy my own time in this House without honorable members accusing me of doing something which I ought not to do. I have not missed one parade at Maribyrnong without permission, but have honorably fulfilled the compact I made when I joined the Australian Imperial Force. On more than one occasion I have sent to the Minister for Defence letters which, have appeared in the press; they are in his office, and if he has done his duty, he has read them. Men outside are being cajoled and appealed to, as the honorable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Laird Smith)</inline> pleaded the other day, when he declared that he would never again say that men were cold-footers, because he knew that he might be doing an injustice to some of them. </para>

In addition to the writer from Semaphore-road, Exeter, another writer to the press stated that I was in the office at Keswick Camp, and had not left South Australia. Those in South Australia who knew me well wondered as to my movements; and it follows that men like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Henley</inline> will not volunteer for service when they think that I am getting advantages, because of political influence. Those writers to the press were without accurate knowledge of my movements, and it is the duty of the Prime Minister, having regard to the fact that, under the War Precautions Act, he has prosecuted so many persons on flimsy pretexts, to prosecute those who write letters without knowledge of the facts, and so prejudice recruiting. And it is time that the Minister for Defence opened his mouth to protect me, if his is the responsibility for my not having been sent to the Front. </para>

                        <para>When speaking on the Public Service Bill recently, I attempted to place on record the circumstances  of my enlistment. I had reached the stage when I was obliged to receive dental treatment; and, since then, I have had a gun accident which has destroyed one of my teeth, and I have had to have another tooth inserted. So &#34; honorable members will see that I have lost something for the Empire. I knew that remark would bring a loud guffaw from the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archibald)</inline> who, during the election campaign, said he had made the doubtful sacrifice for the Empire of losing his seat. However, the honorable member got under the National party&#39;s umbrella, and did not lose his seat; so that he has not even lost a tooth for the Empire. i assure honorable members that I am prepared -to make a sacrifice. I have not yet asked to be relieved of the obligations I undertook when I joined the Expeditionary Force in October last. I cannot say that of other members of the Force. I could say a little on that point if I liked to open my mouth, but that is not my desire. Up to December last, .1 was eligible to be drafted into any unit, either Artillery or Infantry. At about that time, the new recruiting scheme was launched by the Prime Minister, and the onus was thrown upon every honorable member to become the  chairman  of the Recruiting Committee in his electorate. I received a letter to that effect from Mi. Mackinnon; and&#39; it was necessary for me, if I was to fulfil my obligation as  chairman  of the committee, to obtain leave for two months. I did that; and, at the end of that period, being dissatisfied with the rate of recruiting, I desisted, and went into Camp on the. 1st March. On entering Camp, I was asked which aim of the Service I desired to serve in, aud I made it quite clear to Lt.-Colonel Dollman, the Officer Commanding Mitcham Camp, that I had no desire to kill or be killed. I said that the taking of human life was opposed to the principles of the party to which I belonged, and to &#34; my own instinctive principles; and, if there was any vacancy in the Army Service. Corps, I would prefer to serve with it. On the 23rd March, I had received no reply to my application, and I went to the Officer Commanding A Base, where the unattached men were congregated, and told him I was desirous of having a reply as to whether I could enter the Army Service Corps or not. At that time, I was working in the office of the Army Service Corps; and, on that same afternoon, an orderly brought to me a minute, which stated that my application of the 23rd March had been forwarded to the 3rd Military District Head-Quarters. I wrote on the minute that I had duly noted its contents, but that my application was made on the 1st, and not the 23rd March, and I would be pleased, if finality could be expedited. Six weeks elapsed from the time I enlisted before I received a reply that I could not join the Army Service Corps. I again went into the office at A Base, and I was asked what arm of the Service I intended to join. I replied to the young returned soldier who asked me the question, &#34;I do not know anything about it. What would you do?&#34;- He replied, &#34; If I were you, I should go into the Artillery.&#34; &#34;Why the Artillery?&#34; He said, &#34; Between you and me, there is no foot-slogging in the Artillery, and you have not the same graft to do in that service; but I warn you that if you do get hit, you are cleaned- up.&#34; I said, &#34; You know more about it than I do, and I am content to take your advice.&#34; I put in my application to be transferred to the Artillery, and in that service I am to-day. </para>

I did apply for leave for the afternoon and evening when the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor),</inline> as Leader of the Opposition, came to Adelaide to address a meeting in my constituency, but Lieut. -  Colonel Doll  man refused my application. . My commanding officer asked . me if I wished to be paraded before Lieut.  -Colonel Dollman,  and I replied in the affirmative. When I appeared before him Lieut. -  Colonel Dollman  said, &#34;What do you desire to say?&#34; I said, &#34;I have been treated distinctly unfairly.&#34; He said,  &#39; You cannot say that in the Military Forces.&#34; &#34;What can I say?&#34; I asked. &#34; You can say you are dissatisfied.&#34; I. replied, &#34;If I were not dissatisfied, I would not be here.&#34;&#39; After further remarks by him, . I said, &#34; That does not alter the opinion I had when I came here.&#34; He said, &#34;I have nothing to do with your opinion.&#34;&#39; I said, &#34; Very well, sir, good day.&#34; A few days later I received another letter which raised my ire, and I was again paraded. Lieut.  -Colonel Dollman  was not present, but I told the Camp Adjutant that I had finished writing through the ordinary channels of the. military organization, and in future I would, in my capacity as member for Adelaide, write to the Minister for Defence direct. He said, &#34; If you do that it will be at your own risk.&#34; &#34; What risk do I take?&#34; &#34; You break the King&#39;s regulations.&#34; &#34; What particular regulation do I break?&#34; &#34; I do not know, but you infringe the. War Precautions Act.&#34; &#34; Very well, I will infringe the War Precautions Act.&#34; I did so, and here I am. I telegraphed to the Minister for Defence, asking for leave to attend <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudor</inline> &#39;s meeting, but the message passed through several channels, and only reached the Minister when he was on the boat. Even then I received no reply. The outcome was a letter to the Minister for Defence, and . I ask honorable members to note the tone of the Minister&#39;s reply, in order to see if there was any political influence or bias in my favour. </para>

                        <para>Copies of the letter were sent to the three daily papers in Adelaide, but never saw the light of publication. &#39; The Minister is too safely hedged about by his censors, and there remained only the one way of making my position known to the people of Adelaide, and that was by addressing a meeting in the Botanic Park. I took the risk of action under the War Precautions Act, and made the contents of the letter public at that gathering. </para>

I am content to be with , the boys, and do my duty with them, and I shall be able to hold up my head more honorably than those who have gone to Europe for the money they can get out of the King&#39;s service, and who see only the smoke, of the battle, and do not feel the punch.&#39; I do not say that with any desire to hurt the feelings of my parliamentary confreres in the Army.

                            <para>On Wednesday last, just three weeks after, I was informed that my application could not be granted, as there was no vacancy in the A.S.C. at present. </para>
                            <para>This accepted as gospel; but, during the Easter week, I made mention of the facts to a visiting member of the Australian Imperial Force from Victoria, when he informed me that it was all nonsense, and that recruits were being accepted every day in Victoria for that unit. </para>

                        <para class="block">I could not get in from South Australia, but in Victoria they were taking recruits for that unit every day. The honorable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fleming),</inline> as a matter . of fact, got into that unit in Melbourne. I do not say that he had any political influence. It  was an easy matter for him, however, to get into  it,  whereas I could not. He may be a blood-thirsty individual. I do hot know whether he is or not. I certainly am not, and I made that fact quite clear. I also made it clear  to  Colonel Dollman that if room could not be found for me in the Army Service Corps, and if fight I must, I would not refrain from going into the fighting line. I merely wanted that liberty and that consideration which is accorded  to  every member of the Forces. The letter continues - </para>

                            <para>As a case in point, in the office where I have been doing duty for the past six weeks, there was a young fellow who had been rejected three times for active service, but eventually passed, and signified his intention to join the A.S.C. He has been . here for nigh on twelve months, and has a thorough knowledge of the work, but he was advised not to apply, as there was no chance for a South Australian. He has since joined the Light Horse; but, as he has a minor defect, he is fearsome&#39; that, in the last test, he will be rejected; while, for the business in which he has been engaged, and which he desired to continue, he would have been a reliable and zealous soldier. </para>
                            <para>I cannot help but express the opinion, in view of my experience, and what J have stated, that the consideration given to each application is of the foregone-conclusion character, and that it is a farce to make them. </para>
                            <para>Another matter I desire to refer to. is the refusal by the Camp Commandant of my request for leave in accordance with Circular 23526, relating to leave to members of the Australian Imperial Force who are candidates for Parliament. I trust that the fact that 1 was fortunate enough to meet with no opposition to my candidature will not debar me from the leave asked for, as it is my desire to join in the campaign just as if my seat was being contested. 1 therefore desire that you will consider the matter without delay, and grant me the leave asked for. 1 shall esteem it a favour if you will treat this matter as urgent.

I am informed that my wire did not reach you until after you had embarked for Western Australia, for I received no reply; which may he my bad luck. </para>

                            <para>I would specially direct the attention of the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Boyd)</inline> to this reply, which I received from the 3rd Military District, or, in other- words, from the authorities at the Victoria Barracks, St. Kilda-road, Melbourne - &#34; The leave for candidates for Federal Parliament is intended for those members of the Australian Imperial Force in Australia who are being opposed in their seats. Private Yates is&#39; not being opposed, and should not, therefore, be granted leave. It is time that this soldier should be sent on the duty for which he enlisted.&#34; </para>

At Mitcham camp, where I was, the holidays announced were Christmas Day, the 28th December, and New , Year&#39;s Day. The Department was magnanimous enough to give the soldiers three days&#39; holiday. I wired to the Minister for Defence, and told him of the dissatisfaction which the arrangement was causing, and suggested closing the camp from Christmas Eve until after New Year&#39;s Day. This I made as an economic suggestion, &#39;seeing that if the men were away from camp, they would have to buy all their own food. Strange to say, I got back a message to the effect that leave had been altered from the 27th December to the 2nd January inclusive. One of the officers, who asked to see the wire, expressed the opinion that it was a farce to get the men back for two days, as they would have nothing to do, and would have to be fed at the expense of the country. I brought the matter under the notice of the Acting Minister for Defence, but he had not the spine to act on his own initiative. </para>

At Easter time, we got word that the men in camp were to have Good Friday and Easter Saturday as holidays. In South Australia, Easter Monday is something of a national race day, on account of the Onkaparinga races; and, as the men in camp were mostly &#34; sports,&#34; there was general dissatisfaction with the holiday arrangements. I wired to the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> pointing out the position, but, knowing &#39;that my influence with him was not very great, I telephoned to the Minister for Home and Territories (Mr.Glynn),telling him what I had done, and asking him to assist in getting the holiday extended. That  gentleman acquiesced in my request. In reply to my wire to the Minister for Defence, I got the following reply: - </para>

                        <para>Having spoken of my own case, I would now like to give an instance of what political influence can do. We had a secretary in South Australia, Captain Olifent-, who had had twenty-nine years of military experience, and who went to Duntroon with a view to qualifying himself for a position in the Australian Imperial Force, but failed. It was stated, however, in the daily papers that he had enlisted for the Front; and the following Is the kind of letter that the Prime Minister sent to him on that occasion: - </para>
                        <para>Allow me to offer you my congratulations. It is redolent of fine spirit, and expressive of the Characteristics of the mind from which it springs. I am sure your action will do great good, and that it will serve as a clarion call to those who still hesitate. </para>
                        <para>Fine language ! Either that letter was written in collaboration with the Minister for Defence, or the Minister for Defence copied the Prime Minister, or the Prime Minister copied the Minister for Defence, as this and another letter I shall read will show. The letter of the Minister for Defence to Captain Olifent was as follows; - </para>

I know from my intimacy with . him as a member of the State War Council, that he was mainly actuated by a sense of patriotism and duty.  His  volunteering for service at the Front will have a good effect upon the people. He certainly has excellent qualifications by his long training in the Military in times of peace, as well as in war. He has been an energetic member of the War Council, and is familiar with the pressing problems before it. He has a physique which shows he bears his moderate years well. All this goes to show that he should be a valued member of the Australian Imperial Force. </para>
                        <para class="block">Captain Olifent is about 6 ft.2 in., and I dare say he weighs up to 18 stone. There was another letter written by Captain Solomon, V.D., but that does not concern us. </para>

This fine soldier with twenty-nine years&#39; experience, whose example would act as a &#34; clarion call,&#34; and whose fine physique &#34; would be an acquisition to the Australian Imperial Force, is now, after one trip to England as a transport officer, on his way back to the Old Country in a similar capacity, with the pay that goes with the honorary rank of <inline font-weight="bold">Major. He</inline> is given these health trips after all the lick-spittle nonsense I have read ; and perhaps the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Boyd)</inline> would like to ask the Minister for Defence some questions about this case. Captain Olifent had all&#39; this stuff written about him, although he is simply a transport officer, whose address in London, I believe, is the Cecil, or some other great hotel. For these health trips he gets anything from &#163;1 to &#163;2 per day, </para>

What he said calls for a personal explanation. When I entered the Defence Department as Minister, I resolved to forget all politics when approached by a member, and to, do my duty to the best of my ability. The honorable member for Adelaide had hardly entered the Forces before he made application to come to Melbourne. The reason for this was, that he wished to interview the Minister. He has charged me with being spineless, because I refused to treat him, at his dictation, contrary to the way in which any  other private would have been treated ~ under the military regulations. I told him that I knew him as Private Yates&#39;, not as the honorable member for Adelaide. </para>

                                <para>- The speech of the honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Yates)</inline> was a characteristic one. It is a pity that he could not defend himself without making an attack on <inline font-weight="bold">Major Olifent,</inline> who is at present on the high seas. <inline font-weight="bold">Major Olifent,</inline> like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colonel Rowell,</inline> was connected with the Volunteer Forces of the Commonwealth for more years than I care to remember. Year in and year out these officers and others donned the King&#39;s uniform and attended parades on Saturdays and other occasions, being often insulted for doing so. They then formed the nucleus of our Defence Force. When war broke out the Fisher Administration, of which I was a member, determined to give these officers, who. had devoted the best years of their life to military work, the opportunity to go to Duntroon to study for examinations enabling them to obtain commissions in the Expeditionary Force. It was thought a matter of justice and equity that we should do that instead of giving all such commissions to young men of twenty-two or twenty-three, who naturally could pass examinations more easily than men in middle life. Parliament and the people indorsed that determination of the Ministry. It is possible that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Olifent</inline> did not pass his examinations, because we know how difficult it is for a man of middle age&#39; to do what is easy for a young man. Still it will not be denied that there are many men wearing the King&#39;s uniform who are able and efficient officers  in  spite of the fact that they have not passed examinations. Many of those who have been promoted on the field of battle in Flanders have not done so, and will not be asked to do so. So far as that is concerned, that is nothing to be said in disparagement of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Olifent.</inline></para>

                        <para>As for transport service, the Minister has stated on more than one occasion that it is desirable to employ officers who are too old for active service, and thus relieve younger and more active men. Elderly men by reason of their experience and tact,  are  often more valuable for transport officers than younger men would be. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lt.-Colonel</inline> O&#39;Loghlin has made several trips in charge of transports. The attack made on <inline font-weight="bold">Major Olifent</inline> by the honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Yates)</inline> was caused by spite and. malignity. The honorable member might have waited till <inline font-weight="bold">Major Oilfent</inline> had returned to Australia, and should not have used his position in the House to attack him in his absence. To my mind, his action was contrary to fair play. Men in uniform should not be allowed to stay here for over twelve months at  a  time when recruits are being called for. It is  continually  being asked, in the district of Hindmarsh, as elsewhere, when recruits are asked for, &#34; Why is not so-and-so at the Front?&#34; I have known young men to be sent abroad within six weeks after they entered camp, and some of them have been killed within a year of their enlistment. Yet men of the stamp of the honorable member for Adelaide loaf about month in and month out for over a year without going away. This is a matter in regard to which the Defence Department should make some explanation. When men are asked to enlist they say, &#34; Why does not so-and-so go  away?&#34;  We have heard the record of the honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Yates).</inline> Let  us  see what the Defence Department has to say of him. If the Department is, correct, we ought  to  have it placed on record ; if it is not correct, the sooner it is withdrawn the better. It is as follows: - </para>

                        <para class="block">From that record it appears . that the honorable member enlisted for service in the 5th Pioneer Battalion, and was to embark in February, five months afterwards. I heard on pretty good authority not long ago that there was no necessity to train men for the infantry so long at the present time, but that if they were trained here for five or six weeks- they could be sent to Europe, and get their full training there. That was done in the case of a young friend of mine, and, if necessary, I can supply the dates of his enlistment and embarkation. It is evident from the statement I have read that there was an urgent need for reinforcements for the infantry, and that the honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Yates)</inline> had ample &#39; opportunity . to volunteer. There was no necessity to allow him leave of absence&#39;. If a man puts on the King&#39;s uniform he is a soldier, and not a politician. &#34; You cannot&#39; mix the two jobs. If the duties of one position run counter to the &#34;other the honorable member had better throw up the soldiering. He claims that he got leave for recruiting purposes, but it appears to me that it would have been better for the Department if he had been in training, so that he could go away with his brethren in arms. He applied for transfer to the Army Service Corps. Apparently he tried to get into any mortal thing to dodge going away.1 The honorable member enlisted for the purpose of dodging the general election, because if he had not gone into uniform he would not have been here to-day. </para>

This matter ought to be put on a proper basis, because it is in a very unsatisfactory state at present. The sooner these soldier politicians become one thing or the other the better. I do not want to refer to those that are already oh the other side of . the world, but it is obvious from what has been going on during the last eight or nine months that some of them who are still here are a good deal more politicians than they are soldiers. The sooner the Defence Department stops this sort of thing the  better it will be for recruiting. It is not right that the public should be in a position to say that a member of Parliament is in a different position from any other man who enlists to serve his King and country. </para>

                            <para>.- I desire to say something concerning another war, and one which the honorable member for Flinders (SirWilliam Irvine) alluded to the other day as being more important even than the European struggle. I refer to the industrial conflict now being waged in New South Wales. To-day I asked the Prime Minister if the Government intended to take, any steps to arrange a conference between the Railways Commissioners and the officials representing the Railway and Tramway Association of New South Wales, and the Prime Minister replied that the Government did not intend to take any such action. Notwithstanding that the card system has been discredited in other countries of the world, where it has caused a tremendous amount of dissatisfaction and turmoil, an attempt was made to force it upon the tramway and railway employees of New South Wales, despite the results of the experience elsewhere, which ought to have been at the command of the New South Wales Government. The action taken by the Minister for Defence when the Broken Hill strikers were dismissed for refusing to work the Saturday afternoon shift was in pleasing contrast to the attitude of the Government to-day towards the New South Wales strike. &#39; </para>

                        <para>On the occasion to which&#39; I refer, the newspapers, as is the case to-day, were full of reckless statements about German money and German influence, as well as allegations about the soldiers at the Front being left without munitions, and so forth. We had a little toy munition factory in Broken Hill, but it never made any shells to do any damage to the enemy or calculated to improve the position of our men at the Front, and it went out of business immediately the strike was settled. We have heard no more about that factory, but, at the time of the Broken Hill strike, its existence was used to inflame the people of Australia against the strikers. The influence of the daily press, then as now, was used against the strikers, bub, as I have said, the Minister for Defence intervened at an early stage. He submitted a proposal which was neither desired by the men - who  demanded  forty-four hours as a condition for the resumption of work - nor by  the  companies.; but a compromise was effected, and the men resumed work on conditions then laid down, and ultimately the dispute was settled by the Arbitration Court. </para>
                        <para>I fail to see whyanyGovernment which is supposed to. legislate in the interests of the people of Australia  -  a great majority of whom belong to  the  working classes - should decline at this stage to take any steps towards ending this struggle, which may yet involve  the  whole Commonwealth in an industrial upheaval. It would appear from statements in the daily press from time  to  time, and from innuendoes in the leading, columns of the metropolitan papers, or from utterances such as were made  the  other day in Sydney by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Campbell,</inline> secretary of the Farmers and Settlers Association, that it was known this trouble was coming. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Campbell</inline> said that they had been expecting it for a considerable time, and they had accordingly made all preparations for the organization of free labour. He wound up by saying that the trouble could not have occurred at a more opportune time for them. That statement, taken in conjunction with others which have appeared in the press about the ever-increasing rapacity of the wage-earners of Australia, coming on top of the refusal of the Prime Minister, speaking on behalf of the Government, to intervene, gives ground for the impression that the Government are behind the people who want to fight organized labour in Australia, and who are trying to precipitate an industrial upheaval such as occurred as a result of the maritime strike. But there are&#39; advantages in various directions. We have been told that the New South Wales Government are applying for the cancellation of registration of the unions involved, and that all those people who, by courtesy, are termed &#34;free&#34; labourers, will have the existing awards made, applicable to them by a simple process if they band themselves into organizations. It would appear that the card system - that objectionable Yankee speeding-up process, which has been found to be a failure in the industrial arenas of other countries- was absolutely forced upon the unionists in the hope that they would take definite action. Knowing the deep resentment felt towards it by the workers, the employing section expected this upheaval, and made their preparations accordingly. </para>
                        <para>A discussion on the strike situation is, in my opinion, of far more importance than a debate on the matters that have been referred to this evening. &#39; &#34;We have been told that organized labour is attempting to dictate the terms upon which men shall be employed in the running of our railways, in our mines, or in any other capacity, and that organized labour should have no voice in these matters. Speaking as a representative of the industrialists and working classes of Australia, t say that we are going to give the men more and more say as to the conditions under which they shall be employed. &#34;We are not living in that stage of the world&#39;s history when men wore the collars of their masters round their necks; we are no longer to be treated as industrial serfs. Education is abroad to-day, and men demand to be treated, as men, and not as children. We have had experience of what political Democracy is supposed to mean. What we want now is a little more industrial Democracy. Having won the right to cast our votes in the political arena, we demand an increasingly greater say in the factory, the workshop, the mine, and the field; and it is because of that demand, and because the people who own and control our industrial enterprises know that their positions are menaced, and because they have political control through the Parliament of this country, that the Government will not take any action to bring about a peaceful settlement of the dispute. Apparently, the decks are cleared for action, and this long-  looked-for  fight between employers and organized labour is to be allowed to run its course. Those men who were loud in their statements a&#39; little time ago that they would far sooner live under Prussian militarism than under Australian unionism, and who declaimed against the walking delegates and other &#34; objectionable &#34; representatives of unionism, are now taking advantage of the patriotism of the people to mislead the workers outside the unions into the belief that it is a patriotic duty to take the other fellow&#39;s job, in order to play the game for the employer. If Parliament itself, will not&#39; insist, on the Government taking action to bring about a conference between the principals in the present struggle, I hope the people in the various electorates will insist that their political representatives shall demand that such action be taken. </para>

                                <para>- That is all very fine. We have seen agreements broken by employers before to-day. It is said that circumstances alter cases. Even if the coal lumpers did what the Minister says they did - and that I do not admit - I believe that circumstances would be found which would justify the men in taking the action they have taken. We have an Imperial illustration of a broken undertaking. When the Empire went to war with the Boer Republics the statement was made that not one inch of territory would be annexed, but after the war the Orange Free State and the Transvaal were annexed. &#60; </para>

                                <para>- I have no reason to ask for it. I am prepared to take the coal lumpers&#39; side. I belong to the working class, and I am prepared to take their view unless I am shown absolute evidence to the contrary. Although I am still a young man, I have had sufficient experience to know that men do not strike for fun. I have had personal experience of the men engaged in the trouble in New South Wales. I worked on the Sydney trams for a period, and I know that the employees of that system are not the men to strike without extraordinary grievances. Whether the men were right or wrong in the belief that the obnoxious card system would do them an injury, the fact remain&#39;s that they honestly believed it would. Do honorable members wish to believe that men who have grown old and grey in the Service, and who risk the forfeiture of their superannuation rights, would strike for a mere whim - that they were going to ruin everything for the purpose of securing a holiday ? </para>

He has simply to accept the statements which  appear in. the daily press; and we all know that, for the purpose of breaking strikes, there are reporters employed on our newspapers who possess very vivid imaginations, and who are always ready to write up interviews with dissatisfied workers which never took place. In spite of the statements which have appeared in the press to the effect that thousands of the strikers in Sydney are resuming work, we still find that the men there are standing solidly together. </para>

Possibly that is why I did not acquire sufficient culture to interest the honorable member. But I learned sufficient in the school of experience to teach me that my interests are bound up with the interests of those who are on strike in Sydney at the present time. It taught me to expect no concessions from the class that is represented by the honorable member. </para>

For his benefit, let me say that I have nothing to be sorry for in connexion with . that case. I reserve all my sympathy for the members of my own class, and not for the &#34; scabs &#34; on it. But, seeing that reference has been made to this particular matter, and that the honorable member is anxious to become fully acquainted with the facts, I advise him to read the evidence tendered by both sides to the Wages Board, at Broken Hill, in connexion with the strike with which <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Egan</inline> was associated. Then, if he feels so disposed, he can &#39;say whether he sides with the employers against whom the hotel employees struck; because the former took advantage of the depression produced in Broken Hill, owing to the outbreak of war, in certain instances, to pay no wages at all to helpless girls who had no relations in Broken Hill. These girls had no home in the town to which they could go if they were put out of the hotel or boarding house where they were working. Only the street was left to them. </para>

                                <para>- They would be more interesting to the honorable member, who, I have no doubt, would swallow them open mouthed. Honorable members opposite, who talk about a breach of agreement on the part of the coal lumpers, have nothing but sympathy for those who take advantage of industrial disturbances to go back upon their own class. Any unbiased man who reads the evidence in the case against the Hotel, Club and Restaurant Employees Union of Broken Hill can come to no other conclusion than that there was never a more justifiable strike than that in which these girls and men took part. Every one of the employers had signed an individual agreement, in which he undertook to adhere to the conditions that prevailed prior  to the war. These unionists did not ask for an increase of a penny in their prewar wages or for a minute reduction in their hours of employment. They merely asked for the maintenance of the <inline font-style="italic">status quo.</inline> When the secretary of the Hotel, Club and Restaurant Employees Union applied for a Wages Board, so that this agreement might be legally ratified, the employers took advantage of the application to put in a counter-claim, in which they asked that the hours of employment in certain instances should be increased to fifty-six a week, and that the wages should be reduced to the rates paid in Sydney plus 10 per cent. Then came to the front this lady to whom the honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> has referred, and who was a dummy for another employer in the town. When her shop, with others, was shut down as a result of the strike, she &#34;scabbed&#34; on her former fellow employees. She had refused to join the union prior to any trouble taking place. When the industrial disturbance did take place, this valiant lady, with the assistance of another female, levelled a revolver at the head of a little crippled lad, weighing about 7 st., and beat him. While one held a revolver. at his head the other beat and tarred and feathered him. That is the sort of exploit of which the honorable member for Dampier and those associated with him feel proud. </para>

One cannot pick up a newspaper in which there is not a reference to a strike, under such head-lines as &#34; More German Influence,&#34; or &#34;More German Money at Work.&#34; And yet we find that in . Spain, Italy, France, the United States, England, and, indeed, every country having any pretence to civilization where industry has been established the same conflict between labour and capital is going on. </para>

                                <para>- Japanese workers have been on strike. Even in China and India strikes have occurred. Wherever capitalism has raised its head and the exploitation of industrial development has taken place we find the same conflict going on. In every case the cause is the same. The conflict is due, not to German influence but to the conditions under which men and women are called upon to work. At the back of all this talk of patriotism, and of all the talk of crushing out German trade, in which honorable members opposite love so much to indulge, there is but the one idea. The only concrete, evidence of German influence so far as Broken Hill is concerned is that of German names to be found in the list, of shareholders in the mines there. </para>

                                <para>- It is. Speaking of industrial conditions. I am reminded of a statement bearing on the question of industrial trouble which was published in that revolutionary newspaper the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> on 1st August last. This is not an extract from a red-rag paper, or from the Industrial Workers of the World <inline font-style="italic">Direct Action.</inline> but from that eminently respectable organ the <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline> In its leading columns it wrote : - </para>

                        <para>The time is steadily approaching when the Government of the Commonwealth will have to choose between continuing its present policy -which is intrinsically a policy of strike promotion, and the creation of general tumult and disorder - and adopting a policy scientifically calculated to banish discontent; that is to say, a general policy of price fixing. </para>
                        <para class="block">I wish to point out to honorable members who desire to know why various unions are striking which are not directly interested in the dispute between the Railways Commissioners and their employees, that possibly a solution of the question may be found in the general unrest and discontent. As has been pointed out in the selfsame leading article in the <inline font-style="italic">Age -</inline></para>
                        <para>The. present situation is as follows:Despite the increased wages won by fifteen years of continuous agitation, the average Australian worker is 11.1 per cent. worse off to-day, , in the matter of purchasing power, than in  1901;  and that section of the consuming public whose earning power has rested stationary during the period is no less than 50.7 per cent. worse <inline font-style="italic">off.</inline> We see, then, that the employing class has not only succeeded in positively sterilizing the apparently victorious efforts of the workers to improve their circumstances, it has outwitted them all along the line, and put them in a much worse position. Assuming the accuracy of the Statist&#39;s figures and deductions, what is it but downright humbug for any person to disparage the prevailing industrial discontent and to hold up the Australian worker to special execration as a type of insatiable greed? </para>
                        <para class="block">Were we to talk here for hours we could not make out a stronger indictment against the present Administration than appears in that leading article in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of the 1st August. . While we hear constantly of an enormous increase in the cost of living, while we have a statement based on the Statist&#39;s figures that as regards the purchasing power of money the workers are 11.1 per cent. worse off than they were in 1901, absolutely no remedial action is taken. But when the Government are asked to make an effort to reduce the cost of living, we are told that there are insuperable difficulties in the way&#39;. When we say that exorbitant profits are being made while the war is proceeding, persons deny that any extraordinary profits are being made. Yet we know that the workers&#39; wages have decreased to the extent pointed out by the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> in its leading article. We know that the prices of commodities are going up sky high every day, and that somebody must be deriving a profit. Let me give an instance which came under my notice on the very day I left Broken Hill, and which is absolutely authentic. A bullock was sold at. Elder, Smith&#39;s yards there for &#163;25. The weight at the abattoirs, dressed, was 1,260 lbs. </para>
                        <para class="block">The average price per lb. was1s., coming to &#163;63; the hide brought 50s., and the tongue 8s. 6d., making a total of &#163;65 18s. 6d. As the bullock was sold for &#163;25, there was a gross profit of &#163;40 18s. 6d. I do not say that that result is characteristic of the whole of the bullocks sold at Broken Hill. On the morning I left I obtained these figures, which can be vouched for. </para>

                                <para>- I do not propose to take up any more time. I felt that it was absolutely necessary that something should be said about the Government&#39;s refusal to take any action towards bringing about, or attempting to bring about, a conference between the people engaged in, the present industrial upheaval. Instead of any attempt being made on behalf of the Government who are interested, in spite of the statements made that the strike is absolutely ruining any chance of Australia effectively participating in the war, any help is absolutely refused by the head of the Government to bring about a peaceable solution. I hope that honorable members will not be put off with the statement of the Prime Minister, but will see that some efforts are made to. bring about an amicable settlement. </para>
