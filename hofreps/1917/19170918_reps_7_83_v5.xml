                    <para>That this House desires to record its profound regret at the loss which the Commonwealth . suffers in the death of the Honorable Charles&#39; Carty Salmon, who was at one time  Speaker  of this House, and was one of its  members at the inauguration of the Parliament, and also for many years afterwards, and who was at one time a member of the Victorian Ministry, and expresses its sincere condolence with hit widow and the members of his family in their bereavement. </para>

                <para>One rises on an occasion like this overpowered with the sense that he stands under the very shadow of death. Before the majesty of that dark presence, &#39; how petty and futile appear the ambitions and struggles of men 1 This our colleague, our companion, our friend, who but a little while ago was with us, is now gone, and we who knew him well sincerely mourn our loss. He played a conspicuous part in the political history of Victoria, and of the Commonwealth, and his kindly disposition endeared him to all men. It can be truly said of him what can be said of few, that he was a man who. did his duty fearlessly as he saw it, without arousing the enmity of others.  His  geniality and kindness of heart were such that all men felt drawn towards him. He has been untimely taken from us, and we deeply mourn him. He has crossed that dark stream over which, sooner or later, we must all travel, and we who remain feel it to be indeed true that 1 1 the wings of men&#39;s lives are plumed with the feathers of death.&#34; I&#39; speak for, I am sure, every member of the House when I say that we sincerely regret <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Salmon&#39;s</inline> death, and extend to those whom he loved, and who loved him, our sincerest sympathy in their hour of great grief. </para>

                    <para>. - It is with the deepest regret that I rise to second this motion. I was acquainted with <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Carty</inline> Salmon for many years, and knew him before we both, entered this Parliament. We belonged to different political parties, but he was a man beloved, honoured, and respected even by those who differed from him politically. In him the Commonwealth has lost one of its best citizens. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Carty</inline> Salmon was never afraid to do what he thought to  be  right. Occasions  like  the present have been all too frequent in the life-time of this Parliament. I could not help thinking so when the Archbishop said today in the Cathedral  that the  late member for Grampians was a martyr to public duty. It is possible that many of us will find later that the life here has been too strenuous for our health, and what happened to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Carty</inline> Salmon will happen to others. They will find that their constitution has been undermined by their efforts for the public welfare, and that they are thus unable to stand the strain of illness. Regret for <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Carty</inline> Salmon&#39;s death is felt by all of us. I desire, on behalf of honorable members on this side of the House, to sympathize with his widow and relatives. </para>

                    <para>. - In my remarks on 23rd August I indicated briefly the features of this resolution. I intend to propose its amendment by the addition of subdivision H, which will provide that the winner of a cash prize in a lottery shall pay in respect of such cash prize income tax to the amount of 10 per cent, of the gross prize money. I shall ask the Committee to approve of two or three further small but very important amendments. I propose to include amongst the persons exempted in subdivision F, which imposes a tax in certain cases on male persons between the ages of twenty-one and forty-five years, persons on active service outside Australia on ships of war, and persons who have been prevented by order of the Governor-General from enlisting in the Expeditionary Forces raised for service outside Australia or from serving outside Australia on ships of war. There are sure to be some cases that will deserve exemption, and it is necessary that the Governor-General should have power to grant exemptions. Amongst tha persons prevented from enlisting for active service outside Australia are the men garrisoning our forts, who are required to remain at their posts for the defence of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- I propose later on to deal with the very phase of this  tax  which the honorable member has in mind. Subdivision F imposes a tax in certain cases on* male persons between the ages of twenty-one and forty-five years, and I am very glad to have this opportunity of expressing my own views on this proposal. I make no apologies for it. I am willing to take the whole responsibility for this tax if necessary. But it is the policy of the Government as a whole. Honorable members who have been in public life for a long time know that Ministers are not always in complete personal accord with proposals that  they  advocate in the House. A Minister is only one member of a Cabinet, and expresses the corporate decision of the Government. But however that may be in other cases, I have no reservation to make in regard to this tax. I am in absolute accord with it personally as well as in my capacity as Treasurer. </para>

                        <para>- I believe it does. At any r,ate, I have no knowledge of dissent on the part of Ministers. I wish to say very briefly, but definitely, the object of this special tax. It is considered by the Government that those who are unmarried or are widowers without children, and are physically fit <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> go to the war, but have elected to stay at home and attend to their personal business, may fairly be asked to specially help in the repatriation of those who, at the call of duty, voluntarily left their homes and kindred, forsook their personal businesses, and went abroad to fight for the protection and freedom of the peoples of  Aus.tralia  and the Empire. </para>

                        <para>- It will. Subdivision F will apply to every male person, whether .in receipt of a taxable income or not, who, on the 1st July, 1917, was (1) unmarried or a widower without children; and (2) was not under the age of twenty-one years and was under the age df forty-five years, those being the ages within which persons are accepted for service abroad. The tax is to be &#163;10, or 10 per cent, of a person&#39;s&#39; taxable income, whichever is the greater, and will be additional to the ordinary income tax. When the Commissioner is satisfied that, by reason of the support given by a person to his dependants, the payment of the full amount of the tax would impose hardship on him, the  Commisisoner  may reduce the amount of tax payable by that person to such an &#39; amount as he in his discretion may determine.

                        <para>- I have right and justice on my side as well, and that is better than mere numbers. The objections to the measure must come from those who have not offered to enlist for service abroad, and who object to specially pay to help the repatriation of those who have been doing their duty in a distant land in defending them as well as Australia and the Empire. </para>

                <para>In regard to compulsory service in time of war, the National party, represented by the majority in this House, gave a distinct promise to the electors at the general election on 5th May in these words, which I take from the declaration of the Government - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>It accepts the verdict of the electors on 28th October, 1916, and appeals to the patriotism of the people to uphold the honour of Australia by maintaining the Australian divisions at their full fighting strength by voluntary enlistment. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">The verdict of the electors on 5th May - which ought to be a day of glorious memory - was clear and unmistakable, and their mandate we are determined to respect and adhere to. </para>
                <para>The objection that this proposal is contrary to that mandate can come from only two classes of persons - (1) those like the members of the Opposition and their supporters who rarely see much virtue in the proposals of &#34;the Government; and (2) those who are opposed to the decision of the people by the referendum of the 28th October last being accepted, and who wish the Government not to adhere to it. The declaration of the Government on the 5th May, and the verdict given by the people on that day - the mandate we received then - we intend to adhere to. </para>
                <para>The Government is actuated by two principal reasons in bringing forward this proposal. The first is that we believe it will stimulate and increase recruiting, not so much, we hope, by the fear of having to pay the tax, as by bringing prominently before those who have not yet volunteered for service what is not only their duty to their country, but their paramount duty to. themselves. The second reason is to provide funds towards the repatriation of those who have returned from the war after having served their country. Is that not a good object? I hope that honorable members will bear with me for a few moments longer, because I desire to say something very earnestly before I sit down. It is difficult to understand why such a glorious opportunity of doing their duty, by serving their country, has not been embraced by every qualified person. Nelson&#39;s stirring call, made over one hundred years ago, is as inspiring now as it was then - &#34; England expects every man to do his duty.&#34; One would have thought that&#34; to be one of those brave men who first placed Australia on the pinnacle of greatness and renown, to be one of those who fought for liberty and freedom at Gallipoli, in Egypt, in France, in Mesopotamia, and other places, to be one of those &#34; hallmarked &#34; as brave and patriotic men for the rest of their lives, and to be one of those &#34; whose triumph will be sung by some yet unmoulded tongue, far on in summers that we shall not see &#34; - one would have thought that all these feelings and sentiments would have been an inspiration and an incentive that would have outweighed every other possible consideration. </para>
                <para>I believe the view taken by honorable members on this side of the House - and by the people of the country - in regard to those who have decided not to go to the war is : &#34; We do not want to be ungenerous - we do not want to ignore any real and valid reasons for not going - but our general feeling is the same as that so strongly expressed in the imprecatory  words of Macaulay in his lay of Horatius - </para>

                <para>Those who would ask us not to propose this measure ask us, in effect, to say that those who have not gone to the war, but have remained at home attending to their own interests, have no obligation resting upon them to specially help to repatriate those who have voluntarily done so. This House. I feel sure is prepared to. emphatically say the opposite. </para>

                        <para>- In conclusion, if I may venture to express my own opinion, those who do not go to the war are acting most unwisely and foolishly from their own personal stand-point. They are storing up for themselves a miserable old age, a gnawing feeling of regret, for neglect of duty in a great emergency when their country was in danger. Each one will feel, in the words of the immortal bard of Avon - </para>

                    <para class="block">This Bill, which is entitled a Bill for an Act to amend the Defence Act of 1903-15, is more one for consideration in Committee than for discussion on the second reading. It is intended to amend a number of defects which experience has disclosed in the working of the existing Act, and a memorandum has been prepared, and will be immediately circulated, showing the various amendments proposed. Honorable members will realize that the Defence Act was framed, and that it operated for many years, before war conditions arose; and the practical experience of the war has shown the necessity for amendments in order to remove doubts concerning several of the provisions. In consequence of the large number of troops sent to the Front from Australia the authorities have found it necessary to take action, in regard to which some question has arisen, and it is necessary to set all doubt at rest by making explicit declaration, and, as it were, validating that action. In illustration, I may mention that section 31 of the original Act gives power to the Governor-General to appoint and promote officers of the Defence Forces, and issue commissions to them. Honorable members are aware, however, that it has become necessary to make promotions and appoint officers overseas; indeed, altogether some 5,400 promotions have thus been made from the ranks, and , some of the men have risen to very high positions indeed. The power to make appointments has practically been delegated, and clause 3, providing a new section 8a to the principal Act, enables the Governor-General to delegate to the officer in command of any part of the Military Forces, when beyond the limits of the Commonwealth, power to appoint or promote officers to acting rank in the Military Forces. Of course, all those provisional appointments are subject to confirmation by the Governor-General. A sub-clause of clause 3 provides for the validation of any appointment already made, or powers exercised, in pursuance of the delegation. . I mention this as an illustration of the class of amendment with which the Bill deals; and another illustration is contained in clause 5. The men of the Expeditionary Force will be returning, and it is desirable that the Commonwealth should reap the benefit of the experience of those who have fought abroad on behalf of the Empire. Many of these men were privates in our Citizen Forces, and power is taken under clause 5 to enable the Governor-General to appoint, for distinguished service in time of war, or for exceptional gallantry on active service, any person to be an officer or non-commissioned officer, or promote an officer or non-commissioned officer in the Citizen Forces without his passing the prescribed examination. Many who went abroad as privates have been promoted to commissioned rank. </para>

It is essential under these conditions that the provisions of the British Army Act shall apply to them on active service. But we are taking power to modify and adapt the provisions of the Army Act in its application to the Military Forces. For instance, &#34;certain Courts are specified by the British Act, and we are taking power to apply it to corresponding Courts here. We are also applying the Act to war service. </para>

                    <para>Clause 42 remedies a defect of the present law. Section 134 of the Defence Act is contained in Part XII. of the Act, and imposes a penalty on employers who prevent employees from serving in camp, thus interfering with the training required by law. It was thought that that provision applied, to other parts of the Act, but on the matter being referred to the officers of the Crown Law Department, the opinion was given that it applies only to the universal service training. Under Part III. and Part IV., however, employees may be called up, and have been called up, for military work. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. Clause 42 enacts that an employer shall not prevent an employee, or a parent or guardian a son or ward, from rendering personal service under Parts III. and IV. of the Defence Act, and penalties are provided for any infringement of this provision. This is necessary for the protection of employees who are called upon to do service on behalf of the country. </para>

                    <para>It is desirable to alter the law relating to the training of cadets. The training of the Senior Cadets is an important part of our compulsory service. The regulations fix times for the training of the cadets at night and on Saturday afternoons, but there have been many objections bv parents to the taking up of so many evenings in training, and it is felt that the Saturday afternoon drills often restrict unfairly legitimate opportunities for sport and recreation. Clause 49, therefore, enables the Government to provide for the training of senior cadets during hours when they are really in the service of their masters. </para>

                            <para>- Probably not so much, on the average, during a year. But the desire is to take power to do it. I do not think that any employer will object to the provision. Drills for the most part will be held on Saturday mornings, in the employers&#39; time, but in certain towns Saturday afternoon  is not a half -holiday, and the drills may be held during the afternoon. The proposal is to make the Act more elastic, and to make the training easier for the boys, and at the same time to meet the wishes of parents. </para>

                    <para class="block">That provision was made in the Act in accordance with the recommendation of Lord Kitchener, but there were certain classes of officers, for instance, veterinary officers, for which training is not given at the College; and as it is desired to make appointments to the permanent staff from such officers, clause 51 has been inserted in this Bill. It provides that members of the Permanent and Citizen Forces, or persons who have served with satisfactory record in any expeditionary force raised for service outside the Commonwealth, who are not graduates -of the Military College, may, subject to such conditions as are prescribed, be appointed 6r promoted to be officers in the non-combatant branches of the Permanent  Forces, including the Medical, Veterinary, Ordnance, Survey, and Clerical branches; and that warrant and non-commissioned officers of the Permanent Forces may be appointed to commissioned rank for the position of quartermaster to units of the Australian Military Forces. This provision will meet a necessity which is  now felt in connexion with the&#39; administration of the Department. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister has assured us that the provisions relating to the death penalty are not being altered, but I am anxious to know whether there has not been some alteration effected by placing our soldiers under the Army Act. Honorable members are at a disadvantage, because until a few minutes ago they  had not received copies of the memorandum showing the alterations proposed to be made in the principal Act. The memorandum was before another place long before the Bill was introduced; but, of course, amendments were made in the Senate, and it has been necessary to have a reprint made. Apparently, the Government propose still further alterations. </para>

                            <para>- If it does not do more than can be done without, it seems to be unnecessary. I am heartily in accord with some of the proposals in the Bill, particularly with clause 5, which will enable the Governor-General, for distinguished service in time of war, or for exceptional gallantry on active service, to appoint any person to be an officer or non-commissioned officer, or to promote an officer or non-commissioned officer in the Citizen Military Forces without his passing the prescribed examination. I interjected when the Minister was dealing with this provision that these men had passed the toughest examination in being promoted at the Front. I did not like to hear the interjection from the Government side that, in all probability, not one out of a hundred of these men will get promotion when he comes back. </para>

                            <para>- I understand that they pass examinations in the Old Country, but, beyond that, they have stood the fire test on the field, and come through it. They have demonstrated to their superior officers that they are capable of doing the work which has been intrusted to them. There is always a suspicion that favoritism is rampant in the Defence Department. </para>

                            <para>- Possibly it is; but, unfortunately, many people believe it is true. We should make it mandatory that those men who won their spurs at the Front should have their rank in the Citizen Forces. We have been endeavouring to give privileges to the men who have returned, but this is not a privilege; it is a right to which these men are entitled. </para>

                        <para>.- This Bill is principally one for consideration in Committee. But I ask honorable members on both sides to assert the principle that there is no man more deserving of consideration than he who has won his spurs and has been promoted on the field of battle. I feel sure that every member of this House will be only too pleased to insure that the returned soldier gets everything that is due to him, and it behoves us to see that he enjoys the same rights and rank as men who have merely passed prescribed examinations. It is all very well for a Minister to say that this Bill will apply only to the Citizen Forces. We know that the men best fitted to set an example to our youngsters are those who have been under fire, who have stood the test of battle, and have both practical and theoretical knowledge. We could get no better instructors and leaders for our Citizen Forces than the men who led the Australian lads at Gallipoli and in Flanders and Mesopotamia, and I should like the Minister to frame a clause that will insure that returned soldiers get full recognition and opportunity. We know that we cannot employ in the Citizen Forces every returned soldier, but it is our duty to specially safeguard the rights of those who have done heroic deeds on the field of battle. </para>

                            <para>- Very well, that removes the fear I had in regard to the provision. I can well understand why our Act is being brought more into line with the British Army Act. It would never do to have at the Front one set of men serving under the Defence Act of Canada or Australia, another under the Defence Act of New Zealand, and yet another under the defence laws of Newfoundland or South Africa. The British Army Act operates just as readily as does any defence law of the Dominions, and when our men . are serving with the Imperial Forces abroad, they must be all under the one law. My only fear was that this provision was specially intended to hold our men while they were returning to Australia from the seat of war. It is further provided in this clause that- </para>

                    <para>Coming to the provisions dealing with the position and pay of young men who have to train for our Citizen Forces, I  think the Government are acting wisely. We call upon the young men of this country, just at a time when they like to devote their Saturday afternoons to sport, to give up some of their spare time to the work of training themselves to become efficient in the defence of Australia. That being so, their employers should be called upon to shoulder some of the burden in the way proposed by the Government. This is not a Bill which calls for a lengthy second-reading debate, but I hope that when we go into Committee we shall re-fashion some of its provisions so that it will leave our hands a far better Bill than it was when sent down to us from another place. </para>

                        <para>. -The honorable member for Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Page)</inline> has urged very strongly that we should so amend this Bill in certain directions as to reduce to a minimum the . possibility of any misunderstanding. I think it would be a mistake to depart too widely from the laying down of general principles, and to proceed to emphasize details. As my honorable friend knows very well, very large discretionary powers are vested in the authorities under the British Army Act, the assumption being that the British Parliament will always keep a watchful eye on the state and condition of the Army. We may rest assured that, whatever may have happened in the past, future Houses &#39;of  Commons are not likely to forget the gallant deeds of British soldiers during this terrible war. I think that the right view for this House to adopt is that in this measure we should not go beyond the affirmation of general principles, since we may rest assured that future Parliaments of the Commonwealth will always be careful that the interests of officers and men who have served at the Front are in no wise neglected. I do not think there is any chance of a future Parliament of the Commonwealth allowing mere carpet knights to be promoted at the expense of men who have been on active service. Our legal friends will tell us that when in an Act of Parliament we depart from the affirmation of general principles and proceed to particularize, we very often defeat the very object we have&#34; in view. I think it would be well in the circumstances for the House to be largely guided by the view of the Government in this matter. Neither the Government nor any of its supporters can have any object but that of doing the best for the officers and men who have done so well for Australia. </para>

                            <para>- I am sure the honorable member would not. We should exercise care in dealing with the question of promotions. All civilized countries, with the exception of Germany, recognise the principle that where men are , promoted for deeds of gallantry on the field, they should not be required to undergo any examination. When we were building up our Citizen Forces, however, it was very necessary to provide that a strict examination should be passed by those seeking commissioned rank. In time of peace, care must be taken that an Army does not degenerate because of its control by half-educated officers. That is why we have insisted upon candidates for commissions in our Citizen Forces passing certain prescribed examinations. We established Duntroon Military College to provide for the proper education of our officers, but scientific training is not the Only desideratum. A man who on active service shows that he has tact, judgment, and initiative is quite as serviceable to his commanding officer as is any man who has passed the highest technical examinations). Some of the greatest generals of bygone days were masters of strategy - they had completely mastered military science, but they never won a battle. On the other hand, history tells us of others who were deficient in these respects, but were among some of the most remarkable in the armies of Great Britain and France. The promotion of men for deeds of gallantry while on active service is a recognised practice in the British Army, and we must see that the principle is respected and upheld here. That, I think, is one of the objects of this Bill. As to the clauses which provide that our troops while returning on transports to Australia shall continue under the operation of the Army Act, I am inclined, <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> agree with a good deal of what the honorable member for Maranoa has said. But there can be no harm in calling upon our men on their way to the Front to submit to the discipline for which that Act provides, and to which they will be subjected as soon as they land. In conclusion, I would urge honorable members to recognise that those who succeed us in this Parliament will, in view of the happenings of this terrible war, be just as zealous in guarding the interests of the men who have put up so splendid a record for Australia as are the members of the present Parliament. </para>

                        <para>. - I have to complain of the . failure of the Government to circulate the explanatory memorandum now before us when the Bill itself was first presented to us. As it is, I do not think that 10 per cent, of the members of this House understand the measure. Dealing as it does with the prospects of men who have fought for us, and whose praises we . are always sounding, and rightly so, I do not think that we should be called upon to vote for it in the dark. With the memorandum we should have  been able to discuss the Bill on its merits, but, under the circumstances, I confess that- 1 cannot follow the provisions. I should like to bring under the notice of the Minister the case of a lad who passed very highly in an examination at Duntroon, and went across the seas as a first lieutenant. He fought at Gallipoli and in Flanders, and won his captaincy on the field of battle; but, becoming disabled in one arm, he desired to remain abroad and &#34;do his bit&#34; even as an instructor. Against his will, he was sent back to Australia, where he has been given very important work to do ; but only to find that a second lieutenant, with whom he had worked here, had been promoted to major, and was drawing major&#39;s pay, while he, on arriving, had his pay reduced to that of lieutenant. Is this Bill intended to remedy, or to tolerate, that sort of thing? Such instances are certainly not calculated to encourage young men to thoroughly qualify in the Army. </para>

                            <para>- At any rate, it means that, no matter what may be provided in this amending Bill, no man can be given a staff appointment unless he has been through Duntroon College. Precisely similar conditions prevail in the British Army. The officers are divided into two classes, and no man, unless, he has passed through Sandhurst or Woolwich, is given a position on the permanent staff, but is placed in the special reserve. The result is that a great proportion of the junior officers fighting in the British Army at the Front are in the special reserve ; and men out of Sandhurst or Woolwich practically go over the heads of those who have done the fighting from the start. In my opinion, the men who return from the Front should hold the rank they have won there. </para>

A man who has been -promoted on the field of battle, and in a school of instruction behind the lines, has received all the training necessary to make him a leader of men, and has a perfect right to retain the rank he has won overseas. If a man under the age of twenty-five returns, it may be with the rank of captain or major, he has to go into the Citizen Forces as a private. He may be good enough to fight for the Empire and for Australia; but when he returns, unless he has been through the, Duntroon College, he has to go into the Citizen Forces as a private. </para>

                    <para>As to the cadets, I think that they ought to be trained in time given by their employers on other days than holidays. There is no doubt that for this, hot an hour, but half a day is necessary, and it is not too much time to devote to the work. In the country districts, where cadets have to travel long distances, their training may occupy more than half a day, and in spite of what honorable members opposite may say, it will be found that honorable members on this side are quite in favour of the training being done in the employers&#39; time. </para>

                        <para>.- I should like some enlightenment from the Minister as to the operation of the clause dealing with promotions on the field. I have in my mind a case where a non-commissioned officer, after winning the rank of captain at Gallipoli, was  invalided  to Australia, where he reenlisted.  His  desire was to have the same rank that he had won under actual war conditions. He was informed by the Defence Department that, in order to obtain commissioned rank on going abroad a second time, he must pass through an officers&#39; school at Duntroon. As a consequence that man went away as a private, under the orders of an officer who was a mere theorist. </para>

                            <para>- When a man comes back with honorable scars and an excellent record he should receive preference for any soft home-service billet. It is disheartening to returned men to find that other men can occupy good positions for fifteen and eighteen months, and even for two years, without going abroad. Some of those who have not gone abroad have stated that they will be satisfied to remain where they are until the war is over. Such men should not be retained in the service. </para>

                    <para>The arrangements under which promotions are made abroad have their defects. At the present time great dissatisfaction exists with the method of appointing commissioned officers in Egypt. Noncommissioned men who have served with the utmost ability have been passed over and privates without experience as noncommissioned officers have received commissions. I have this on reliable authority - the statements of men who have returned Some inquiry should he made into the matter. </para>
                    <para>I wish to draw attention to the manner in which officers in London are neglecting their duties. For the past two years the delay in forwarding &#34; non-effective statements &#34; has been a burning complaint. On my return from Great Britain last year, I brought the matter before the Minister, and certain cablegrams were sent to London, with the result that 3,000 non-effective statements arrived by one mail. Evidently they had been accumulating in the London office. In many cases the non-receipt of these statements had delayed the settlement of the estates of deceased soldiers, whose families were in actual need. I have a case in which a widow whose son was killed more than twelve months ago cannot obtain a settlement of the estate because the non-effective statement relating to him has not yet arrived, and. I am sure that hundreds of such cases have been brought before various members. The almost criminal carelessness and indifference of those in our London office to the claims of the dependants of men who have sacrificed their lives on the field of battle should not be permitted to go unchecked. I advocate the sending Home of a special officer to inquire into the delay regarding non-effective statements. Unfortunately, the number of these statements will increase rather than decrease. We ask eligible men to enlist, but when the extreme hardship endured by the families of many men who have been killed becomes known, the forces operating against the success of recruiting can well be understood. I hope that the Defence Department will see whether the London office cannot be galvanized into life, and those employed there made to realize their duty to the men who are actually fighting and to their dependants. </para>

                        <para>.- I am sorry that it is not proposed to amend the Defence Act to deal with appeals. A case has come under my notice - I have all the papers, and shall place them before the Minister later - in which a private attached to a veterinary corps in Egypt got into trouble with the authorities for some neglect of duty, and was ultimately marked down as a venereal patient and sent to an isolation ward. Subsequently a doctor regarded him as mentally deficient, and he was told that he had been wrongly sent to the isolation ward. But the medical officers connected with the case did not agree either as to his being a venereal patient) or as to his suffering from mental disability. He was asked if he would return to his unit, and he refused &#39;to do so unless his case was investigated. He was placed on the <inline font-style="italic">Suffolk</inline> and sent home, and he states that he was wrongfully put into the isolation ward on board ship. There should be some process whereby such a man would have an opportunity to clear his character. This man and his wife are so ashamed of the charges made against him that they cannot go back to the town where he was attested. Provision should be made for an appeal in such cases. I think that a Board of Inquiry should be constituted. </para>

                        <para>. - I am glad that the Ministry has seen its way to move in the direction of making the training of cadets a little more attractive to the lads. I am informed by officers who have taken a great deal of interest in the cadets, that the greatest cause of insubordination among them is the objection that all healthy young persons have to being deprived of opportunities for taking part in sports. This has been accentuated recently by the fact that our cadets have been called upon to attend more drills than has been the case in the past, because some time ago the Department suspended all training. I would like to have heard the Minister speak a little more definitely as to the extent to which it was intended to press this reform. He seemed to indicate that there was not to be full recognition of the right of the boys to the Saturday half-holiday, and that an indefinite number of hours would be arranged which might still call upon them to drill on some Saturday afternoons. </para>

It is time that the Minister for Defence made some better provision in regard to getting that information. The way in which it is delayed is shameful. It brings great hardship on widows and the dependants of soldiers who have passed away on the other side of the world. This most important question has been before honorable members for the last two years, and has been debated in this House on several occasions, yet no attempt appears to have been made to bring about a remedy.. I do not know why the information cannot be forwarded to Australia within four months of the death of a soldier. Apparently, there is some unnecessary delay on the part of those who are administering affairs in connexion with our troops overseas. </para>

Every second Saturday in the coal-mining industry is a holiday, and on those days the lads employed in the mines go fishing or indulge in sport, and if they are asked to drill in the morning the employers will not be called upon to pay. The only method of overcoming the difficulty is to have the drills on days other than Saturdays. </para>

                            <para>- I quite agree that it will be necessary to have some discretion. In regard to the matter mentioned by the honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Austin Chapman),</inline> I recognise that there are many difficulties in reference to the position of men who have been promoted on the field. Though a man may have been promoted on the field of battle, it may be held that his promotion was not due to distinguished service or some act of gallantry. I hope that the case mentioned by the honorable member will be borne in mind. He was speaking of. an officer of the Australian Imperial.Force who was promoted to the rank of captain, but was reduced to the rank of lieutenant on hisreturn. </para>

                        <para>.- I would not have risen at this late hour but for the fact that, having had a long association with the men at the Front, I am in a position to know that the question now under discussion is a very burning one with them. At the outbreak of war there was a great deal of discontent among our troops because incompetent men were placed in certain positions, and gave orders which proved very irksome, while others who were competent did not secure the opportunity of proving- their worth. . I think that every one agrees that it is absolutely necessary that our officers should have practical knowledge; but, in my opinion, to become efficient leaders they should also possess a theoretical knowledge. More characteristics than one go to make up a successful officer. A man must have; not only dash and daring; but also brains. Those who possess both qualities are successful officers, and&#39; on their return to Australia they should be given such positions in our Forces as are open to them. </para>

                    <para>Two honorable members referred to what they considered the harsh treatment meted out. to some of our men. I. have been in charge of prisoners at courts martial, and I can say from experience that every consideration has been given by Australian officers to the men who were standing their trial. Honorable members must bear in mind that the position of a man on. active service is very different from that of a man. in civil life. In an army in wan time there must be strict discipline, and I. do not know of any instance in which our officers have been unduly severe. Only to-day I met in Melbourne a returned soldier on crutches. He was a member of my unit, and when last I saw him he was paraded before his unit and discharged from the Forces with ignominy. He was returned to Australia, and here he re-enlisted. He went to France with the 59th Battalion, and made good. He is to-day suffering from a machine-gun wound in the leg. That man was at one time the terror of his officers and to-day he jokingly referred to &#34; the hell of a time &#34;&#39; he had caused them. I am satisfied that the sentence passed upon that man was just, although, excepting the death penalty, it was the most severe punishment that could be imposed. </para>

                            <para>- I believe the presiding officer was a Liberal and a solicitor. This Bill is a very timely measure, because it will serve to obviate many injustices that are caused to-day. I know of instances of men who have carried out, on private&#39;s pay. the duties of non-commissioned officers, and then have been compelled to revert to the ranks without receiving any recognition of the services: they performed. One soldier who possessed special qualifications was withdrawn from the firing line, and&#39; placed in charge of a hospital over the heads of confirmed corporals who were drawing 10s. per day. He worked seventeen hours per day week after week, and was often called up in the middle of the night. He took the full responsibility of the management of the hospital, and yet was drawing only a driver&#39;s pay. Ultimately he was returned to the ranks, and another man who did not possess the same  qualifications, and proved to bo incompetent, was promoted to do the same work with higher rank and pay, and his duties were performed by a private. I trust that there will be no further cases of that kind, because such pin-pricks are very exasperating to the men, and do not conduce to getting the best possible service out of them. </para>

I fail to see why we should not insert in the Bill itself the definition of &#34; active service &#34; given in the Imperial Act. Unless we do so it will be necessary, whenever we are asked for a definition of the words, to refer to the Imperial Act, which is as big as a bound volume of the <inline font-style="italic">Government Gazette.</inline> This objection on the part of the Minister to insert the actual definition of &#34; active service&#34; in the Bill itself is sheer obstinacy on his part. Let us make our laws intelligible, so that ordinary people may understand them. I ask that progress be reported. </para>

It has been declared by the Premier of New South Wales, and also by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hagelthorn,</inline> a member of the Victorian Government, and by the Victorian representatives of Messrs. J. and A. Brown, that the statement I made in regard to those mines has no foundation in fact. The statement I made was, as reported in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> that- </para>

                        <para>The Richmond Main and thePelaw Main, which are to be worked on behalf of the Victorian Government; are very dangerous mines, because they give off gas in large quantities. Yet the Victorian Government is advertising for gold miners, labourers, and workmen of any sort to man these mines. With inexperienced labour of that character, an explosion might occur at any moment. </para>

                    <para class="block">I was referring to the danger of working these mines by inexperienced men, because of the gas that is given off in them. I was not speaking of their equipment, but the fact that the mines in question are two of the best equipped in New South Wales lends colour to my statement that they have  to  be so equipped in order to prevent the ignition  of  gas. There is nothing better than their ventilation plants, and especially the ventilation plant of the Richmond Main. The owners were compelled to put in the very best appliances in order to keep them free from gas. That in itself bears out my statement as to the danger of working them with inexperienced men. In the New South. Wales Parliamentary papers for 1908, to be found in the Commonwealth Library, there appears the annual report by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Atkinson</inline> for 1908. in which it was stated that fire damp had been reported under rule 4 in the Maitland portion, northern inspection district at the East Greta, Heddon  Greta, Stanford Merthyr, Pelaw Main, Richmond Main, Hebburn,  and  South Greta mines. In the annual report of the New South Wales Department of Mines for 1916  -  the latest available - we have the statement, at page 134, &#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Humble</inline> reports fire damp has been seen and reported under the general and special rules during  the  year.&#34; Pelaw Main and Richmond Main are mentioned, in addition to some other mines. It is stated, further, that one individual was prosecuted for having matches in the Pelaw Main mine, and that the following collieries, amongst others, are using locked safety lamps throughout : - Stanford Merthyr, Pelaw Main, Richmond Main, Seaham, and Seaham No. 2. These are mines in which the Government are endeavouring to employ inexperienced labour, and, notwithstanding what may be said outside as to their safety, I repeat that they are not safe if inexperienced men be employed in them. </para>

                            <para>- Under certain conditions they shoot in every mine in the Newcastle and, Maitland districts. The only exception that I can recall to mind was in the case of the Pelaw Main. Some time ago they were driving two main headings, and the gas coming off was so great, according to the under- manager at that time, that they could not fire a shot; they had to scallop it out for fear of an explosion. Not more than two months ago, if I remember rightly, a fire occurred in Pelaw Main, and the men had to be withdrawn because of the fear of an explosion. Notwithstanding all these facts, I am told that my statements were incorrect. Prom the point of view that the mines in question produce gas, my statement is absolutely correct, and the greatest care must be taken to safeguard the lives of those who go into them. </para>

                        <para>. - I put a question to-day to the Honorary Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> in regard to the administration of the Victorian Patriotic Fund, and was asked to give notice of it. I regret to have to say that, whilst those in charge of the Patriotic Fund in Victoria may be well-intentioned people, they move very slowly, and are doing but little. What makes their slow-going methods harder to bear is the fact that in New South Wales those in charge of the Patriotic Fund are doing excellent work and carrying out the functions for which&#39; the fund was called into existence. I know that the Government have no supervision over these funds, and that it would be difficult to single out the controllers of the Victorian fund for special treatment. The administration of the South&#39; Australian fund is even worse, so that the situation is a very delicate one. If the Victorian and South Australian funds were singled&#39; out for special action on the part of the Government there would be a rumpus, and if, on the other hand, the Government stepped in with regard to the whole of these funds in the several States, it would stop the good work that is being done in New South, Wales, and, to a lesser degree, in Queensland. </para>

                            <para>- Necessitous cases are brought under the notice of those controlling the fund, but they do not deal with them. If it were not for the Victorian State War Council there would be nothing done to meet these cases. The Victorian State War Council, through its officials, is doing splendid work, but it has very little money with which to give relief. At the conference it was promised that &#163;1,000 would be handed over to the State War Council to enable it to deal with necessitous cases. According to to-night&#39;s issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Herald,</inline> that amount has been reduced to &#163;500. No attempt has yet been made to pay out the extra amount that was to be payable as from the 11th instant. I know that the Government have no immediate supervision over these funds&#39;, but they could secure it, and they should do something in the matter. If I were to make statements of this character outside, the War Precautions Act would be applied to me. and I have no desire to adorn a cell, as I would have to do, since I would not have the money to pay the heavy fine which would probably be inflicted. I do not infer that those responsible for the administration of the fund have no sympathy for the wives and families of the men at the Front, but the fact remains that one can get them to do but very little. They have a considerable amount of money, and they should use it in the direction in which it was intended it should be used. </para>

                    <para>I know from what I have learned from those interested in other bodies that the people responsible for the Patriotic Fund are not carrying out the promises they gave. If something is not done to remedy the existing state of affairs, I shall take the risk of saying outside what may bring upon me the charge of interfering with recruiting. It is up to those in charge of the Victorian Patriotic Fund to do some of the work for which the fund was brought into existence. At present I can only say that this fund is being administered unfeelingly. </para>

                            <para>- Tell me one thing they have done. They do not attempt to spend the money for purposes for which it was gathered. I do not know what the expenses of administering the fund are, but I am told that the daughter of one public man is getting &#163;6 a week for supervision of some sort. I have no proof, but if that be true, both she and her father ought to be ashamed. I do know, however, that there are enormous expenses, and that the fund is not being expended on the objects for which it was gathered. At a conference a promise was made that the money would be properly disbursed, and I draw attention to the matter now in the hope that Victoria may be placed on a par with New South Wales so far as the administration of the Patriotic Fund is concerned. </para>
